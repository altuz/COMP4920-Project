,Not Recommended,318220,20294956,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Cyotey,"DevelopersBefore I go into my review I need to tell you all some things. To put this in the nicest way possible, the developers are an unprofessional, and hypocritical team of failures. If you go into the forums or look at their facebook page you will notice that any negativity against them will result in a ""professional"" and instant lash towards you. In the community forums you will notice that they have whined about negativity towards their ""finished game"". You will also notice that they say they will listen and answer everyone who has a question. I have asked a couple of questions and got no answers from the developers. Only answers from other community members telling me that they do not answer anyone. This game has been abandoned for quite some time and left with bugs and barely any gameplay to justify the price. As far as we're all concerned, they're back to just fix the bugs, add a ""sandbox"" mode and then throw their hands up and be done with it.  I have been banned from the forums yesterday after talking about a promising sounding new police simulator called 'Police 10-13'. Apparently they can't answer questions, but do visit the forums frequently to find an excuse to ban people that don't hold their game in high regards. To be fair, part of what I talked about was how the developers making 10-13 are making themselves look and I quote ""like idiots"" because there are multiple things they are doing that professionals wouldn't do. And the ban is fair according to the rules. In short, I'm iffy about it like I should be after this farce. Only time will tell and I am still excited to see the news and its development.With this said about the developers, please be very cautious about their new project 'CTU' (Counter Terrorism Unit). These developers are childish and are untrustworthy.StoryThe only story there is is a quick intro scene saying that your father was great at being a police officer. After that you're thrown in with a pop up text tutorial and you figure out the rest.GameplayWhile it's clearly clunky and buggy, it is fun for a while. I put in 8 hours before getting very bored. I went back into the game to see if anything was changed or added despite what people said just to make sure, and nothing has been done. All there is is just a few cars you unlock by entering 'codes'. Your duties will differ. You will give chase on foot, get into gunfights, set up speedometers, arrest drunks and those that have harmed others and sometimes break and enter homes that have been reported to have someone armed and dangerous. It's realistic to a very small degree and has potential. Before the game was released, it had a different name and had a lot more going in (more buildings, looked much more polished, basically everything that makes a game look good to hype it up in the beginning). If all that was there it would be really good.SoundVoice acting is terrible, music is very dull and on repeat, guns don't sound right etc. The sound isn't terrible, but it isn't good. And all of the talking past the introduction is silent and through text.GraphicsThe graphics are basically a more polished GTA: San Andreas. Lighting is better and textures are smoother but not by much. It looks like one of the later PS2 games.OverallIt's good in short bursts if you don't care for too much content but the bugs will irritate you enough to not want to play. With Police 10-13 planning on coming sometime in 2016 I would hold off. And there are other simulators much better than this one. The GTA IV police mod is the best one and there's an older and sillier simulation that feels complete as well called Police Force if you don't want to wait. But this ""simulator"" is worth $5 at best and even real police officers are voicing how bad this is. Get a better simulator or hold off for Police 10-13.Small Immediate EditI've had this review written out for quite some time and could not post it up until now and have no idea why and so I saved it and waited. Now that I've finally been able to post it, please spread the word about not getting this game at any price. I have never fallen victim to bad developers as I'm usually good about asking for opinions and looking at whether the business is professional as well up until now. And again, it isn't because I was banned from the forums. I have nothing personal against that. Just their empty promises, lack of news and refusal to keep an open mind and accept the fact that not everyone will be happy and they screwed up badly is why I am bashing them directly. I hope my review helps and happy gaming!"
,Not Recommended,318220,32145351,Posted: 2 June,all,Flowerhorse,"TL;DR: Remember Spacebase DF-9? Pretty much the same thing here. The game is badly optimized, blatantly unfinished, and the developers have abandoned it completely. It is not worth its full price, and I cannot recommend it.---Alright, I've tried to stave off writing this review for roughly a year and a half, in hopes the developers would fix the game's bugs (which, in my opinion, should have been done before full release) and work towards giving us more content. Unfortunately, it seems they have abandoned the game, hence the missing blog page,steamdb pageanddead facebook page.I will attempt to write a 'fair' review, however.Pros-Despite the warnings, you can stay on duty forever. I've found that stress and sleep affect nothing, just make sure your hunger bar doesn't drop too low or your officer will stand still and pant for a few seconds.-You are able to choose between seven different police vehicles, and you can customize them (albeit the customization is lacking).-You have four vehicles available to purchase for driving while off-duty to avoid the great sin of driving your police vehicle while off-duty despite being the only officer in the city.-To drive off the monotony of pulling over impaired and speeding drivers and ticketing cars for parking violations, you can receive calls from dispatch and either accept or refuse them. They give you a reason to use the siren, at least.-Technically, the game delivered on everything it stated in its 'features', barring the amount of missions.Cons-None ofyourvehicles are roadworthy. It takes a second or two for the wheels to straighten after fully turning, and for some reason your vehicle engages the warp drive when accelerating above 30 miles per hour. Additionally, the officer physically cannot depress the brake pedal fully, and holding it down for too long, despite still moving forward, will shift the car into reverse and hit the gas.-The vehicle physics are horrible. Upon colliding with an object, be it a building or a car, no speed will be lost. This can lead to multiple additional collisions as your officer attempts to slow down with the defective brake pedal. The vehicles can climb close to 90 degree slopes, though, so great job to the manufacturers there.-Nobody knows how to drive. None of the drivers in town can maintain their lanes while making a turn. Additionally, there is a loop near the city where a traffic jam will form every day either because a semi cannot make the left turn into the city without hitting a traffic light, or two drivers collide and, due to the collective inability to reverse, are forever stuck. Any driver you pull over will make two consecutive near 90 degree turns while slamming on the brakes, most of the time leading you to either ramming them or passing them. Fleeing drivers will also slam on the brakes after you collide three times, causing the same problem.-The pathfinding (or lack thereof) is terrible. The pedestrians in the game are on rails, which often lead them directly into parked cars or a building. Fleeing suspects will proceed directly away from the player on the nearest rail, or to the nearest rail if not already on a rail. This can lead them to shooting directly up a mountain, as, like in vehicles, forward speed is never decreased. Movement can only be blocked by vehicles and buildings.-Fleeing suspects are a nuisance. Fleeing vehicles usually lead to high damage to your police vehicle. Fleeing suspects run at the same speed or faster than your officer, making chasing them on foot rarely worth it. In addition...-Your officer forgets how to run. When pulling out any of their equipment, your officer will revert back to walking speed. In addition, your officer will only make a brisk jog at max when aiming their weapon, leading to great difficulty when attempting to tase a fleeing suspect.-Sometimes, after going off duty and returning to duty, the dispatcher decides to quit, and you will no longer receive any calls.-Weather and tire smoke tanks your FPS.-Many police vehicles have clipping issues with both your officer and any arrested suspect.-Some zones don't have gas stations.There are probably many more cons I could list here, but it's 2:05 in the morning and I'm too tired to think of anything else the developers left broken or unfinished.If you do insist on buying this game, however, let me make a few recommendations:-Play on realistic mode. You can be given up to three calls at a time, so it gives you stuff to do. The permadeath really doesn't matter.-Don't worry about your reputation. The game only ends if you manage to get -1000. So feel free to uphold the law differently.-The SMG keeps you alive a lot better than the pistol.-Suburbs usually gives you drug-related or burglary calls. Lake usually gives you assault or kidnapping calls. The rest are fairly balanced.So yeah. That's my review. I'm going to go pass out in a pile of blankets now."

This game really looked like it had all of the right aspects to simulate police work, as well as a life simulation in general. I'm not going to hate - the developers just need several months to improve this. I got bored after two hours or so. Very repetitive."

I like the premise of it mixing boring things with action. However I can't really get into much more.Why you ask?Because as a gamer, I realize this game is HORRIBLE. Bugs, poor controls, poor AI, poor everything. This was a HUGE waste of money.I don't mind giving money based on the idea the dev has. But the current price point is embarrassing. This is a five dollar ""game"". If that..."
76561198122248263,Not Recommended,318220,16489066,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,I AM THE LIQUOR,"I regret having to give this game a thumbs down, because I really do think it could have been something. In it's current state, it isn't worth the $20 price tag. The game lacks content and gets boring real fast. At this moment, there is only ONE developer working on this game. In the discussion threads, the developer explains that to him, this game is complete, and basically everything from now on is just icing on the cake...WOW... This game is basically an alpha...if that. I understand the whole small team, low budget thing, but to say this game is, in any way complete, is just plain crazy.PROS:+Can be entertaining in small bursts.+Sandbox+The game does have potential (maybe not anymore, but it did).+It has an aspect of realism to it.+The updates are free (as they should be), and the developer stated he didn't want DLCs.+Developers respond to you if you ask a question or comment on something.+Pretty cool customization of your police unit. You can also purchase things like a new flatscreen or a couch for your house with your hard earned cash, which is sweet.CONS:-Bugs/Glitches (apparently not enough to be game breaking as the game is completed--spoken by developer)-Stiff movement system for driving and on-foot. Frustrating controls.-Poor animations.-GTA 3 graphics.-Not enough content to warrant a $20 price tag. It needs more missions/guns/cars/skins/buildings/everything.I really wish this game had more fans and a workshop, because that would change things. More content, better graphics/animations, more skins/customization, would add to the longevity of the game. At the state that this game is in, I cannot recommend this title.Verdict: 5/10"
76561198059593096,Recommended,318220,12672517,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,Jaek,"This is clearly a game with a relitively low budget, but still is a very fun police simulator and, in my opinion, worth the money. In this review I will assess the positives and negatives, explain some of the features and finally give my verdict on the game.Positives:- Variety of different missions (passive and direct).- 7 regions to explore.- On and Off Duty modes.- Level up / Ranking system in the police force.- Can interact with every NPC civilian.- Police cars have warning sirens, full sirens, and lightbars that can be customised.- Variety of clothing and vehicle paintjobs.- Realistic feel of policing.- Can storm buildings, make civilians surrender, stop fleeing vehicles by hitting them with yours.- Has an easy and hard mode.Negatives:- At the time of its release, it is quite buggy.- When an ambulance / police transport / tow truck is called, they are not actually seen.- Car physics are not very realistic.- You get reduced career points for actions such as breaking down doors even if there is a criminal inside.- You are the only patrol officer in the game.- Fleeing NPCs act as if they were not being chased if they get clear of you a few metres, then run again when you get close.- Limited things to do Off Duty.- Does not have a very comrehensive help / controls screen.PLEASE NOTE MANY OF THE ABOVE WILL MOST LIKELY BE IMPROVED / FIXED AS THE GAME DEVELOPS!Suggestions:- Could have custom loadouts (e.g. different weapons).- Could call backup such as a SWAT team.- When the player reaches a high rank, they could command other officers.- Needs more vehicles and Off Duty activities (could maybe respond to specific emergencies).Analysis:I am someone who is a big fan of police simulators. Arma 3 Altis Life was great for this, and Enforcer: Police Crime Action is quite similar, only it is single player. You can drive around the town centre looking out for speeders (cars drive around 20mph and around 30mph is considered speeding) and you can pull them over, use the breathalyser or frisk them if you feel it is necessary. On the start of every shift there is a passive mission to complete by the end of the shift, for example setting up a roadblock with cones and checking 6 drivers for faults on their cars. There are also dispatch calls with generous time limits such as finding a person wanted for assaulting passers by. For this you would go and talk to the victims to get a description, then wait until there is intel about where the person was last seen. You would then go to the scene, find the person matching the description, and park up. Normally when you call out for them to stop, they will run off. You can pull out your tazer, and when you get close you fire. After that you can arrest the suspect, take them to the station or call for a transport. You get career points which help you rank up after completing every mission.Off duty mode is really unique, and has a lot of potential. When you have enough money you can buy a car, and you can also customise your home with new furniture. It is also possible to level up your stress level buy going out with friends or your mother, and other people. Instead of actually interacting with your friends or mother, the game teleports you to their house and puts the time forward a few hours, and says that you have spent time with your friends / mother, without you actually seeing anything. Physically doing activities may well be something the developers add in the future. When off duty it is also possible to fill up on food and replenish your energy by sleeping. You have to be careful though as spending too much time off duty will reduce career points.Conclusion:This game as mentioned earlier has obviously been developed on a low budget, but they have made that budget stretch as far as possible. The gameplay is enjoyable even though the graphics and physics are not fantastic. Now it has been released, it is likely that if lots of people buy it and the developers have access to more money, the game will be better optimized, feel more smooth and have some great new features added. That will of course come over time so if anything, the money you put in to buy this game will be an investment, so they can improve it. That said, even before the game is developed further it is still great fun and I can see a lot of hours of gameplay from it.Overall Verdict:I would recommend this game to any fan of police simulators, or anyone who fancies a go at being a police officer. It may at first seem very rough and strange, but believe me, you will probably get used to it just fine.I rate Enforcer: Police Crime Action 7/10 at its current state but it has the potential of being a 8/10 or even 9/10 game.UPDATE: It is now August 2016 with very little development since the review, sadly I would not recommend the game any more."
76561197985169161,Not Recommended,318220,15246990,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,rilzi,"Great idea, poor execution. An open world sandbox police 'sim' is something i've wanted to play since the likes of Police Quest. And this game pretty much has that idea down. Unfortunately, it's let down by its execution. The graphics and animation are poor, worse than GTA 3. The AI is all but non existant. All NPC criminals either run from you, give up, or stand in one spot and slowly shoot at you. Pathfinding is poor - pedestrians will mindlessly walk into anything blocking their path forever. The physics are poor. Cars don't crash so much as 'stop'. Hitting a tree, building, or even a pedestrian will cause your car to stop on a dime. Other vehicles also have a tendency to fly into the air randomly.If this was early access, I'd say wait and see, but as a fully released title? Sorry, can't reccomend it especially for the price they're asking."
,Recommended,318220,13367761,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,JohnDoe,"This game at it's current form demands a lot of patience from the person that plays it. Most of the AI is very underdeveloped: pedestrians walking everywhere, stoping for nothing and nobody. The driving in the game is a nightmare. Speed is a relative term at the moment, getting from 20mph to 134mph under a second... and good luck stoping... without immidiate reversing. Missions are quite repetative but so is the life of a police officer... as I would imagine.The time passes real quick. An hour in the game equals to a minute in our life not leaving much space to complete missons without doing 16 hours shifts. The concept of getting hungry, tired and irritated is a great idea, but at the moment they don't have much effect on our character. Ranking up is also a great idea... yet again, doesn't really change much. You are still putting those speeding cameras out, regardless your rank. But enough of the negatives.It's a police simulator! Yes. You are wearing a uniform, you have your police cruiser, which is by the way very nicely detailed, as far as sound and lights go. The weapon mechanics is acceptable and it is fun giving out those tickets for broken lights or  speeding thorugh town to attend a burglary.The developers have a great vision. There is no doubt about it. This game might have been released just a bit too early, but their presence in forums and announcments on up-coming updates is reassuring that buying this game at this price is an investment. Now it is up to us if we are willing to invest and see the development through. I am, because it's exciting to be part of developing a great police simulator."
,Not Recommended,318220,12640613,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,Terminal Rex,"My biggest problem with this game is that it feels like a very early access inide game and no where near like the complete product.Firstly the driving mechanics are aweful the controls feel clunky, it feels like driving a tank and you even have to turn off the engine before you are allowed to get out of the car. I don't think they will fix this either because it is one of the core mechanics of the game.Unfortunatly when you do anything it is done through a menu system, for example you call to get a prisoner transport and instead of seeing a car come out and pick up the prisiner you get a screeen shot saying it has been done, this is the same for ambulances, tow trucks ect.The graphics leave a lot to be desired, most of the game looks pretty poor the models look like they came out of a ps1 game, this would not be an issue if the game mechanics were better. Also every citezen looks the same i think there are no more than say 10 character models.The map is split into tiny sections you have to drive through checkpoints to get to different parts of the map, there are so many loading screens in this game for pretty much everything you do.All the above points are things that are core parts of ther game and will probably never be changed/fixed at the time of writing there are many other issues too such as bugs (cars floating in the sky), I feel like the duty time is too short it makes you rush to complete the day, buying yoyur own car is far too expensive compared to how much money you make, you have to get a taxi home because home is too far from the station. Hopefully the modding community will come to the rescue of this game but at the moment i wouldn't recommend this game, ive played played games that cost £4 - £5 that have been more polished  and genrally better games."

Many threads locked down and being directed to their list of excuses as to why they can't finish/ can only have 1 person part time working on it (Looks like they believe their next game is more important than actually finishing this one).

Unable to execute handbrake turn(car slides sideways and backwards at about 40 degrees).ii. 70 mph max on road and offroad, road and terrian has no effect.iii. Suspects running up a cliffside half inside the sheer face.iv. Any vehicle impact(such as stopping drunk driver), by rear ramming, results in your car being bounced high onto the air, as the car stops dead on the road(the physics suck).v. Chasing a vehicle off map ,new map has car sitting on side of road, engine off and suspect vehicle disappered.vi. A suspect pulls a gun on you, but if you shoot them before they open fire, you get a hefty penalty, for opening fire on an innocent. Then when you call for the medical services, you get a bonous for completing the mission and removing another criminal from the streets.0 Comments	 Subscribe to thread  (?)"

It offers you plenty of options what can a good officer do, like patrolling the streets, stopping cars, checking drivers, chasing burglars and vandals.You always play in the sandbox mode and you have to watch your needs (hunger, energy, health). You have to complete some of the missions during duty hours (some of them are optional and randomly generated) but it gets very repetitive very soon.Technical side of the game is a problem. City looks empty and sterile.

It absolutely is NOT worth the $19.99 at this point in its production and will need many large updates to make it anywhere close to worth its asking price. I will list some pros and cons:Pros:-It's a police simulator and those are hard to come by, if nothing else it's an attempt to deliver a very demanded but rare game format-It's ambitious: There are many features such as buying police cars, living life off work, etc. which are nice on first play-Practial button layoutCons:-Really, really clunky - the car driving and handling may be some of the worst I've ever tried. Sure having features such as having to turn on the engine and the realistic idle movement of drive and reverse are fun in theory, but the steering controls manage to be un and/or late responsive while the gas and reverse are over-responsive. It's horrible. Running and crouching aren't much better.-This game doesn't look pretty. I get that it's not a large studio producing it but if you're going to charge me $20 at least have more than five car and character models in the game-Everyone in this game has a gun. I have done 10 missions and 9/10 ended with the suspect pulling a gun-Shooting controls are very poor - the gun often will not fire the first few shots unless you zoom in, which can lead to getting you killed-Boring mission types - There are a variety of missions and the idea of questioning suspects and searching nearby buildings is a great one, but the tips are only clothing descriptions and all the searches end in you having to gun down a pistol wielding suspect-Simple features such as tow trucks, ambulance calls, and police pick up lack an animation and instead take you to a brief load screen before returning you to where you were witht he action performed - things like this REALLY make it feel like an early access-Whoever developed it is not an English speaker and google translate is not flawless. Many spelling or wording mistakes really prevent it from having a professional, clean fealIn conclusion, don't buy this game. I was incredibly disappointed with this game. I was quite excited that a new police simulator was finally being produced as there are barely any available. Don't get me wrong, I know it is a small project and wouldn't be upset if this were an early release, but I paid a decent price for it for far from a decent product. On the very bare outside it looks similar to LCPDFR, but don't be fooled. This game is far from being worth its asking price and will need some serious updating in the control, mission, and visual department before it comes close its asking price."

No fix for the multitude of bugs in this game.  This game has so much potential but apparently the develper has said FU to the people who have been following this game, and purchased it in 2014.  THe game is a good concept but after about an hour of game play and going on the limited number of calls you get real bord real easy.  No back up units not much interaction.  You can call for a police van to transport a prisoner but there is no cut sean and the person just disapears.  Same with tow trucks the car just disapears.  Even though the game is now 4.99 I would wait until it .99cents because anything more than that is rediculus.  You get more gameplay from a 50 cent arcade.  Will deff not be purchasing anything from this developer in the future because obveusly they like to take your money and not follow through on the devel of the game.  So don't wast your time.  yea it is great for about 5 min but buggy as heck and really not worth anything more than 50 cents."

It has some really nice implementations like choosing your patrol vehicle and customizing it. Also the missions are fun. BUT sadly this game is so full of bugs and annoyances that I can't recommend it right now. If even slowly driving your patrol vehicle onto the concrete of the downtown gas station damages your car badly (up to 10%), that's just not how it should be. Also the handling while driving is annoying. The slightest push of a button can completely turn your car around. Not to mention all the bugs like flying cars that are not reachable which makes it impossible to finish certain missions, too fast decreasing of gas and car condition, clipping errors (eg. handling your submachine gun), invisible road bumps that crash your car and so on. As said, the idea behind the game is pretty cool, once the developers flat out MANY bugs and annoyances, it might be actually pretty fun. Until then, I don't recommend it."

And yet it is still a much better title (and game) Then any of the ""Simulation"" Games released for the purpose of a quick cash grab.It's simple. You play as a police officer, male or female, and are tasked with the daily routines of being said police officer. You go do a shift by beginning with a mundane mission and will either get interrupted with a more exciting mission or just simply go through the mission and gain points. Points mean you are promoted and get money, thus allowing you to spend it on your house. The closest comparision I have is True Crime: New York City in terms of random missions and being tasked with being a police officer.The game doesn't look impressive, but it get's the job done. It has good character and vehicle animations that allow you to tell what a character is doing and what they plan. The appeal of just going through the daily life of a police officer is a welcome compromise between the hardcore idea of being an officer (Swat series) To the matienince of health and hunger levels (Deadly Premonition).The worst part about this game is that it feels cheap. The love for this game the developers gave to it is clear, and I enjoy the experience thus far, but there are a lot of times where I find cars flipped over for no reason, the camera constantly get's stuck to one position and once someone screams you will hear that scream throughout your shift like that victim is haunting your soul. If given more assets and time, this game could honestly be as good as Euro Truck SImulator in providing for a niche audience.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: YESDespite the cheap look this game has, it is a game with a lot of love and detail put into it that already feels like a unique experience.SUGGESTIONS TO DEVS: Focus more on bringing in the social life for the protagionist; I actually felt like this town could be given a lot more history and more characters that you could interact with."

Some may ask why? Well, because every vehicle in this game don't have licence plates.  And for a Police Simulator to not incorrperate Licence plates it's pretty bad.Let's talk about driving.  HORRIBLE DRIVING IN THIS GAME.  The vehicle speeds up way too quickly.  AI driving is horrible.  And let me tell you about traffic lights.  Cars will stop on green and go on red.  Some traffic lights don't even change to green.How about pulling over vehicles.Oh this the worst.  If a vehicle is running from you, you actually have to hit them with your vehicle to stop them.  Just parking in front of them after they start running won't stop them.  (Pretty unrealalistic)   (If you don't hit them with your vehicle then you can't open the pull over menu.)So in this game we are seen as the only police officer in town...  While you are playing this game you will not come into contact with another police officer.  Although, if you exit your vehicle you can hear a police radio.  Some YouTubers have said that he/she is so lonley being the only police officer that he/she is playing recordings of a Police Radio.  Honestly I wouldn't blame him/her.If you are looking for a Good Police Simulation, buy Grand Theft Auto 4 and Install LCPDFR (Just search upLCPDFR.COM)or get Grand Theft Auto 5 and install LSPDFR (Just like before except now it'sLSPDFR.COM)With this mod you can actually run licence plates, pull people out of vehicles and stop someone who is running without hitting them with your vehicle.  And better yet there are actually a lot of other police, so you won't have to worry about being the only police officer in town!To end this there is a new police simulation coming out sometime in the next months called Police 10-13(https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252178673)I can tell you that this one will have potential graphics are way better, and they have been working on it for over 3 years so awesome!"

Think of True Crime New York City; you could give tickets, inspect cars, frisk people, etc. However, like True Crime NYC, this game is rather broken. The world feels empty, the NPCs are nearly identical aside from a few color differences in clothing, there is a lack of dialogue. In all aspects, the game can be done if you look past these things but it really needs a lot of work. The aimming is clunky, the driving is dodgy, the weather effects are ugly.There is no denything that I still enjoyed the game. However, until the game is polished up, I will not be touching this game for a while. There are many ways the player can boost, or outright manipualte the way the game is meant to be played and quickly level up. Despite the bugs and exploits, you can have a fun time but the game can get really boring really fast, there's not much to do when off-duty.In conclusion, if you can look past the bugs and exploits, you will most likely like this game if you enjoy police simulators. However, if you are like me and suffer from strong OCD, the glitches will really drive you insane. If and when this game is a little bit more playable, I will indeed consider rewriting my review.

,Recommended,318220,22000040,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,dblendor,"First I will start this review by touching on the admins of the game here on Steam. Quite frankly they are terrible with customer service, after asking a simple question one of their admins gave a short response (did not answer the question) then proceeded to lock the thread. Not the best way to handle a customer.The game itself has its high and low points. Despite what the designers state, it does feel a little repetitive no matter how you play the game. The limited customization of characters, the fact that characters don't have traits upon creation or their experiences working make the player character feel bland. The personal interactions are also very bland and don't do much to bring the player into the world of the officer they are playing.Enforcer does provide a large playing area where you can explore, yet the world feels a bit empty. In a day and age with so much attention paid to how Police Officers perform their job, you do not get any of this in the game. You do not even have other officers, events that change how the community sees the police, or a Chief that imposes training on the force.Unfortunately, it causes the game to feel a bit hollow. While you have the option to choose from a number of police vehicles, and freedom to patrol where you want, there's just a great deal missing that causes the game to not feel satisfying.  I am recommending the game only based on the fact it's the only one of its kind and it's not terrible if you have low expectations.The developers also should take a hard look at how they respond to customers as well.Of note, I definitely logged more than the six hours of game time it is showing.True Score: 5.5/10"

You are able to do some basic police stuff and you must take care of your player with food and comfort.  However, the game gets really old after a few hours of playing.  You are very limited with what you can do and the map is very unique.  When you enter a new section of the map, the game must load the new section as aposed to just continuing driving.  The bright side to this game is that it is compatiable with Mac users and it is the only realistic police simulator out there for Mac.  However, for PC users, I DO NOT recommend this game.  Instead, I recommend the LSPDFR mod for Grand Theft Auto V.  I know it is a bit pricey for the origional game, but trust me, it is a lot better then Enforcer.  I believe that Enforcer's price should be reduced to about $5.  However, the gameplay is not what makes me so angry.

I'm not going to review the story line, but just the gameplay itself. Enforcer: Police Crime Action centres around a single municipal police officer in a small desert town. You respond to call the dispatch informs you about and you have the options to respond to the calls or not. There is also real-time events happening in the city as well. It likes to focus mostly around the every day duties of a police officer and it does this very well. The simulator also goes beyond the duties of a police officer and you have to maintain you social and home life when you are not on duty, like manage your stress, eating, sleeping, and spending time with friends and family. Now that I have vaguely explained the game, I'm going to go into pros and cons of the game.Pros:-The simulator/game, or whichever you prefer to call it, does an amazing job of immersing you into the life of a police officer. The lackluster graphics still do not get in the way of making you feel and believe you are the law enforcement of this town and tries to make you thorough in your investigations and arrests, making you feel like you want to make a difference in the one-cop-town.-The callouts. There is, at this stage of the game, quite a few different types of callouts that dispatch will give you while you're driving aroung town, looking for any law breakers. You can do simple things like, stopping some delinquents from vandalizing a public building to solving a kidnapping and finding the kidnapped and taking out the kidnapper and calling in an ambulance to take the kidnapped person from the situation.-The rank up system. There is a huge list of different ranks to go through, from just a simple patrol officer to the chief of police. The list is quite large and every crime you solve and even just giving an illegally parked car a ticket helps you earn points to rank up and earn new things, like different police vehicles and customization items to them, as well as making your paycheck at the end of each shift more bountyfull.-Being able to make vehicle roadblocks and checkpoints, for example, like creating a drunk driving program where you stop vehicles and perform breath tests to catch drunk drivers and even inspect vehicles to make sure they are road-worthy. Even just doing this can add enjoyment of feeling like a police officer and busting those damn drunk drivers a ticket and time in the slammer.-The game does balance the action and simulation very well. I have had to chase down many suspects that attemted to flee and deploy the tazer on them, watching them get the jitters and then give themselves up after one hell of a shocking. You are equipped with a pistol and a SMG when there are those times that you just can't take them down the nonlethal way. I found myself hiding behind my vehicle helplessly as the offender continues to sling lead my direction and found myself trying to figure out how to take him down and end the situation.I could name many more Pros to this game, but I may edit those in at a later time, but let's address the obvious Cons of this game now.Cons:-The graphics are horrendous, but given the small team that made this whole game themselves, you find yourself not caring too much, but this is a Con because the optimization is pretty bad. For a game that lack a lot of detail in the town there shouldn't be an excuse why I only get less than 20FPS on the medium settings on my system. The optimization is really bad and I run a pretty good system, so I should get 30FPS or more on the medium setting.-Physics are non-existing. You are, what feels like, stuck to the ground, like your car is a giant magnet and stuck to the ground. There's really not much else to say about the physic-less world, but let's hope there is some sort of physic engine added in later, probably much later.-The controls, oh the controls, they are awful, with no sensitivity sliders, or custom key options. You turn your car almost 90 degrees by just barely tapping the ""A"" and ""D"" keys. It makes it hard to stay to one side of the road and you find yourself all over the damn road and crashing into everything.-Damage system. Your car takes way too much damage easily. Just by bumper tapping or hitting curb, you'll find yourself repairing you vehicle up to 3 times a shift and the shifts are very short. To get to parking lots, or the gas pump, and the garage have no slope on the curb, so you always take a lot of damage by just trying to get into the gas station. It's extremely frusterating and annoying. This huge flaw needs to be addressed immediatley. Like, now, seriously. It almost ruins the game for me.-Your food, sleep, and stress bars. They deplete waaay to fast. I think they have been fixed, but they still go down way too fast. They need to be slowed down by 10x or more.Okay, so I hope this review helped people deceide whether or not to invest in this game. Is it worth $16 on sale? Maybe, but maybe not. If they release a MAJOR and I mean, MAJOR update soon. Then hell to the freaking yes it's worth it, but as it stands no. Helping this small team of developers is worth it, though. This game has AMAZING potential and I'm so damn excited to see what they have in store for this game. Personally, I give this game a 8.5/10. I love this game. The police simulation games come in a small amount, like Police Force 2 or the LCPDFR mod for GTA IV, so I welcome this game and I am happy to support the developers. Keep it up, so far this game has me hooked and I can't wait to see what you all have in store for this."

Err, are strange…BugsThe scripting is strange.. When I was playing the game a little so I could make this review, I pulled a guy over for wrecking into a cement truck*, and randomly, after telling him he could go, he just randomly sprinted off and ran at a car furiously until I arrested him. *that wasn’t considered a crime, apparently.Some callouts are WAY too easy. I was called out to an injured person call, and I walked over, and called an ambulance, then it was over. No robbers. Nothing.One of the buttons while you are on duty does nothing that I can see (also, why a gun while off duty? I have never been attacked? Is that a thing?)In the game, it appears that you are the only cop in the city. Are you getting shot at by a gang? Tough luck mate. In real life, the entire city would come to kill them  if a single shot was fired at an officer, let alone 20! But in the game, you are the only person with a gun that isn’t trying to kill you!There is nothing stopping you that I know of from going and frisking everyone on the streets, farming easy points from the random illegal item system.

You start off as a police officer rank and work your way upto chief of police, and in the help guide in the game, it says as you progress ranks you unlock new missions and therefore take on more challenging and complex jobs. Yet this hasnt been the case, as i'm now a Lieutenant and i'm still doing the same jobs (getting the same jobs) that i've been given since the start and its now all too repetetive.So to sum up for me...i good game, different. But longetivity doesnt seem to be there for me, as i just keep getting the same missions despite having been promoted ranks and i'm now not too far off the top rank as lieutenant. Maybe someone else will back me up on this or reassure me that new missions do come up once you progress from lieutenant.Bit disappointing in this respect but a decent game. I'd recommend buying it when on discount."

The game still needs a lot of work, but I appreciate that the developers are working hard to fix all the issues with the game. I'm not sure how quickly it will be fully fixed, but when it is, this game will be really great. For example, I am still having issues with cars flying in the air, and a lot of pop in. I'll be driving down the road and sometimes objects will just appear right infront of me. This makes it almost impossible to drive through town without almost totalling my car each time. I also am still having a lot of issues with lag. If I was playing a game like Skyrim on Ultra I might question if my computer can handle it, but with this game, I'm pretty sure it still needs to be optimized for more graphical set ups.

Now, on to the review.This game needs some tlc for sure. The car physics aren't that great. They work, but don't expect GTA or Forza handling.The interface suffers from some flaws such as some wonky dialog boxes to choose actions, some odd ""loading"" type screens when taking certain actions that remove a car or an object from the world (such as towing a car or calling an ambulance) and interfacing with cars, drivers and suspects lacks useful feedback beyond a text message at the top of the screen. Some visual feedback would be nice, such as seeing missing/expired plates and/or defective equipment on the cars prior to a dialog-box based inspection once the car is stopped. It's a usuable system, but a complete overhaul to make it more intuitive and user-friendly would be a welcome change.The career system is lacking. I've yet to see any difference in the ""ranks"" beyond unlocking a new vehicle type. It would be nice to see it fleshed out more. Having to go ""off duty"" to reduce your stress level is an interesting idea, but lacks any depth beyond refilling a meter. Some more direct interaction would help it. The station serves little purpose except to drop off prisoners and request a ""warrant"" but I have yet to figure out what that even does.There's a currency in the game which is earned by working and can be spent on furnishing for your home (again, not a bad idea, just needs some work to makeit interesting.) Beyond appearances, everything seems to give the same stat boosts. Take the TV for example. The cheap and the middle priced TV both give an equal amount of stress reduction, negating the point of buying the more expensive TV. The other part which makes no sense at all is you have to pay for your own gas and vehicle repairs. I could understand repairs to a point, as you should be punished somehow for wrecking a squad car, but fuel? That makes no sense. Require fill-ups, sure. But no cop pays for fuel from his own pocket.The controls are functional, but again need thought out a little better. For instance, when ordering a suspect to stop, you have to use the ""C"" key. If you have your gun out, in order to fire, you first have to ""aim"" with a right click. I would remove the ""aim"" portion (since you should already be aiming if your gun is out) and bind the command function to the right click, so you can give orders quickly and still be prepared to shoot. Again, not a big issue, just an annoyance.So what is good about this game? All of it. It's a hell of a concept, with many underlying systems which make it all work well together. It's not perfect and it's a buggy mess, but it does have a certain allure and charm. The different styles of cruisers are really cool. Thee are several customization options once rank 3 is unlocked, including rims, paint scheme, lightbar type, and colors of each side on the lightbar. Once again, it needs more, but it really is a cool start.The missions can be repetative, but the constant stress of responding to a call and not knowing what you're walking into is really well captured. Sometimes it ends in a gunfight, sometimes they run then turn and shoot at you, and sometimes they just surrender or you really have to work at identifying which person is the right suspect. Again, it has it's flaws, but has potential. The biggest complaint I have is that there is always a suspect somewhere when given a call. It would be nice to occasionally find out no crime was actually comitted, but that would require a much more in-depth investigation system which I doubt this game would be capable of pulling off.Sometimes drivers pull over, sometimes a chase ensues, sometimes they bail and run on foot. Again, you never know what you will get. I can't commend this game well enough at mixing in the unknown to every contact with a car or suspect. It really is a good mix and keeps the game entertaining.If you want a perfect, AAA game with minimal bugs, tons of content, and bleeding edge graphics, then skip this title. However, if you enjoy finding hidden gems that might be a little rough around the edges, then definately give this one a shot. Have realistic expectations of what teh game is and is not and you will find it really enjoyable.Also, if you have younger children that are always fascinated with police, fire and ambulance vehicle every time they see one, then play this with them. There is no gorey bloody deaths, and while there is the occasional shootout, you still have to call an ambulance for the ""bad guy"" and be the good guy. For some with small children, it can be a good option instead of GTA and stealing cop cars."

Furthermore the missions are often rather repetative as the criminals will often spawn in the same locations every time. In addition there is literally no incentive to bring the criminals back alive (if they have their gun drawn) you recieve the same points for killing the criminal as you do for brining them back alive (unless they dont have their gun drawn, points are lost for shooting at them).  As well despite the several distinct regions in the game, they all feel almost entirely bland as they are rife with either unenterable buildings, or land with nothing on it. Another thing that I must complain about is the fact that shooting vehichles does literally NOTHING, if you shoot at a vehichle it will not do any damage to the vehichle or the driver, also problamatic is the fact that if you shoot at a civilian vehichle, no points are deducted. Another problem is that if you simply quit and reload your game, your stress level will be reset and your sleep and hunger levels are also almost enitrely reset, which removes the necessity to take anytime off. There are also rampant glitches, such as the fact that the main city (or at least the one your house is in the region of) is rife with invisible potholes on the streets that will do damage to your car if you go over them at too high a speed and possibly even send your vehichle flying. As well I have noticed sometimes that there will randomly be vehichles just sort of floating in the air. I have also noticed that sometimes in the city various vehichles will run into each other for no apparent reason, maybe it is just the drunk drivers but I dont know.Overall, I think that if the problems with this game are fixed it could be a good or maybe even a great game, I really do like the concept of a game where you play as a police officer as it has not been done very often, however until they fix the problems listed and the many more that I probably didnt notice or think to write about, then it is not really a worthwhile purchaseUPDATE: they are improving the game however, so hopefully soon they will fix the bugs that currently plague the game"

Most of the time will be spent mining trading cards or waiting for the off chance that you actually get given an objective that you haven't completed 50 times previously.Thirdly: The team has abandoned it completely. They are nowhere to be found except in their miserable fiefdoms, moderating their forum with an iron fist like a Cold War era Russian dictator. They don't listen to it's player base, they don't update their game, they break all of their promises and they have the *gall* to insult players with actual concerns, actual criticisms and actual desires to see this game completed.---------------------------------------------In summary, stay away from this mess, the game is broken and it won't be fixed and the development team are petulant children not deserving of a single cent from you.If you want a police simulator, you're better off getting the First Response mods for GTAIV or V."

While it has a lot of fun things to do, it currently is quite buggy, which the developers have promised to fix in patches, along with new features in the next few months. So here are the pros:- Has a fun concept; patrol the town and surrounding country looking for criminals or traffic violations.- Different dispatch missions; various calls like drunks causing trouble, robberies etc.- Multiple ways of catching criminals; tasers, guns, shout at them to surrender etc.- You can kick people's doors in an arrest them with a warrant (this is buggy at the moment tho)Cons:-VERY buggy and not very user friendly at the moment (probably fixable in patches soon though)- There's no backup system, so ATM you're the only cop in town-animations, drivng physics and pursuits don't really work properly.-tasers make people hover in the air for a minute (???)So overall, if you're a fan of games such as SWAT 4 and GTA 4's LCPDFR mod, i'd recommend you give it a try after a few patches. For the dev's first PC release, it's pretty decent, with a good graphics/sound options menu."

At times it is fairly buggy and sadly it does not recieve regular updates to further enhance gameplay. However if this genre is your cup of tea then by all means I would reccomend it if you have time to kill. The game itself is fairly realistic; essentialy you complete day to day police tasks such as issuing parking tickets and arresting drug dealers. You have a health bar along with a hunger bar, strength bar and an awakeness bar (both of the 2 latter can be refilled on duty by using fist tool for a while). All the police vehicles in this game are fairly nice however chases tend to be uncommon.Please note: This game is not good for laptops, mine succeeds the minimum requirements but realistically you should use something more powerful, my laptop struggles to handle this game and thus fries itself.

Dont want to say it was awful.I have come back to it after a few months and it has radically improved.The graphics are not gorgeous. In fact they would not look out of place in early Xbox games at points. So if you are looking for good look this is not it. And frankly, asking for good graphics in something that is a simulation game of this type is just silly.Which brings me to my next point: I have seen some mention that the game gets pretty dull after some time playing. They are not wrong. However, once again, this IS a sim game that attempts to simulate a real life job. And much like its counterparts in the career simulation genre, things are going to get repetetive at times. Just like a real life career. Anyone who has played a truck simulator will have hit that issue where they feel bored, even if you are a trucking fan, like me. And that is to say nothing of my second favourite Farming Simulator. Sorry but real policing is not all gun fights and car chases.Bugs. It has some small ones that unless you are someone who is easily annoyed or bugged (Badum Tsh!) by such things, you will not notice them.What you get here is something that attempts to bring you the day to day grind of a police officer. Even the boring stuff (Which i personally like to see and do) such as traffic policing.Could this be better? Sure. But what it is right now is good considering the small time it has been around.So, dont expect high octane chases, and movie style policing. Its a simulation. And dont expect AAA graphics."

In addition if you have played LCPDFR you know the struggle to get the mods you want to work, hell you had problems getting GTA IV to start, but you did what you had to, stayed up through the night to get everything working because you know how fun it is, and now you are looking at this game because its like LCPDFR except you don't have to worry about bugs, crashes, bad mods, no. Finally a game based around the idea of police simulation. Now the question is, is this game good? Is it what we all wanted? The answer, is yes. Amazingly this seems to be the first success of its kind and on my very first day of playing it I already had 5 hours, keep in mind this was not made by Rockstar, this was made by an indie developer so this is not GTA 6 Police, not even close. This game still has minor bugs, it still needs polishing, it is not finished. Currently the game is very enjoyable and playable, none of the minor drawbacks that I just mentioned damper the games ""fun factor"" at all. All I meant by saying that is do not expect GTA 6 Police, however what you will find is a game with good graphics, decent animations, a good selection of vehicles, and a good system of fighting crime. And I know that the one question you still want answered before you buy this game, so I will tell you, yes, you can*Pull people over (Traffic stop). When you do this you have the option to check their plates and license, use a breathelizer, ask them to exit the vehicle, issue a ticket, and I believe a couple more. And yes, sometimes they do run and you must chase after them, but whatever the random situation is you have the choice of letting them go free, write a ticket, or if need be, arrest them and transport them to the station or call a police van. You also should tow their car however that is optional. Now for your characters abilites, you can fight with your fists, you have a pistol, you can direct traffic, you have a taser, and you have your radio to call a police transportation van, an ambulance, a tow truck, and help if your police car runs out of gas or has reached its maximum damage capacity. (Yes cars use gas I know its awesome!) And of course you do get random callouts. There is also a level system, I do not know off hand how many levels their are but I believe their is about 15 or 16. You start as a corpral and make your way all the way down to the final rank Chief of Police. Now depending on your rank you will get more dangerous callouts and get paid more at the end of your shift. Now I do not want to spoil the whole game but you do have shifts and off your shift you go to your house, you can go out with friends, own your own civilian car, eat, watch TV, shower, sleep, and many other things. Now this system of off duty is not the greatest, their is not much to do and it will probably be polished in the future. But I do think that it is good because in a game that is centered around police simulation it would be awkward to be on patrol 24 hours a day 7 days a week, so I do believe this is a good system that was put into play. So that is pretty much what you are getting, also do not forget the whole game is open world, no missions! Now if there was one thing that I could say was the biggest problem with the game currently it would probably the car physics, they are not unplayable but they are not Iracing physics. That is pretty much the end of my review and don't think you know everything now because I am happy to say there are many more features in the game still that you can do as a police officer! I do believe it is worth the money and my final rating on the game *CURRENTLY is a 8.7/10"

It tends to get edited on their side often. Post vanish, many sub post are deleted.. etc.The lack of communication and even the forum mod finally admitting he had zero contact for several weeks with the studio leading him to leave himself... then the Devs / Odin come back and delete post that have any ill statements or comments on the company.. but allow massive flaming and attacks to the prior mod to stay... Kindest thing I can say is... ♥♥♥♥ poor company, ♥♥♥♥ poor attitude. Stay clear of anything they ever offer... simply because they have shown they outright lie, they make empty promises, and they nail down any comments that reflect the actions they have taken.Below is my latest forum addition to the discussion on the update... I am putting it here in case it vanishes.Jeorg Ersteman has Enforcer: Police Crime Action 3 hours agoIt is not a matter of Odin sucking... etc.The simple facts as they stand would be in their favor but for one thing. They made a totally false statement, then could not / would not deliver.Positive. The game released a complete nightmare. Completely bug ridden and quite literally a mess. That was corrected quickly, and with much info from the devs. All in all, for a 20$ title, it gave that.. and they fixed it up to what at the time was offered. Then they did give some extra in the form of vehicles, and some add of little things.. like the sort of flashlight.Negative. No mod support other than skinning cars ever came. It was mentioned that uniforms etc would be possible. Additional call outs were mentioned.. never came. The lingering total end to calls bug still exist. BUT the big thing in my book, and what has people down.. is the complete lie. That is what it is.. the lie of a totally new game more or less via the update. Simple fact. They offered a totally new experience... and had nothing to show.. and still dont. Giving us a pic every few weeks of a street is not showing progress. Posting only to lament the condition of the company as far as ability to progress is not progress.They lost a lot of faith from people in simply saying they would do something, then not following through. As another guy mentioned.. an update does not run 6 months late... a totally new project does. I said before.. they never had an update.. and instead of just saying it, and that they would work on one now because they want to.. they lied. Simple fact. The best and only thing they could have done to keep the faith was simply say... we have no idea when this will be done.I had a lot of support for these guys being small etc back on day one. The way they really did communicate and work on issues. Now.. 180 from them.

Just about yesterday did I really give this title a chance. Now I am addicted to it. For some odd reason. Allow me to give some Positives and Negatives on the game. So you can decide to make your purchase.Positives: -Plenty of Dispatch Missions to take advantage of, which are Challengings and Fun.-Your Police Vehicle has many customization options.-Wide vast area with much to explore.-Plenty of criminals to arrest.-Responsive Controls.-Driving feels very fluent, but takes time to get used to.-Music is actually very good.-Voice acting is on point.-There is always something to do, even when there are no missions available.-Ranking up feels rewarding as you get an increase in pay.-Weather & Night to Day transitions are wonderfully done.-You are able to decorate and buy new things for your home.Negatives: -Aiming can be a chore to pull off, when you are about to get shot.-Sometimes when doing routine checks on cars, the person driving the car will run sometimes, also very far.-When you arrest someone, you are forced to walk. When you want to put them in your car, especially if they run a far distance, walking takes forever to get back to your car which will inspire you to call police dispatch to lighten the burden.-When finished with routine missions, entering the police station for a warrant based on a mission is a problem. When you step back outside the station, the game forces another routine mission on you, removing the perp from the map. Making it difficult to find where they are again. Unless Dispatch decides to update you on their location, which can take a terribly long time.-illegally parked cars don't spawn often, unless you quit, and restart the game. So when asked to ticket illegally parked cars, there are usually none in the street. There is a way around this by ticketing cars on the street by checking their license plates, and ticketing them that way. Its the only way around it.-You take no damage by getting hit by cars. They usually flip over you. Also you cannot kill a pedestrian by hitting them.-You can only arrest one person at a time. When you're after two perps, you have to dispatch the one first, while the other has the chance to escape as you cannot go after them when you have someone handcuffed.-Sometimes Dispatch missions never show up. Because of a game glitch. You have to sleep 8 hours & restart the game. The glitch is caused by the Stress meter being too low. The game gets confused and doesn't turn back Dispatch calls on.-AI pedestrians have a habit of endlessly walking into vehicles, perps in houses run endlessly into the wall, or the door with their body peeking out of the door when you try to arrest them.-The game has a bad habit of throwing you missions even after your shift is over. They should stop. Because when you end your shift with a mission active, even if its routine, you are penalized points. Which you need to rank up.Even with the negatives I think the game is still very enjoyable. Regardless, its up to the buyer. Happy New Year everyone."

Whilst going through this page and looking at reviews, I figured I should try it. It was on sale and I said to myself ""Why not?"" I personally am a very very very large fan of the police genre of gaming (My favorite games being the SWAT Series, especially SWAT 4, LCPDFR from GTA 4 and various other examples) and while I am very biased in my opinion, which is why it is my opinion, I feel compelled to say that I can see the arguments on both sides. Yes, this game is buggy in various ways (Though not as many as I read about. Maybe I was lucky.) And yes it does have questionable graphics. But this game, to me at least, was not made for the general population. It was made for the people who specifically like to play regular cops and aren't all about the shooting and explosions life styles (I realize the hypocritial way I said SWAT 4 was my favorite police genre game, back off xD). This game has an outstanding amount of minute details. So while I do recommend this game, I recommend it to a very small percent of gamers. If you want a game that's about shooting and explosions then this is not for you. Whilst I love explosions and shooting myself, it's a nice change of pace. And yes, the devs do update this game (As shown by the police motorcycle) but at the same time it is a small dev team so you have to accept some problems. All in all I feel this game was made for me and some other small percentage of gamers. If you are truly stuck on if you should buy this or not, I recommend watching gaming reviews and not someone whose messing with the engine of the game and make up your mind for yourself."

The amount of people out there looking for a genuine (and playable) police simulator is a high number; this game is for every one of them. It is definetly a working progress, and the developers need to fix a lot of things and add more into this simulator:- AI must be fixed... when someone decides to run away from you, your thoughts are ""yes, finally a chase"" and then they end up running into a wall or car and don't proceed. This ruined a fair few moments for me.-More (and fixed) car chases. Car persuits are a big pro to police games, and this game just needs to up that. When a car fails to stop in this game, it drives far too slow, you want a car persuit to be fast and action filled, not at 25mph on a more or less straight road.- Fixed sirens. The siren/ lights (on police vehicles) in this game is better than most others. Having said that, there could be A LOT more done to make this system more lifelike.- Animations. The game is seriously lacking in animations when something happens in-game e.g. after you shoot and kill a suspect, or find any injured person, the protocol is to phone for an ambulance. Once pressing the ambulance button the cop states into the radio that an ambulance is needed. Then a still frame of the police station shows on screen along with the allocated points for what you have done. That is just one example of many animatons that are lacking.- Fellow cops. For a POLICE simulator, there isn't enough police-you are litterally the only cop in the game. It would be nice to see other patrol cars patrolling and to be able to call for backup when you are under fire from multiple people.- Different scenarios (and locations). After a while playing the game, the patterns are obvious, you do not even need to look at the map to find out where you're going because you already know where the developers have set that specific scenaro to happen.To conclude, this game is very addicting, you can play for hours on end without getting bored. BUT, having said that, this game is 100% a WORKING DEVELOPMENT, only purchase this game if you are prepared to put up with some annoying bugs and repeated scenarios. This game definetly has potential. Lets just hope that the devs see what needs to be improved and act accordingly."

You can also check the NPCs for drugs and weapons along with many other things. Somtimes you're hiding near a highway with radars ready to catch speeders. Sometimes im patroling watching for gang/drug activity. The only downside to this game is that the graphics are terrible, they're similiar to the ps2's graphics and have similar graphics to GTA: San Andreas, but I hardly even notice the bad graphics and they're easily overlooked.

A lot of what's said from dispatch, or the written text, is odd and strikes me as non-English speakers who've never watched Cops trying to write dialog.  I would expect less ""There's a murderer on the loose"" and more ""Shots fired; civilian casualties"" or ""Armed suspect reported"" or the like.  Google searches reveal that the dialog used to be even worse, so this is *after improvement*.There isn't much polish; the little things will constantly eat at you.  Like, trying to back up your squad car feels clunky, or having it slide backwards down a hill when it's parked (which I guess is fixed in the latest patch).  You basically harass and pull over random people to try and make your quotas, with only a few traffic violations being ""externally visible"".  I will say I was really impressed when, at night, I could actually see people with their headlights broken and ticket them for it.  That was cool, I'll give them that!You can't pull people over for running lights, you can't issue tickets for accidents.  The game doesn't seem to care if you, yourself, drive recklessly and there doesn't seem to be a penalty for damaging innocent cars.  Scarface: The World Is Yours had better traffic law mechanics.  I couldn't even pull over a truck that ran a light, then rammed into a street light and blocked an intersection.And finally, the weather; when it started raining, the sound of the storm was really overwhelming and irritating.  And it was raining inside the police station, which was great.  In my house, at least it wasn't raining in there but it was still equally loud as outside.  Really obnoxious.One of the things that made Police Quest cool was they actually hired law enforcement folks to help design the game.  I'd love these guys to take another shot at this game, with Enforcer 2, and actually hire a cop to help them make it.

Good grapchics, there are many nice plugins, excellent system. I'm fun of LSPDFR/LCPDFR. Everyone's reviews are correct, I think so. But, I think that it is very difficult for me to critisize this game in comparison to LSPDFR/LCPDFR.One reason.There are few games which able to do patrol duty in video game market. Very famours patrol duty game is ""Police Quest"". P.Q. is very nice game but it is too old in today. I understand that P.Q. system is plannd and excellent at the video game age. "" Is P.Q. fun or not fun ? "". I answer "" very fun "". Just the same, P.Q. is too old game.Can we find in easy other patrol duty game at current game market ?. That is not easy. Police patrol duty games (simulation, adventure, action and other) are very few. So, I praise this game developer's challenge at the video game market.Other one reason. G17 Media, LSPDFR and LCPDFR developer, members are working without benefit. We have to buy only GTA5/GTA4. Of course, we can donate to G17 Media but is it enough for them?. G17 Media  members has enough income from everyone's donation ?. Other LSPDFR/LCPDFR plugin developers are too. We can benefit by their non-benefit and non-paid working. The better way, patrol duty games are published at video game market.As soon as we will be able to find other patrol duty games at a market. EmergeNYC from FlipSwitch, Responding from Visionary Studios, Police1013 from Wingman Games. I'm very happy. I want to praise every developer's challenge."

It needs alot of patches and bug fixes an example is when a car hits you, what happens is that the car makes a flip. Another one is when I travel from one part of MV to another one, my car loses 1 hp. When my sirens and lights are on some cars still manage to hit me and the drivers are not drunk.. Things are very expensive. I was on a mission I had to shoot 2 drug dealers, I got hit once and and shot like 8 bullets. My car got hit by another car and i had to pay for the gas. I had to pay 100$ for the bullets, 200$ for medicine 25$ for my car and 11$ for the gas plus the food that is 5$... I earned 600$. My total expenses were 341$ 600$-341$= 259$. The cheapest car costs 9000$... After my shift I have to either walk home (like 7-10 minutes running) or waste 20$ on a cab to my house. You have to pay to get food out of your fridge, it's 5 dollars... wtf? The physics in this game suck, driving is laggy even with the lowest graphic settings with me and I have no clue why because I can run games like arma and BF4 on max FPS. 2 body shots with an m9 can drop me but with my mp5 I need 4 body shots (m9 fires 9×19mm Parabellum bullets and so does the mp5, this means that it fires the same bullets but I need more shots to drop someone). The map is split in small parts which is really annoying because I get lost alot (for anyone of you who has postal 2, think about going from one part to another) This wastes alot of time on just loading that and I get lost sometimes trying to find my house.. Also when I arrest someone and as for a van to pick them up I see a screen saying ""Good job, one less criminal on the streets""... They could've added a truck to pick them up.My advice to you: Don't buy this game unless you are willing to deal with the bugs.This game has potential, if you fix these bugs it will be an amazing game.Thanks for reading this."

76561198097707156,Recommended,318220,12770520,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,Соединенные Штат,": Hi, first of all I really like the you released, and I have a few ideas and bugs i've found in the game. Here are the bugs- 1. Includes floating cars, primarily in the downtown area, even after the updates, cars still float. 2. Some cars do not pull over by siren, when i'm trying to pull certain vehicles over, they fail to pull over, when i go in front of them they just drive into my car. 3. I found that my left indicator keeps coming on while driving. 4. When I press the number ""4"" in-game my character is frozen and it can't move. Very big issue. Now enough with the bugs, here are a few suggestions- 1. More police vehicles, assuming the map takes place in America, I, living in the United States assume you don't know much about our vehicles. My city has these cars (Fayetteville Police Department) -2007 Ford F-150 -2012 Dodge Charger SRT8 -2007 Chevrolet Tahoe -2012 Dodge Caravan -2005 Chevrolet Impala -unmarked 2012 Dodge Charger -Unmarked 2010 Chevrolet Impala Of course, since you don't have licensing you can't get the exact models, but its just a idea on what our police cars look like. 2. Police backup I think that calling backup that come in there cars, armed to help you out would be great. I think that would have to be my biggest concern with the game is the lack of other police. 3. Less loading screens It would be nice if when you called a ambulance, a ambulance was actually responding and you can see the ambulance doing its duties, same with calling a police van to pick up someone you arrested, as well as when you call a tow truck, just to add to the realism, i saw you did alot on off-duty, but don't forget about on-duty! 4. Mod compatibility, I think it would be nice for members to be able to create mods that maybe you developers never really thought of. 5. Less rain- I'm not sure if it rains alot in Brazil, but here in North America, it doesn't rain every single day. 6. More call outs- Here are just a few ideas that I think are very important to implant- -Car Accidents (VERY IMPORTANT) -Drunk Driver -Officer Assistance -Domestic Disturbance (2 people fighting, even when you get on scene) Those are pretty much the most important call outs I think the game needs. 7. Faster cars I found the cars go only about 17 mph through the city while the speed limit is 30, I never actually caught someone speeding. I think people speeding should be very visible. 8. Speed Radar I think it would be nice to see the exact speed of vehicles passing by 9. License check It would be nice to check people's license by going back to the police vehicle and checking there name on the police computer. There, we can see if the driver has a warrant/expired license/revoked license. It would also be nice if some drivers didn't have a license as well. 10. Police baton Not very important, though just a small feature. Overall, its a great game."

Another reason is that the game is completely empty, just a bunch of very dumb AI walking around with cars spawning in front of you while you're trying to drive. I see what the devs are trying to achieve, but it looks like they have given up on their game and have moved on. I feel like I have been robbed of $20 because this game is not even worth that much, I would estimate that this game is about $1 at this stage. Another reason I feel robbed is that they actually think that this game is done and have slowed down on making updates which is what makes me furious. This game is not even half done, its 1/10 done.

,Recommended,318220,15082579,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,Stenwick,"Alright. Never written a review before so. What the hell! Ahem...I'm going to give this a 3/5 in this case. Mainly because its in its baby stages, and theres more to add in this case.So far, the gameplay is alright, Simple so far. Start out as a beat cop (Sort of) Walking around, Ticketing vehicles, setting speed traps, pulling over drunk drivers. There is a minor story in both the male and female characters, but that quickly liquidates as..Well. Its a sandbox..Free-roam. So I can't mark down points on that.The location is....Clunky. In my personal opinion (And others may feel free to disagree) It feels as if you could either move it to a more populated area. (Or create a second map. That would give players a much wider sense of adventure and exploration) Or just expand the area more with more to explore. Eitherway, Once you've seen all the areas, thats it, exploration over.Combat? Well. Rarely there. Or I havn't really progressed far yet. (First Sergeant so far) Fists are rarely used (You could throw a baton in there for variation.) Firearms are suddenly thrown in. Maybe remove the SMG? I find its rarely used around now. Probably for later ranks. Tazers are not the only non-lethals out there, Pepper spray maybe? Good for short-ranged. Less range than the tazer. More range that your fists (Or baton if its implimented). Two hits and your dead, unstandable. Frustrating when you forget the tazer has only one shot and you have to reload. Maybe throw in body armor later on? Seeing as you will more and likely going up against drug dealers, cartels, gangs. It'd be logical to later on recieve body armor for a small cost. Hey. If it gets worse, throw in S.W.A.T armor/uniform! Baby stages!Missions. So far. So good! It started slow with simple hunt down drink drivers, or wander drunks, or setting up speed traps. And as I ranked up I started getting more into the dirty side of crime by hunting down the occassional drug dealer. Like I said, in baby stages so far, but more can be added. So looking forward to more here. Some missions I find quite entertaining. 'Go to X and find Z' One I just find inasne......'Illegally parked Vehicles' Okay. So 25 Minutes to find 7 wrongfully parked vehicles. I don't think Mountain Valley has a drug problem, I think it more has a parking problem. And they're so well hidden that I can't find them! I have to traverse map to map sections just to meet my quota! Oh. And some times are too generous. 25 Real time minutes is pretty much 2 shifts. But when your first shift ends, that progress is lost. Be alittle more less lenient on times..... And...Less illegally parked cars...More drugs and gang violance.Progression. So far, I'm liking the rank tree and the standard 'Gain certain amount of EXP/Score' to rank up. Maybe unlock more uniforms/Vehicles/Housing and such as you level up. Hell. If you get to Sergeant, throw in an NPC Companion maybe! It pays to be ranked! And this job is too dangerous to go alone!Driving. Okay. So far. This will be the main negative part for this. I took a car out, and I swear I was falling into a 'Back to the Future' Moment. Gently press the accelerate button...And...Atleast a second later. 99MPH..... I had to immediantly slam on the breaks to slow down. Heck. At one point I was going in reverse so fast I had to slam the handbreak on as accelerating did nothing! This requires quite abit of tweaking! And the car repair costs are manic, not just because its expensive, its more that its difficult to NOT hit anything. Cruise helps. But. Eh.A.I. Uh. Its not great, but its not so bad either. Maybe some more character models for look. They're not so bad walking, they just horrific when driving. Stop one car, the one behind slams into it and slowly (And painfully) Tries to continue moving. Usually people stop as soon as they hit a car, (Or see a policeman giving a ticket to the person in front.) A bit of an intelligence tweak may be required on the drivers.Customisation? Meh. Five off duty uniforms. Two on duty uniforms. Not great. Maybe add shopping here? Or a new flashy uniform when you rank up? Only one house. Little customisation. An expensive fridge does little to no better than your cheap stock one.Overall Verdict? So far. So good. Alot of tweaks to be made. It does in its own way feel unique. Realistic. And none of that 'Good cop, Bad Cop' rubbish. (Though kicking in doors is quite a good one without caring for minor loss points.)Improvements?- A much stronger progression system. Maybe additional uniforms per promotion. Access to more equipment.- The cars. The speed is an issue. If I go any faster, I might break the time barrier and see the game in the future.- A.I. Yeah. Intelligence Tweak when driving.- Either friendly Police A.I to assist you (Seriously, Can't be the only policeman in this valley right?) Or impliment a co-op feature (Though give that time, Co-Op and multiplayer is when the game is a good few builds away from completion)Overall. Keep it up. And keep going!"

It's been said by other reviews, but it really does feel like it's in early access and not quite finished. Apart from the floating cars, etc. mentioned by others, these are the things i found frustrating:- Fuel consumption. Appears to be the same regardless of engine revs... when i first started, i got into my patrol car, and played around with the keys etc for 5 mins. In that 5 mins, my fuel went down to 70%! Just idling in the driveway! Did they install a lawnmower tank in the car?- Refuelling - Apart from the lack of driveway access to the gas station which knocks 7-8% points off your damage just getting next to the fuel pump, Why do I have to pay for the gas? Maybe it's different in other parts of the world but where I come from, the police department pays for the fuel, Not the officer!- Bad Drivers! So, I'm giving a ticket to the truck parked illegally and some bozo drives into my patrol car (which had its lights going parked up on the side of the road). So I pull the driver out, Pat him down and breathalise him and he comes back clean. So I arrest him and take him to the station and apparently i've arrested an innocent man! I guess its not against the law in mountain valley to not look where you're driving. I imagine the same thing would have happened had I arrested the 2 people in cars outside the police station who were sat stationary on the footpath driving into the concrete planter boxes... Innocent too I imagine..Its an awesome concept. and has the posibility of being one of the greats.. but it needs work. I would not recommend it right now.. its a disappointment.

Being a police officer and being able to do whatever a police officer does on a daily basics makes the game great. Not to mention the ranking system which gives the game a more MMO feel, where you need to get enough points to rank up to the next level.The bad: Sadly, there is more bad then good. Pretty much the only major bugs/glitches that the game has is with vehicles. Just driving a car feels really bad, in the sense that simply moving forward and turning left for just a second makes the car almost instantly turn 90 degrees. Also sometimes when driving fast and colliding with sidewalks or passing intersections makes the car fly into the air, and do a couple of flips.Another glitch is tha sometimes when firing at an armed criminal, your bullets dont shoot correctly. And by that I mean dont shoot at all, leaving you free to get shot by the armed criminal.I am still recommending this game because as a police fan, this is perfect for me. Adding on that there is no other stable game that accomplishes this."

Although it doesn't hinder the gameplay and fun factor.- Controls are not always clear. There're many different options and as such you're not always sure how things work. A quick peek manual would be nice.-Ingame time. A full days lasts 24 minutes. In my opinion that's way to fast. I like my days a bit more longer lasting. Let's say 60 minutes or so.So far, this is a nice game already and I'll see myself having lots of fun with it in the future. Especially if they're able to fix some of the things mentioned above."

I've been griping for years that after so many incarnations of GTA, we could at least have one open world cop game. (True Crime doesnt count there's too much of a fantasy element there) But in it's current state, this game is only kind of OK. But at the current price, it's just not worth picking up until some things get ironed out. Such as the driving; it's the worst driving with a mouse and keyboard I've ever experienced. I feel like this could be remedied by figureing out a way to have controller support. While it wouldn't really fix the problem, it could make the problem a lot less evident. Character movement is akward, though not as bad as the driving. I would go out on a limb to say that it's passable, but it still needs work as well. I also feel like the devs are working on trying to work on making the game bigger and more complex before addressing these fundemental issues. Overall I cannot recommend this game for it's current state and price. There is loads of potential here though. So hopefully one day that price will reflect what could be a very cool, unique game."

I played it for about 2 hours and got to level 4. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't figure out how exactly I can get my new car.Now, in the start, you have to spend the first 5 minutes just reading through a very long text that explains how everything works. Instead, I'd suggest a categorized way of looking through things. That way it's better to look over things later on as well.The game mechanics are.. they're not the best. It's sluggish, the car handling is pretty crap and civilians driving trucks often cause traffic jams because they can't turn a tight corner. As far as civilian interaction goes and completing missions that involve finding suspects, it's pretty much impossible. I mean my first callout was a vandalism case. I asked the guy who called what the vandals look like and he gave me the descriptions of them. Problem was, the descriptions matched like 3 nearby NPCs. I'd have no way of knowing which one of them is the real criminal. Some diversity in appearances would be nice. Just retexture the clothes, if you must.DUIs are a little confusing. So I check someones breath and they're under the influence. I get them out, place them under arrest and it gets ticked under ""Innocent Civilians Arrested""? DUI is an arrestable crime in pretty much every state in America. Wut.As far as on-duty off-duty time goes, I think there's way too much effort put into the off-duty aspect. The stress level is.. meh. Hanging out with your mother/sister/grandparents/friends doesn't even give you any stress points, which is weird. And what's with the applause as if I've just won an Oscar after hanging out with people?The police vehicle itself is well done, as well as the interactables. Indicators, siren and the strobes themselves. However, it being just red is kind of bland. Red and blue in the future pls. Oh and while I think to mention it, please add a tutorial on how to get a new police vehicle, because I have not got a clue on how to get my new ones.The game is built on a strange engine as well. I mean the graphics aren't really top of the line and I'm lagging horribly unless I run it under low graphics. It doesn't make much sense that I can run Payday 2 better than I can run this.There should also be a little bit of further research be done on the ranks. I mean you don't have Police Officer and then Senior Deputy. Deputy = Sheriff's Office/Department (county). Police Officer = Police Department (city).All in all, like I said, it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential. Needs a lot of polishing. I mean the English itself in the game is sometimes bizarre."

There is sooo much you can do, while capturing the day-to-day grind.  While this could become boring, it does a pretty good job capturing the realistic career-risk of any ""routine"", where even a routine traffic stop can turn suddenly violent and the player faces sudden and possible death.It is not perfect.  There areas I wish would be improved upon.  My primary issue is, there is no, ""backup"" support.  You do not have a partner, and you can't call for backup.  I feel this, could be rectified in an expansion, which, maybe we will see some day.  This shortcoming, I was able to justify with the rationale, that, the town is pretty small, it ""might"" be possible, that you are the sole law enforcer on payroll (and of course dispatch).Enjoyable game, does a great job of immersing the player in the atmosphere.  Visuals are well done in many areas.  The open-world, random citizen/criminal generation keeps the replayability going (and humorous at times... my first day on patrol, my first three suspects were woman truck drivers... immagine my shock when this cute girl in a sexy dress jumped out of her truck and pulled a gun on me...).The realistic mode really draws you in to the life & death risks of the job... you learn to rapidly eject from your car in a chase, taking up cover behind your car, very quick.  My player has died in the line of duty four times (meaning permadeath-restart from scratch), before my latest actually has survived up to LT (and still going).There is a more arcade mode... haven't played it, where death is not possible, but injury is.  This brings me to the 2nd issue I have with the game, I believe their should be a second mode, where both injury or death is possible (not always one or the other).Great game.  Hope to see more from the developer.Definitely recommend this game.10-4!"

How ever there is a dark side to this.....This game was released as a finshed product with more bugs than Orkin could handle. The bigger bugs that made gameplay impossable have been resolved, but the game still has a load of bugs... Instant spawns and disappearance, bad graphics, malfunctions, unknown sliding, bad car handling and menu freezes and more... After a while this all gets old to deal with, I even placed up a ""bug report"" video on youtube with the bugs, and bugs that Odin themseves denied exsisted. It took 9 video's in a bug report play list to show what exsisted, including what Oldin denied. At this time a update or fix has been promised for soon release, but that was months ago before summer of 2015. At this point and time the entire community including a modirator, is at war against Oldin without mercy. I belive I am the last one to turn, and for the longest time did support the game against the community including the modirator. Now I am with them against the game. Odin has brought up they were still working on the update, but have one guy, and crying about lost money as if it was our fault for releasing a unfinshed product calling it compleate. Maybe we at the community mis-understood that a game that has been released, is a finished product by Odin Logic, even if it dosen't work right or at all.  Because this update fix? lets face it, it is just a re-build of the game...I will mention it..  ---->looky here, some kind of Police sim Called Enforcer..I will advise it, ----> Since there are many that got refunds, get it on sale at its cheapest. Because once you get going, you will feel less ripped off at the sale price. Right now as it stands at $19.00 is a rip off, It is only worth $5.00 and that is just being nice..

However, it needs tons of fixes, those being;-Button mapping-Animation Fixes-Better driving-Could do with better graphics but right now theyre ok-more animation fixes- better weapon controlsLike I said this game is great but ever since the developer abandoned it, it has gone a bit down hill. If the developer would come back to the game and release more updates then I can guarantee that this would be a best seller among this genre. For now anyone wanting to support a good cop game should go support EmergeNYC. It's an open-world game that has been greenlit and is currently in development. I've been following them and so far they've shown wonderful skills and a cool representation of New York City. If you don't want to support them just follow the development and tell your friends about it."

Go figured they wanted to hide the negative review.  I was one of the first people to play this game, and I spent several months not only playing it, but being the sole community moderator.  Enforcer is an arcade-style game.  I honestly wouldn't even call it a simulator.  Yes, you play as a cop, you can pull people over, respond to calls, etc but the game is just terrible.  The graphics are bad, movement is bad, driving is bad, general physics is bad.  Essentially,EVERYTHINGabout this game is bad.For the first few hours you can enjoy it, but after that you realize how annoying the game actually is.  The AI is a joke!  The AI drivers are terrible, which reflects back on the developer for not making a decent AI.  Here's one example:  I pull over someone for running a red light and give them a ticket.  As soon as they leave the traffic stop, they do it again!  There was even one intersection where cars would always despawn coming from a certain direction.The worst part about this game is the developer and thee publisher.  Kaligus and Chris.  They try so hard to justify their inability to properly fix this game and make it worth $20.  Excuse after excuse.  ""Updates are coming."" Yet, here we are, one year later and only 3-4 updates have even been released.  Both of these people are purely incompetent.  When I was a moderator, I was the sole community-to staff interaction.  They essentially made me the public relations guy because they are TERRIBLE at talking to their community.  Since I stepped down, their communications with the communtiy has decreased to almost none!  When Chris does post, all he does is post linking to a topic that talks about an update.  Nothing else.Customization wise, you can change your lightbar to one of three options, but one of the lightbars has been broken since day one.You can choose from various different cars; from a Crown Vic to a Charger, to a Tahoe to an F150 to even a bike,You can use custom textures on vehicles that were created by the community.Finally, here's some basics.Positives:Very basic police sim.Option to use various cars.Ability to be good cop/bad cop.Negatives:Very little to no real interaction from the developer and publisher.  Community is often left in the dark.Game hasn't changed since day 1.Basic issues such as lightbar texture problem is still not fixed.Driving is very poor and arcadey, not simulation like.Ever since a recent update, the game has gotten much worse.Publisher often tries to downplay all negativity, which includes deleting negative posts.Rips off customers by making this very basic and very horrible game $20."

,Recommended,318220,12858649,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Partymaster,"If your looking for a good police simulator then look no further. This game(as it is still in development) provides almost all the policing experiences a cop could experience in his every day life. However there can definitely be some improvements to the game as far as exanding the map to be more of an open world sandbox and have additional CPU police to patrol around as well and maybe even multiplayer. This game has a huge amount of potential to be the best police simulator out there but it still needs quite a bit of work to get there with minor bugs and a little bit more of a relistic feel. What I mean by realistic feel is when you play the game everyone and everything gameplay mechanics wise seems to be robotic almost, the civilians almost seem like they have no life to them at all, they look like robots walking around and the driving is a little unrealistic in the sense that if a car runs into you, it doesn't harm you but it harms itself by somehow flipping over and going out of control. Like I said though, this game is a great simulator because of the wide variety of missions and calls that a normal cop would answer to in real life. The basic concept of the game is fantastic, its working out great as far as how policing is done so far. If your like early development games and policing then I highly recommend this game, however if you like a full complete game and not something in development then I suggest waiting a little longer before purchasing the game however the price of the game may increase like almost all games that are in development always do.My suggestions to you devs as far as making the game that much better is1-Multiplayer. Co-op multiplayer and maybe even VS Drug Lords VS Cops/Swat2-Implement more AI- patrolling around and busting bad guys and all is really fun but the lack of other police patrolling around and no backup seems a little unrealistic and a little dull, having a team to work with or maybe even command when your a high ranking officer can definitely spice up the gameplay and make it a lot more interesting.3- Implement S.W.A.T- Everyone loves swat...No question about it. Swat is a huge help during tight situations and if there was even an option to play as swat and just go on raid missions, breaching and clearing, taking out High Value Targets and etc. that would probably spike this games badassery up by a ton. Everyone loves that feeling of being a badass S.W.A.T with a team about to breach and clear or just go into an area to raise absolute hell. Implementing S.W.A.T AI backup in the game and even a S.W.A.T mode would just be awesome4- Connect the maps together to make one big sandbox- Instead of seperate maps, connect them! I think most people would prefer a sandbox rather than different sections, especially if the different sections of the maps can be really small in comparison to the main city.5- Implement more traffic violations- I've noticed that every time I pull over a car for blowing a red light or even crashing into another car yields no bad outcome whenever they are pulled over and traffic stopped. I always mistake pulling people over for blowing through red lights and think I'm going to ticket them but the game doesn't pay attention to them blowing red lights, implementing that would be pretty cool too.For all of those people reading this review all the way through good job! lol and thanks for reading. As for the Devs, nobodys expecting all these suggestions to happen in like one week, we can wait however don't blow the suggestions off otherwise the game will get dull very quickly because there is a lot more that you guys can add to increase the feel of being on the Police Force. Don't quit! This game has potential over all other police simulators to be the best because so far you can do a lot more in this game as far as policing than any other game made so far. You guys are doing a splendid job and I wish you the best of luck developing this game, I can't wait for the final product because if you guys can make it this good this early in development, you guys can definitely make it amazing with time. Don't quit! A lot of people will support this game to the end!"

You only get to buy 3 cars, and buying furniture for your house is nice, but not enough.

It would be nice if there was, and as we gain stress levels, the recoil becomes greater.7: Criminal AI is awful, they stand in one spot when trying to shoot you, instead of trying to get behind cover.8: We need more content, after you play the game for about 3 days, you have pretty much seen everything there is to the game. Give us more missions, more cars, more houses, more gun options, gun customization, a recoil system, partners, trucks, ect.9: It would be nice to have an actual Story Mode. This would entice us to keep playing and staying interested in the game. It mentions that your grandparents dont have much time to live, maybe you could play on that a little bit?10: MULTIPLAYER! The fun of this game would increse tenfold if we could play with a friend.I'll say this again, I love this game and want to see it grow. However it is very unpolished and until the problems listed above are adressed, I couldn't reccomend this game to just anyone. But if you could look past the problems, you just may find your new favorite game."

Sure, its graphics can be considered lacking, maybe around a more ps2 style, but that just means older pcs are welcome to join in on the fun. Driving is touchy, especially in the different models, but there are more than enough good moments in this game to keep a player coming back. The pedestrians are quirky, so it may seem lame to some, but I think it breaks up the repetitiveness of the game. Different things to do, such as setting up road blocks or speed radars, busting drug dealers who seem to always have a gun, serving warrants and more. This game isnt difficult to learn, and is a great time killer. I got on Steam sale for 9.99, and I would say that is the price YOU should shoot for.Pros-Variety of missions leading to different styles of gameplay.  (Laid back pulling speeders over, or gun ho, busting dealers)-Customizable clothes, cars, and house.  (Not a huge variety, but enough to set you a part)-Easy to learn-Tons of potential-Taser the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of someone.Cons-Outdated Graphics (Older systems welcome)-Touchy driving system-Lack of interaction with HQ, other officers, and other agencies.-Turning on/off car over and over-Turning on/off all your lights and your siren.-Gas and damage system are “iffy”7/10Would smoke a bowl waiting for speeders just to have the perp run on me so I can shoot them in the back with 10,000 volts."

The inclusion of family life as part of off duty activity and purchasing personal items adds in depth feel. overall graphics are quite good and more than adequate. Undoubtedly there will be a patch released in short order, which is rather common these days to address the glitches present.Revised: While the flaws in this were started as being addressed in an upcoming patch, it has sence been abandoned without any word from the developer.

In Casual mode though, there is no problem with Dispatch giving you calls.-Arcadish type game (You get points for completing 911 calls and arresting criminals as well as other police duties, all they do is count towards your rank as a police officer which is kind of pointless considering the only thing being a high ranking police officer provides is better pay. No rewards other than being a State trooper allows customizable vehicles.-Crime rate is way too high which leads to boredom of the game really really early, and leads to repetition, which is why people tend to only get about 9 hours in on average before never playing it anymore.I pulled over one drunk driver, only to have 2 more drive past me as I was getting out of my cruiser.Then another car sped past them in the oncoming lane going way over the speed limit, and meanwhile Dispatch telling me that there has been an assault in the area.FOR GOD SAKES I AM THE ONLY POLICE OFFICER IN THE ENTIRE GAME D: I can only do so much."

The creator really spent some time with and polished it up nicely, and put a lot of details in like customizing the vehicles, different incidents, and different missions to do. The driving is awful though. The vehicles have poor handling and are difficult to drive. Also, you have to manage stress, sleeping, and hunger levels in the game. To me, that's just a waste of time, I just want to play a cop simulator and not worry about the rest of that junk. To reduce stress, you have to go out with your mom, friends, etc. The game is a little bit more encompassing than I would have liked.

If Enforcer: police Crime Action was worth $5.00 i would buy it at that price because that is its true value especially with the lack of updates.

I then lost points and had to pay money to get my car fixed because this guy kept pushing my car down to 14%. I was pretty mad. Due to things like this I have only been able to get to a Sergent rank.

,Recommended,318220,15271106,"Posted: 8 April, 2015",all,Amaan,"At first I thought this game wasn't worth my £7.49 I payed for it. However, the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the ""Contacts"" menu, it says ""4+h"" when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a ""s"" on the end of words.Another issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...I am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.Right now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars.Overall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again...Once the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading."

This game has an offduty system which needs work. The game needs to tell you all the laws i have arrested people for valid offenses and lost points. Not to mention when off duty you have a bar that is time till you have to be off duty. Honestly of there is a sequal to this game that is well done and not rushed i would still buy it. But this game is a no go for the price it currently has. Also when you get shot at (which happens rarely) you shouldn't expact backup. This is becaise there is no AI police officers. Not even EMS that shows up. All you do is select an option on a radio for people who are hurt, sick, or shot."

(Could have been better for you to always be on duty, in my opinion.)-To go off duty, if you are in a remote region you must pass through other regions to get to the police station, you will get assigned rutine missions as you pass through each sector. This might not seem like a problem to you now but when you start to get into the game you will find it very anoying.-Firefights are very random, example: Stop a normal car on a rutine alchohol check, car stops, driver gets out and starts running away, i persue the driver through the streets, she stops, turns around and puts hands in the air, I tazz her (my bad) and she just pulls out a gun, pumps me full of lead and BUM!

As well, vehicle handling, in my opinion is nearly impossible. 0-150 KM/H in 3 seconds? and slowing down.... good luck braking from 150, because when you do, you will lose control of your vehicle, and likely hit a few cars, damaging your police car, forcing you to waste your earned in-game money, and losing score to call a tow truck to fix your car that was damaged beyond believe upon hitting a no parking sign. Until this update comes out, that was promised mid-July, but no notice has been given as to why, in early August, there is still no update. Unless the update covers the biggest issues I can find in this game, such as vehicle handling, ( which also makes it impossible to get into a good position to arrest drug dealers ) this game is lacking. As well, I have seen a few bugs so far, such as people walking over my police car ( yes, they litterally jump up, walk over the roof, down onto the hood, and keep talking on their cell-phones like nothing happened ) or stuck spinning around behind some vehicle they constantly keep walking into. You have alot of work to do devs, and if you ever manage to release the much-awaited, and promised update, I will be happy to revise my review. But until then, I do not recommend this game."

When I bought this I had expected they would bring me a reasonable 20 euros worthy product but what I got was a prodect that belongs either in early acces or in the ""below 5$"" section.As I started playing this game I thought ""seems to lead up to something"" but slowly as I played more I had grown to hate it. It offers very little freedom in what to do as you can do almost nothing at all. There's very little missions to finish and not even super mario for the nintendo 64 is more repetetive than this game.My typical day in a game like this is: I fill up the useless energy, food, and stress bar that are there for no reason by for one instance meeting up with friends (which you don't actually get to do, the screen just turns black for a moment) for no reason. I go to my closet and click on ""on duty"" below the 5 listed useless options of clothing you could wear when not on duty.  I walk out of my house and step in the car, look at the roads and see about 5 cars behind of each other of which 2 are halfway embedded into the ground, 2 are speeding in the most unrealistic way and 1 is driving like a total (ahum) ""r'tard"" because he/she is probably on alcohol.  I get a mission right away saying a drunk is behaving violently in the park so I go there with sirens and lights on. I drive over a steep mountain (cars in here are like horses in skyrim except they go 150 km p/h) and land on the dirt perfectly. I drive over a lantern pole (gta much) and get to the place. As always there is 2 witnesses and they describe the character, I see the exact matching description, walk up to the guy with my gun and turns out it isn't him, get a penalty for aiming at an innocent. I see the right person and walk up to them with a gun saying freeze and they pull a gun on me, by this time I start shooting the person and by 2 shots in the head the person lays down. Now apparently calling an ambulance will still work out. I get a bonus for shooting someone, and another bonus for shooting the ambulance.There is about a variëty of I think 10 missions intotal in this game and bare in mind that this whole story is a more action packed optimistic version of the actual game, in that way I am making commercial for them for over-appreciating how broken it is.Pro's:-You get to be a cop-Good concept-Driving is so broken it's funCons:-Repetetive-Looks like unfinished product (yet is not in early acces)-Anything you do in this game raises no excitement whatsoeverFinal judgement: 4/10Consumer recommendation:If you're a fan of the police and simulation thing do buy this game, you might actually enjoy it. (but don't get your hopes up) Best is to wait for it to go on sale. If this does not convince you here are some games that are cheaper and way better: Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Mount and blade : warband. These are games I think you might enjoy if this game drew your attention.Producer recommendation:Game should be placed under early acces if this is an unfinished product (and believe me it is). And if you do consider this product finished: Don't ask 20 euros for it, it's a far way from being worth 20 euros.[Update]Recent changes have been made in this game, bugs have been fixed and playing it is not a general dread. Yet as I keep thinking this game should not cost as much as it does, it did turn out into a good game.I did not expect the producers to adress any of the issues since it was never stated it was Early Acces, but I am glad they did it. This is a buy, but only if you like simulation combined with police.Final final recommendation: 6.5/10"

I tried really hard to love this game, and did at launch. However, it dawned on me just how little there is to do in the game. It also doesn't help that major things just as driving mechanics have not been addressed. Major features that were advertised seem to have no impact on game play, such as the stress mechanic. One issue I did notice was that when cycling through the graphics settings I was unable to go from ""ultra"" back to low, as the ""ultra"" setting would automatically crash the game on my PC. However, my computer is FAR from a top of the line gaming rig so I will not count that against the game; but it is something to keep in mind though.Overall, poor execution on a game that had a lot of potential, and honestly quite a bit of hype surrounding it all things considered."

With games like this, where there's such a high demand for ""Police Simulators"", there needs to be a lot of work done before releasing, and they definitely didn't put in that work.While the base of the game is good, most of the game is just spawning NPCs that walk, run when you get close, and then shoot at you when you press a control. The game is not dynamic, it's literally the same scenario over and over and over again just placed in different locations and vehicles.The vehicles provided have really bad handling, the models themselves are OKAY, but they're not where a game like this should be at. The lights are just spinning orbs placed on top of the vehicle model, meaning on top of the lightbar as well, so it literally looks like they're just spinning objects on top of another model.If this game was created right, I think it would be a very very good release, however, the unrealistic handling, the unrealistic scenarios, plus the graphics and design being below average really drive this game into the ground.At this point, I wouldn't think its worth anything near 19.99, I think if they wanted to sell this game, it should be 4.99."

A lot of people have been saying that his game has a great idea with poor execution. Customization here is pointless only to just make your house look better. Visuals? I could care less about visuals as long as they dont make it horrible to look at. Here is the problem though, animation quality is terrible and i do get that animations are hard to make. Another extremely major problem here is that this game is marketed as a finished product but what we are presented here is clearly not a finished product. This is not marketed as an early access game as it should be. Sound effects are pretty bad besides a couple that i really do enjoy. The radio sounds are the things i have a problem with because they are taken from somewhere else and used over and over and over and over and over again. Voice acting isnt terrible but there needs to be more of it. Now onto glitches. When cars hit people they dont die........WHAT!? I'm not kidding. People don't die when cars hit them. Rediculous..... Also when i serve a warrant on a suspect's house, if that timer runs out and you kick a door down in his/her home, you will lose career points. That is BS. I see the same modeled person sometimes 2-3 times in one area. There is also very little missions to actually do in this game. When suspects run in this game, they go about 20 yards away from me then do what they were doing like talking on the phone, when THERE IS A COP CHASING THEM. If I was a cop chasing a suspect, they would be running as fast as they could not trying to re-blend in to a small crowd where if i catch up to them again, they pull a gun on me, WTF. This happens literally every single time i chase down suspects like a robbery  suspect, or a man who assisted in murder. There is also no other police units as in you are the only cop around for the shift, you cannot call for backup in a big firefight. I wouldnt have a problem with any of these said things listed above if this game was marketed as an early access title which it clearly is not.

Looking for something like <Insert random word> Simulator 2014? Could give you some fun.Got off the bus near my house in the middle of the night, it's raining and I've just got a shirt and hotpants on, should've planned that better. Got a squad car in my rather crappy yard, suppose it's my colleagues wanting to greet me. Turns out it isn't, it's my own personal squad car with a never ceasing stream of chatter through the comm radio. Nevermind, I better go to bed instead. I enter my house and I feel the sudden urge to charge through the living room at full speed, I must've looked like a malformed gorilla with my freakishly large arms waving about. Oh well, at least no one saw me, I'll go to sleep now, wake up fresh for my shift tomorrow.I decide to take a cab to the station, seeing as I can't use the squad car in my yard. They all look funny at me when I arrive, I'm apparently not supposed to check in here at my shift, they tell me to just get changed back home and drive out, they'll assign me as I go. But they graciously enough let me check my e-mail on the computer and offer to sell me ammunition for 100 bucks. Seems kind of strange to me, at my previous assignment they equipped us with that kind of stuff for free. Oh well, note to self: Don't shoot too much.Once again I call the cab to drive me home. I check my wardrobe and there it is! My uniform, a handgun, a sub-machine gun and a tazer. Ready for all eventualities. I go out and enter my car, start it up and tries to back out the entrance to my rather crappy yard. This car handles like a rhino, at least when backing. But at least it accelerates quickly, I went from 0-110km/h in like 2 seconds. No one really cares when I speed past red lights on the sidewalk in 110. The perks of being a cop.First mission! Catch four speeders with the radar. Well that's ironic. Anyway, I drive out a bit away from town. If I should really call it town, more like a glorified block. I set up near a slope, that way they don't see me until it's too late. I go to get my radar and holey moley! There's tons of radars and cones in my car. I resist the urge to litter the entire area with radars and decide to just place two instead. That proves to be quite a difficult task though as the radar keeps falling over when I try to put it on the ground. After some effort and planning I manage to get a couple up anyway. A couple of people speed by, the radars automatically issues them a ticket, that's awesome tech. Suddenly this big freakin' truck comes wobbling across the road, I yell for him to stop the vehicle. He swerves into the side of my squad car and stops. I proceed to tell him to exit the vehicle and promptly does a breathalyzer test on him. He's clean. I'm pretty suspicious about the guy though so I ask for compliance, I frisk him and check his ID as well as the plates on the car. Nothing, he's clean, the truck is clean. Oh well, gotta let him go. It's not like I gotta pay the damage on my squad car by myself. Right?... Wrong. I call dispatch and they tell me to be more careful and charge me 600 bucks. I mean, c'mon.As I walk back to my freshly repaired car, dispatch calls about a kidnapping. I'm so all over that. I get in my car, blaze my sirens and drive around aimlessly. Where am I supposed to go? I start asking people if they've seen anything suspect. No one has. Dispatch calls again, says they have a possible location. 10-4. As I watch my GPS I realize that when I switch the settings from ""mini-map"" to ""overview map"", the map is rotated so they don't look the same. Very unintuitive gear they assign here. Oh well, I manage to find my way at least. I get out my car and draw my gun, I feel my adrenaline pumping. In panic I realize I can't crouch with my gun drawn, I simply can't! I'll have to manage anyway. I see them, a girl lying on the ground and a fat white guy just stands there, looking at me, before I get the chance to tell him to get on the ground, he pulls out a gun. I shoot him in the chest. He staggers but is still alive, he points the gun at me and I shoot him again, right in the chest. He staggers again but he's still standing! What kind of beast is this?! I pop off two more bullets in his chest and stomach. Still standing. One final shot and he's down. Mission complete. 200 points to me. I call an ambulance and they take both the perp and the victim away. No further investigation needed. That's efficient policework. I grab his gun from the ground and get back to stopping cars. There seems to be A LOT of drunk drivers here. One of them swerves right towards me, I panick, my life flash before my eyes and I prepare for permadeath. He crashes straight into me and comes to a complete stop, I didn't even flinch. Seems like I'm made of some tough stuff. I arrest him then I go home to sleep. Busy day."

The mechanics are a bit shoddy but ultimately functional 99% of the time so it's entirely playable for long periods without running into frustrating game breaking errors.  The graphics are comparable to The Sims zoomed into ground level, nothing impressive, but again it's tolerable.What stands out in this game is the wide variety of experiences and factors taken into account for each civilian and situation you encounter.  This game makes the effort to include experiences ranging from stopping people for speeding, broken lights, and swerving suspiciously to tracking a kidnapping or a drug dealer to a specific house, requesting a warrant, then searching the location for the potentially armed criminals and evidence lying around.Personally, I consider it worth buying for $15 or less if you're intrigued and don't mind the graphics or clunky physics of a small indie game."

Has its glitches here and there but nothing game breaking, just minor things that occure not too often. Has lower gaphics but that doesn't take from the game itself. Controls took a little getting used to but after about 15 minutes you pretty much get the hang of it.I hope the developers will continue to add to this game, it has a lot of potential. Would love to see more regions perhaps as ways to pick where you want to work, like a bustling city instead of just the rural area, perhaps some more buildings to go into, even while on duty like stores, restaurants, ect. Kinda like how real officers do, who eat while on duty or patrol stores. More interaction with NPCs while off duty would be nice, such as building relationships or stopping in at a friends house and actually going to clubs or restaurants. Hopefully they are working on these or will consider it now it's been said.But over all I give this game a 9/10 and a recommend."

Some really good ideas and has been well excuted for a game still in early development.Here are some things I'd like to see implemented in the game.-Have more variety of missions as you move up the ranks. As I've ranked up I am still getting the same menial tasks while on duty. I'd love to be able to do drug raids and busts as well look for clues at a murder scene etc.-Have the option to choose a career track. Have the ability to choose whether to become a SWAT team member or Homicide Detective etc.-Have more things to interact with and do while off duty. Have a bar or nightclub where the player can go for a drink to lower stress or even meet a partner to date and eventually move into your home.-Have bigger houses to buy-Have food places modelled indoors. This could work gameplay wise with robberies in progress happening inside the places or hostage negotiation situations.-Fledge out the precinct indoors a bit more. As you rank up you get your own desk. You could also have a meeting room where the chief tells you about a wanted criminal to track down etc.-More NPC variety. Once you pull them over and as you walk up to their car they could take off and start a pursuit. I also haven't encountered any of them who try to punch you, it's either they run away or draw a gun. There should be an inbetween.-Add new items like pepper spray or baton you can use on unruly NPC's and Spike Strips for speeding cars who are dangerous.The game is still in early development and I am sure the developers have a lot of plans for the game they want to implement. I am keen to see how this game pans out in the future :)"

Right now it has an excellent framework to build off of, but it does still need to be fleshed out a little bit, otherwise it's just small random missions. Kind of like in the game Spider-man 2 where once you finished the game you could just swing around town and help people as it randomly popped up, but there is no plot or story at this time. I think this game could absolutely be a stupendous game, and the gameplay is similar to GTA. In it's current iteration, I would give it 6 out of 10, just because it's really neat to be able to drive around town as a good guy. If they can get a story in this and plot, even a mediocre one, and possibly add cooperative multiplayer, it easily has the potential to be a 9 out of 10. If you like GTAs playstyle and you don't mind betting on a horserace, this is a good investment.Ps. Make sure you play it on realistic difficulty.

If you don't feel like doing calls you can do regualr traffic patrols too. This game has a lot coming to it, So I would give it a try."

It has all of the elements of the mod but into its own game and quite a nice one at that. The cars have different models and I like how you have a life outside of being a police officer as well.However, you have to carry out different tasks (such as eating and sleeping)  in order for your character to be happy. I dont really like this part of the game primarily because it takes up a lot of in-game time which leaves you with barely any time to explore. This makes the game feel like a mod for sims.Other than that feature, I actually really like the game! Stopping cars because of speeding or wreckless driving is tedious for some but I for one could play this for hours at a time! This may deter you from the game but so be it, if you get bored of repeating the same actions then you will get bored of this game!The game is great and really has potential of what could be added to it like multiplayer, such as ""cops and robbers"" themed games.

It's not that it's just completely horrible, it's not. However, the game controls are really hard to use and the movement/action of the character is not smooth by any twist of the word. I just find it so aggravating and tiresome trying to play this game because my character ends up doing things I don't want him to do or I can't figure out how to do something.On the flip, the idea behind the game is good. I like the police simulation theme and a lot of the ideas behind traffic stops, speed traps, responding to calls, etc. is really cool. But when I spend the whole (in-game) day trying to do only one of those, the game needs some work. I'm sure if you put enough time and effort into this game, you may get good at it and might actually enjoy it but the learning curve is crazy with this game.

Without further developing (by the devs, or by highly skilled modders) this game gets too repetitive to play.  When on duty there're some serious, but acceptable shortcomings.  But off-duty is the most un/under-developed ""game"" ever, which is highly unacceptable for a ""finished"" product.  Still enjoyable for a few hours of play each month (until you remember just how bad the off-duty game ""mechanics"" work).  As a whole I'd give this game a 2/10, if I separated this into 2 games for ""on-duty"" and ""off-duty""  On would be probably 6/10, while off is a resounding 0.This IS a released game, not a greenlight, don't be mistaken.  They are still adding new features (which isn't something a COMPLETE game should need... this is a functional alpha test that's being called full by the devs) so maybe eventually it will become a worthwhile game.Edit:  It seems the dev team has stopped working on this game, so it is being left in a entirely incompleted state.

This is a game where you can actually drive on patrol and do traffic stops and take calls etc. There are not many police games out there where you can do these kinds of things. Most of them are first person shooter games. I like how Enforcer Police Crime Action allows us to do these things because there are not many games like this. The only other police games that I can think of that allow us to do these things are, True Crime New York City, Police Force and Police Quest.  It is nice to finally have a good police simulator type of game like Enforcer Polic Crime Action. There are however some things with the game that should be improved and that is, The Missions, They seem to be the same thing over and over again and the grapics and pedestrian models copuld also be improved. Im not ssaying that these things are terrible, Im just saying they could be improved. From What I hear this game was made by 4 people so you have to give them credit. i think that with time and some more work in the game that it can get better. i give this game a 7 out of 10.

THey built a good foundation and then killed it before they did any updates or upgrades to make it really good. Lame.Bought it yesterday and have been avoiding the family ever since. Loving it so far. Lots of room to explore. I like customizing the house and just tooling around looking for infractions. Missions are pretty good too.A few things though. Right now, since this is in Alpha there isn't much diversity in the things to do. Customizing the house, other than buying a tv and sofa seems to do nothing for you. The missions can be a little repetitive and occasionally you'll get 5 missions in a row and other days you'll get nothing. Controlling the car can be a little tricky but not too bad. For some reason, almost everyone on the road is drunk which makes it easy to find bad guys and level up.Putting these things aside and remembering that this is a brand spanky new game, it is a great bit of fun with infinite potential. If you want a realistic view of police life, I have to think this is a pretty good simulation that will keep getting better.By the way, the developers just posted pics from the next update on their Facebook page... looks like we're getting a police motorcycle soon :)"

Here is my report of the first two days.Day One:I started the shift out finding illegal parked cars and writing tickets.  I spent about two hours (game time) doing this when I received a call from dispatch stating there was a report nearby of two people vandalizing a building.  I then turned on my lights and sirens and sped to the location where the report was.  At first I did not find anything as I approched people to gather more information two indvidivauls, a male and female, began to run from me.  I pursued the male on foot calling out to him to him that I was the police and to stop!.  After about a 20 mins foot chase (game time) He finally gave up and I found drug paraphernalia on him and subsequently arrested him.  I radioed dispatch for a van to come take him away to jail.  I then went back to the scene of the crime and found the female not too far away.  She gave up immediately.  I took her into custody and transported her back to the police station.End of shiftDay 2:I started off doing speed traps on a rural road for about 3 hours (game time) when I got a transmission from dispatch about a theft that just occured.  I turned on my lights and sirens and arrived at scene to a crying female.  I interviewed her and she gave me an accurate discription of the suspect that took her purse.  I subsequent search of the area I found the male traveling west on the southern most road of town.  I stopped him and idetified myself and he gave up.  I found drugs and further evidence on this subject.  I arrested him and took him to the police station.  After I cleared I noticed a car traveling and a high rate of speed and swerving back and forth.  I activated my lights and sirens and pulled over the car.  The driver was IDed and found that there was problems with his documentation.  I tickted him and cleared the traffic stop.  I then received a call from dispatch of suspcious drug actvity in town.  I then arrived and found the suspected person in the middle of a park.  I walked slowly towards him and IDed myself as a police officer.  The defendeant then pulled a firearm on me and shot twice.  I pulled my service weapon, shot and killed him.  I then called an ambulance to come and clear the scene.9/10  Would kill drug dealers againRe-Edit to the trolls* To those trolls who say 1.8 hours.

You just have to go into it with an open mind that it is still in the works, otherwise all the bugs will irritate you. As of now, everything is pretty routine.  As of now, it's like a mobile game, in the respect that it is just sort of a time killer. Not something you will spend all day playing, but it is fun for a few hours.If you like 3rd person games, and a police simulator that is actually pretty in-depth, I do suggest picking this up. Hopefully, it can only get better. They have already patched some irritating issues, like the invisible jumps in the middle of the road that send you into the sky for a meet and greet with jesus christ himself.What can you do?1.) Stop cars and check registration / Administer breathalizer2.) Use NYC's stop and frisk policy on random people walking3.) Wait for a call for a suspected murderer, vandalizer, thief, or assault.4.) Set up a radar and sit back collecting 30pts per speeder.5.) Go home, pay $5 to your fridge to eat, take a shower, watch tv, go to sleep.6.) Rank up with points, which unlocks free new cruisers. (Better top speeds.... Goodluck staying on road and stopping.)The main bugs that hurt are:The randomly disappearing objects, such as a person you are in a foot chase with, or a car that you are attempting to stop. (Mainly because it gets out of range when you try to turn around your charger that steers like a battle tanker)Random gun jams on your weapon. The gun sometimes just doesn't fire, which leaves you clicking fast and sometimes unloading a full magazine into somoenes face.You cannot relieve stress fast enough.

I'd like to see a little more variety in tasks. It'd be good to iron out a few little visual bugs - like when someone gets out of a vehicle - there's still someone sitting inside, or when you tell someone they're free to go, and they still stand there gormlessly. An auto-rest option would be good - as it's pretty repetitive at the end of a shift to have to go home and watch the tv 4 times. The directing traffic option does nothing other than make you look silly.It's a good base game - has a lot of positives going for it - but if ever there's a version 2 - could do with a lot of improvement. If you just like the idea of cruising around in a police car issuing tickets and catching drunks, it'll keep you happy."

,Not Recommended,318220,33333002,Posted: 6 July,all,Isaiah53six,"MY REVIEW WILL BE FOR THE GAME PRICED AT $5In light of the fact most reviews for this game have been negative (due mostly to developer abandonment) I had extremely low expectations for this game.  I should note that I was able to purchase this game for $5 with a steam sale.   Now after playing the game for over 10 hours I have decided this game needed some perspective.WHY DID I VOTE THIS DOWN?Simply because I believe it is overpriced at $20 for the content and quality (or lack thereof) of content you receive.  Simple put, this game has been abandoned by it's developers, it's not complete and is therefore not worth more than $5.   The rest of my review is for a $5 game.OVERPRICED GAMEAs I have already stated, since the developers seem done improving this game,  I don't believe the game is worth more than $5 in its current state. The main reason is its age.  This is a dated game with minimal features compared with today's standards in games. If you can get at a low cost, it's probably worth it.WILL YOU LIKE THIS GAME?I think it mostly depends on you. Everyone is different so it depends on what types of games you enjoy playing.  If you find yourself still interested after you have read this review AND can get it for a low price, I would recommend it.THE GAME'S GOT NOSTALGIC CHARM:If you have ever played Police Quest from the 1990's, this game reminds me of an open world, updated version of that with some tweaks.  I enjoy the old 1990's sim style games which this game vastly improves upon.  For me this game is a simpler form of Police Quest III: The Kindred without the story-line or the updated vehicle abilities.   For me, Nostalgia is the biggest reason for why this game is fun to play and definitely worth my time.GRAPHICS:The graphics are NOT the latest and the greatest but it gets the job done, especially if you like nostalgia police sim games.   The sounds of the police car siren are great and the lighting options are nice!  I have found the game as a whole a relaxing break from the usual high energy, fast paced shootout style games of today.  In this game, you are given the choice of patrolling at leisure which involves random police procedures and also given choices to participate or ignore missions and calls as they occur.SOME GAME TWEAKING/MODDING IS POSSIBLE:What many reviewers have failed to note is that this game can be tweaked (ability to change in game costs, money, levels etc.) in the source file folder which makes this game slightly better  (and playable) especially if you like messing with settings.  Many of the annoying game limitations (such as time on duty and off) and other event/callouts settings can be altered!KNOWN GAME PROBLEMS AND THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:Be aware that there some noticeable graphical bugs in the game although  I haven't experienced any complete game crashes yet.The AI car speed is too slow (30mph) and vehicle steering mechanics are not very good especially if compared with modern driving games.Cars will get stuck at intersections causing wrecks, your personal car can lock up if you try to use the siren/lights and sometimes people will appear to respond until a correct procedural order is followed according the game requirements.  In my experience this didn't occur often but it can become frustrating trying to get someone to get out of their car or to get them to stop their car.MORE ITEMS OF INTEREST AND ENHANCEMENTS THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE GAME:Sometimes an AI person will shoot at you but since aiming  can be difficult you will be shot.    A better aiming system could be implemented (a further aiming shooting ability) would help with this.The actual game city is quite small and bland (no people actually inside the buildings).  The city could be expanded or even have multiple cities which would make this game greater.It is worth noting that there is quite a bit of terrain to cover now.The police station cannot really be entered.  Entering a police station and exploring it would make this game even better.The game doesn't have fast travel capabilities as modern games do (unless you use the taxi off duty only).The map could be integrated instead of broken up into sections.AI driving needs improvement.There should be other police cars, more random AI traffic and less people walking around.Ability to customize character (skin color, person, clothes,uniform) would enhance the game even more.There should be a police backup option.Full Xbox controller support TOGETHER WITH the keyboard would help.  (Although there are ways around this through third party controller apps)There are many more possible improvements for Enforcer but as it stands as a low budget Indie game I have enjoyed what it offers at the $5 price point."
