76561197977974467,Not Recommended,318260,13921030,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Martha Kiffmeme,"I can see what they were trying to do.  Make a game where you start doing the busy work and work your way up where you are managing employees and then regions, etc.  The problem is this game fails at almost every level.* Pizza making: almost no feedback telling you what you're doing right or wrong.* Delivery mini-game: Horrible controls, frustating ""physics"".* Managing employees: boring.* Managing stores:  Supposedly there is competion, but from what I can tell they don't actually do anything.* Events: Occasionally there are events that happen, but they have little more impact on the game than Monoply Chance cards.In the later game, you're mostly sitting around sending employees on vacation, wating for more money to buy another store.  There's just a lack of anything to do in the game other than make rude shapes using the pepperonis.------------------------------------ Re tried the game 2015-01-16 after the new patchHere's what's improved:* Pizza making: Customers' tolerence for what constitutes ""lots of"" or ""a little"" ingredient is much relaxed so you don't have to experiment by counting ingredients anymore.* Pizza prepartion: There is now an extra step in making a pizza which involves timing the cooking phase.  This adds to the challenge when multitasking.* New inventory system:  Having a new system to play with is good and adds some depth to the game.Here's what's not improved:* Delivery mini-game: The driving still my least liked part of the game.   I think the biggest problem is when driving fast, it doesn't feel fast, so when you hit a curb at 50mph it seems like the car unnecessarily launches into the air.  Also, I didn't mention this before, but the sound the car makes is unpleasant to the point I turn off the sound, especially so when one of the wheels is off the ground.* Customer Feedback:  Customers are still strangely vague about what they didn't like about a pizza.  Saying that a pizza didn't have enough toppings on a pizza with 5 ingredients doesn't help much identifying how to make a better pizza.  It would be better if the customer could comment on the ingredient that was most wrong (e.g.  ""There wasn't enough cheese."")* Allow Employee boxes:  This new feature seems to be there to encourage players to fill orders themselves and/or get to the part of the game with store managers.  Either way, having to click a box every time I want an employee to interact with an order gets old quickly.  If I ran a real pizza shop and had to tell the employees to work on every individual order, I'd go insane.  I think this could be made better by allowing the player to promote a manager on acquisition of the second store rather than the third.* Cooking an order: There's a new icon that appears on the left part of the screen when an order is being cooked.  But the icon isn't associated with the the order screen, so if you have two orders cooking, it's guess work to determine which order to click ""Perform"" on to stop cooking it.  Having the cooking graphic on the order line itself would fix this confusion.* Costs: With the addition of ingredient purchasing, money management becomes much more important, however there is almost no control of costs or prices.  As far as I can tell, the only direct control of my money I have is what I pay employees and optional purchases (advertising, events, etc).  Ingredients, once upgraded into them, must always be stocked; so you can easily get into an unrecoverable state where the cost of ingredients out-paces your income.  It would be nice to be able to turn off the ingredient upgrades.  Also it would be nice to have a daily summary of costs and income, e.g. Sales, Tips, Wages, Ingredients, Store costs, penalties, advertizing, etc.* Advertising:  I have no idea what affect this has on the game or how to decide what the sliders do.* Managing employees:  No changes with employees.  Paying them and sending them on vacation is about all you do here.  Employees are basically duplicated drones differentiated only by job and a rating of skill.  Training seems pointless when a beginner can become a master in the matter of minutes naturally.  There's no strategy needed when dealing with them, so it just feels like a chore.* Later game:  There still doesn't seem like much here, just more of the same.  Have I just not played enough, is there a new mechanic after getting into new regions?I'd say, overall the updates to the game are in the right direction, but I still cannot recommend the game.  I wish the developers the best and hope those that do like this game continue to enjoy it."

The gist of the game is throwing on toppings, and driving through a small town in a car that's hard to control. Also, I hit a glitch after flipping my car, where my shop consistently lost $-7 a second, and made me up to -$15,000 in debt until I rage quit."

I had been looking forward to playing it for a while, but I found the gameplay mechanics to be too frustrating to be fun. My main problem is with the pizza making, it takes way too long to make the correct pizza orders, having to click and count each ingredient 20-40 times when you have 4 ingredients on just one pizza (and orders often have multiple pizzas) just isn't fun. I wasn't that impressed with the rest of the game either, upgrading ingredients and delivering pizzas which I was looking forward to, got old quick. I can see that some people like this game, but if you're a perfectionist like me and want to make perfect orders, I don't think this is for you."

It seems like no matter what you do, you always put on too few toppings. There doesnt' seem to be any indicators of how much is ""a lot"" of pepperoni or ""a little"" either, so no matter how much or how little I put on, the customer feedback was the same, -- ""Did you even bother to put on any toppings?"" Very frustrating.Then you have to deliever the pizzas yourself, at least at the beginning, which is harder than it should be. There's an AI arrow telling you where the house is, but it doesn't actually tell you where to go. It tells you ""as the crow flies"" where the house is, which may or may not be where an actual road is. This results in a lot of missed deliveries because you flip your car over or crash into a house because you turned where it was indicating but it ended up being a dead-end. In this modern world of GPS, you'd think they coud've put something a little more accurate like that in the game (maybe it's an upgrade later in the game, who knows...)Eventually you do earn enough upgrades to hire employees, which significantly improves your customer feedback (since the computer is now making the pizzas and delivering them for you). Still this quickly becomes a very tedius repetitve thing where all you're doing is clicking on ""Yes, employee, please make this pizza for me...."" ""Yes, employee, please deliver this pizza for me...""I feel like this game wasn't sure what it was trying to be. This either needs to be a more functioning simulation that gives you feedback on how to improve your pizza making skills or it needs to be a more automated tycoon-style game that you don't have to remind your employees every single time to start the pizza, deliver the pizza, etc.I played this for about 2 hours. I finally ended up with several employees, and didn't think I was doing too terribly when one case of food poisoning put me out of business. Instant game over with no way to get back any of your progress. Sooooo frustrating. I definitely won't be playing this again."

This one really falls short. I'm actually surprised to learn that this isn't an early access game.- UI needs a lot of polishing. There's literally a part of the interface where if you have nothing selected, a screen just reads ""NO.""- Parts of the game occasionally freeze/lock up. There's about a 50% chance that when I see one of the ""clean up for the health inspector"" minigames that it'll freeze in some way or not count down the game tmer.- The parts of the game that should be fun, like making orders, are more tedious than anything and it's very difficult to measure if you're improving on your pizza making skills at all or if it's just a total crapshoot on whether or not you get a perfect order. It just generally results in you having characters perform all tasks for you and you just click/drag icons to people's faces.- It just feels very clunky and unfinished. Hard to describe, but it has that very general ""this game is not done"" feeling.- Delivery part is the most fun, but the navigation is weird, the map doesn't show your destination, and as you buy car upgrades the cars seem to actually get worse in terms of handling and helping with perfect orders. Who would've thought that hitting the breaks on your car would flip it frontwards, implying that the pure stopping force of your breaks is stronger than the pull of the earth's gravity on your car/it's weight. aka upgrading your car turns it into tissue paper.- It's too easy. I found myself able to purchase every single upgrade every single day without having to choose any tradeoffs or have to play the game more to save up for things. But, with the way this game plays, that actually seems to be a benefit.I seriously love all food related games and really wanted to love this game, but it's just hard for me to play more than 15 minutes at a time without getting bored with the game mechanics & feeling like it's missing something."

I saw this is about building an empire, you get to expand your stores, there's mini quests involving mafia, there are competitors, and you make your own pizza.Sadly after playing this for a bit I realized the two games are nothing alike, and comparing the two really makes this feel unfinished. Despite some patches that improved previous complaints, things still could be better.For example, one of the quest is to make X amount of 'perfect order', which involves perfect cooking, and perfect delivery. But despite the in-game feedback telling you the food was cooked perfectly, you still do not get the credit. And to achieve 'perfect delivery', it requires you to complete the task within 1/2 of the allotted time, and isn't possible unless you are breaking traffic laws by driving 70+ mph, going through sidewalks, running red lights and driving in the incoming lane, which seems rather ridiculous and breaks the in-game SoD quite a bit."

Then I got to the level where I had employees and 3 pizza places, and realized that now the game was what I was more interested in, a management sim where I could go in store if I really wanted to.Once I've played a bit more I will give a fuller review, but for now I would reccommend it ONLY if you want a management sim, if your looking for a pizza restaraunt game forget it."

,Recommended,318260,13941526,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Grinf4ce.at,"This is my updated Review on Supreme, as there where several changes on the gameplay and I dont want to have an outdated review (You can read the original Review here:http://www.pastebin.ca/3027775.).The updated review below is related to the Major Release on June 11th.I will only go on new changes/improvements which are related to the latest build. You can read the full review below.Review Result or TL;DRI can recommend this game. It makes quite fun for short-game sessions.The developers did improve some weak points during last updates.Strong Points:+ Concept Idea is nice (You get order, you craft the food, you deliver them).+ Different Food with different Toppings.+ Random Events (Mafia, Flashmob, Poisoned Food) where you need to take a decision with good/bad impact on you.+ Feedback what you did good/bad during creation of food.+ Improved Driving-Expierience during Delivery-Mini-Game.Weak Points:- Currently none (as not parts of the game where re-played).Supreme - Updated Review (14th June)1.) TutorialThe tutorial is still clear written and easy to understand.A strong improvement in new version is to give advises at the end of ""Food-Creation""-Process, regarding the topic ammount and likes of the customers.This makes it more easier to build a ""perfect"" pizza.2.) Technical: GraphicsIn my last review I concerned, that there is no life in the delivery-city and no day/night-cycle.I was surprised during my last game session. The city looks very nice! The textures got updated, the city environment got improved. Day/Night-Cycle implemented.2.) Technical: SoundNo change since my last review.3.) Technical: ControlsThe controls during the delivery got improved.4.) Lets Play: Working in ShopSince the last updates, this point got improved. The orders comes now via phone, computer or smart-tv. You will get feedback during the food-creation process what you did good and what not (in regards to the topics on pizza/sub/..). This makes it more easier to understand what means ""little"" and what means ""a lot"". Anyway, it needs some experience to do it perfect, but the game now supports you a little bit.You have now a short period of time to do the job by yourself or assign it to one of your employees. The employees have an energy bar. You need to send them for a break, otherwise they will burn-out and quit ther job. In case of some employee quits / or get fired, you will automatically get another one. During my 1h session, I did not find any possibility to upgrade the single employees. Maybe it is implemented and I did not found the corresponding menu.Anyway, as this is unconfirmed and will not be have any impact on the review-result.Currently, I cant give any feedback for the multi-store-feature (Tycoon Mode?) as I did not reach the possibility to do this.At the end of the day, you need to buy new ingredients stock. Otherwise the customers will call you to get disappointed because their favorite food is out of stock.5.) Lets Play: Deliver the FoodStrong improvements on this part of game.Controlling the car is more precise and easier. The borders got removed, so you can drive across the walkway without your car get flipped (btw it is still possible to flip it - but another way). If your car flips, you can reset it and will get put onto your wheels again instead of the delivery failed.You still not need to consider the road traffic act, but as the time seems to be shorter than previous, and the car dont flip on walkways, this makes more fun!After delivery, you will get a good overview of the delivery-stats and the store reputation will increase/decrease.6.) Lets Play: Upgrade your shopUnlocking ingrediences, sides and cars is remain unchanged.The store-tier upgrade seems to be offered automatically during the game (after some days).The update makes it possible to hire employees (during my game-session only cooks/drivers).It is now possible to get multiple orders when the reputation is high enough (makes it more easy to put enough workload on your employees).Maybe I dont found appropiate menus, but it seems that the company upgrades such as advertisment got removed (unconfirmed).7.) Lets Play: Manage your shopI was not deep enough in the gameplay of new version to give a review about this.There are still funny and new random events where you need to take decision.Anyway, when I checked the last updates, it makes quite fun to play the game. So I will change the recommendation from No to Yes for this current Build.As soon as I continue playing my savegame and check the multiple-store-feature, I will update this review again.If you have any questions, please come back to me.Best regards,Grinf4ce//Edit 1:Added TL:DR section."

,Recommended,318260,13967455,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,kkddpp33,"The game starts off very slowly.  You're the only employee in your pizza business, so it's your job to both make the pizza and deliver it.  You choose your toppings (very limited at first), manually place them on the pizza, then hop in the car and WASD deliver it to a green area in a city.  You have an ample time limit to deliver in.  It seems like the only danger is flipping your car if you brush up against a curb during a turn, which automatically forfeits your delivery.  Other cars driving on the roads will stop if you cut in front of them, so it seems like you would only hit them if you were trying, or were very reckless.After you've delivered a few pizzas, you get to buy some upgrades.  First toppings (olives, bell peppers, ham, etc), then sides (pasta, garlic bread), and eventually shop employees.  You can upgrade to hire chefs, drivers, and janitors.This game's speed is absolutely exponential.  Where the pizza deliveries initially drag on, once you make your first hires, it starts to explode.  Suddenly the game is about pizza shop management instead of pizza order fulfillment.  You can then unlock additional shops and regions, and you can keep tabs on your competition's stores.  You can hire managers to watch over your employees' productivity and wellbeing, then hire regional managers to supervise those managers.It was almost too hard to keep up after I made the poor choice of unlocking all the regions at once and opening a store in each - expansion strategy is definitely important in this game.You'll have employees who quit because they're overworked, along with kitchen fires, political decisions, mafia proposals, etc. that show up in a small event feed in the upper right hand corner.I'm definitely not done playing this game, but I thought I'd jump in and provide a review while the sale is going on.As for my opinion: yes, definitely buy this if you like sim games.  The devs are obviously still engaged in improving the game and you should be able to get several hours of play out of it.  However if you lack patience, this may not be the game for you.  There are quite a few pizzas and deliveries to make before the game scales up to the management aspect.TL;DR - 7.5/10 would recommend, but devs are involved so that number will go up as they respond to comments.  Gotta have patience as your store grows.  Don't run into the curb.  If your employee is slacking, fire them."

It's just a chill game about running a pizza shop! I would compare it to Lemonade Tycoon or Game Dev Tycoon, but even more in depth. Not only do you run pizza shops, you get to MAKE the product you're selling. I did a video though if you would like to see how these elements actually play out. :)http://youtu.be/NAvtxgakRLYThe scenery looks awesome, the gameplay mechanics are easy to learn and it's a lot of fun. I think this is one of those games that simply isn't meant to be taken too seriously. As I always say though, do some research before spending your money. :)"

If you're too lazy to read what this games all about then at the bottom there will be a TL;DR.THE MAIN GOAL:The main goal of ""Supreme"" is to run a successful pizza industry so successful that everybody sees your pizza and the most superior, or get shut down (or possibly DIE) trying.THE BEGGINING:Supreme is a pizza buisness tycoon. It may be new and the graphics may not be all that great, but the game is very fun to play. In this little slice of heaven, you start by naming the CEO (you), the company's name, and the company motto. At the beggining, you will have a horrible pizza joint set up, you will be the only employee, and nobody knows who or what you are. You will have to deliver the pizzas yourself when you don't have any drivers, but delivering was personally quite fun for me. The driving physics can be a little wonky at times, but it could also be pretty humorous. Random events will happen including the Mafia which could make your progress either very difficult or very easy. What you decide to do for these events will either be good or bad. The neat thing about this game is that everytime you decide something, there is a random chance of it being good or bad. Certain events only occur at certain times with certain stats set, while others happen at random. Since no janitors are hired, you will have to clean the restraunt manually whcih cost $10 every time you clean it. Making pizzas can be very difficult for some, once you get used to it, making pizzas will be super easy.THE MIDDLE:After awhile (2-3 hours on average), you will be getting to the point where you have bought employees and have bought some other restraunts along with some regions. Employees get unhappy if you don't send them on vacations to regain energy or give them a raise here and there. Sometimes employees will make customers mad because they cooked their food wrong or sometimes they will get lazy. If this happens, you can fire them, or make them more happy and productive and possibly send them for training. Employees are very usefull after a while, at the beggining they're useless since the orders can be done faster yourself. Your employees can go on strike, or you could fire them to make things strict around your company. Other restraunts can be bought after a little while into the game, and other employees can be hired there. The global map is represented with a pizza, pretty cheesy if you ask me. Other restraunts become vital to completing your main goal, but there's another vital part of becoming the main place to go for pizza around the globe, which is ofcourse, REGIONS! Regions are used to increase the area where you can build. The government will get angry at you if you try to build yourself a little monopoly so don't just buy out on the world that quick, or be at risk of being shut down. If you have noticed by now, you will be getting alot of more events depending on if your reputation is high or low. If it is high, kids might think twice about prank calling you and vandalizing your restraunt. If your reputation is low, you might get a phone call from your wife telling you that a bunch of kids left decapitated rabbit corpses on your lawn (yes, stuff like that happens). If you ever decide you jump into politics and help a guy become president, things can go two ways, he could be a good guy, or a bad guy. If you accidently (or purposly) got a bad president elected, people will hate you for supporting him.THE END:After a while (a LONG while), you will make it to the top. Once up at that point in the game, you can continue to deliver pizzas... for ever... and ever... and ever... and ever... but hey, you can start over and experience a new journey, and do things you didn't in your last playthrough!TL;DR?:9.5/10A very good pizza buisness tycoon which has replayability, the only downside is the graphics which for me, doesn't matter."

Should have more options later on though considering the money will be rolling in.My managers kept quitting with no notification and ofcourse the regional managers did not rehire."

I had hoped of starting my own pizza company, working my way up through the ranks of the local pizza shops.. Boy was I wrong..I've gone bankrupt, I've had to take out loans, I've wrecked my car 150 times and I've had to sell my kittens...If you buy this game, expect to rage at some point.. but but but, the main thing to remember is: ""Love the rage"". The game is great from the start and you'll have loads of fun with it. I haven't gotten fully into everything yet but it is a good game and worth playing it through to see what happens.9/10 ~ Needs more Ducks."

This game really hits home with me. The music, the quality ingredients, every single detail is a mirror image of life in a pizzeria! I am telling you, the delivery missions are probably the most fun I've had playing a game.. ever. The customer interaction is accurate (You have no idea what you're doing and they're yelling at you because of it) Ultimately I would reccomend this game, but not the actual pizza man lifestyle!Edit: They changed the driving mechanics, the ai doesn't stop at red lights anymore, the update somehow made the map look worse than it did originally and it just all around doesn't feel like the same game it used to. I'm done makin pizza"

Froze a couple of times too on random events like the health inspector and roach killing.Pizza topping - 5/10Driving a flipping sedan - 0/10Asking a refund on steam - 10/10"
,Not Recommended,318260,29937366,Posted: 15 February,all,Hollena,"I probably shouldn't be a delivery driver IRL....Car controls were clunky and I kept loosing money to failed deliveries on this game. Crashed way too much, more than I want to admit. Pizza sauce looked very odd, more like an object than a sauce. I am a very big fan of time management/strategy games but I can't recommend this one."
