I knew I would love this and after playing for around ten minutes it is exactly what I wanted it to be.This game is pretty much a brilliant modernization of interactive fiction games of the past.Think Zork if it was multiple choice instead of parser (type words) interface. This creates a friendly modernization of the genre that is all too welcome.The game itself is awesome. It is old school and self aware of its own absurdity. You work at the demonic law firm of Varkath Nebuchadnezzar Stone, you will try to stay ontop of your student debt, and even manage your love life!If you're on the fence just check it out! It is a great adventure that is also reasonably priced. It reminded me today just how great the imagination is."

I realized, though, that this one was extra special when I noticed I was replaying it for the 4th time in a row. While the others are a blast, I rarely replay them, and have never replayed one as much as this one(except Choice of Robots, go play it now if you haven't). This one is exceptionally written, and if your a book worm like me, and really 'get into' the story and 'transport' yourself there, you'll have a freaking blast. I even name my character my real life name just to add to the immersion, and I recommend this for any Interactive Novel, it really adds to the fun.

And it delivers with stunning success.Everything about how this game is written is fantastic. There is rapier wit to spare in the clever dialogue, narrative and general premise, the characters are written exceptionally well, and the descriptive writing makes the absense of visuals a moot point; your imagination, from the visual cues indicated, is the most effective tool.The story is quickly paced and never stagnates. Exposition is kept to a minimum and you make decisions frequently and often. Speaking of decisions, the choices you make in this game DO influence so much about the story and the characters and how everything ends. It feels like this could be your story, though the protagonist is probably a good deal more clever than you.It's just an absolute riot, a delight to read, and you're guaranteed at minimum 2 hours on a single playthrough, and if you see those achievements you can tell there are MANY directions you can take the game. I'm gonna go for a replay soon enough!For this pricepoint? It's an absolute steal. Highest recommendations."

This is far more sophisticated. This is a beautifully constructed game that takes a fun format and brings it to the next level. The story is completely engrossing, I couldn't turn the game off, it was that engaging. The writting is immersive and a pleasure to read, the choices are well constructed and satisfying (with just the right amount of humor thrown in), and the world is unique and intriguing. I was sad when the game was over, I wanted to explore the world more.I'd also like to note that I found no offensive content in this game during my play-through: nothing sexist, racist, homophobic--in fact it is very easy and satisfying to play as male or female, gay, straight or bi, and the race of your character is never mentioned or assumed. The cast is also racially diverse, which was a pleasant surprise. I never found the experience awkward or felt that it was only intended for a specific type of player. It's so uncommon to find a game that seems to be constructed for everyone to enjoy, but I think Choice of the Deathless has made it happen. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and look forward to playing other titles by this developer."

So many possibilities, so many ways it could have gone wrong or right. The replayability is amazing due to the amount of choices you make through the seven years you are with the firm before the final choices (yes, the final CHOICES) reveal themselves. Everything you do effects how the game ends. For me I had five choices, and I am sure there are a ton more possible, but honestly, I got the ending that I most wanted out of it all. By the end, I was happy. Everything went the way I wanted it. All because of the first choices I made in the game, then stuck with my guns, made some choices that I felt right, even if they contradicted my best interests.

,Recommended,318310,12073035,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,♫Quilly Shiba,"Choice of the DeathlessChoice of the Deathless is a choose your own adventure type text-based adventure. As the store page mentions, you can choose your gender and sexuality without this affecting anything in the storyline, and thus you start your journey working at a “law firm” dealing with demons and other beings that exist in this world.Quickly you have to get used to your new work environment, and choose how you budget your expenses (Live downtown but pay high rent? Give yourself less pocket money?) These choices don’t affect the story at all as far as I can tell, maybe unless you either go broke or completely pay off your student loans, none of which I’ve done yet (I went for a neutral path moneywise).You get to meet a variety of characters, some colleagues, some superiors, some clients, human, demon, and others. What you choose to say and how much time you choose to hang out with them affects your friendships and possible romance with them, which is pretty interesting - socializing matters! And if you’re an♥♥♥♥♥people remember… So I’d say this aspect is pretty interesting and where the game actually branches.Scenario wise, I think you usually get the same most major scenarios to progress the story, and the choices you make in between aren’t able to cancel a future major event happening. It will just affect what options you can choose to do in the scenarios. For example if the major scenario in year 3 is happening and you have some allies by spending time/ helping them in the first few years they may help you out. Or if you became enemies they might mess you up.Storywise I found it quite entertaining, the writing style is alright, I’d say 7/10 in terms of smoothness and clearness. Would have liked some more details in how their world with humans and demons and other forms of life work, but how the author paints is it interesting and vivid enough on a small scale.Overall I really enjoyed the 1.5 hours it took to finish this story, and there are way more paths I could choose. As mentioned though major scenarios are mostly the same, what makes variety is your relationships with other characters. Just like a real life workplace! (Minus the necromancy of course) :p"
76561197971684637,Not Recommended,318310,23716531,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,CodPor,"The illusion of interactivity falls apart on a second playthrough.The plot never changes. There is no failure, and there are no branching paths. It's always the same sequence of events, with only a few side scenes and ending details that can be changed by your choices. The only time you can become a skeleton is so late that it only gets a token scene before the story ends. Becoming a partner at the firm is the last choice you get to make, and has no effect other than an achievement.Oddly, the gender of one of the supporting characters changes to match your stated sexuality. I guess this was done to ensure the player always has more than one romantic option. I found it weird on a second playthrough for this character to be exactly the same (even their physical description is identical) in every way except which pronouns were used. If you don't have a preference, their gender appears to be selected at random.The player is warned about the danger of losing souls or neglecting sleep, but I never ran out of souls even when I tried to, and sleep deprivation doesn't seem to have any consequences. Both of which mean there's no reason not to pay off your debt, except the debt has no consequences either, and the only reward for paying it off is another achievement.The game seems to treat achievements as the primary motivator for playing. But there's no challenge to getting them, so they don't feel like rewards."
76561198042613011,Recommended,318310,11933156,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,Yuna-Animatus,"I think it speaks a lot for the quality of 'Choice of the Deathless' when you consider that I bought it before it became available on steam when it was available for android devices. And here I am, having bought itagain. Quite simply, Choice of the Deathless is one of the finest games from developer 'Choice of Games' and it's all thanks to the creative, imaginative world so beautifully crafted by Max Gladstone.Now, I understand that the prospect of a text only, choose your own adventure game on Steam sounds mad, especially considering the current age of gaming, where titles are often harshly, and mostly unfairly, judged by how they look and how impressive their visuals are. I also understand that this game simply isn't for everyone. But I think this game is worth a shot.Set in a universe where lawyers use magic known as craft to negotiate contracts, aid demonic clients and even fight for their life, the concept of Max Gladstone's world itself is very interesting, although you could claim it's nothing entirely new. With masterful worldbuilding, witty dialogue and exceptional imagery, the world of 'Choice of the Deathless' comes alive and lures you in. As your character is flung from choice to choice, you'll definitely find a few favorite characters along the way as they are all packed with personality and life.And of course, while the game doesn't offer you much physical character customisation, the way the story is written pretty much allows you to simply just imagine your character in the story. That is the key to enjoying this game, imagination.If I had any complaints, it would have to be that the game is largely linear. The main story path never deviates that much on repeat playthroughs with the exception of one or two minor details. But the choices you are given lead to a surprising amount of flexibility. By the end of each playthrough you'll have crafted a  mostly unique story each and every time.So while the idea of a text only, choose your own adventure game being released on steam seems a bit mad, at the end of the day you'd be hardpressed to find a better example of the choose your own adventure genre out there and for an exceptionally low price, it really is hard to say no to 'Choice of the Deathless'."

Well, it's really a game in the loosest sense of the word, but it is definitely worth your time. What it actually is...is a very well written and evocative choose your own adventure style interactive novel. I fully intend to play this a couple more times to see how different choices will impact the story. Anyway, this is as simple as it gets game wise: just striaght up text on a white screen with your choice options on the bottom of the screen. No graphics, no audio...nothing like that. Basically, if you have read a kindle bok before, that is what you are getting here, but with achievements, lol.Anyway, I really enjoyed the story, and my first reading didnt take too long. I can easily recommend this one to anybody and give it a 9 out of 10 for being well written and give extra props to the developers for selecting an appropriate price point for the game AND for offering a demo so you can decide before spending the $3 it will cost you.I'd say definitely add this game to your library.

But maybe not, because by it being a CYOA game might've gave me some different involvement in the story that color my view of the game. In other word, it works as CYOA game as well.What's it about? It's a fantasy story set in a universe where magic is a study of law instead of art or science. And magicians, or craftsmen as it's named in this setting, are more lawyers instead of scientists or artists.Definitely the best Choice of Games work I've played so far.Edit: What do you know?

But this game isn't as good as others in the genre. Choice of Robots, for example, is a much better game.This game lacks a few things:1) consequences for actions- many of the ""paths"" lead to the same destination. There are plenty of fake choices in this game, and the stats have seemingly no bearing on your character's ability to succeed in this game. In fact, as I write this review, I'm realizing that the stats are virtually meaningless in this game. The author doesn't seem to know how to integrate the ""Choice of"" mechanics very well.2) Clarity- I've played through this game 3 times as of my writing this, and I still don't understand what's going on in a few scenes. It's not because I'm too stupid to get it, either (I know when something goes over my head, and I'm not too proud to admit it :-P ). The mechanics of ""the Craft"" and how its analogous to being a lawyer seems tenuous at best. In some scenes, there are so many different versions of reality (e.g., nightmates, demonic planes, god/goddess realms, etc.) that it's really difficult to understand what's going on. There are a few other egregious examples of this, but in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll just say that the overall arc that binds the story is needlessly complicated and ends in a very confusing way. Mr. Gladstone (the author) must have never heard of the old adage K.I.S.S. : keep it simple, stupid.3) Interesting characters- This might seem like a trite complaint, but none of these characters have any life in them. Character tropes can be a good thing, especially in these ""Choice of"" games, but none of these characters fall into familiar archetypes in a way that enhances the storytelling. I can think of a few off the top of my head: a rich and pretentious scion, three superficially different intimidating bosses, a family man, a horrific monster who turns out to be harmless. It was just lacking4) Satisfying puzzles- The best Choice of Games are the ones where there is a particular situation in which your character will most likely fail in any given playthrough, but there is one narrow path in which your character will succeed in that situation. This happens arguably once in this game at the casino night, but there are no consequences, and it's not at all satisfying. In Choice of Robots, for example, it feels sooo good to earn the grant from the National Science Foundation toward the beginning of the game; there's nothing similar to that in this game.Overall, I'd say this game isn't very good; but honestly, for the price...... what the heck. Buy it, play it, and see what I'm talking about.Also, what the heck kind of writing is going on during the sex scenes. Really? It's all about the lack of plural second person pronouns in the English language. It's bad. Really bad."

The way this works is so metaphysical that it is unrelatable, confusing, and overly complicated. Magical interactions that are more important than moving your drink from a table to your hand are managed as contracts, the attornies review these contracts in this metaphysical world where the contract is illustrated as a web and the attorney reviews it for loop holes that are literal holes.

You build relationships with others that could help you later - or make you fall.There are three love interests: the male workaholic who steals credit to your job, the female soap box idealistic, and the rich haughty aristocrat (male or female depending on your preferences). A bit disappointing, and virtually no impact on the story. Another negative points is that a lot of stats are pointless. You have limited sleep and soulstuff (your ""magical energy""), yet I've spent nights to work and used craft every single time I could, without ever running out of any of these. Those minor negative points have all been fixed in the sequel, Deathless City's thirst.Overall, I've had a great experience with this game and I recomment it - however, the sequel is even better, so I strongly encourage to buy the bundle."

At some points this game suffered the failing of not making it clear what my decisions would lead to (I was surprised to find out siding with my firm in the goddess case was considered the more morally wrong option), but it was much better about this than past Choice of Games I've played, so I give the writer points for clarity - particularly impressive given how easy it would've been to muck up that aspect with the very unusual premise the story is based on.With the amount of intriguing options I still plan to pursue in future playthroughs and achievements I want to grab, this game is an excellent value for the very cheap asking price."

I purchased it through the most recent Steam sale. Entering the game, I had quite a few apprehensions and definitely saw it amongst the lower echelons of games that I had purchased during the sale. I am now happy to say that this could not be farther from the truth. I am only 45 minutes in, butChoice of the Deathlessis one of the most enjoyable experiences that I have had on Steam!My past experiences with “choice of” books is that the decisions don’t really have that much weight to them. Oftentimes, I find myself growing bored of them too quickly, frantically flicking through the pages in an attempt to find the quickest and easiest path to end the novel. However, inChoice of the Deathless, I find myself constantly weighing up the potential pros and cons of my choices, assessing which characters it will affect and which ones will want to engage physically as quickly as possible with me (I’m looking at you, Chen and Ashleigh). Through these choices, a richly-developed and thoroughly enjoyable story is developed, with constant twists and turns and unexpected relationships being forged.That’s enough of the choices aspect of the game. I think the author, Max Gladstone, deserves some praise for how beautifully written the novel is. The writing is rich and ambitious, without deterring the reader. It's descriptive in its detail of even the most minor parts of the book. Because of this, readers are treated to a wonderfully imagined world, in which they can feel a genuine tie to their character (even more so if you name it after yourself). In regards to the world, it is a very interesting fantasy world that readers are transported to. One that feels expansive and immersive, yet not too overwhelming.EDIT: I am 90 minutes in and I have had some very enjoyable developments in my personal story within the game. All of the characters seem to hold me in high regard, except for Varga. God, I hate that guy. The intricacies surrounding my decisions and deciding which approach to take with certain clients has added yet another interesting and enjoyable aspect to the game. For instance, I displayed empathy towards one demon, R'ok, whilst exercising caution and restraint with a Goddess which ultimately resulted in a loss for my character.Overall, I am enjoying the game a great deal and look forward to developing my review the further I get into the novel."

The Gods have been slain, and demons are bound by magic to serve mortals, but they are always looking for ways to threaten the physical realm. There is a lot of awesome bits of lore like these that hint at a greater world. Your character is a member of a law firm that deals with demon contracts, so you are an interesting mix between lawyer and wizard.You start off by just getting out of school and getting a junior position in the firm, shackled by crippling debt. Your goal is to earn money and power, while also dealing with interpersonal dilemmas. Each chapter ends in a personal conflict related to your case, which can be resolved in multiple ways. I chose to employ powerful magic and political backstabbing, but there are also options to deal with these by means of charm and friendship, sheer force of will, or trickery. The game keeps track of your stats depending on how you handle a situation, and you also develop reputation with certain characters.There is a lot of great descriptions of the other lawyers, especially the more powerful ones, and ideas about magic that can only be expressed in text. I don't know how well the game will hold up on a second playthrough, but I suspect the scenarios will be the same, but with different side stories and reactions. I think there is more in depth characterization, even romances, if you specialize in charm, but I was a pretty ruthless guy who only had time for work. The ending was a satisfying conclusion. My bosses loved me.It's cool to see Steam branch out into interactive fiction. It's a pretty underrated genre of video games. At the end, it's a well told story with a unique setting and an interesting take on demons, so I'd give this a full recommendation!"

Now, the obvious thing to say is ""the nice thing about these kind of games is the various options they provide and how your story changes with each play through""; but when things are so boring you barely can stand playing through a game once, do multiple branching paths really matter?While ""Adventure"" was an acomplishment for its time and still manages to somewhat hold today, this game should be able to hold up to the fun that can be found in adventure but fails to do so. It feels like a constant reminder of the difficulties with interactive storytelling when such a media was still a fresh consept.SPOILEROne of the main complaints I had is that the description of this game sounds like the adventure. I thought there will be some kind of take on modern office life or some kind of commentary on how a law firm operates or even a hard boiled detective/ lawyer story that just happens to involve the undead. This isn't the case, as it gets into the undead part more than the reality part that I was hoping for.

It is also refreshingly not heteronormative, allowing you to choose whether you're male or female, if your first kiss was with a man or woman, and if you're interested in men, women, or both.  That said, considering that the next book had a trans protagonist, it is surprisingly cisnormative, at least for your character, despite the line from a senior partner of ""I have been three times a father, and once a mother, and none of my children speak to me any more.""

The detail in how the story is told (as well as how it all unravels ultimately) are interesting, and although I wish there were a few more options or alternate events than there are, it still makes you want to continue through to the end.  It's entertaining, and it doesn't discriminate based on gender - you're free to call yourself man or woman and still have the same romantic options available to you, both men and women. I've put four hours into this thing already and finished the story several times, and I'm still not bored with it; there are more outcomes I haven't found even at this point and achievements still to be unlocked.

I really enjoyed playing this game, its interesting storyline and variations, the clever and humorous voices, and the honestly awesome world that it has going on. It's so engaging and made me really want to continue to replay and replay and replay(, if at least, to get the achievements and) to see the entire web of possible story variations.Definitely worth getting and playing.

The writing for, “choice of robots” was philosophical and aided by generic technological terminology, and “heroes rise” was filled with comic book ability terminology interlaced with futuristic technology reasoning.With this game, “choice of the deathless” you can tell that this writer has done not only his supernatural and spiritual research, but he is also well versed in the poetic styling of demonic fiction. Honestly, I went into this adventure expecting something a little more heaven vs hell, or even dealings with the devil type story. Surprisingly, the story was closer to demonic bureaucracy and internal politics.Personally, I ‘m rather fond of finding love in the “choose your own adventure” style settings, and I can honestly say my choices gave me a rather enjoyable end to that journey. Although, love aside, I feel the pace of the story was rather rushed in the beginning which kept me from really grasping the world I was entering. I’m sure the effect that I felt starting the adventure was intentional after seeing just where the journey took me, but I think it also had a side effect by not allowing me to fully connect to the characters in a meaningful, remember able way. I would play this “Choice of” game again, only to give myself a better grasp of the world within."

The content is great.  It really is a choose your own adventure style game, only the adventure involves being a necromancer/lawyer (Necrolawyer?).  It's a lot of fun, and it is definitely the kind of game that you can play for only minutes at a time, or for hours.  It's also nice to be able to listen to music while playing.Final thought:  If you like reading, and you like video games with stats and character customization, buy this game.  I will be getting their other works soon.Cheers."

It's beautifully written and I wish there could be a 'save story' feature to export the adventure just completed and be able to read it again.I only have one critique: it would be useful to have an option to change the color combination, because it becomes tiresome to read after a while."

The fantasy world is refreshingly bizarre and a lot of fun to wrap your mind around. I can strongly recommend to buy this game and give the whole ""choice of..."" genre a try.I want to add two minor things:I am no native speaker and as the language in the game is quite poetic, which I like, it is not always easy to understand everything. On the plus side I am learning a lot of new words. :)The second thing is, I like it more wheen you can immediately see the effect of your choices on your stats (like: ""I want to punch the guy (Rage +++) = you can see your rage will rise for three points). In other games of the series this is allready happening, please continue to do so."

I always gravitate towards 'Choose Your Own Adventure' games but a lot of them end up disappointing me as the choices and story gradually... grays out.

The characters were also really varied, interesting, and just plain cool, especially the firm's partners. Also, who doesn't appreciate being a sorcerer-lawyer with the power to (eventually) equal gods, it's just awesome.
