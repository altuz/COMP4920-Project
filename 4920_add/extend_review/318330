It feels like you can see it all just before you. If you know what I'm talking about, then you should get an idea about the quality of the writing. It's just perfect for this setting.Throughout the story you get a multitude of choices and that makes you really feel as if you're in control.But, it's not all gold that shines.As a matter of fact, the display is a bit too white for me.

Be a tactical genius with a penchant for sniper rifles and a desire for glory that makes you consider switching sides.Or in true Gundam fashion, opt to become a madman willing to use a superweapon for your own ideology.Romance your wingman, your 'operator' or your techie.Play it safe, be inventive, be agressive or be flexible in the choices you go for.There is a lot of replayability here for a low price.

As with most of the choice of games, it sort of pales in comparison to choice of robots in my opinon, but no, bad Gman, mecha ace fixed a lot of problems i have with the others before they were even problems. First thing, the relationships aren't handed to you this time, which is a great upgrade from champion of the gods, in which you could be a blood-spattered barbarian and the timid princess would still be tripping herself reaching for your...well you get the point. This game in particular does a great job of making you feel like you've accomplished something when you actually just picked the logical option in a life or death situation, the story's ""DIscount star wars"" as all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, right down to a pretty major plot point which I won't spoil, but it can't be blamed as it does a good job of making up for it.The combat's about as involving as it gets with text adventures, by which I mean, about as involving as hearing a witness account of an epic godzilla fight from a guy who was watching it from the moon with some seriously effective binoculars, but that can't really be helped. The characters feel...sort of human? It's not that easy to relate to them, but once again, text adventure limitations. One negative point, I've gotta say they missed a trick with the enemy faction, the way they're portrayed they act and talk the same way the empire from star wars does, hell, they refer to the first member we encounter as an ""Imperial"" for god's sake, yes I know that's standard for empires, imperial being a member of an empire, but...I'm getting off topic. What I'm trying to say is that they're painted as a faction of complete psycopaths, the furthest we get on the spectrum of ""Doing what I think is right, Call of Duty is me"" is a text option saying ""I shoot to injure, he's just doing his job"" yeah, sorry mate, but this guy's job description seems to include ""Must strangle one orphan kitten per week"" or something of the like.In short, not as good as choice of robots, but just below it, along with most of Choice of's other titles, pick it up, it's dirt cheap and you won't feel that money was wasted. 7/10"

It could almost as easily have been a WW2-themed tale of the travails of a Panzer Squad.If you've read other Choice of Games, especially those on mobile, be aware that this is NOT their usual fare.  Most decisions focus on tactical squad command decisions: flank, charge or wait, attack at close or long range, delegate a task or assume command, etc.  These are well-written and implemented sensibly and thoroughly.However... characters fall into military tropes (enemy ace, commanding officer, wide-eyed rookie) instead of the usual Choice Of soap opera.  Romance is implemented, but almost grudgingly.  The gender of romanceable characters is randomized by default (this can be over-ridden), and as far as I can tell only F/M or M/F romances are allowed.  (I mention this only because most other games by this publisher go out of their way to be inclusive of all preferences when it comes to romance.)If you enjoy the more serious aspects of the Gundam anime, or regularly read WWII memoirs in between PBEM rounds of a Slitherine wargame, you're sure to find a lot to like this game and it's absolutely worth full price.If you're looking for something character-driven, emotional or romantic, the company's other works of interactive fiction are probably a better choice."

This book has a concept I love more than anything: a save feature. That's right, we can now dog-ear the beginning of a chapter so players can come back to it and see if maybe they wanted to try things differently. It's a great anti-frustration feature that's rarely utilized in these games. The customizability of your mecha isn't quite as extensive as it could be, unfortunately. On the other hand, you have the option of deciding a few different things about some of the more important characters in the story or even leaving it up to randomization, which is either unique, or generally only comes up when selecting your own character's sex and preference.On top of that, the stats matter a great deal, but not necessarily in a way that cripples players. There are multiple paths to saving the day to account for different choices and stats. As a minor caveat, however, this is a game where you specialize in a stat and then lean heavily on it. If you're a fan of CYOA games that give you a chance to be well-rounded, or where well thought-out choices always work, or where you're allowed to adapt to the game as you find out more, this is not that sort of game.So, good story, interesting choices that can change it, and a save feature.

I lost literally almost my entire side of my military, including ones I loved but later was treated to what seems like a somewhat rushed ending. It was likely the choices I made that affected my outcome but it was almost like a cliffhanger where you wanted to play the sequel.  I probably know the ""end end"" result but it would have been nice to (as Mortal Kombat would endorse...) ""finish him/them!"".  Still very satisfying but would have been even more grandoise if there was a sequel or maybe just 2 more pages of epilogue focusing more on the relationships I had developed  and/or lost (moreso a nod to how HeroesRise ended in each game)."

The game is not really about mechas, though--it's about your choices and how you interact with a small set of characters. I really liked that, because it meant you could actually care (or not) about them.Your choices offer you some semblance of RPG character development--developing your piloting, tactics, willpower or leadership. The choices really matter in the sense that you could see totally different outcomes depending on what you've done. Some characters can die or live depending on what you do. However, the actual acts are always the same (with differences in the details).The game is short, which I actually quite liked--it felt quite the right length, neither stretched nor cut short. I finished my first run in ~3-4 hours. The 2nd run was done in 1 hour or so, since I only had to read the different scenes where I'd taken different actions.Overall, I recommend this game if you're a fan of fiction or interactive fiction.

But this isnt the first time I've played choice of games product (life of a wizard was awesome) so while I enjoyed the story, I was honestly a bit, unsatisfied. There wasnt enough depth in this game.*Spoilers*Any stat that goes above 4 (starting 2) ensures that you succeed every related option.And with the scarce amount of stat increasing/decreasing choices, this results in very limited dimensions for character ability development.The custom modification on your starting mecha doesnt carry over to the lionheart. Since the custom modification is given to you in recognition of your past accomplishments and current standing, it should have made sense for the game to grant you a similar customization for the lionheart, especially if its something as simple as a custom paintjob.Oh, and if you picked the thruster mod (+1 pilot) and reload checkpoint right after your first save, you permanently gain the stat bonus (this is most likely a glitch and doesnt work for others)The war, or at least the part we get to experience, is freakin short. I know its important to keep a tight pace going, but perhaps the writer could have added a portion/storyline during the early stages of the war, about how the protagonist becomes who he is now, instead of three flat choices and a few paragraphs to cover 5 years of mecha piloting. (The amount of influence the first choice had on your character was just ridiculous)Lastly, a personal rantNo matter how badly some people dont want to admit it, this is TOTALLY a Gundam story.- half masked rival CHECK (and you thought you could get away if you changed the color of the mask?)- same rival/antagonist that has extereme philosophy about war and equally extreme sense of chivalry/honor CHECK- accidentally stumbles upon WHITE PROTOTYPICAL mecha and gets chosen as its pilot CHECK (seriously bruh?)- Earth federation vs space coloniesLook, I love gundam, and I have no problem with this being similar to gundam, its actually great, just stop trying to deny it.For the record, I still recommend this game to people who havent tried choice of games, but as a fan, I don't think there's anything wrong with always wanting more. The fact that choice of games have steered away from traditional/cliche combat heavily themed RPGs makes me that much pickier when it comes to this particular game. it's probably also the one and only mecha text based rpg game out there."

Such as a save state, although you rarely ever see it and your actions have so little consequence, or when they do their consequence is revealed too far ahead in the story.

Should you surrender or fight to the death?It's odd like that.The decision are really simple and or not decision. do you want close up or range attack lets see my range is 5(the Best) and meale is 2(bad) sooooo close up it is! oh no i'am dead. How did i not see this coming!weaker story, ending is well it kinda just ends, no resolution.writing is averageAlt tab for the night so it really took me like a 1.30 hrssadly no desire to replay."

But if you expect a heroic story, don't. The author does endeavor to put in a lot of shout-outs and references, leaving your side of story - despite everything you're given - kinda bland.It's your choice, really, but having played it twice, I do not recommend it."

I do think that the story could do with some music, but thats just me.The story almost reminds me of the story of Sunrider with a few splashes of Code Geass, although that might just be me. I love it so far and would recomend it to anyone who loves a good story."

I mean that the choices are extremely hard to make and what they will lead to is hard to determine, every choice means something and you can't just go back on it without suffering some losses. And that is a good thing. Sometimes with Choice of Games's games I can just rn through them and easily find the best scenario ending, but this one, gosh, I haven't I even finished it because I don't have the heart to see everything crumble around me and not go my way. This game gives a good dose of cold, hard reality and that gives it heart."

No ridiculous mecha with weapons out of every orifice here. Instead you have the tale of a Squadron Leader in the right time and the right place to help end a war. Notably it includes a good checkpoint system, something that I would love to see spread into every Choice of Games' offerings."

There are also character stats, which increase or decrease based on the decisions you make through out the game. If this sounds like something you're interested in, then I'd say definitely give Mecha Ace a shot. I've never played a CYOAB before, but my love of mecha anime seriously made me enjoy the time I've spent so far on this little gem."

Good choices that I hardly felt too fustrated when things didn't go my way, and I ended up loosing function in my arm in the story! Very detailed(unlike this review), and longer than I thought it'd be, though I didn't get much interaction with other characters as I would have liked. Will play again. I wish there were more to further the story."

Only after getting all the achievements (and almost having a nervous breakdown while at it) I managed to get completely satisfied.If you like Choose Your Own Adventure, you shouldn't pass up this game. Take a break from impressive visual effects and realistic graphics of modern games and let your imagination take you to the fantastic places!"

The last chapter was the only weak point for me. While it was good to see that all of my choices mattered, I just couldn't help but feel the finale was a little rushed. I liked the epilogues though."

,Recommended,318330,15193975,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,tettsui77,"As evidenced from my play-time (5 hrs at writing), I haven't had any really truly hardcore sessions of this game.  BUT... I heartily recommend it, and I'll explain why.Long story short, I have a *million* games I'm either playing or would like to play... and I'm largely a RPG man.  So, I just really have never felt compelled to nor been able to put a lot of time into ""Mecha Ace"".  That said, this game RULES -- and the world and story have ingrained themselves on my mind from the first moment, and have kept me interested no matter what else is going on, or what my ""main game"" is.  ""Mecha Ace"" continues to pull me back in, even if only for 15 minutes at a time, and that's what's so great about it.  I could go weeks without touching the game, and I still remember every detail of all my characters, and what's going on in the world.  The writing is just that good -- rich, vivid, and descriptive.I can safely say that, no matter how long it may take me, I *will* eventually finish this game.  Because WOLF LANCE keeps calling me back (definitely the best lance name, for the record).  Because I want to know about that prototype.  Because I want to run the impie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s off, goddammit!It's definitely a niche game if ever there was one, with its text-intensive (if rewardingly deep) world ""instead"" of graphics.  But... if you've read this far into my review .... it's probably up your alley!  If you still have reservations, hell, try and catch it on sale.  Either way, if you ever loved reading sci-fi and/or ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure"" books as a kid, then you will NOT be disappointed in this game."

The price of a blockbuster too, in a way. Numerous endings and narrative branchings. Not long, not too short. A lot of references if you're a mecha fan : the author really knows his subject well and that's actually a big part of what makes this title awesome. Enjoy the intensity, the lack of depth does'nt make it less enjoyable."
