Well, apparently it can be.Pros:+Beautiful game aesthetic (the screenshots are spot-on)+Increasingly difficult puzzles that make you feel nice and smart for solving them+Fresh concept+Tight controls+Elements of humour+CardsCons:-No current resolution options (full-screen distorts play beyond what appears to be 8x6)-Some progression bugs-No key-mappingNeutral:+/- Controls, while tight, are very simplistic - literally only side to side and jump+/- Music - standard fair+/- Fantastic amounts of trial & error+/- Some truly sinister levels (1.5 is not bugged, it can be solved)This game has a lot to offer despite some minor issues here and there, and a bit of patching is sure to bring out its full potential (as the company responsible for the ever popular 'Hero Siege' you can expect them to do a nice job of polishing their creation). I'd say give it a go while it's on sale, or wait a few weeks while the kinks are worked out."

The game automatically starts in the former (no option to start it in full screen).There is no rebinding of controls for neither a controller or a keyboard.Ignoring these minor annoyances, the game is actually pretty fun and forces you to be not only strategize, but to also be fast and accurate and encourages you to think outside the box."

The game's mechanisms are consistent, which is good because some indie games don't work the same every time *cough* Bad Rats *cough*.Some of the puzzles are really well designed, some give you way more pieces than you actually need, and that is frustrating. What makes this game rage-inducing though is dying at the end of a very long level. You are forced to restart from the beginning.Overall, this game is dark, cute, frustrating, and fun. I would buy again.Also, some of the trading cards sell for a relatively high amount, so that's an added bonus."

,Not Recommended,318430,14739648,"Posted: 4 March, 2015",all,Shadowspaz,"To put it simply: This game has no idea what it wants to be.The premise is a very unique and interesting- It's a puzzle platformer where the goal is tokill yourself. You play as a pig whose parents were sent to a slaughterhouse, so to reunite with them in animal heaven, you must use up all of your lives. Very bizarre, and the puzzles are decent at first, but halfway through the first level, they throw trick solutions at you that you have absolutely no way of knowing about.Beyond that, though, this doesn't even stay a puzzle game. There are sections where the goal is tonotdie, and instead, you have to chase down a key through Super Meat Boy-esque areas. The key gets you farther along, eventually to a boss, which you must kill and, again,notdie to. The bosses certainly don't factor in to the story, and they certainly don't fit the parameters the game already set up (Namely, the goal of dying).So we're looking at a casual puzzle / intense precision platformer game- Two genres that are really at odds with each other. Unfortunately for the precision platformer moments, the movement is binary- You're either moving, or you're not. This leads to some punishing situations, if you lightly tap one direction or the other, and it is something that Super Meat Boy did a fantastic job of mitigating. In addition to that, the edge detection on blocks is unreliable, at best- There are numerous times where I've fallen before reaching the edge of a block, and other times where I've been able to jump a bit after I should have fallen. This makes any precision jumping an absolute nightmare.And then there are the gimmicks. Now, this isn't a bad term. All games use gimmicks. Portal's gimmick was, well, portals, and it worked astoundingly well. But Squishy here just usestoo manyof them. Halfway through the first chapter, you'll discover that the only solution to a puzzle isby wrapping around the screen;a function that israrelyused since then. Towards the end, there will be a level where you can fly- No preamble, no use afterwards, you can just fly for that one level. For one of the boss fights, you can suddenly throw fireballs (Which is explained by a textbox right before, saying ""You can temporarily use the power of fire!""), turning the game into very much an action platformer- Not a puzzle one, not a precision one.On top of all of these, there are still teleporters, boost blocks, portals (As in, from Portal), forced darkness (Which obscures the ui, as well), and various other block types, most of which are only used in a couple of levels. Some of which are only used inonelevel.Beyond that, I can't tell if the game takes itself seriously or not, with signs that mock the player, calling them a 'noob,' and stating that 'the following level will make them ragequit.' With regards to the former, hard for the sake of hard does not make a good game. Puzzles with trick solutions do not feel rewarding at all. Both of these points are valid at many, many points.And then there are the bugs... So many bugs... I've gotten graphical glitches, inputs sticking, and other people have gotten game-breaking bugs, trapping them in an area known as the ""secret hat shop."" In addition to that, they apparently left in some debug function where you canright-click anywhere to teleport there.Anincredibleoversight, and I seriously wonder if anyone playtested this before sending it off to Steam.All in all, this does not, in any aspect, feel like a professional game. I respect what the developers have done, and the fact that they have gotten their vision out on the market, but they have a looong way to go (Both in game design, and programming) before making a real gem. I hope they keep at it, because this gamestartedwith a really interesting premise. I wish they kept to that."

You can to do a level over and over again to get to the next part, you could play the start of a level 100 times. You can have a 10% chance of getting to the end part of a level where takes you 3 minutes and then die because you now need to play that part a few times. The story of the game, back to the start and see how for you get this time. Each level is a series of events where you have a chance of dying and where there is a time period between these events. So go back to the start and try again and see how far you get this time. You might as well roll a dice and if you get a 3, restart, wait 1 min before rolling again and if you get it 10 times without dying go to the next level, but don't forget the first few times you get that far you have almost no way of progressing.The levels where you are meant to die are better, but as for the boss battles, they are completely random, you might as well roll a dice 10 times and if you get evens all 10 times you win.You have to wonder why this game was 9p, my theory is that a few people or a person got game maker and played around with it, by putting a few assets into game logic and an engine that was already there and adding a few bits and pieces. And since Steam takes 20% and Game Maker probably takes 30% and not forgetting the tax man, they just discounted the game to 9p.That being said, it is still a game, it has some fun and was 9p.

Sadly, this is the biggest failing of the game.  A game like this needs great controls to be anything other than average.  The controls are poor.  This is made worse by the lack of checkpoints, so failure due to the poor controls means you are starting over from scratch.

,Not Recommended,318430,14743926,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,DerAnt,"While the game is only a mere $0.14, has quite a few levels and a humourous side to the story, there is an unengaging storyline, horrible and illogical controls, glitchy and buggy gameplay and a boost to your ""chances of suicide"" (not literally, but you'd get the point).You play as Squishy the Suicidal Pig, who learns his parents died because they were sent to a slaughterhouse. He remembers his parents telling him that after death you get sent to heaven, and he stupidly commits suicide. He then finds himself in Hell and needs to kill himself 31 times or something to go to heaven. It's understandable that as a 2D platformer aimed at a kiddish-like audience with the appeal to humour, the story would be less than decent. However, it completely mistakens the point of many platformer games, where the goal is to ""survive"", not to ""die"". There is no motivation created in completing the game, and you can't unlock the other mode without completing the adventure mode. Clunky story, unappealing to complete.With a less than decent story, you'd expect the controls to actually be somewhat better and smooth, considering it's a 2D platformer with surprisingly crisp graphics. However, I was left spamming my keyboard, trying to find a button which would let me click on buttons to click ""yes"" and play the game. What's considerably worse, is you can't even use your mouse to nagivate in the menu screen, you press <Esc> to go to the pause menu, <Enter> for ""okay"" in the Pause menu and <Spacebar> in the Main Menu. It seems that both <Enter> and <Spacebar> were dedicated to their respective menus. Heck even <Y> didn't work for restarting the game.The somewhat confusing design of the level is a mess to start with. You get an easy tutorial level, and after that a heap of level designs that aim to push your brain to the max. At level 1-4, jumping on the boxes were near impossible as:1. They dissappeared over a short period of time after being stepped on2. Pressing the up+left/right arrow keys caused Squishy to jump, land, then run forward without any input from the player3. After jumping and falling down, you're forced to restart as you can't even jump up to the platform.This is then repeated over the course of the level, where 1 minor mistake and glitch on the computer's part will cause you to inevitably lose any chances of killing yourself and progressing within the level. After this experience, I became very good and fast at restarting the game i.e. press <Esc>, then press <Enter>.Clunky system, sloppy controls, glitched and buggy - it's almost at an unbearable state, where there you don't get any motivation in playing. The game does offer a humourous (and incredibly stupid story), crisp graphics and ""3"" cards (excuse the pun), all at a generous price of just $0.14usd.Not too bad, considering the price, but there are definitely better developed 2D platformers out there for free.

No matter what your circumstances are, you must persevere. You must go on. Things will get easier with time, and you will survive. Not even if you were accidentally born with a cow for a head. Not a cow's head, but a whole cow. That'd be really uncomfortable. But is that worth taking your life over? Think of all the milk you could make. Or if you really have to sneeze and it just won't come out? This too shall pass. Though you may be in insufferable agony, a soul tempered within the flames of Hell shines brighter. Cleansed of sin in hellfire, you are stronger, purer, and have a will stronger than clamshell packaging.But this game gives the wrong idea.Squishy The Suicidal Pig just makes it that easy, huh? Just kill yourself, and everything will be okay again? Huh? That's not a good life lesson, Squish. You're teaching these kids terrible things. Squish might not have it easy, selling his cheap little puzzle platformer for 99 cents on Steam and on the Google Play Store just to make ends meet. And his parents died, and he's in literal Hell for killing himself. But does he really have to kill himself again?Like the game clearly says in the title, you are a squishy pig. And your goal in each level is to die. There will be many puzzles impeding your progress, but you need to figure out how to manipulate the objects in order to kill yourself. I'll admit, it's an interesting gameplay mechanic. It's not something that's seen too often. Although it has been done before. Better, even.Right off the bat, it's easy to tell that Squish is not quite a high budget title. It looks like something you'd play for free on your school computer instead of working on your PowerPoint presentation on wolves or chlamydia or whatever you're researching.As if the dollar price tag hid the fact that this is a cheaply-made game. At the very least it's not ugly, the spritework is nice and there's some decent animation. Like how Squish is just sweating nonstop as he idles, which seems very fitting for a suicidal pig in a sweater. The soundtrack can be a little grating, but it's mostly tolerable.But Squish's so-called claim to fame is his excellent gameplay. Clever puzzles and platforming. This is what Squish is staking it all on. They clearly know that they're low-budget, they wouldn't be charging pocket change for the game if they thought they created a piece of art. They're hoping to skate by on quality mechanics and charm.Much like everything else in Squish's life though, this is all a lie. Squishy is definitely charming, I'll give him that. But his game is muddled by sloppy physics and garbage puzzle design. Not to mention a clear lack of identity.Squish will jump from puzzle platformer that requires you to die, to a Super Meat Boy-esque platformer hell that asks you to survive every few levels. Which would be perfectly fine if the controls were built for platforming. But no, Squish's movements are so imprecise. Not to mention buggy. I've had to restart puzzles multiple times because it wouldn't register that I was walking off a cliff, and I was just levitating in space as I walked off. Or my jump button suddenly losing functionality when I really needed to jump. The controls are responsive most of the time, but that's not good enough in a game that requires tight controls and twitch jumping.I'd be more forgiving on the controls if the game at least copied everything that made Super Meat Boy great, instead of just saying ""Oh, this game is hard. Let's make ours hard too"" and thinking it'd automatically make their game good. The levels can be unnecessarily tedious, involving lots of time-consuming arranging of parts and movement. Squishy's stubby pig legs don't quite move fast enough, which makes progressing through certain portions an awkward crawl.And this is made even more unbearable by the game's absurd use of checkpoints. They're there, I've seen a few of them. But they're rarely ever used, especially where they should be used. Should you mess up on a puzzle, you're restarting back from the beginning. Should you die on an annoying platformer hell level? Back to the start. Unless you're playing one of the rare levels where they thought ""maybe this one could use a checkpoint"" and just so happened to place one.I want to like Squish. I really do. He could use the moral support, you know? He could use a friend. But he's such a worthless piece of garbage. He's late to the party. He's the early 2000's flash game, complete with the early 2000's sense of humor. But here he is, released in late 2014, trying to make jokes about n00bs and cutesy farm animals being graphically slaughtered.I tried to give it a chance, but the puzzles aren't even well executed. It frequently relies on tricking the player, leaving red herring objects in many courses purely to confuse the player. Or using a ""joke level"" where the answer was to ignore the puzzle altogether because the answer was something so unbelievably ""obvious"" to begin with.Not to mention the fact that it rips many of its puzzles directly from a better version of it, a 2008 Flash game called ""Karoshi: Suicide Salaryman"". Which is a whole dollar cheaper, at the reasonable price of free. It might not be as pretty, but the puzzles are a lot better put together and a lot more satisfying. It's like Squish just decided to rip the concept of Karoshi and paste it to the concept of Super Meat Boy for an ultimately frustrating platformer.I'm disappointed in Squish. It's a decent platformer, I was able to play through levels and enjoy them for what they were, but it's weighed down by so much baggage. It's like they really wanted to nail the ""suicidal"" vibe of the game by giving it so much baggage that it's just unpleasant to be around. You might still want to stick around, just to help Squish stay strong. But really, I think it's time to just let go.Be free, Squish. Go on. This is clearly the way you were meant to go. This is your self-righteous suicide. You were too good for this world, Squish. This world is a ball of toxic hate and evil.Ascend to the heavens, Squish. You're in a place as pure and perfect as you are now.You are truly blessed."

Yep. I think we all raged at the f*cking bird level in the beginning trying to collect all the apples at the same time. You know what I'm talking about.The only negatives I can think of this game is not being able to change my control settings, I want to be able to move with WASD and space to jump. I'm a very simple gamer with simple needs, and that is what I want for all my games. I don't want to have to learn a new control language because it messes me up with timed jumps, which probably contributed to 90% of my rage level.Overall though, this game is cheap and I knew what I was getting.

76561198117046172,Recommended,318430,14789662,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Elmo3000,"One thing I want to make clear straight off the bat is that this game gets a positive review from me solely because it is more than worth it's current price of a whopping nine pence. That being said, given that I would probably purchase an empty wrapper that used to contain a chocolate bar and still has some hint of the fragrance for the same price, that's no indication of the game's quality, and to be blunt you can sum up the biggest strength and greatest weakness of the game in one word. Cheap. In both senses of the word.I don't want to make it sound as if the game is bad - it isn't - but this is an instance where you get what you pay for. Despite the original sounding concept - you need to kill yourself in every level rather than avoid death - it plays ostensibly the same as any other puzzle-platformer; push some boxes, activate some switches, and get to the end. The only difference is that the end of the level is a pit of spikes rather than a princess in a castle.The controls are simple and not too shabby. Aside from moving and jumping, there's nothing to do. Sure you can walk up to a switch or push a box, but you only need buttons for left, right, and jump. Around 80% of the time the levels are surprisingly decent, showing a good understanding of level design given that your character has barely any abilities. One thing I would improve is the jumping mechanic, as I've died more than a few times due to an unclear cooldown period after jumping during which you can't jump again. That reminds me - every few levels the 'You're trying to die' mechanic is eschewed in favour of finding a key or chasing something, so there are moments when the game loses the biggest asset that was keeping it original.The other 20% of levels present a pretty big problem though. Some of the levels are ridiculously unclear and downright stupid, and on these levels you won't fail because you lack skill, you'll fail because the game is withholding information you would need to beat it. On one level - and I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about spoiling this - there's a row of pits and two boxes, and the game somehow expects you to figure out that you need to push boxes into pits 4 and 6. There is no indication of this whatsoever, and the closest I could find was a note in the dirt reading 'A-N T-G'. There's leaving things to the player's imagination and then there's just taking liberties.I'm currently on the Boss of World 2 and I can safely say that as someone who has finished around 75 Steam games, it is the worst boss I've faced in any of them. The arena is small and the boss throws six bombs down, which cover half of the arena. The bombs have a blast radius that is a little over twice their size. Do the math. It doesn't help that to win the battle you need to avoid this attack EIGHTEEN TIMES in a row. That pretty much sums up the worst parts of the game - 10% skill, 90% hoping the random number generator lets you win.Overall, despite what I've said, this guy is well worth the price. The graphics are pleasant, there's a bit of humour and variety, and although it's hit and miss, there are more hits than misses by far. But bear in mind that if it was priced at say, £5 or more, this would definitely be a negative review. It's fun, but approach with caution."

,Not Recommended,318430,15902772,"Posted: 19 May, 2015",all,conor,"You ever play Karoshi Suicide Salaryman? It's a series of free flash puzzle platformers where the goal is to jump into spikes or drop a box on your head, since the objective of the game is actually to kill yourself! It's a neat little game, with several bite-size levels to keep you satisfied the way Warioware does. The graphics aren't great and feel like they're fresh out of those way-too-edgy late 90s flash videos, but they're serviceable and do their job. I have fond memories of those games, so when I saw this game was on sale for just over a freakin' quarter and was mechanically similar, I figured why not.Graphics and soundtrack are the only things this game does better than the Karoshi Suicide Salaryman series. Credit where credit is due, it's a pretty good-looking game. It isn't pandering to the retro aesthetic that so many pixelated modern games do, and I appreciate that. There's also a fair amount of effort put into this game, and a substantial amount of levels for the price. There's even a speedrun mode, which is nice to have even if I'd never use it.Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that playing this game is a chore. The controls are archaic - you press up to jump instead of having a dedicated jump button separate from your movement buttons. It's a little thing but you get thrown off every once in a while. It's difficult, and not in the way a game like Dark Souls or Castlevania is difficult. Think I Wanna Be The Guy or something that's unfairly hard in an attempt to artificially extend the playtime.The gameplay feels similarly dated, as there are no checkpoints. If the levels were shorter, this wouldn't be a problem, but far too often you'll accidentally screw up later in the level, so you'll hit the R button (which you have to find out on your own) only to find yourself back at the beginning, and have to slog through a puzzle you already know how to do but don't move quick enough to do so without getting frustrated.The price doesn't save a game from not being fun. I know it might seem unfair to keep comparing this to a different game, but I cannot emphasize enough how much better the Karoshi series is at nearly everything Squishy the Suicidal Pig attempts. From the treatment of an inherently messed up subject matter to having to temporarily avoid killing yourself, every single thing in Squishy the Suicidal Pig feels like it's been done better before, and for free.The one comfort is I've already sold the cards I got from wasting my time on this and gotten my money back."

On the level there, there is a big pit of lava and many other ways to die in the level, but you lose if you try to die. This game breaks its own rules!Shortly afterwards, you encounter ANOTHER level where you can't die. And, at the end of it, there is a boss which is stupidly hard. I wouldn't mind if it was a fair challenge, but it's not, it's just a pain to go through.In short, you will probably think this game is a waste of money, unless you are into puzzles and platforming that is almost impossible."

You even see that one has been here effortless.----------------Stage 1:Stage 1 is probably the best in the stage in the game. Here you can learn all the games techniques and solves a great puzzle. The best level in the world and generally in the game is the Bird Hunting Level. However, this gimmick is used with the bird there once and never used again.Stage 1 Boss:The Bully. One of the 3 good bosses. The boss has to defeat a meaningful way.However, you notice here what you actually have a bad hit box. The deathblocks kill you although they do not really touch you. There are blocks that fall down from above. Should probably be an attack by the boss. The blocks spawn very random. (RNG Warning).The boss has a phase 2.Here fall down more blocks and the RNG increases.The chance to be not to hit here is 75%.Stage 2:In Stage 2, the puzzles become more difficult. However, it has something of the world 1 which is good. There is a level where you have accidentally fall down and hope that not one of teleporters touches you because you will be teleported back up.Stage 2 Boss:I have been waiting for this section. The Coyote.The Boss is one of the most horrible bosses I know. (From myself I often play called IWBTG Fangames where there are from time to time bad bosses, but they have meaningful, beatable and make more fun than this boss.)First when the boss starts he speaks something with fat Pigs who nobody cares.The trouble is, when you die you have to listen it again. And that can be annoying.I wonder how the TNT throws are constructed. Again here RNG Warning.Eventually, he is a nitro box that you have to push him.Sometimes, the box kills one if the box has landed.The bad part is the phase 2.He is throwing random Spikeballs and TNT Boxes. At some point he raises an ordinary box down the you have to push on a switch so that a cannon is activated. You have the boss since back thus lead the cannon hits him. The chance to hit him there is 25%.What I have noticed when I played the boss on INSANE mode, the TNT barrels he throws in the phase 1 have a timer that explodes from 0. Sometimes they explode at 1 or 2, thus can not judge you when they explode.Stage 3:Actually, Stage 3 is like Stage 2.Nothing to say here.Stage 3 Boss:One of the 3 good bosses. The Snowman.The boss has its own programmed off by the player to attack, like shooting or ran to him.The random thing here again is, that you can shoot fireballs. (and only for this level/boss). The gimmick the boss is very bad, you can go to the left side so you jump in on the right come.The gimmick reminds me of SMB3, but it does not fit to the boss.One would have to make Snowman smaller so you can jump over him because of Snowman has no chance the player can attack with the ""push-attack"".The boss has a phase 2.This is the best phase 2 of all bosses.The Barrages are good and an original way to defeat him.Stage 4:Here you can tell how the developer has no loss. The levels are very small and have strange gimmicks.This is the worst world.Stage 4 Boss (Finalboss):One of the 3 good bosses. The Demon Pig.I do not know what has to do a demon in the universe but the phase 1 has again an original gimmick which is good.It is a Space Ship Shooter where to shoot at aliens.The Phase 2 has to defeat another object to the boss somehow. A sword.The Barrages are very good and is fun. However, the boss is very short and not epic for a Final Boss.-----------------------Thus, I wrote my review. I will continue playingthis game for achievements but;> Is it not recommended <"

This game was a great opportunity to let the player think outside the box, but there is only one way to solve the puzzles as far as I can tell. There are also some platforming levels where you'r supposed to not die which kinda ruins the theme.

You're basically a pig, and the goal of each level is to kill yourself by using various traps.I have only gotten a little into the game, but here are my thought, as of now.Pros:Level Design is unique.Control is good.Charming 8-Bit adventure.Music is upbeat and catchy.Many fun levels.Boss Fights!Many modes, that probaly will make you come back to this game.OMFG SECRET HATZZZ STORE!!!Cons:Restarting a level because of an accidental crate placement is annoying.Not telling you about different mechanics (Edges of screens are connected.)Music gets repetative. Fast.Overall game idea is not that unique.No button replacement, the arrow keys are your only opition.Not that many opitions for sound or, anything, really.Overall, I think this game is good, but not perfect. If you got a few bucks to spend, you like platforming-games or just wanna support Indie Developers, I would recommend this. The game just came out, so maybe some updates will fix the problem with the lack of options. Also, you can't 360 noscope in this game. (Just Kidding! :D)6 out of 10."

It said press ""X"" to restart, which is from an Xbox controller, so I had to go through each key trying to work out which one was restart.I have to manually go into the options every time I open the game and select ""fullscreen"" to make it go fullscreen.I wanted to plug in my controller and use that, but there's no options to customise the controls at all.This was on sale at  £0.39 and it still managed to be disappointing for me.

This levels are really well designed and I loved to play them.But!... when you go further in the game, you start to stumble on levels that require no more thinking, but skill... lots of it! This is, in my opinion, a VERY bad idea! The worst part of this levels is usually the moving platforms with weird physics.But there is worse! At the end of each world (10 levels) there is a boss level. This boss levels are in two parts: first you have to complete a level which requires skills ಠ_ಠ, and then you can fight the boss.Let's first talk about the boss fights: they are very hard... because of their infinite randomness! This is not a good way to make difficulty. In Dark Souls, you can learn the paterns, and once you master them, you win. But in this game, a boss fight is a fight against RNGesus. This is a BAD design.Now, imagine you have go after you tried to beat a boss - let's say - 57 times. If you close the game, you will have to beatallthe f***ing level again before you can fight RNGesus again.(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻I managed to beat the first boss. But the second one is really too horrible.

I remeber playing Karoshi Suicidal Salaryman and that was a *fantastic* flash game. I loved it and hoped to have a similar game to play with new graphics and storyline. I was horribly disappointed, however, because within the 0.2 hours I accumulated in front of this game, I sped through the first 10-15 levels. The game also features what seems to be the weakest storyline I have seen so far; I thought there was going to be some promise of storyline, seeing as there is a whole game dedicated to the achievement of the main character's soul desire to be with his parents. As I was playing with the controls, I also discovered that right clicking allows you to teleport the character to your mouse location, which I find truly unnecessary, where even if it was, there should at least be some sort of safety preventing people from randomly finding this so that it can be used in cases where there is a legitimate layering problem and the player is stuck. Considering I got the game for ~$0.10, I feel bad for expecting *anything* out of this purchase. You have failed me, customer reviews."

The puzzles are well made and sometimes require you to think outside the box. The platforming is not as great, well suited for maneuvering around the map but less so when trying to do more precise movements. The game is really fun and enjoyable when the puzzles rely solely on thinking and problem solving. However, when the game asks you to jump over a pit, dodge an enemy or jump off a moving platform or something of that nature, the imprecise physics and jump controls can be a bother. While the majority of the levels are not like this, some of the marathon levels and nearly all the boss levels require you to stay alive. This makes these sequences the most ""rage enducing"" not because of the difficulty but because of the randomness of the AI and the wonky controls. These levels are in the minority, and if you can manage to get past them, this game is worth the playthrough. The level design, the art and the sense of humor are great. Besides, the game is dirt cheap. You certainly get your money's worth."

Making a game hard doesn't make it a bad game. However, the controls are horrible. Instead of the WASD we are all familiar with, it using the d-pad of the keyboard. A lot of times, it doesn't responce either. It isn't my keyboard that causes the problem. The game asks you to use a controller, simple right? WRONG! It doesn't work with any dual-shock controller. Even games like Team Fortress 2, which is 8 years old, supports the Dual-Shock 4. All of this make the game nearly impossible. For example, 1-4 you need to jump onto certain blocks that fall apart. I wasted over 15 minutes trying to beat it and failed. And I am not bad at video games. Don't buy it. Unless you want to make money off of the trading cards."

I'm going somewhere with this)*********Why did you read this line!?  You fail!  Go back to the start and try again! (No, really, just bear with me)**********Oh, too bad!  Another failure line.  Are you stupid or something?  You gotta stop reading these.  Back to the top, bro.***********Looking for the review?  Guess what.  Uh-huh.  You: the top.  Try again.**********And with apologies, the review:So what was that all about, you ask?  I just disrespected a small chunk of your time and insulted your intelligence for my arbitrary punishments.  And that's just horrible.  As you might expect, this is a metaphor for Squishy the Suicidal Pig's gameplay.  Let's look:Okay, so a puzzle platformer about a pig who has made a bet with the devil that's left him with a bunch of extra lives and the challenge is to burn them all up to earn a ""Get Out of Hell Free"" card.  That's a premise that's got a ton of charm and potential.  I'm guessing it's that premise that's drawn you in for a closer look.  I expected some free-form puzzling that poked fun at the platforming genre where deaths are easy and so often cheap.Unfortunately, no.  It's not that.  It's just another ""ragequit""-pandering frustration platformer, schizophrenically mixed with some janky pseudo physics and guess-what-the-designer-is-thinking puzzles.  But make no mistake.  Squishy isn't bad for not being the game I would have liked.  If you've got the platforms and the fireballs, I'll dodge 'em.  And you desperately need a better HVAC guy.  Point is: like the contents of several shot glasses, hard can be fun.  Although in both cases, if I end up falling into a pit, it had better be because of my own miscalculations in what I can handle.This is not the case with Squishy.  Arbitrary is really the watchword for this game.  To tie it to the platforming: on the levels where it switches for no particular reason to a ""not die"" level, sometimes there are checkpoints.  The checkpoints only work once and then you restart the whole level.  Why?  Arbitrary punishment! To prove that you're willing to put in the man hours and really prove that you've nailed the level up until the brand new mechanic that will definitely kill you a half dozen times before you can possibly suss out a feel for it.  Or perhaps the developer just thought you'd be really pleased with seeing your indistinct hit box in action as you die from a deadly pendulum coming somewhat near your sprite.  Time for a side-scrolling shooter level!  Wait.  What?I'm sure I could easily point out a dozen more examples of peculiar and unfair design, but ultimately Squishy breaks the two rules anybody out to make a precision platformer needs to put in big black text on a stark white background and set as their desktop wallpaper until the end of time:1.  You must hold your game to the same standard of precision you demand from the player.You want super responsive jumping that isn't competing with other animations. A sense of weight and speed is also welcome if you're going to ask the player to pass within a hair's breadth of hazards. The hit boxes must not extend outside the visible sprite.  And even then that's the minimum.  One pixel of toe touching a hazard should probably be forgiven.   Look at how bullet-hell shooters do it by only making the player's center mass vulnerable.  (Now look at what you've done, Squishy: you've got me calling bullet-hell shooters sensible)2.  The player is going to fail a lot.  Respect their time and get them back in the action quickly.Put a checkpoint after a lengthy segment and don't make it a limited use thing.  Really, we're supposed to be making fun of the idea of a limited resource representing your number of tries, right Squishy?  If the player dies after something like that, the only thing you're challenging is their patience.  To its credit, Squishy does have a dedicated ""reload the level"" button that helps with this, but any good will gained from that is instantly lost with every boss that has to waste around 10 seconds of my time with its unskippable intro dialogue every single time I restart.  Don't do that.  Especially don't do that if your boss is hard enough you might be dead in less than that amount of time.  And double-extra don't do that if it's a throwaway line that does nothing to characterize the boss outside of a generic bad-guy line.  Thanks, I think I got that much from them being the level boss and/or the devil.Better yet, forget the wallpaper thing.  Tattoo these on yourself in mirror-writing Memento style so you never lose sight of your redemption.So now that my mighty tirade against Squishy's platforming has thundered across the primeval plains devouring lesser megafauna, let's ask: could Squishy be saved from a negative review by clever puzzling, a strong visual aesthetic, or its narrative elements?  Nope.Back to the word arbitrary that I seem to be hung up on; Squishy's puzzles are that.  Most of the puzzles are variants on get-box-in-air-and-get-crushed-by-it, but almost all the others are one-off tricks where you have to discover some completely unsignposted rule.  There's one level where you jump and don't fall, another where you have to try and wrap around the level, and one where you have to seemingly glitch your way through a fan that blows you upwards, just to name a few.  Oh, and there's blue and orange portals in some levels.  Because of course there are.Can we please stop paying homage to Portal in our puzzle games?  I know every game would like to strive for the same level of wit, character, and solid design, but if you had those things in spades, then the ref would only hold you back.On that note, the whole Squishy the Pig, deal with the pig devil, etc narrative that drew you in really doesn't go beyond just that much as a framing device at the beginning and end.  Don't expect to see Squishy or any of the antagonists portrayed beyond one or two sentences a pop.  Of course, I've been platforming since the dawn of the 90s so I can accept a back-of-the-box type story.  Still, strong character can save an otherwise mediocre game, especially if it proves a draw in the first place.The art style's a bit of a mixed bag.  The game is pleasantly colorful and some of the sprites are appealing.  Squishy's idle animation does make him look nervous and sweaty, for instance.  But then you've got a slew of boxes and platforms and buttons that look very MS Painty.  The art's not going to carry this one, but it's not offensive overall.What is a bit offensive is how buggy the game is.  During my first run through - before the latest patch - I found the exterminator's bonanza, but even during a quick refresher run of a couple levels before this review I got stuck in a wall, missing assets stopped me from beating a level, and the final boss looped forever outside of my reach.  Now, the dev is passionate enough about the game to keep patching it, but then again, should it be on sale on Steam if it still needs that much work?Of course, if you're just getting this game because it goes on sale for less money than you'll get for selling the digital trading cards then Squishy will live up to all your desires! And why did you read this review anyway?  10/10, etcBut yeah, it is cheap this one.  I guess as one last point in its favor before the damning post: it's not like it will cost you much to try.  Mostly your time.  And that's the big reason why I can't thumb this one up:  it's just too damn smug about wasting my time when it can't see fit to fix its own issues.  That's what all that fooling with you up top was about.Again, sorry about that.  I actually think you are discerning and very smart for reading my review."

Too often i find myself in situations where death simply was unavoidable. It happens so frequently that it makes me wonder if that was supposed to be this game's gimmick?Now, I’m not strictly talking about the Insane bosses I would also like to point out the at times unresponsive controls which lead me to fall into a pit or to leap over a platform because the moving platform I jumped from gave me too much momentum. This can get very frustrating and random obstacles like the sand pits in level 2-8 with no apparent purpose suddenly starts to make sense, they were put there to make backtracking take even longer and the player’s experience so much worse at other times it is the weird level design that gets me (yes I’m looking at you level 2-4 with awkward jump you had to make which apparently is “skill based”) or subtle hints like “Gur nafjre vf sbhe naq fvk” which I’m sure has a logical explanation to it that I’m just too stupid to translate, only problem is that the text disappears after 5 seconds and no, there’s no way for you to go up to the sign and read what it said again as it would in any normal game, you have to exit the level to read it again.All this is disregarding the various bugs like when I had to exit a level and “Restart and “Exit” did literally the same, forcing me to either complete the level or close the game or getting pushed into a block so that I couldn’t move and had to restart.Final words: I’ve tried my best to make this review as objective as I could but would I recommend this to anyone else? Definitely not!Where does this game shine? I think the idea of having to lose your life is a neat idea that I’m pretty fond of, it’s what hooked me in the beginning but I’m afraid that’s all...not even the music which I know is subjective is very repetitive to me."

But it has enough problems with its design that I quit playing before beating the first boss.I'm playing with a keyboard. It never told me which keys do what, no tutorial or anything. The options menu doesn't have key configuration. The only time the in-game hints said anything about the cotrollers was to press Y (as in y in the xbox controller) to restart the level.Inconsistency in the game rules are bad. I considered stacking a couple of crates to kill myself early in the game and noted that was not possible;  you can't push the box underneath. Then at a later level that's exactly how you're supposed to kill yourself, and then it works.Poor level design. Early on there's a level divided in two parts: part A has you doing a long, boring and obnoxious platforming. Not challenging, just a chore. Then you get to the second part, where you have to push a crate and run so it falls on your head. Time it right and the box falls before you get there, which means starting the level over.Anyway, it's not a horrible game. I could see it as a good game with small tweaks here and there."

As the store page description will tell you about the game, you play as Squishy, a child pig who wants to reunite with his family in heaven, and needs to kill himself over and over to fulfill his deal with the devil. The concept is pretty unique and the first few levels shows this idea in full, where you must figure out how to get yourself killed in each stage...Each stage that wants you to die, at least, and this is one of the biggest issues with the game: it lacks consistancy in concept. Sprawled throughout the game's many levels are challenges were the idea is to NOT die, which defeats the purpose of the game's core concept, and these challenges range from racing a knock-off angry bird, to simply reaching the end of a very long stage, so that you can aquire a key to advance. Failure in completing the sequence required to finish the level will force you to restart the stage, be it by your own mistake or because of terrible RNG (random number generation for those who don't know).To add to the game's inconsistancy, there are boss fights in which you must also survive, but if for whatever reason you need to stop playing before you actually defeat the boss, you must replay the entire stage that leads up to that boss before you can get another crack at them, which can be painful when going for achievements tied to them, like slaying them on higher difficulties. The difficulty system is used exclusively for the bosses, in no way can you change the difficulty of the other levels or the game in general. The only thing I can see that the difficulty does is increase the number of objects a boss throws at you, and how more punishing the RNG gets with those objects, as beyond the first boss (which was kind enough to show you where a box was gonna fall), you get no indicator on where they'll land.The various platforming required in the game, regardless of how inconsistent the concept gets, is sluggish and bugged, where landing from a high enough platform will seem to stun you for half a second, preventing you from jumping again (which can lead to a forced restart on the stages not letting you die). On top of bugged jumps, sometimes you can jump at a wall and get stuck there, as though you were pushing against a crate, but fortunately moving in the opposite direction of said wall will let you fall back down. There are also various moving platforms in the game, and they conjure up mobility bonuses and penalties, based on when you try to jump off them, assuming the speed of the platform hasn't simply caused it to move out from under your own feet!The game revels in trolling you with cheap gimmicks that is not shared between all levels, like wrapping the screen when you walk to the left to come out on the very right side of the level, or preventing you from quiting the game to solve a puzzle that seemingly has no solution (alt+F4 still works, but still, what the hell, developers!?). In addition to the trolling gimmicks, every world contains a secret hat shop level you can gain access to that, until you have essentially beaten the game 100% with bosses slain on insane difficulty, does nothing and prevents you from using vanity items on Squishy.This game will stump you, it will frustrate you, and you will not want to continue playing. If this game was only puzzles that stuck to the game's concept, perhaps it would be worth picking up, but no, that is not the case."

However he is sent to hell as suicide is a sin and is told by the devel if he can pass the devels challenges he will be risen to heaven.The platforming sections are fun and yet can be very difficult, the puzzle sections are fun and the boss battles are great! this game can be considered a great one!

Also there are levels where you find out what you were supposed to do (drop a box somewhere) only when it's too late to do so. So most of the time you spend repeating the same easy puzzle just to get another attempt at the challenging part of a level.The game ceases to be fun after an hour.

Why??? Surely this one would have been OBVIOUS!- The levels get longer and longer and because the game is so finicky with crate placement and because you can't drag crates, any slight mistakes mean you have to start a level over again. This repetitiveness becomes frustrating quickly and something like a rewind (ala Braid) or a checkpoint system would have been really good- The physics don't quite work the way one would expect (even for a game where rotational motion seems to have been kept to a minimum). For example, if you push a large crate off a moving platform, it will still assume all of the momentum it had from the platform, even though you applied an opposing force to it and that it's heavy e.g. pushing a crate to the right off of a left moving platform makes the crate still fall sharply to the left. Most SDK's come with fundamental physics modules that should cover this- The main game mechanic of finding a way to commit suicide is broken in later levels in favour of surviving. This starves the main concept of further development- The tutorial sort of explains the game, but the game doesn't really teach the player how to play beyond this and means guidance needs to be saught on the internet. For example, early on in the game, the levels are cluttered with extra crates or objects that don't need to be used, which lead to confusion and give the player no real way to figure out what to do next or how to finish the level. Each new level should introduce 1 new mechanic while re-enforcing previously learnt mechanics and the new mechanic should be extremely obvious to the player. Only later on should the player be taught that levels contain useless objects once a few different mechanics have been taught and re-enforced.The one thing I do like about the game though is the artwork and this would have really been brought to life with higher resolution textures and sprites and more frames with each of the animations. I guess these shortcomings are reminiscent of the game itself. It's not really sure of what it is or how it's supposed to be played and enjoyed and so it's not sure if it's meant to be a pixel game or a vector graphics game.So, if you want to play a game with a piggy protagonist, I would recommend you play Mr. Bree instead."

The puzzles stayed simple and easy but took longer and longer, time consuming does not mean more effort, it just means more time waiting before you can say ""Hey, I did it"". The best part of a puzzle game is that ""AHA!"" moment and I just wasn't getting that with this game, instead it was more of a ""Finally finished."" I'm not saying this wasn't worth playing, for its price it is worth the gameplay, but as a game I was let down quite a bit.

The whole point of the game is to find a way to die on each level by solving platforming puzzles, except the few where you need to stay alive, which is cool, but the levels can be long and hard. With no check point system and kind of sloppy controls, I ended up getting stuck towards the end of the levels where I needed to die or dying on the levels where I didn't need to die far too often and ended up having to restart over and over again.

They stay around for wayyyy too long.Secondly, I encountered a couple of glitches, including the ability to walk on thin air, and being stood on top of a spring block without bouncing. In the same level.Third, this game employs ""adventure game logic"", meaning that unless you're the creator, some levels are gonna make no sense. Like the ""walk left and pop out the other side of the level"" level was just...stupid. And a one-time thing, as far as I can tell. I wouldn't know, I couldn't get past the fifth level.Oh, and the reason for needing to die? Yeah, okay, but the levels that you have to NOT DIE? Clue's in the name of the game as to why that shouldn't be the case, like, ever.Survival is bugged, too. The second ball ALWAYS gets stuck in place, until about fifty seconds in where it suddenly starts moving. Once, both balls got stuck INSIDE EACHOTHER.

And if you are moving a block and it does not make a perfect square next to it you are ♥♥♥♥ed, since the ♥♥♥♥ing pig just floats in the air unless it is a perfect square, and it has to be pixel perfect. jumps are incredibly awkward and apparentally the dev was too lazy to have the game go fullscreen on launch, kinda like another game I know, it goes by Hyper then Dimension and something about Neptune or something. and if you right click, you teleport anywhere you please. This isn't a secret code or something, you simply right click and congrats, you beat the game. Honestly this game was 14 cents and I got it so I can make like a 4 cent profit from the cards I sold, but it really wasn't worth it.I would say ""but♥♥♥♥♥♥it was 99 cents"", but sadly it wasn't ): . don't buy this game, rather go on some flash game site and play something there. it's free and probably better designed than this."

Although, the devil is ""bored"" and gives him a chance to go to pig heaven, but first he needs to complete his ""challenges""Your challenge is to kill yourself.No joke.The main objective is to kill yourself, except, it's a lot easier said than done. Instead of just getting a gun and holding it up to your head, you have to think stratigically and move boxes and push buttons until you ultimately die.It's a puzzler, except you're trying to kill yourself.The only thing I don't like about this game is that if you mess up JUST THE TINIEST BIT, you have to restart the entire thing. Say you accidently push a box too much and you can't push it to where you need to- you have to restart the entire level over again. There are no checkpoints. Other than that, there is NOTHING that I hate about this game.For the low low price of $0.14, you should DEFINITELY get this game. It even has cards, so you'll get your money back without a doubt.

I had to roll my eyes - yet another trashy indie game using cheap sales/mass giveaway stunts to get into as many hands as possible after getting raked over the coals. Saying that it was from the developers of Hero Siege meant little to me - I had never played that game. And yet, Squishy looked kind of interesting. A puzzle/platformer where you have to kill yourself? It was dirt cheap, I could give it a chance.Squishy was good. Surprisingly good!Squishy's parents were slaughtered, and the little piggy kills himself in an attempt to reunite with them in Heaven. His suicide sends him to Hell instead, but luckily the devil is bored and offers him a challenge that can get him into Heaven: cross four worlds and find ways to kill himself. Easier said than done!Each level is a puzzle you have to navigate to open the way to your intended death, which can be anything from finding a level to open a trap door over a bottomless pit or launching a box to crush yourself. The puzzles are clever and sometimes ask you think outside of the box. The game also switches things up with boss fights and key races where you have to navigate and obtain a key quickly, both of which are scenarios where youdon'twant to die. The visuals are good, though the music is a bit quiet, and there are collectable apples and other challenges for the completionists. If you like puzzle platformers, you can't really go wrong here."

Less than an hour in it gives up on its premise and forces you to play a level where dying makes you fail, which is annoying and frustrating. Many levels rely on you figuring out game mechanics that are never explained. The game is buggy. Stages often make you redo time consuming and finicky puzzles because you didn't do a later puzzle right on the first try. Luckily, the cards from this game made me £0.12 and I only paid £0.09,  so I consider it well worth negative three pence.Also they left in a testing function so you can teleport anywhere in any level with right click, so that makes things pretty easy."

,Not Recommended,318430,19354112,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,twitch.tv/omertaaaaa,"I loved this game until stage 2-10, Jesse Boom Coyote or whatever his name was. That boss is a perfect example of terrible game design. The crates of explosives he throws are completely randomized and poorly coded, causing your player to slide, acting as a magnet pulling you back towards it. On top of that, the physics of the explosives seems completely random. If you manage to damange Jesse's home, he falls on his face only to reappear seconds later with some strange hovercrate as he proceeds to drop more crap on top of you. Granted, there is more pattern to his second wind, and it's fairly easy to identify. However, the amount of tediousness required to get to that point is often frustrating enough that you end up quitting after repeated failed attempts. It's a test of your patience, and I have failed.Therefore, I do not recommend this game because of the sheer annoyance of this boss. Perhaps a little drastic, but after spending 12 hours playing this game and 6 hours on a single boss without any sort of progress leaves a bitter taste in my mouth."

It is an extremely emotional game in which you can relate to the protagonist more than you have ever related to anyone. How you ask? It'll make you want to commit suicide at points, just like this pig. It gives you these suicidal thoughts because of the fact that if you push a box or blow something up or die... You have to start the level over.However, the dying part brings me to my next point. In a game where you're supposed to die to advance, I have found that in at least one level, if you die, you lose, which in my opinion, contradicts with the point of the game.Overall, this game is completely worth the money and y'all should buy it now.

When platformers usually ask you to survive obstacles to live for another level, the point of the game here is to find a way to die to live again in the next level (this pig has plenty of lives).The puzzle isn't bad, it pushes your brain to tick. But as the level progresses you'll find that the game is designed less to challenge your wits and skill than to force you to retry, retry, and retry - again and again. As the levels become more difficult, the game asks you to spend more time to retry; all too often you won't understand the whole level until you're stuck in a certain point, so you have to retry, then you pass that point, and then you're stuck again, and then retry, etc until you actually finish the level. This is so frustrating because it really takes time to redo the level from the beginning. Even the game seems to realize that on some level they give you a ""retry point"".This game is actually not the worst game I've ever played. I'd say even in its simplistic form, this game has its uniqueness. However the ""retry madness"" isn't just bearable to me. If only this game is moddable - as in, people can create their own level - it can be much better perhaps. Alas, it is not.So unless you have plenty of time to spare with this trial and error fest, Suicidal Pig would only make you suicidal."

,Not Recommended,318430,33414784,Posted: 9 July,all,Cuddly Kitty,"NOTE: Played with a 360 controllerAlthough the idea was interesting, the execution is not so much.  This game obviously had little to no playtesting and suffers from inconsistent flow, wall clipping glitches, intermittently erratic jump responsiveness, very poor utilization of checkpoints, and significant misalignment between certain animations and their respective hit boxes.  Examples of the latter incude most explosions and the final boss fight.The game suffers from a weird sort of identity disorder in that it shifts back and forth between its original premise and poorly trying to emulate the likes of Super Meat Boy with twice the tedium and a weak plot explanation.  More thought should've been put into finding a way to keep everything on course.  The boss battles are also aggravating and poorly thought out; the second and third bosses are very luck-based.While some of the stages are interesting like one stage near the end of World 2 that featured a mess of teleport orbs over a bottomless pit, there were also some very obscure points.  For example, in 3-5, you're expected to somehow know that you can multijump, despite the fact that you can't do so in any other stage and there's no indication that would point to this fact."

76561198068443330,Not Recommended,318430,34153381,Posted: 10 August,all,sirnamak,"This is a game with a very interesting central mechanic. It creates puzzles based around finding a way to kill  your character. But the puzzle design feels stale, and doesn't add new mechanics in an interesting way. The other half of the game is ultra difficult traditional platform levels, that would work but the platforming is just not smooth enough for the difficulty to be entirely enjoyable. There are also a host of technical issues, including a mechanic in a boss fight that allows you to skip half the fight.This was obviously added for the developer to test the fight but %100 should have been taken out before shipping. I finished this game, and considering I spent 40 cents it was definitely worth the money, but there are better 2D puzzle platformers, and better ultra hard platformers out there you should play."
