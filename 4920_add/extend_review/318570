76561198053422627,Recommended,318570,11980508,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"My Video Review on Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L-zCopQ3-0Fun little game, and most definitely a challenge.  The randomness in the game pretty much guarantees that no two games will be exactly the same.  Graphics are good enough and very much resemble the ever popular Plants Vs Zombies style.You basic goal is to assemble a big and well enough equipped group of warriors to defeat Dracula when you find him, as he is one tough hombre.  Find him by accident too early in the game, and you best stay out of his way, and hope you have enough defense built up to survive his attack.The game begins with your base tower in the middle of a dark town that will expand as you explore it.  This town is completely random every time you play the game.  You can click on any building to explore it, and each time take a chance on a ""battle"" scenario explained below.  There are several different types of buildings that give you different benefits when explored.  For example exploring a house will light it up and give you a new companion to your team, always seeming to start at level 1.  Opening a hospital gives you the ability to heal wounded warriors from battles by sending that warrior ""away"" for 1-5 turns, each turn being one more click of a building to explore.  Other buildings give you additial defense that you are trying to protect against the undead in the battles, while still other buildings such as gun shops can give your warriors better weapons to fight with.Any time you click any building, you have what seems to be about a 15% chance of entering a battle against a random number and type of undead creatures, and if lucky (or unlucky enough) you will also find Dracula himself attacking your defenses.  Your goal here on these screens is to prevent the undead zombies, liches, skeletons, and more from beating down your defenses to 0.  This happens in a gameplay style that very much resembles that of Plants Vs Zombies with the baddies coming at you from the right side and you placing your warrior(s) on the left to try and take them down before they reach your wooden spiked fence behind you on the left side of the screen.  Should they get past you, they will die on the spiked fence, but not before taking down your defense total which starts at 200 each game.  They also might kill or wound your warriors you place in the battlefield.  Die, and say so long for good to them.  Wounds can be healed by sending them away for 1 to 5 turns at a hospital, assuming you have uncovered one.All in all, a fun little single player challenge that is worth the $5 asking price IMO.  Watch my video above for a better demonstration of how the game plays.Hope this helps you, and good luck should you find Dracula early on!  You'll need it!  ;-)"

I feel like a game needs to have at least $1 per hour of fun and this game accomplishes that.This game introduces permadeath, gold/upgrade carry over, and procedurally generated everything into the Plants VS Zombie gameplay.There is no story to speak of, Van Helsing say hey go kill Dracula. That is the story. But we don’t need no stinking story.

I REALLY like the mesh of genres behind this game, and what they've set out to do here. The problem is in the execution:- Tips pop up at the wrong times, and sometimes can't be closed.- Actual tooltips are non-existant, as in appearing when something is hovered - and they could really be used here. Which tells me that this was probably a mobile port.- Lack of information about your existing bonuses and effects.- Fixed resolutionOverall, I think the gameplay behind this is pretty solid, but the execution flaws are just too many in order for me to feel compelled to play more, and thus I have to give this one a No, even tho I like what it wants to do. If this were an Early Access game, I'd be excited to see the end result. Unfortunately it isn't."

It's an interesting concept of making Plants vs Zombies a rogue-lite. I think the game needs a bit better style of tutorial, it attempts to teach you really important things with popup boxes and if you skip it, you have to learn the hard way.  You really need to read everything the game tells you. It's super duper important you realize that houses closer to your base have easier fights. I think a good strategy is never spend your gold on actual fights, just spend it on the upgrades that carry over. I heard another gripe about having to ""grind"" out the upgrades but I was able to get every upgrade within 3.3 hours of playtime. I honestly think my biggest complaint is that the actual combat characters' models and animations look goofy. Also, I haven't beaten Dracula yet but there may be a replayability issue after I do."

You will die at first and many times thereafter, but the clicking on buildings to power yourself up (or face a potentially deadly attack) is a creative idea.Could one say that the game makes itself seem longer than it is by forcing you to replay it too many times to build up enough money to buy the upgrades for each run? Yes, but for me it never became frustratingly obnoxious because I enjoyed the gameplay enough to continue. Eventually you buy up all the skills and beat the game, but probably not much before then. I also beat the game on hard mode.I hope this game gets a sequel since I think this type of building off the familiar with a new concept deserves to be encouraged and expanded upon. A sequel with a more elaborate upgrade tree, more character classes, and a slightly less tedious start to the game would be awesome. But even in its flawed form it is still fun to play, and I enjoyed this more than Plants vs. Zombies 2."

Each game should take you between 30 mins to 1 hour to complete, perfect for lunch hour entertainment.You will fail for your first 10 games or so while you learn and earn points to upgrade your team for your next playthrough. Everytime you play, your starting team gets a little better and eventually your are capable of killing Dracula.It is well worth the price."
76561198062930115,Recommended,318570,15497781,"Posted: 22 April, 2015",all,DG Dobrev,"A rather difficult rogue-like game, which can be a big time sink if you want to beat it. In essence, you need to find and defeat Dracula in a randomly generated map with various buildings that provide your stronghold with soldiers, various bonuses, buffs or weapons. Your soldiers can equip a weapon that has various range, power and limitations, and also need to rest, meaning that some strategic thinking must still be used. Battles take place in a rectangle 5-lane grid Plants vs Zombies style, and just like in PvZ, you need to face off against opponents of various difficulty (with their own range, power, HP and limitations), and eventually defeat Dracula, the final boss.The Good:1. The artwork.2. The replayability.3. The price.4. The gameplay.5. The strategic battles.The Bad:1. The game can be downright unfair.2. The game can be really infuriating.3. The game expects you to grind for a while and get some upgrades in roder to ease your path to victory.The conclusion:Based on the pleasant artwork, it's price (1,25 on sale now) and decent gameplay as well as challenge, I am willing to give the thumbs up to this game. Being a rogue-like, the bad things I mentioned are completely forgivable, because, let's face it, that's exactly what you should expect from a rogue-like game."

Really it is just grinding to get the upgrades then using the Blade wannabe character to take out Dracula. There is some strategy involved in placing your characters. Some. Once you get all the upgrades, beating the game shouldn't be too much of a problem. All in all, was cheaper than goingout to a movie."

It's sort of a mashup between FTL and plants vs zombies. You click locations on a city map every turn to unlock power ups with the chance of finding monsters. Eventually you'll run across Dracula and the goal is to kill him.Your party starts off weak but so do the monsters. As you upgrade your guys the fights get tougher and tougher so you have to make some tactical decisions about deployment strategies. You need to use enough firepower to keep the monsters from crushing your base during one fight but also have enough left over for tomorrow's fight. All the while you have to manage training for experience, turns spend healing and regenerating ability points used for deployment. It seems simple at first but there's really a lot of management going on. It's quite fun and so cheap, you will get your money's worth."

Didn't think so.)  Much like in life, you start with a single building.  Around you, fading into the distance, more buildings.  I'll be honest, in 1.7 hours I still don't know what they all do.  Some of them give you people, some give you guns.  The rest?  What am I, an FAQ?You click where you want and things change color.  Sometimes weird monsters come at you and you have to defend humanity, Plants vs Zombies style.  You'll lose.  Sometimes the very first thing you click on ends the game.  At the end of the game you get points you can spend to upgrade how you start.  More people, better guns, things and stuff.Staying alive the first few clicks becomes easier the more times you fail the human race.  Eventually, you'll have 30+ buildings under your control, a huge army, tons of weapons.  You'll feel tough.  Then you'll click on something and all your people will decide they're sleepy and you get to watch as a horde of smug looking monsters walk from right to left unopposed so they can show you a game over screen.This review would not be complete without mentioning the teleporting Dracula.  Randomly he appears on the battlefield, warping from place to place.  Don't bother deploying troops to stop him, as he warps behind them and that's about it.It is a fun game in it's way.  I can't see someone putting dozens of hours in to it, but for $5 it's a fun couple of plays.  It's on sale as I write this.  $1.24.  Less than a cup of coffee, unless you get that 99 cent stuff at a gas station.  Which there isn't anything wrong with, mind you.  It can still be great coffee."

Actions like resting, healing and training are all necessary, but keeps your Hunters from fighting. To win you carefully need to balance between which to keep present for combat, and which you can savely miss a few turns.While the first few games you're bound to loose to find that sweet spot, you gain gold which you can use to gain permanent upgrades to your game-start, making things easier aswell.Turns (or days) progress by capturing buildings, each one serving serving a different function to reinforce your team.Inevitably, you'll find opponents in these structures and combat starts. Combat follows the ""Plants vs. Zombies"" lane principles, where the Hunters you can put to action depend on which you didn't send off for healing/training or are too fatigued (no Action Points) to fight. While the amount of units and opponents is limited, the primary difficuly from these sections does not stem from what to use against what foe as in PvZ, but more what units did you have available, and are you capable to deal with the loss of Action Points and Health in preperation for the next fight."

,Recommended,318570,13560730,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Terroriza,"This game is hard to get a good idea from looking at it on the store page. It is really good though, I got it on sale and have been very pleased.  It's kind of like plants vs zombies as far as gameplay, but has much less variation in units you control. They do however add new and unique elements to it to make it not simply a boring clone of pvz which is what a lot of these games turn out to be.The game does require a whole lot of luck in order to beat it. You are not going to beat this early on, not until you have played and died tons of times. Not until you have played and built up enough gold in order to add global upgrades for all new games. It's good and bad in that sense, it makes it not too easy or short, but also a bit frustrating that it is almost impossible early on. I saw one review that said you don't run into monsters that often, but I seem to get attacked 1 out of every 2 or 3 moves that I make.  Part of winning is just pure luck that you click on a spot and simply don't get attacked during the round your players are resting. If you run into an attack your first 3/4 or 5 clicks it's going to be tough b/c your guys will be resting and you can't do anything which just lets your village get destroyed. You could also start off and not get attacked for 6 turns in a row with time to build up a nice army. This randomness gives me so many mixed feelings on this game. I have had several games that I run into dracula on my 2nd or 3rd enemy encounter and then it's either game over or nearly game over.Overall the game is good enough to get a thumbs up and is worth what I paid, but with a few tweaks it could of been a great game which I would of preferred over PvZ. It would be better if they added a system where you only run into an enemy every so many turns or showing you have certain turns which you know you won't hit an enemy, maybe even a ladder type system where you climb your way up while still having the town. Also, not being able to run into certain mobs unless your so far out from the center of town would be good too. I can't figure out the system in which the type of enemies spawn. I can sometimes select all the squares near the start then move outwards and run into very tough mobs a bit later on. Other times if I skip some closer squares then hit them just a little bit later all of a sudden its a crazy tough mob, then when I click the square far away it's a super weak mob.There needs to be some kind of system other than what appears to be just 100% pure randomness with everything involved. You can even keep it being random if they had something where after a preset # of turns you take then brings a new enemy type into the mix. So that you know for 100% that within your first 5 turns you won't have a chance of running into tougher mobs. Then at 10 turns a new enemy type will randomly appear in the mix as well. It just needs some order to it to go from good / ok to great."

There's an upgrade section where you can spend your gold to become stronger for your next run. My advice is to try and get all the gold you can at the start, buy all the upgrades and then put your tactician cap on.The main view acts as a board game where you click on different buildings that provide you with resources. However, each building has the potential to go into a battle to shoot down horror inspired villains.The game lacks polish with no resolution options and outdated graphics. There's not much content in this overall package, but being a permadeath game, I can understand why. I still would like to see more classes, upgrades, enemy types and a better UI experience. The developer does seem active listening to the community, so updates look like they're on the way.Grab this game on sale, it's worth it because the ideas work well and you will have a great time experiencing a unique title in a market usually flooded with similar gameplay styles."

The moody ambiant track was actually memorable and made the game worthy of returning to in small doses. Feels distantly like a primitive underachieved tablet version of Darkest DungeonsA board style game with tower defense combat. Good atmosphere and core concept but dev did not fully realize in execution leaving a grindy repetitive clumsy and rather unbalanced experience to deal with.Great game but feels like an alpha. Game tells you to follow clues of Van Helsing to find Dracula but I played this for over 5 hours and I never saw any such thing. From what I can tell Dracula, which is the main goal, can spawn at any time in early zones or in advanced zones and there is no rhyme or reason to it. End boss battle not well thought out, game has you grind all abilities to max to start out with a decent chance at being able to play and not die immediately.Every tile that is 1 hex away from start location is zone 1 - 2 hexes are zone 2 and difficulty scales up rapidly. Each hex can be one of nine districts which improve an aspect of your faction every turn, for example being able to heal quicker for the hospitals. User interface is a little on the clunky side.Rapid movement on the combat map is difficult, the action points based system is hard to balance with health management. The inability to go to the next turn without having to explore is disappointing especially mid game when you need to recover and are forced to go several zones in just to uncover a square and make the days pass, exposing you to very real risks of a game over encounter.The end goal is to kill Dracula which is an overpowered unique monster that sometimes telegraphs that he is in the fight by taunting you and then showing up as a random spawn. He teleports around, can tank way too much damage and moves through the battlefield way too fast. With no way to pin him down it would take nothing short of a massive grinded army of guys to take him down.Because yeah, this is plants vs zombies, but instead of just having a card u spend coins on to spawn towers, you get ONE tower when you uncover a house tile, which you can customize with a weapon from the gun shop tile, and thats it, you gotta babysit this tower because when it dies it is gone forever. So achievement this level of grind would be no small feat, and after all the grind necessary to even get this game started thats a daunting prospect. Because yeah, the game starts you off in a tower defense with one tower, most basic weapon, and then spawns foes on all lanes.You cant win, and have to grind to have a starting deck that can even remotely put up some kind of a defense. Even then there are a lot of spinning plates all at once and you will mess up sooner or later. I think if this game had been retweaked it could had been really good but it has been released a long time ago and I am not expecting the gameplay to fundamentally change."

Each hunter only has a linited number of action points before they have to be rested and made inactive, they can also be replenished if you find resources to do so. while this is a nice idea in principle you can not skip a turn as such when a hunter is rested for AP or in hospital you still have to explore and each time you explore there is a risk of an encounter and if theres no active hunter or you lack AP then your base gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥On principle all this sounds ok and it is ... sort of. as you play you earn points, these points can be used during battles to heal your hunters, kill all mobs on screen, as an xp boost etc, however these points are also the some points that are used to buy upgrades on the main menu that carry over all future games, such as starting with more hunters, increased starting level of hunters, better and more starting guns, strong base defences etc.Now heres the key gripe, the game is impossible to beat without significant investment in these upgrades, you simply grind the game to get the points to purchase all the upgrades from the main menu and then once done you play your final playthrough and complete the game.There are no high score tables, no achievements to earn and as such little point in playing the game beyond earning trading cards.As stated by others this feels very much like a freemium mobile game and I'm such it would have been a reasonable concept for it however asking £3.99 for this game when there are alternatives like Rebuild and Rebuild 2 available to play for free on the web paying for this game just does not make any sense.There is no story, and no challange or reward for wanting to play this game any further, each time you play you'll earn points towards and upgrade and with each upgrade you will last that bit longer untill you have purchased enough upgrades to last long enough to complete the game and then thats it, the end.Dev Feedback -Add a high score tableMake it so that hunters can move to anywhere on the board with one move not just one square up/down/left/rightSeperate points used for ingame battle bonuses and menu upgrades***EDIT***Well after a few more hours of playthrough I am about to ""complete"" the game having obtained all upgrades and it's fair to say it has even more issues. The UI is too big and you can not zoom out far enough, once you explore 4 or 5 buildings away from your base buildings appear obstructed by the UI and even off the screen and are in accessable, it is entirely possible to break the game by running out of buildings to expore on screen if you do not kill the boss before doing so. Either needs a higher res which is not adjustable in game or ability to zoom out further.***EDIT#2***Having just completed the game and a little late to find out you can move the screen around holding LMB down and moving mouse, something that could have perhaps been mentioned somewhere as it is kind of important."

When they work together correctly the game can be a lot of fun. It is unfortunate then, that the game tends to be more a jumbled mess of interesting ideas than a coherent whole.You start out with a few wannabe vampire hunters and begin taking the city back from those bloodsuckers. Combat plays out like plants versus zombies, except your vampire hunters don't have nearly the range or the firepower to really hold their own, even when they have the upgraded weapons. There's a leveling system in place that makes them slightly more formidable but the enemies still seem vastly overpowered.It's also often impossible to tell which lane the enemies are coming down so planning for them all to come from one area and having them all come from the other is soul crushing, especially since moving your soldiers around is unnecessarily hard. The combat isn't terrible, and I did enjoy it when I felt like I had struck the right balance, but that happened far less often than it should have.Let's talk about the cocky piece of crap Dracula. He'll show up basically at any time and screw up your day. This is by far the games most terrible offense. It's basically impossible to kill him with your starting crew, yet he can show up and ♥♥♥♥ up their day within the first few encounters. He'll keep showing up to, and he does considerable damage to your fort if he makes it past your team.Pretty much every time I've lost its because he showed up and wrecked my undergeared soldiers.Healing your soldiers is arduous because they're sent away to the hospital for long periods of time. I could accept that on its own but the amount of time versus the healing done is atrocious in a game where its all about how many men you can field rather than something more tactical like X-Com where a few soldiers CAN pull off the seemingly impossible. Having half your team out of the fight when a big encounter comes up makes you want to throw your keyboard.There's a lot of cool stuff here, but none of it is applied all that well. There are four weapon types, only two of which I found useful. The enemies are cool in concept but vastly overpowered and often times spawning in such great numbers that a full squadron can simply not kill them fast enough. Like I said, I really want to like this game. There are times when I had fun, but I don't think I can reccomend this when there are better alternatives out there.I give it a 5.5/10"

With enough knowledge and skill you can over-come nearly anything that a game can throw at you. Not so with Hunters of the Dead. So much of this game relies on the roll of the dice that you cannot even begin to have enough skill to win. You're supposed to build up your forces from game to game with the upgrades, but that requires that you actually win fights. While you can 'win' fights, you can't even begin to do well. You'll collect maybe five hundred coins before dying, and you need at least three times that to get even one upgrade. The upgrades themselves don't help enough to prolong your game enough to actually kill Dracula. Don't bother with this game, it isn't worth the money."

Its more like a randomized luck based board game with resource management and Plants Vs. Zombies battle sequences.with that out of the wayHunters of the Dead is an extremely simple game. Definitely one of those easy to learn, difficult to master sorts of things. Some of the in-game instructions aren't completely clear (I'm still not sure what the gadget shop does), but it doesn't matter since the game itself is so straightforward and basic.The only real annoying thing that sort of ruins Hunters of the Dead is the frequency of Dracula encounters. The goal of the game is to kill Dracula, and you'll randomly fight him as you click on buildings. A little too frequently it seems. Dracula is tough and cheap, so its normal to either be too weak to stop him or incapable of damaging him enough as he teleports around. The result is he causes lots of damage. Even after buying out all the powerups and wiping the floor with the normal enemies, Dracula continues to ruin my day as I seemingly can't avoid the somebeatch and I'm never strong enough to kill him.Despite how difficult it is to beat, Hunters of the Dead is stupidly addicting and fun (if annoying). Its a diamond in the rough of the $5 section. Highly recommended."

Its all a grind game to get better - no skill needed - all luck based.There are hardly any options to configure game, the lack of in depth explanation of a couple of the mechanics, the amount of rest to gain back a couple of action points and then rest at a hospital gives so little in health back even with several hospitals its just not balanced. 3 days to get back 4 action points when it takes 2 just to deploy 1 troop and 1 if you move him during battle its just not fun and you can expect some battles to not even have a single troop to take the field becuse they ahve to rest and so your base will take damage, sometimes enough to just make you lose the game.Yes its a roguelite but this is just choices during design phase that are hard to comprehend."

Она использует механику Plants vs Zombies, но при этом тут мало контроля над набором ""башенок"". Это не рогалик тоже, потому что игра полагается ТОЛЬКО на рандом.Суть такая. Город, который нужно защитить от Дракулы. Дракула насылает на город нежить. Нужно защитить последнюю базу сопротивления от нежити и по возможности убить Дракулу. Вот-с.На карте города разбросаны дома. В некоторых прячутся выжившие, их можно завербовать в качестве охотников на вампиров. В некоторых расположены оружейные магазинчики. Не стрелять же бойцам из ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥енького пистолета всю жизнь, правда? Есть аптеки, которые ускоряют выздоровление героев, есть пивнушки, куда бегут отдыхать уставшие бойцы, есть магазины и кладбища, дающие бонусные деньги и экспу для персонажей.Здания открываются по очереди. Кликнули на одно - бонус. На второе кликнули - бонус. На третье - ой, на нас напааалии.И вот здесь включается боевка. Клеточки, как в PvZ, по ним шагают зомби-скелеты, как в PvZ, на их пути расставляем бойцов из заначки. В зависимости от того, какое оружие парни выловили в оружейных магазинах (чистый рандом, повлиять никак нелья), у них изменяется площадь атаки. В отличие от PvZ, сколько у нас бойцов есть, столько мы выставить и сможем. Они еще могут сместиться на пару клеток, если пунктов выносливости хватает, но не более того.Очевидный вопрос: а может ли случиться так, что нападающих будет больше, чем защитников? Ну, мало ли, может убьют кого, что тогда делать?А вот и главная проблема. Да, количество зомбаков МОЖЕТ быть больше, чем герои смогут сдержать. Игроку может просто не повезти на выживших, может Дракула со своими войсками объявится на втором ходе, а может у солдат закончится выносливость (примерно три пункта на брата, один тратится за высадку во время боя и еще по одному за каждое перемещение), и тогда они пойдут бухать всей толпой. Кто останется драться? Может вообще никого не остаться. Зомби будут маршировать свободно.Дойдут до конца поля - снимут у базы немного здоровья. Здоровье дойдет до нуля - ну, вы понимаете.Теоретически таких неприятных ситуаций можно избежать. Допустим, повезет найти кучу народа, и кучу пивнушек для них, чтобы они отдыхали быстрее, а еще отспавнится куча старых фортификаций, которые можно разобрать на кирпичи для базы. А может и не повезти, тут чистый рандом. Каждый - абсолютно каждый - ход может закончиться дракой. Количество нападающих предугадать тоже непросто. Более того, время от времени вылезает сам Дракула. Он быстро движется, телепортируется с клетки на клетку и в драке 1 на 1 может закошмарить любого охотника. Если пройдет, то врежет по штаб-квартире в три раза больнее, чем любой монстр.Чтобы игра не казалась такой уж несправедливой, в игре есть четыре пауэрапа, которые можно активровать на вырученные за победы (если таковые будут) деньги: можно дать солдатам двойную экспу после боя, вылечить всех, добавить огневой мощи или убрать всех врагов (кроме Дракулы) с поля. Или - все золотишко сохраняется после поражения - можно в стартовом меню купить парочку бустов: стартовать с дополнительными наемниками, с дополнительной экспой, с дополнительным оружием, с дополнительными хелсами у базы. Но все это дроч, дроч, дроч и череда бессмесленных поражений.Да, и про ""ролевую систему"". Пушек всего пять: пистолет (слабый, медленный, но далеко стреляет), пулемет (мощнее пистолета, но стреляет на одну клетку короче), снайперка (бьет всю линию, но у стрелка слепая зона в две клетки), дробовик (стреляет буквой ""T"") и меч (очень крутой, но только по одной клетке). Левелап только повышает статы, судя по всему.Итого: вместо того, чтобы покупать Hunters of the Dead, можно играть в кости с самим собой. Тот же эффект, только дешевле. Или просто подрочить. Еще веселее, и вообще бесплатно."

My review is probably worse than the game itself. I admit that my pure judgement is indeed not really helpful.I do have somewhat experience (played at least 10000 games, beginning from C-64 and even earlier times) and this one is, in my opinion, still the worst game I ever played, but of course this does not play any role and I should have done this differently.My excuses, I wrote my first recommendation whilst being very upset.And I am afraid it is not getting much better as I find it very hard to find the right words for this piece of software.Let's have a look at the facts.I do not need to comment on any technical issues.For this kind of games, any grafix and sound can do.  It is simply not important.What really matters is the gameplay, fun, sense, however you want to call it.So I start on this map and the only option I have is to select any undiscsovered building.What is my strategy? What kind of building do I select first?Maybe it's a good idea to go for these hunter buildings first so that I get more guys and bigger army?Or better get some graveyards for faster training?The gun shops are good, no? You probably can get one of those sniper rifles that really help you much in your further battles.Does it even matter? No.Just click somewhere. Get some coins and die.Repeat several times until you can afford those upgrades.With the upgraded hunters etc. you will eventually be able to survive the attacks.You do not have to activate any brain cells however. just drag and drop some hunters on that lanes.Forget about any strategy, there is not much.You can send your hunters to a hopital or to training. You do not know what happens next as this randomness is a bit too random. Maybe to end up with no hunters available. Then you have to watch those sprites moving slowly towards your barricade. Maybe you would like to spend some coins for the ""kill all"" special. Problem is that you cannot remember which icon is what and there is no explanation after the first time.Where is the gameplay, where is the fun?I'd rather play ""Frogger"" from 1981. Crossing the street without getting killed. This is fun.There are a lot of indi developers out there that do most of the time a really good job.It's your call."
