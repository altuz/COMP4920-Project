,Not Recommended,318690,13286827,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,China Chef,"WARNING: DO NOT TRUST THE RATINGS, ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM ALTERNATE ACCOUNTS THE DEV MADE. THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.I was rooting for Vinci Games, I really was. I wanted to like this game so bad. My brain was screaming don't buy this game, but I decided to follow my heart and give it a try. I regret my decision so much.Here are my reasons:I dropped my gun and couldn't pick up another one, the optimization was iffy, I got stuck on a pipe, the game design seem to be limited to grab the keycard and hit the thing, and in the short time I played I managed to turn the entire game wire frame by hitting esc and when I pressed F2 the entire thing quit itself. It took me all of 12 minutes to want my money back, as this game does not offer a compelling story or fun game experience. It was ear destroying ambient noise, unappealing AI interaction and absolutely no depth in combat, with a complete lack of any other mechanic. Unlike the description, there where almost no dynamics, and I was not even slightly thrilled playing any part of this game. This game is so bland, it makes air control look fun. You just run around and hit the same 4 or 5 monsters the entire game, with absolutely nothing satisfying about getting a kill. Sometimes there is one on the floor, which does the same thing, and sometimes there is a big one, which does the same thing. You just pathetically wallop them with your flashlight until they crumple up and instantly disappear. If you want a good sci-fi horror shooter experience, you are probably just better off installing Doom 3 again, because this game seems to be a horrible mangle of concepts from different titles that got tossed into one giant unappealing mess of a game. This is possibly one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. Even worse than early access, because they are trying to market this featureless pile of dung as a pulse pounding horror game."

It's repetitive, boring, and lack of content makes it a shallow game which needs much more time in the development cycle. You'll find bugs a plenty and combat is slow, mundane, and uninteresting.While the enviorments themselves are interesting at first, they lose their appeal after the first level. Mostly because it's copy pasted over and over and over again through out the 7 levels seperated by 3 stages in each one.   The game can be beat within a range of 2 hours if you put a lot of effort to it, or even 30 minutes if you spend time using the console which is still enabled.Overall, this game needs work. A LOT of work."
,Not Recommended,318690,15527799,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,Orge Lambart,"Where to start.... I wanted to love Cargo 3, it had a price tag that agreed with me 4.99, was a FPS sci fi horror game and generally looks like something I would love.  After downloading the game I was stoked to play it.After the first minute of playing I had already come to regret my decision.  The movements are sluggish and kind of unresponsive.  You randomly take damage for no known reason, looking in all directions I saw nothing that should have damaged me but none the less I was damaged anyway.The hit detection also seemed to suffer from the same unresponsiveness that the controls did.  Pressing the fire button would cause my weapons to fire 3 to 5 seconds after I pressed the actual button.  Which allowed the creatures to start attacking me.  Point blank shots seemed to have no effect on these creatures at all..Eventually I found my way to the first level's end... I think?  I was greeted with a loading screen... upon reloading, I was devoid of my weapons.  After wandering for a few moments I was attacked and killed as I had no weapons to defend myself  (this was a bug, when I reloaded the checkpoint my gun was back)   After wandering a little while longer I was killed while my point blank bullets cruised through the creature right in front of me.I think this game could be good, if the movements and hit detection were fixed, while it certainly won't win any game of the year awards for the low price of 4.99 with some fixes it could be worth a few hours of game time."
,Not Recommended,318690,14733726,"Posted: 4 March, 2015",all,CorvusCorax,"This game is an abomination! There is simply no better way to put it. Its graphics, its design, its sound effects, everything.Truth be told I like indie games and I like giving them a chance. This is how it all began with Vinci Games. The horror genre is one of my favourites, anyway. Not to mention when the atmosphere is greatly determined by the presence of zombies or zombie-like creatures. And of course, the sci-fi environment gave another reason to give this one a try.One thing you notice right away is how the game allows you to continue your progress. Even before starting a new game. No, there's no data and you will start a new game but what kind of programming and preparation happened in the background if the main menu has such a mistake?Then you start in one room and go to another one. And then another one. And these look very similar. And once you come across with a new design later on you'll encounter the same elsewhere. The game barely offers any variations. There are some pictures and text telling you the story before the menu but once you are in the game there's no indication as to what you need to do. Yes, later on you encounter a door that requires a red card but... that's it? And the next level says green card. Really?Well, yes. It reminds you of Doom. But Doom was released 20 years ago. Enemies appear out of nowhere and once killed they respawn later on. Several times they respawned right in front of me or in the next room (as the smoke effect was visible through the wall). You kill them with a drill you are provided with at the beginning then you continue looking for the key and do the killing to the same creatures you have already disposed of. Oh, and some of them hide behind the wall which opens up after a while (again, Doom by id software).I do not know what happens later on as for me it was perfectly enough to get to the 2nd level and quit in order to abandon this mess once and for all. And this game costs 10 euros? It is a joke.I think Vinci's credo is as follows: ""Let's make a game with the critically acclaimed Unreal engine and cash in on the well-made trailers.""This is bad. Very bad. Avoid it as far away as possible. Other, relatively cheap / low budget games from the same genre but with excellent design / atmosphere / idea: Outlast, Forest, Slender The Arrival."

I don't even have to play the game that long to see it. Game does not run very smooth and needs fixing of some mechanics. I'm sure a few patches can fix these issues. But until then I doubt I'll play much.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i38qTR99jh0&list=UUUI5L-pyfuGa2l_IlG1d7_Q

I'm sure the devs had some vision in mind, but everything about this game feels broken. Seems like it takes 8 seconds to switch from holding the flashlight over to the odd spear launcher thing since you're not allowed to both see and aim at the same time in a nearly all dark environment. Some enemies seemed unable to pass through an open door while others have textures that pop out on the other side of a closed door. This really should have been a free demo.Save your money - it's not even worth the $5.00 I spent on it.  It's too bad Steam doesn't have a return feature like the Origin client does."

Poor game planning.  AI enemies will follow you around no matter how fast and far you run and hide they always run straight to you.  Spent the first five minutes trying to find a red key card using only my flashlight against 20 enemies, there was a gun but it ran out of ammo quickly with no ammo in sight and died.  Flashlight moves around so much it made me dizzy and vision is constantly blurred by overuse of weird membrane type bubble around you.  Having a flashlight and clear FOV is hard enough for a dungeon scenario but add all the extra crap on top and it's unenjoyable.   Game has promise but it's not fun and almost painful to try and play in those conditions.  I play games to have fun not squint and run around a dark and blurry  rooms trying to fight off slashers with a flashlight.  Don't waste your money.  Not worth the current price.

Even for the $1.49 I bought this for.+ It's pretty, at least.+ It's cheap. Very. Very cheap.+/- Not as buggy as some people claim anymore, but it still just isn't even close to satisfying.- There isn't really a story.- Gameplay is just.. meh. Literally all you do is run around some facility (god knows why) collecting keycards and then going to the next area, with a few new enemies here and there.- When you advance to a new area you have to push one of the weapon keybindings to even gain access to your weapons again (not that big of a deal I guess, but the first time I advanced it took me ~10 minutes to figure that out without wandering helplessly trying to avoid monsters).- The weapons are also horrid. I got to the 5th level before I even found a proper weapon that wasn't a drill.Just don't buy in to this game. You'll regret it. I feel cheated even for the miniscule price I paid for it.

The graphics are enjoyable thats probably the only positive i can give. The modles of the zombies arent the greatest but they move and attack quite nicely, the guns look decent but graphics wise everything gets held back because of the poor visuals, and by that i mean 90% of the maps are very dark and you must use the 3 available visions that are given too you, personally i used Nightvision. The whole time there a grey lines shooting across your screen almost as if you are in a flashback of some sort, it doesnt help with the game play but you get used to it after a while.all in all id give graphics a 6/10The graphics sadly were not the only thing with flaws, for mutants id never expect them to sound the way they did.each mutant has their own sound and honestly none of them have good sound effects, the first mutant you encounter sounds like a high pitched crow and it just doesnt make sense when you hear it.There is only one song/sound that plays in the background of the game and it doesnt add to the suspense at all, the sound of the foot steps you take is one of the better sound effects in the game.Also the sound effects of your character choking to death on the gas in the poisonous rooms, its quite realistic and makes you feel sick to your stomach.I could probably forgive all of the above issues if the game was not so repetitive and bland.I will give a breif run through on how this game is, the only story concept of this game is at the start when you read about what happened and why your character is in this hell. All you are told to do and all there is to do in this game is to collect cards to open special doors that will bring you to the next level.The cards are not very noticable and for the first five or six cards you find they are in the exact same place (where you replenish your HP, Armor and Energy), then the odd time you will find it in a corner of a random room.The plot and story is short and has really nothing to it, no thought or effort.Other problems i found with this game is the mutants spawn where ever and when ever they please, if you dont kill them they just stockpile and there becomes an abundance of mutants everywhere. You get nothing for killing these mutants and the wepons given to you, especially at the start of the game are not anywhere near helpful.Both guns i collected took far too long to kill the mutants and even longer to reload, and the melee weapons you are given take about six hits to kill a mutant and as you progress the zombies get stronger so of course it requires more attempts to kill a muntant with whatever weapon your using.If you dont kill the mutants of course they follow you until you are far enough away, but it is very easy to be trapped by them inbetween doors or in corners. If you dont have your weapon at the ready or have an opening to get away you will die in seconds.Also at the start as i was progressing through the game, i noticed as i passed through the doors that required keys to get through the maps were being recycled. I noticed and recognised a lot of the same rooms and hall ways, as crazy as that sounds but when the whole concept of a game is basically a search and destroy, you tend to give yourself side objectives (because you get none in the game).Also this game is not scary at all, nothing about this game makes you feel terrified or worried. Zero sense of ergency.If you are like my self and like to state your oppinion for others to interpret, but can still enjoy a game as is, then for the right price this game is for you.This game does feel a little unfinished and quite rushed, but this wont be the last time i will play this game.I do like to finish what i started and i intend on finishing this game.In total i give this game about a 4/10"

I can play games like Dead Space, Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim, and Dishonored without issue, on the highest quality.=======Cargo 3 prompted me, after hitting ""New Game"" for the first time, with a ""This will overwrite save data"" pop-up. It even had an available option to ""Continue"", had I not chosen ""New Game"". Usually that option is blacked out unless a save-file is found, but, I digress; that's not really an issue, it's more of a quandery as to why it was not thought of in this case.Also, the noises the game makes when highlighting and selecting options? Ghastly stuff, that.After continuing on to start a new game, I was left with a loading screen for what I timed to be about 7 minutes. In those 7 minutes, I tried to figure out what the blazes the background was supposed to be. I also noticed that the spinning skull icon, after a few instances of screen freezing, teasing me that the game may actually have been loaded by this point, the skull icon had shifted to the right, and slightly up, leaving behind it's red-glowing outline. This shouldn't be normal.Once the game finally loaded, I was confused to find that every minute movement I made froze the game momentarily, before allowing me to try moving again. Standing still, the game seemed laggy; moving around was impossible. I turned all the graphics down to the lowest settings, and found it much less detailed and pretty, but much more vexing. Now I could move, but the game looked terrible, and was still lagging out.I managed to switch from the flashlight to the gun-like-type-thing, and waste ""Energy"" by using the LMB. Using RMB shot something out that looked horrendous, and prompted a sluggish reload, so I quit and turned the game off.Utterly disappointing.I might have to try a re-install and see if that fixes the issue............Uninstalled~"

We must buy Cargo 3 and play it till the end of our lives.This is the work of a true genius. A perfect emerald of magnificence. Emancipating light or pure knowledge. You can't comprehend this noble phenomenon, but you can let it in your heart and gates of Paradise will be open wide for you. 420/10p.s.: if you are a f**king idiot: it's ironic review. It's worst game ever, you shouldn't buy it and if you did (like me) and enjoyed it (like Satan himself) you should feel bad.Actually you should feel bad even for opening store page for this s**t game. Trust me, the only redeeming quality of it - it'll make you appreciate another games a lot more."
