,Recommended,319180,14937503,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Shawn Marrster,Get this just for the music if you are old like me :)C64 music galore. Some of the best music ever on a SID chip.Platypus IIMain tune: Rambo II loader (original: Martin Galway)Level 1: Monty on the run (original: Rob Hubbard)Level 2: Last ninja (original Ben Daglish / Anthony Lees )Level 3: Terra Cresta (Martin Galway)Ship select: Sanxion loader (problably the best C64 track. Rob Hubbart)Wish that the full soundtrack was avalible as DLC (or as bonus ingame)According to the internet: The music was licensed from c64play. Maybe I could get the original tracks from them?

I really don't know why the second installment of Platypus is so badly recieved as it's pretty much the same game as the original, aside from minor alterations and changes. Also the game now supports 3 players local coop."
,Recommended,319180,13101874,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,LeadFire,"As a huge fan of the first Platypus game, I have to say I think this sequel is being given rather a unfair bad rap by the reviews here. Despite a few cons with this new version I can't overlook the fact that they have also added several new features that have made things better:- The game now supports THREE players instead of two, which makes for tons more fun. Likewise, the game now allows for all three players to use ""joysticks"" instead of just one (the joystick mode also works fine with controllers).- Different ship types. Choose from four different ships that each have slightly different guns.And let's face it, the best one is the donut gun (well to me it looks like it shoots donuts).This really adds a cool new dynamic to the game when you mix and match with the other players.- HEALTH. Play in easy mode to now have health for each life (3 hearts). No more dying in one hit!- You now always keep your weapon bonuses until the timer runs out (you won't lose it if you get hit).- Two new items that you can get in the boxes: A shield for temporary invincibility and an upgrade that doubles the firepower of your given weapon (no time limit!) until you get hit.Also I should add that the game seems to have full controller support despite the description. The only thing that might need a keyboard/mouse is for putting your name in for a high score.The only cons I've notice so far is that the sound only comes out the right speaker (which is kind of annoying, but if you can put your speakers in mono its really not that bad), and the frame rate seems to be a little lower, but its not terrible.All in all I'd have to say that this game is actually really fun and arguably on par with the first one.Maybe not for full price, but if you find it on sale I'd say it's definitely worth picking up."

Please, for the sake of humanity, don't buy it.Okay, so I like most people read the mixed reviews for Platypus II and decided to buy it and I was disgusted.Sound only comes out of the right speaker, the game is in 4:3 (It didn't even work properly in 4:3 on my monitor, it left a huge black section around all sides of the game) and it is basically the exact same levels as Platypus, just in a weird order.Please, if not for humanity's sake, don't lower those precious funds in your bank account by purchasing this. Waste all of your monies on games, or even drugs. Drugs are better than this.0/10 Would hate again."

,Not Recommended,319180,15999395,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,EF,"Got it for the cards. Played these games when I was a kid forever ago. They(Nux, Platpus I and II) do look unique, but IMO Platypus is the only ""good"" game out the three. Recommending this game mainly out of nostalgia and cards, but with the game being minimized issue, not really recommending it positively.As a note to the devs- It'd be nice that when anyone has the game minimized the mouse should not be locked to a certain small area, so they can do other things on their pc while the game is minimized without any issues.Also- Nux(-90%), Platypus(-80%), and Platypus II(-90%) were on sale for a week.  $2.77=Price of purchasing games individually. $2.99= Price of buying them in a bundle. Usually buying the bundle is cheaper, but in this case it was not."

And sourpusses are hating this game? I guess they didn't find it as fun as I did. The second Platypus is far easier than the first and also has the nice function of letting you leave the game and then come back to where you left off. Another nice thing is that you now can have up to three players. Did I mention the fantastic music? Each of the 5 worlds brings something unique, and introdues new mechanics, which towards the end of the game are all working to stop you from winning. Anyway... if you're new to this sort of game genre, buy it... Ignore those sour comments about some silly problem which I didn't even notice... Trust me, the game is fun if you're not a grouch."

Otherwise, just buy the fist Platypus because honestly it was a better game....Plat II didnt feel as polished as the first one and it seems way more difficult, even on the easy setting. It's as if someone said the first one was too easy so make the second one REALLY hard. That was part of the charm of the first one is that you could work towards perfect scores. Plat II feels way more frantic and less relaxing.The music in the first Plat was cool and relaxing. Plat II, not so much.....just like the ramped up difficulty, the music sounds like disco on meth.The player two and three options that flash at the bottom of the screen are completely annoying. I am happy when I get down to my last continue because then they finally disappear off of my screen. Why would you put those there for the entire game? They get in the way and make it harder to see enemies.....you think someone that owns the game wont remember that other players can join in?Plat II seems like Plat one's little brother tried really hard to make a game as good as his big brother, but couldnt quite pull it off."

The game is also somewhat laggy, with an FPS averaging 15-20 (for comparison, I ran the original Platypus at 60). I hear only from the right side. I feel like someone bought the series and decided to ruin it. The original Platypus was addictive, whilst this game will make you want to quit after the first level. It's like someone stole the code and models from the first game and decided to make his own version of it."
