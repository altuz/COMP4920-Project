The text parser is bad, much worse than the original. With the price of this remake you'd think they would have fewer issues and improved more than just the graphics. Not at all worth the price, even at the 50% off I paid for it.If you reallly want it, wait for an 80% off sale. That would be close to the actual value of this game."

Ok. Nice shiny graphics. Then a horse cart comes along. Its graphics look too CGI, too clean-and-shiny, like the early days of 3D modelling. Think the 7th Guest and Myst1. This is a 2014 game? Maybe if they'd done animated 2D instead of all the wasted effort on the overly clean 3D backdrops? I dunno.I talk to people in the streets. Badly edited cuts. Again like it was ""one-take, we'll edit the pauses out of it in post"".This is King's Quest 5 levels of bad voice acting. Are the people supposed to sound like non-native speakers? One of them did sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was pretty awesome.It feels like a bad fan remake, except it costs money.Worth < $5. Possibly $1?"

The graphics lack detail. The animations are choppy and ridden with glitches. Overall this game does not do the 80's original justice at all. In fact I recommend playing the original over this one because it still is the better, much more polished game despite its age."
,Not Recommended,319230,21495906,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,gravenstein,"The voice acting is awful (and for Christ's sake, voice actor they hired for this, you're supposed to be a guy from Brooklyn, stop saying ""sorry"" like a Canadian), there are multiple misspellings and bugs, the interface is pretty awful, the graphics look like a shareware game from the late 1990s, and worst of all it doesn't really expand on the original game at all.  You'd be better off downloading and emulating the original, because at least that came from old-school Sierra programmers who knew what the hell they were doing.I really, *really* regret paying money for this game.  Actually, I kind of feel bad that I played this game without getting paid to do so.  TERRIBLE."

It was very annoying to play, and it looks like it's been made in 1995. In the reviews I read that the original game was included, but that's not the case. For that you have to fork out more. Avoid."

76561198273300685,Recommended,319230,21738145,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Kalizzeri,I liked that there is a lot to do in town and lots of Information.  That ales the storyline interesting. I also think that its funny that you can get run over by the horse and carts . but this game doesn't have a whole lot of direction . I would have liked more info on what to do and where to go and why. It is entertaining. I need to play more to figure some stuff out though cause I have never made it very far. I record.end giving it a try if you can get it for a good price.

But hey, nobody's perfect, it's very clear that a lot of hours have gone into creating this game."

No.The graphics look like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of a late 90s 3D game and Thomas the Tank Engine. The voice acting seems to be further inspired by a Gavrilov voice-over translation of the very same cartoon, as if the instructions were to read the lines with a minimum of emotional tonality.Maybe the game is more fun to play for those who enjoyed the original back in the 80s.Is there ANYTHING I like about this game? Well, the intro tune is quite nice..."

,Recommended,319230,30648486,Posted: 21 March,all,Pufix,I will give it a thumbs up but just for the effort of recreating the original scenes from Gold Rush Classic. Other than that I can't say it's a game you would wish to play.

It's not the most complicated of games, but it sure does take a bit to work out what to do if you're not following a walkthrough.Overall, I'd have to say that this is a great game and a welcome revival for a genre that is sadly laking in our current gaming market."

If you played the original and could not beat it then this version gives you a chance to replay it without all the guessing of what to type and when.  This of this game as less of a remake and more of an update to allow point and click and you will enjoy it better."
,Not Recommended,319230,29937273,Posted: 15 February,all,SportyHeadShot,"Game freezes whenever you leave brooklyn, if you take the stage coach route it freezes at the camp and becomes unplayable, if you take the cape route it freezes at the map view, if you take the panama route it freezes at the map view, whenever you enter the california area it freezes at the map, you can restart the game 100 times and it still freezes on you, it quite often freezes moving between rooms, all in all you simply cannot complete this game as Ive tried multiple times to get past the freezing and it simply freezes whenever you get to the next major spot, you often get stuck in walls and have to restart the game, as much as I am nostalgic to relive the game with the updated graphics its simply completely umplayable unless someone can create a major overhaul of the game to make it actually playable."
