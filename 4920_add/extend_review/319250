TLDR summary at the bottom!Anyway, Magicmaker is a great game for anyone who ever wanted to custom-build the wizard of their dreams. A lot of games over the years have taken a stab at the idea of a customizable magic system, but so far, I've not seen it done better than Magicmaker.The idea is you are a wizard, hired by a temp agency to be a security guard. As you play, you'll collect elements, colors, and other bits that can be combined to make whatever sorts of spell you can imagine. Want to throw fireballs? Easily done. What about black hole beams that suck out someone's life? Easily done. Magic pets (or even turrets) that attack any who challenge your rule? Walk up walls, jump off the air, or just straight-up teleport? Done, done, and done. With approximately 2 MILLION possible combinations, you might be at this awhile, just experimenting with all the neat stuff you can think up!I can say without a doubt that I've found one of my favorite time-killers in Magicmaker. The art style is charming, the game mechanics are loads of fun, and there's all sorts of humorous nods throughout the game that will brighten your day.Some people will wonder about the development team, ""Tasty Stewdios"", since the interaction and passion of game developers is important. It's easy to see how they are by looking around the forum community: they love their fans, and love their game, and want to see the two happy together. Very responsive and passionate about their game, TS is quick to address problems with the game, consider suggestions, and speak to players like people, not numbers.--------TLDR:Create custom spells, rack up kills, loads of fun. I made a spell that shot a magenta beam at people so hard, it ricocheted between 15 different monsters and blew them all to ash, then sucked out their soul energy to power my horrible rampage through the desert.10/10 would wizard again."

The spell making system is mind blowing, as even the most overpowerd spells differentiate from person to person. The story is witty and funny and the gameplay is simply going mad with power. My only complaint is length and how easy it gets, but its fine. Would definitely reccomend."

There are forty materials to use in spells, each of which applies a different effect like poisoning, lifesteal, faster fire rate, exploding, splitting, gravitation, and LAZORS. The system works very well and it is fun to make lots of interesting spells.Obviously no system is perfect. There are some bugs, like piercing not seemingly enhancing lasers and other things. There are literally millions of combinations, so this is to be expected.The area where this game really suffers is actual gameplay. Aside from the ability to create millions of different spells, there is nothing in the game that hasn't been seen in every other side-scrolling dungeon crawler. The enemies are not very varied, and can all be defeated fairly easily with a powerful spell or two. There are five zones, each with four or five missions, so the game does not last very long. You can go back to freeplay previous zones, but the only point is to get more materials.However, the game is still in active development, and the developers comment on most of the threads in the steam discussions, so it can only get better. The spell-building system alone has tons of replay value. Making new spells and asking, ""what happens when I put AoE on my turret with lasers?"" is enough to play this game for a good 5-10 hours alone.Overall, if you like customizing and experimenting, this is a great game, but if you are looking for a solid dungeoncrawler platformer, look elsewhere."

You want a spell that burns things AND does extra crit damage? Then you use Fire and Artichoke. Seriously. Artichoke. This game is hilarious and devoid of esoteric combinations or synergies.

76561198024689730,Recommended,319250,28918934,Posted: 1 January,all,Laike Endaril,"The spellcrafting in this game is absolutely fantastic...probably the best I've ever seen.  I liked playing with spellcrafting components in Morrowind, but the spellcrafting here is on a much higher level than that.  Not only is the number of different underlying systems they put into combat and spellcrafting absurd, but they also kept it fairly balanced.  I can't even begin to imagine the number of hours they must have put into debugging and rebalancing things to get it this polished.The artwork and music are both very fitting and well done (color palette reminded me a bit of Terraria), and the programming is absolutely fantastic.  All the common bugs I'm used to seeing just aren't there.  For example, in super smash bros. brawl (and many other games), if you hit someone hard enough, they can fly through solid terrain because the physics engine isn't programmed to check for collisions between the start and end points each frame.  In this game, you can fly faster, and will NOT travel through terrain when you reach it.Only programming bug I can remember atm is that if you delete a saved spell while in a zone portal, you cannot see the confirmation prompt (but can still click on it).  Oh, and at the end of the game after the credits, it just stays on that screen (you need to press escape and go to title screen...not obvious).  Besides that stuff, there are some graphics with areas that are supposed to be transparent that are not (some look like possible texture bleeding; not sure, but one of the plant boss heads definitely has the entire background of its texture not-quite-transparent).  In any case, nothing game-breaking.  And the image stuff is almost unnoticeable.  I'm just picky (and used to looking at dev stuff).I don't even have any reasonable suggestions for the devs besides considering multiplayer, and possibly adding to the story if they feel like.  I would love to see a magic maker 2, even if it uses all the same spellcrafting components.  If this game (or a sequel) had multiplayer...I would probably lose hundreds of hours in pvp.The game has a new game+(++) system (multiple playthroughs to reach true endgame equipment status).  You unlock more slots each time you play through, exponentially increasing the number of unique spells you can craft each time.  I think the max is 8 slots per spell; I will find out after my current playthrough.In any case, I'm off to buy copies of this game for most of my friends, because I thought it was just that good.The rest of this is just notes in case devs see this and are considering adding pvp at some point...A few things would need rebalancing for a pvp mode to work.  Your damage output is far higher than your damage taken as it stands, so you would die too quickly...unless you had 100% damage reduction, which you can do (literal invincibility...while holding still, combined with 100% knockback prevention), which would also need to be fixed.  Hmm...you might still be able to die due to execution and other status effects?  Not sure.  In any case, some significant number tweaking would be necessary, but I don't think any of the actual game mechanics would need to be changed (besides adding a networking system...which I know is a nightmare)."

Handles well.+ Making spells is a lot of fun. It's the main attraction, mixing aspects together to make ridiculous magic.+ Cute visuals and character customization.+ HumourBut now the negatives:- Game has absolutely horrible pacing and doesn't make it clear how you should progress.-- The end of the game can come very quickly and very abruptly due to this poor pacing.- Several levels require specific spell to be equipped. End up wasting time not knowing you need to go back and make a new spell- Very unclear instructions for a lot of aspects of the game.- Can only equip 2 spells (and a wand).

The problem is, the game is short and relies on the New Game+ mechanic for replay value. However, if you're looking at this game, it's probably for one thing:-Making your own spells.-To this end, the game really does shine. While certain elements are better than others, -most- of them are fairly balanced, such as the three ""DoT"" elements. Burn spreads (which makes it really good in areas with lots of small enemies (Desert...)), Poison stacks on the same target, and Curse deals damage to nearby enemies when the target dies. Then you have two elements that change the mana cost of the spell (these are, in my opinion, not recommended for the wand, which deals little damage but uses no mana). Blood Contract gives the spell a boost to damage and effect, but causes the spell to consume health instead of mana. The other is the Arrow element, which removes mana cost (or causes the health cost to go down a ton in the case of Blood Contract + Arrow), however the spell now becomes more like a bow, with very limiting ammo that you have to then retrieve to continue firing.The game also allows players of various playstyles to play the game. One of the artifacts, for example, increases the damage you deal and take by 1% for each enemy you kill, with it reseting when you finish the dungeon (it stacks multiplicatively, so your damage dealt and taken are doubled after the first 70 stacks.) Combine this with the Blood Contract spell effect (just be careful, as the Blood Contract's health cost increases too... I have gotten to points where I've killed so many enemies that the spells takes more health than I've got) and the Repulsor Energy robe effect (After taking damage, your next spell gets a massive damage boost), and you're looking at dealing huge amounts of damage. Conversely, you could make a shield spec revolving around Harpy Feather spell (pushes enemies back), Evercold Ice robe effect (supplies an absorption barrier after not taking damage for a couple seconds) and Lightning Rod robe effect (after a certain amount of time it creates a barrier that deflects incoming spells.) The options really are staggering.So, despite the short playtime, I would definitely recommend this game. It's a lot of fun messing around with the spell mechanic to find something you like. Just be careful with that last boss..."

Combining materials to make spells is very entertaining, there's a lot of combinations to play around with. Somehow the developers managed to stuff in dozens of unique materials that are balanced in a way that doesn't have you just using 5 or 6 of them. Going into a level and seeing a spell that you spent some time on completely wrecking enemies is amazing. It's actually just as amazing to see a spell that you thought was going to be great completely flop in the face of actual enemies.While I am enjoying the game quite a bit I think that the ""feel"" of the game could be improved on. I love the paper craft artstyle but some of the environments lack depth. The style works better in indoor environments than outdoors. The game is also very particle heavy, sometimes to it's detriment. The particles often make it hard to decipher what's going on."

The learning and experimentation phase lasted several hours of gameplay, but eventually I got enough of the right effects to really start figuring out what works.Once I completed an endgame run, (new game +3), and finished experimenting with spells that I had in mind but hadn't tried yet, I lost interest.  Completing various challenges such as the Races, Targets, and all-options Freeplays would've kept me busy if I were a completionist, but I'm  satisfied with clearing the final boss.The wide variety of spell customization is pretty well done in this game.Closing note: Once you get to New Game +2 and +3 and have 6-7 effect slots unlocked, various spell combinations can be pretty hard on your computer even with a decent graphics card and graphics settings set to minimum."

Back in Oblivion, making and testing spells was one of my most favorite things to do, and now I have an entire game dedicated to the concept. There are plenty of materials to work with, allowing for ridiculous amounts of customization and experimentation. Vampiric swords, explosive lasers, and swarms of homing missiles are just the beginning of your options.In addition, the game has one of the most charming graphics styles I've ever seen, with everything looking like craft paper cutouts, and a nice soundtrack, though not much sticks out as truly memorable.However, all is not good for Magicmaker. While it has a quirky sense of humor, the story mode is very short. A few hours is all it takes to beat campaign. And while there are a fair amount of extra levels, it still doesn't extend the game out to a satisfying length. New Game + helps some, but it's not quite enough either. The game also suffers from low performance on lower end machines.I would recommend the developers give the player a whole new hub area with new worlds, such as a volcanic world, or a crystalline cavern, or maybe a ""death valley"" level, and have more encounters with Azazel. I'd like to know more about her, give her a bit more background perhaps, or at least just have her show up more. I'm pretty sure she only ever showed up twice, not including the final battle. I would also add some graphics options, especially some kind of particle fade. Random bits of dead enemies tend to clutter the floor and reduce performance.Overall, despite its glaring flaws, Magicmaker is still a worthwhile play due to its incredible charm and its entertaining spellmaking system."

Though I would love this idea translated into a RPG setting. That being said, the different materials are not as diverse as they should be. The perfect type of materials are things like walking on walls, and repulsion. In other words, they have to have an effect on how you go about playing the game. If it merely poisons, or burns etc and does damage over time, you are still doing the basic thing, i.e firing a projectile in a straight line. In other words, not game changing effects. The beauty of magic is in the vastness of the manipulation of the natural world that you can do. In other words, the game has a nice spell making mechanic, but because of the dungeon crawling, you end up having spells merely for dps, than to create a wonderous variety of spells. So with 2 million combinations, comes 1.9 million useless spells that get boring very fast.From what I have said, it may sound negative. I actually don't feel that way about the game. The general idea of the game, is precisely what I want in a game, quite literally. I would hundred fold recommend this game, not only because it is a bloody good dungeon crawler but because this idea of a magical systems needs to get out there! Beats magicka hands down. Not to say, this area needs bigger expansions and more imagination. Then again maybe I am the only one that wants to truly rule a world with powerful magic that I created in which the developers never intended because they could never computer all billion spell combinations ;)"

This game has the same concept to the Nth degree. I have played a bit and am still finding new spells and combinations of spells to use. Aside from the spell mechanic it is a platformer that gets increasingly hard as the game progresses. Some levels turn into bullet hells with so much going on that my computer lags a bit.This game also offers a lot of customization. You can change the way that your wizard looks and the graphics and animations of  your spells and wand. The customization alone will add value to your dollar.From what I have played so far I would definitely recommend this to a gamer on a budget. It is a $10 dollar game and i would expect more than 10 hours of enjoyment out of it. But don’t take my word for it try it out for yourself."

Some spells I've made of note:-A spell to summon about 100 minions a cast, without using mana (minions are weak, but you can get a lot)-A homing laser turret that goes through walls-A ""machine gun"" spell with a fire rate of 390 RPM-A force wall that lasts for a few seconds and damages anything that contacts it-A spreadfire of piercing projectiles that travel along wallsAdditionally, for those who like customizing their characters' appearance, there is a character creator with a huge amount of custom-colorable components allowing a great amount of detail in character creation.However, while the spell and character creation is okay, there are a few issues with the game. Levels are procedurally put-together so you'll see pieces repeated, though in general they work well as an arena in which to use the spells you've created. A few glaring bugs still exist (notably a known bug I've encountered with the spell save/load (an OPTIONAL feature) breaking my save file), but the dev team so far appears active in trying to repair them.Summary:Pros:The best component-based spell creation since MagickaIntricate appearance customizationSand wormsCons:Procedurally-assembled levels can get slightly repetitive;Flying books you can't strike down and only dodgeSome significant bugs present in the gameThis game is a diamond in the rough - emphasis on ""rough"", but the devs are working on that.

There are mechanics in it allowing you to create spells and imbue enchantments into wands and robes. So let's get to the point. The spell creating system is great, and I really like it, but there are some turds in its punch bowl. First, the spells CAN be a bit bland, and the casting animations are a bit dumb. What I really like though, is the ingredient merging to add ingredients to robes, spells, and wands. You add an ingredient, such as explosive powder, and it gains properties, in this case, Area of Effect. This is a great mechanic, and I really like it.The platforming is a little bad, but the bosses are really amazing. The first boss (which is pretty easy) is a plant monster, and it moves ""tentacles"" around clockwise or counterclockwise, making you have to move around with it, or you get hurt. The boss introduction is awesome though, as in this boss, it says ""Gross Plant Monster: (Ican'trememberthename)"" Ocarina of Time style, which I really like.Overall, this is a nice experience that you should enjoy thoroughly, but maybe lower the price, because this shouldn't be so high as Terraria, which has lots of fun and content and is what a bullet hell really is.

This isn't your average ""okay, I can have a bolt, laser or spray of 3 elements... boooring....""  This is REAL spellcrafting.  (If you wanted a fire bolt, you can still make one.)Pros:- Huge variety!  I've played for a decent bit and I'm still unlocking more slots and more elements, yielding a ridiculous amount of possible combinations.- Great visuals!  The customization extends to the image of your spells, so you can cast in style.  In addition to a modest but effective assortment of costume customizations, the art style of the world of Magicmaker is remeniscient to craft time in kindergarden!  Think Kirby's Epic Yard style but with paper.- Great music!  The adorable soundtrack reminds me of the games of my youth, such as Yoshi's Story or Maplestory (I get it, I like stories.) where I would simply sit and listen to the soundtrack because it's so heartwarming.- Atmosphere!  The setting is nothing short of adorable.  The NPCs admittedly few lines of dialogue will charm as you walk through the hub testing out your spells.  The tone is both comic and endearing.- Did I mention variety?  I meant it.  In addition to spellcrafting, you can also customize the traits of your robe and use varying artifacts.- Execution.  The game is just oozing ""fun.""  I want to collect all the treasure in a level to unlock that next spell slot at all costs!Cons:- The controls are a bit janky.  The mouse and keyboard works fine, but I wish I had more mouse buttons.  My problem really.  Abandon ye who wish to aim with a controlstick--I found it impossible.- Enemy variety.  Though I've only played a little, I've encountered a ton of different enemies.  But at the same time, I feel I've encountered very little variety in the threat--they all pose the same threats.  Either damaging by bumping into you or by shooting at you.  There are a few exceptions to this, such as elite enemies carrying treasure or the boss fights at the end of the level.  They provide enough variety to keep it fresh.All in all, if you like magic and crazy abilities determined only by the limits of your imagination, I think this game will appeal to you.For the price? 10/10.With real expectations?  8/10.If you like adorable wizards? 10/10 regardless of price!"

This is one of the problems with text-based adventure games: there are so many different objects, the programmers couldn't possibly implement enough interactions for everything to make sense.For a long time, I've been fascinated by the concept.

However, as the game goes on, I started to realize just how well the spell customization was implemented. I could create a turret originating at my mouse cursor that shot laser beams that changed directions randomly. In many games, most of those traits would have been incompatible, but Magicmaker is at its best when combining crazy spell attributes into a beautifully chaotic whole.However, I can't say that it's a particularly well-polished game. The graphics are a mix of flash-game style shapes and a painfully obvious overreliance on particle effects. And for a 2D game with such simplistic graphics, it's horrifically laggy and bug-laden. Entering certain levels caused my game to crash, and the options regarding particle effects don't seem to do anything.In short, if you can look past the problems, it's a brilliant customization-based game. I'd certainly reccomend it, but if lag makes you cringe, I might suggest waiting until those problems are fixed."

I think most materials are very viable as well so everything has a use :)I have so much more positive i want to say about this game, its on par with games like magicka and path of exile in its own way.Pro's ============================================*Beautiful and charming 2d graphics.*A lot of possible spell combinations and materials.*Option to randomize a lot of things, including: wizard appearance, spells, spell names, or randomize it all by playing the randomize challenge! great fun awaits :DNew game+ which offers you more replayability after you complete the game.Cons ============================================*It doesn't have multiplayer/coop or ways of messing up your friends ( by mistake mind you  :P )*Few spells you can actually use in combat, its: 1 basic spell from your wand, 2 from spells, 1 passive from robe and 1 pre-designed artifact that you cannot customize and once you go into combat you cannot change your spells and are required to exit to change.*Difficulty drops significantly very quickly as you gain more materials and material slots.===============================================All that staid, even if i wreak everything easily its fun to play and the moderate at best difficulty is a good reason to start experimenting with other builds or ways of playing other than the ""min/max"" builds we are used to.tl;dr.... I will strongly recommend this game if you like magic creativity and games like magicka or path of exile."

It looked like fun, and when the price dropped to $5 for a sale, I had to pick it up.Right from the get-go, the game's performance left much to be desired. Before even completing a single level, I was lagging to the point of having to Alt-F4 out of the game, unable to save and quit properly. I tried playing again the next day, with the same result, despite reducing video settings and such. Naturally, I looked to the game's Steam discussions for troubleshooting help. A common recommendation was to toggle vsync in a settings file, which I did. It worked; the game ran much more smoothly and lag was less noticeable.Guess what else it accomplished?Breaking my computer.Now, my computer is a few years old, but it can handle the vast majority of 2D games (as well as a lower number of 3D games), no sweat. My computer, despite being in relatively good condition, has hiccups now and then. But now it won't even turn on properly. When I try to turn it on, I get a black screen. Is it this game's fault? It's probably a flaw with my computer, but that doesn't mean I'm inclined to relieve Magicmaker of all blame.I, having a broken computer whose video card got overloaded or something by a game that performs horribly and isn't even multithreaded, am looking forward to the day when I can invest in a powerful enough computer to handle this poorly-optimized game without any problems. If I have fun with it when I'm actually able to play it, perhaps my opinion will change. Until then, I'm giving a solid thumbs down to the game that broke my computer."

Each tier up provides a rune with slightly better effects (not by changing the effect of the spell or enchantment, but by increasing the modifiers of the rune).  I think the developers included all five tiers of runes when calculating all the spell combinations.  It is stated that there are 40 different materials.  The triangular number of 40 (Which calculates the combinations of two slots), multiplied by 40 (for the third slot), is 32,800.32,800 combinations, average gameplay, and sub-par artwork.

Until you fix that bug. Allow me to explain:The game comes with an inner launcher installation, and when that installation fails, you have to go into the game files to re-install the launcher. With me so far?OK, so, SO MANY people have had a problem with the launcher installer that it's currently the #1 most asked question on the FAQ, which is how I learned how to fix my game, but then if this is the #1 most asked question, and the solution is pretty simple, then WHY HAVEN'T the dev's fixed it already?Apart from that, it's yet another instance of the flash-style animations that belong in the 90's or early 00's, games that claim to provide full controller support, but the right stick is so wild as to not provide accuracy like a mouse would, and even then, no mouse sensitivity scaling either. (So it does not in fact provide FULL support)Pros:Exactly(?) 2 million spells (although I feel like the system was ripped out of Battlemage Lichdom or something previous)Controls are tight enough that Super Meat Boy is an apt comparison. (At least for movement controls)Acheivements and trading cards!Cons:Graphics and animation are subpar - but of course it's splashy, and it's hard to tell what the hell is going on most of the time.Dead ends in the level design are there from the very beginning. I'm sure there are many more to come. (Not even a crappy chest? come on!)I got past the first boss and into the hub town within a half hour, skipped boring orienteering messages from NPCs. Learned that upgrades are irrelevant, and/or can be accessed from nearly anywhere within the hub town or some levels.Final Verdict: 3/10 - I came for the promise of magical powers, but there are too many flaws to make the game hold my interest. The game's not ugly, but it commits the larger sin of being boring, (and confusing, which is not the same thing as complex.)Just buy Enter the Gungeon.

I've never felt driven to do that in a steam game before.ConsLower tier materials accumulate and there isn't a way to make them more useful late-game (so use what you get!).Boss fights felt a little constricted.$10 for a 20-40+ hour game.Taco Scale:10 tacos VS 20-40+ hours of gameplay.or2.5-1.25 tacos per day VS 4-8 days straight of Magicmaker (~5 hours per day)I'd happily choose Magicmaker over 10 tacos.I'm looking forward to the release of a second Magicmaker, unsure if there is one in the works or not.If it doesn't happen, at the very least to add more gameplay, the ability to mod the game would be fantastic.But if there was to be a second game....Local multiplayer would be amazing, cooperative play through levels, races, battle arenas. Balancing would be much more tricky of course, you know that.Online multiplayer is a big no-no, since the whole idea of the game is discovering awesome spell combinations. Copying off of someone online would ruin it.Due to this core element of the game... the shareability is a bit limited. Would be neat if you had an option to print out your Magicmaker character though, with diagrams for cutting/folding to make the character out of their individual pieces.Anyway, get the demo if you're unsure about it."

The spell creation system was pretty fun, but that's pretty much all there is to it. I'd give the game a 5/10.Not worth the full price, buy when on sale.Pros:+ Pretty good controls+ All the different spells are creative and fun to try out+ I liked the music (reminded me of Maplestory somehow)+ Humour in the game is okay+ Few grammar mistakes+ Non-repetitive! (mainly because of its length, though)Cons:- The game is short- You'll either be very over-powered or very weak- You can hear the music replay (it awkwardly creates a brief sudden silence to the music)- Some fps lag?- Character editor sucks and the dialogue assumes you're male even if you changed your character femaleFull review:When I picked up this game, I was expecting something else than what I got. Are there over 2 million possible spell combinations? Yes! Is it fun? To some extent, yes! Is the gameplay diverse? Yes, and no.Commenting on all of the questions and answers above, the game delivers its purpose quite well: you get what you're promised. However, questions like ""Are all the 2 million spells so different from each other?"" or ""How difficult is the game?"" or ""Is the game long?"" are the downfall of this game (in addition to the horrible story).From the 2 million spells you can have, you'll most probably settle with the one or two easily most overpowered ones. The other 1,999,998 spells are not even worth it to check out when you realise that the game is super boring to play if you don't have your OP laser beam with you. Or maybe you'll feel happy with that weak and useless charming spell that just slows down your gameplay and makes you underpowered.The game doesn't get repetitive mainly because it's so short. All the different missions, ultimately, dumb down to the category of ""go there and kill stuff"" with an addition of ""find something"", with the random occasion of something a bit different. Most of the time I have in this game are from customizing my character (the character customization sucks pretty much though) and spells as well as AFKing. I'd say the game took me about 3h to beat, the only difficult part being mission where I had to kill a boss without killing 20 Fairies, which are probably the weakest enemies in the game. Never did I feel like the enemies were strong or challenging at all.Now that the bad sides have been covered, what's left? The game has many good sides to it, too. The grammar is fine, with only few mistakes. The humour got me a few times, which is pretty uncommon. The game plays well with its tight controls, and only once did I end up in a dead end despite the maps being randomly generated. The music reminded me of Maplestory for some reason, which is a game I played a lot in my childhood (also Maplestory 2 is coming soon!), so props for the nostalgia (although the BGM plays a bit awkwardly; you can hear the music replaying itself, which annoyed me a lot)! The game didn't lag for me, although I've read comments of people raging about their fps rate, just thought I'd say this.The game is okay, but not worth the 9,99€ it asks for. I'd buy it during a sale. Still recommending it despite its minor flaws (and the major flaw of horrible balancing) 'cause it's a solid game."

While it is a great game, here's a couple of stuff to watch out for as this is a package that comes with a bit more than just jumping in and letting your imagination run wild.First, this is a game and not just a sandbox. You go through various levels while prodecurally generated, have reoccuring copy-paste elements so each zone will generally give you a similar gameplay experience. You start off with a very limited palatte of spell effects and a limited number of spell slots which you can add spell effects. This means that your potential for creativity is limited at the start and you can only get so creative towards mid-game as you're playing on a new game+ when you more slots to add more and more spell effects. Eventually, after beating it around three times, you get the max spell effect slots for maximum creativity.Of course, balancing a game is very difficult and some spells and strategies are clearly stronger than others. As you go through the game, you will most likely stick to just a few strategies that you know will work. Yes, there may be two million possible combinations, but there are not going to be two million GOOD combinations, especially not early in the gameThis is a good game, but this is not quite the sandbox I thought it seems to market itself. Maybe it's my play style that leans towards functionality than roleplay or creativity's sake, but the way I played it, that's kinda how it went for me. Of course, experiment lots as the game gives you a big enough variety of things to try out. I find that my strategy has radically changed every now and then when I decide my current strategy is not good enough, and that's where most of the fun of the game is. Experiment and experiment lots."

Currently, my main spell is 3 lasers that bounce off walls and leave trails, causing them to multiply when used. You can customize the looks of your character as well as your spells.

I actually looked forward to quest descriptions and so forth, because they were consistently good for a chuckle.At some of the harder levels, everything turns into a damage sponge, but while that's occasionally annoying, there's enough dynamism in the levels (and each of the five worlds are all distinct in the kinds of motion they require--truly an elegant design direction) that it's usually an interesting new challenge.Basically, I expected a toybox of Metroidvania items, and I got a fun game with character and depth and I had a great time.

I've only found a handful of the items so far but the combined effects are so much fun to play with, and no matter what effects you combine IT ALWAYS WORKS. A few of my favourites: Homing laser which phases through walls! A multifire, ricocheting shot that spawns slime minions with each hit! Freezing chain lightning which drains HP! The combinations truly feel endless and no matter what crazy spell combination you come up with it WILL work how you think it should. Major applause for the developers for making such an indepth customising system which never seems to break down no matter what you make in it.Buy the game and find your own magic to make.

Do remember, this is my first review and I have almost no experience with games compared to others. I'm just saying what I think as I play.Well, I suppose I should turn off the bias switch first. It's a bad influence.Phew... So, Magicmaker. What I can only call a fun magic sandbox. Sure, there's a story. It's fun to listen to the characters and their rediculous ramblings, look for easter eggs, etc. I even have a save slot I'll occasionally restart just to look at that job chooser spell and all the unbelievable jobss it flips through. This game is one best played at your liesure, from my experience. Fiddle with spells for fifteen minutes, summon GIANT ROBOTS OF DECIMATION, and then go to work or school. Do it again in a week or two, try to figure out what you were even trying to do with that spell, advance in the story a little while sipping your morning tea. It's truly a casual game. However, under the pleasant atmosphere that just adds that small smile to your day, is a massive crafting system for weapons of mass destruction or tools to water the school's flowers. There's almost no limit so long as you seek more. This said, there are some downsides.New game +++++++++++++++++++++++++++. Oh jeez. I... Really, really appreciate the attempt to actually give the game a bit of difficulty and expand, but I don't think JUST more enemy health & damage plus an extra slot does it fully. I think it should have turned to the entire basis of the game; magic. Give more enemies the ability to use spells! Give goblin mages the ability to use more complex spells! Perhaps, add new ingredients as well? Although that's a bit wishful... Also, restarting with the ingredients I'd gotten before in New Game + feels wrong. I think it would be better for difficulty if it was truly a new game, just harder.The campaign is so short... Rediculously so. I don't know why, but I feel like I expected each + restart to have a different story. Now THAT'S asking too much, but I feel it would have just... Fit the atmosphere. Not only that, but it makes the short campaign excusable 120%.Honestly though, those are my largest complaints, and they've been brought up by many other people. In my honest opinion, the game is worth the $9.99 it charges. I'd pay twenty dollars, maybe more if the recommendations made by me and other reveiwers were taken into consideration and instilled in a sequal. I may not have played too long and gotten my money's worth just yet, but with this game I will. It's gaurunteed. On that note, I'd like to know of any similair magic sandboxes.

This is a solid little game that allows you to tinker with spells and perfect them to your desire. The problem being, from my limited experience with it, the areas get a little boring.I'll admit it, I got pretty bored a little past two hours of playing. That's a shame because this game seems like it has a lot of potential. I love the idea of tinkering with spells endlessly to see how I inevitably come up with the omega ray of death that will tear asunder all of my enemies. Problem being? This ARPG personally doesn't make me care about doing that.The story is fun, but not driven. From my perspective, that's this game's most prominent problem aside from slightly flighty controls. You play the role of an unexpectedly badass security guard sent to deal small problems surrounding a wizarding school. The story has a real tongue-in-cheek flair to its writing. That's great and all, but I tend to prefer my RPGs to have a little gravitas.The gameplay is pretty fun! I enjoyed the time I spent spellcrafting. Essentially, you go around collecting cards that enemies drop. These cards range in quality, but also in how they affect your spell. For example, you can have a standard fire spell, but you can also make it bounce around like a bouncy ball and blow up after a short while. That's a pretty simple spell for this game, too. Your spells are only as limited as your imagination. You get a lot of neat little tidbits that you string together to make a spell. In my humble opinion, the game's system is somewhere in-between Lichdom Battlemage and Morrowind in both complexity and fun in spell making. Overall, that's this game's strong suit, and it uses it well.From my experience with it, the armor system, which is an extension of the spell crafting system, is also pretty fun. Basically, you get a static, defensive buff that you get to play around with and make fit your playstyle. You can add on things like double jumps or permanent shields that you can adapt to fit your playstyle. These come in the same form as the cards as described above.Aside from the kind of bland and silly story, the areas could use a little work. There are four levels, and while you tend to have different objectives whenever you go back to them, it really isn't fun or exciting to do so. It kind of felt like a slog after a bit, which is why I stopped playing.TL;DR: If you don't mind a silly story, recycled areas,  and flighty controls, this is a solid little ARPG. I only touched the surface of the intricate spell system in this review. My suggestion is to buy it, but probably when it is discounted.6/10"

The graphics are stylized and are very pleasent to look at, the papercraft aesthetic is like playing through a story book.Pretty much everyone who looks at this game will be skeptical when they read about the 2 MILLION combinations for spells.  Yeah, sure. 2 million that are barely different from one another. However I still enjoy it as the little changes from spell to spell had different enough effects to be considered seperate. None of the materials seemed useless and I tried them all at least once. Pick your materials based on how you want to play whether that be heavy damage, fast attacks, status effects, or your own brew; Magicmaker likely has a combination that suits you.The writing is trying to add a comedic flair to the game and for me it was hit and miss. The comedy has a lot of parody and sarcasm, which may or may not hold appeal. The comedy doesn't impact gameplay in any way and is purely in dialogue and mission text. There are jokes and lines beyond the two mentioned above, and again comedy is subjective so I can only say that I chuckled at more than a few lines.The game is a bit easy at first, and for the most part will stay that way. This isn't a game that will put you through a wall but it can and will kill you if you get too complacent. Some areas can become bullethells with how many enemies are attacking you, and this is a problem. The screen can become a cluster of spells obscuring the player's view.The levels are nicely designed if a bit generic: Forest, Desert, Ice Cave, Haunted House, Ancient Temple. Each has something new from area effects like wind and duststorms to boss formats from a standard fight to avoiding the boss until you find the artifact to seal it away. The levels aren't very long but it works because most levels are maze-like and allow you to explore to find the collectables and complete the various tasks. The missions also add some nice challenges to spice up the levels such as only touch a certain kind of floor tile for a max of ten seconds by level's end.The combat is simple: see an enemy, use your personal magic arsenal to remove the enemy. Some enemies use projectiles, some can only deal damage through physical contact.  It's nothing new but it works well and finding your favorite way to dispose of enemies is half the fun here.The final level is a bit of a itch. New set pieces are thrown in that can really drive players mad such as the maze behind the walls. After you reach the end, the final boss is far too easy; the first stage at least. To be honest, I wasn't sure how I killed it. I was caught in an attack, prepared to take the damage and retailiate when it dies. I think there's a way to use some of the boss' attacks to damage it and this is likely what happened, but it was still dissapointing when I didn't get the killing blow. The second stage is much more interesting and I had a blast with it.The ending doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I guess is neat. It wasn't anything special and doesn't explain much, and left me with a few questions. Turns out there's a New Game+ mode where you can increase material slots on spells further which is a nice inclusion.If you've read all the way to this point, thank you!

I would warn that if your looking for a game that really challenges your skills this is not it, by the end of the first playthrough your stupidly overpowered. The big draw for me is trying new combinations and seeing  what kind of insane effects I can make."

And on that note, the graphics are lacking, the game is a little short, and I feel the pricing is a little high for the end product.I recommend this game, but only if you're into making funky spell effects and ONLY if it's on sale."

Or what about flying frost daggers that kill anything in the proximity?This game has a nice set of achievements, alot of freedom, randomly generated levels and a very nice artstyle.The game can crash and freeze alot though, so I'd recomend this game to someone with a few extra dollars in their pocket during a large sale."
,Recommended,319250,28735197,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Jam Usagi,"I love this game, and it certainly delivers the whole 'many, many combinations' thing. I've had lifestealing boulders, gigantic hand-shaped beams which curved towards enemies and set them on fire, ridiculously powerful magical swords; right now, I have a homing tri-beam with enough recoil to let me fly around the map, even without my quadruple jump.The humor is great too, and I've wasted a good hour or so just paging through the descriptions and laughing at them. The dialogue pokes fun at archetypes and the absurdity of a society of wizards, and the physical humor's pretty great too when it shows up. It's all round a funny game.Now for some things that aren't there. If you want story, this isn't the game for you. Boss fights are pretty lackluster too; they seem to be randomly generated in terms of attacks, but any two bosses from the desert area look almost identical, for example. In fact, the entire level seems to be random, from the times I've died and not recognised the layout when I got back.Another problem I have is with the level gimmicks. All the areas I've been to have had one (except the starting area), and they're all fairly obnoxious - periodic sandstorms which damage you if you're outside, darkness which can only be lifted by expending a material slot and thus weakening your spells, and pseudo-puzzles where you have to push crystals while avoiding the boss. None of them are especially fun for me.Overall though, this is seriously worth the money. The visuals have a very nice papery look, the choice of spells borders insanity, and the spells themselves provide fun, unique combinations which are great to just mess around with. Pick this one up if you feel like playing a fun, casual game with a playstyle to make your own."

,Recommended,319250,29629583,Posted: 1 February,all,Quantificate,"Quite fun. Basically do anything you ever wanted to with magic, in any color/style/flavor you'd like. Ricocheting lasers that penetrate walls? Check. Homing missiles that break into multiple shots mid-flight? Check. Instant Transmission at six times a second? Check. Massive world-ending fires? Check. Summoning hordes of minions that slow down your computer? Check. Seriously, if you can dream it, you can probably make a spell for it."

,Recommended,319250,34362179,Posted: 19 August,all,DJCRogue,Really unique concept and I had a good time the first time through. There is a new game plus and I went into it a little but I felt I've experienced the best with mixing and finding the spells I liked and the op spells for when the crazy stuff you tried failed.
,Recommended,319250,34471333,Posted: 24 August,all,Mr.FireMage,"I thought this game was really cool. I like how you can combine different spells to make one new spell. The gameplay is easy and fun. I think it would be cool if there was a sandbox option where you get infinite spells slots on all items and can combine every spell with every spell. It may may lag the player after using a spell, but if you don't put to many spells on, it shouldn't have a problem. Overall, I think this game is great and I absolutely recommend it to any fan of magic."
