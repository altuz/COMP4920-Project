,Recommended,319270,12116044,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Luke Warmwater,"Pros:Challenging but rewarding puzzlesCons:Unimpressive presentation.This review (and probably many others) is going to make nuermous references to SpaceChem.  This is because the mechanics of both games are very similar.  Instead of atoms, each level has boxes to rearrange into the targetted combination.  This is done using conveyor belts and various machinery that sort, rearrange, duplicate and combine them, depending on what you need.  The theme is more 'real world' than SpaceChem and while  I quite liked it, the 2D nature of the conveyor belts restricts the complexity of possible solutions.As much as it pains me to say, the presentation is somewhat lacking (the whole game is 33 mb).  However, I consider that puzzle games should be ranked on their puzzles alone.  In this case, the levels are straight foward but challenging so that it's a rewarding feeling when you finally solve them.  While I haven't yet attempted the hardest puzzles, based on the difficulty of the earlier ones I expect that each will take a long time to solve.While SpaceChem is the gold standard for this genre, there's no shame to be in such a great game's shadow.  If you want more, then Great Permutator is worth your time."

It's about SpaceChem level of difficulty (e.g. hard), so don't worry that it only has 50 levels as you won't be finishing them quickly. The soundtrack and art have a classic puzzle-game feel. The Steam version has some nice new features, and considering the cheap price any hardcore puzzle fan would be a fool to pass this up. Highly recommended."
,Recommended,319270,18665412,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,main_gi,"Of course!This is a challenging optimization timing based puzzler with a bit of its own style. Several optimization puzzlers (SpaceChem, Infinifactory, Manufactoria) in this genre are very ""big part"", complex games where there are many possibilities for solutions.This is a bit different. For most of the puzzles, the range of solutions is constrained - the constant grid size of 11x11 is used well without you noticing it at first. In addition, there is a limited amount of tools, also called 'action blocks', and the game exploits several of their traits including some subtle asymmetries. These combined not only means you won't have to think in such big quantities, nor will you forget how your solution works.This is a style of programming puzzler I really enjoy and I've got a lot of time and fun out of it.Update on negatives about the game, as well: The debugging is pretty poor - it is a very trial-and-error part of the game, though thankfully the mechanics are simple enough that it is not as bad as SpaceChem.8/10."
,Recommended,319270,16753695,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,Chaos_Defrost,"Not a bad game at all. First, if you're on the fence about this from the screen shots, this isn't for you. This is a challenging puzzle game through and through.If this sort of ""use pieces to get things from points A to points Whatever"" gameplay appeals to you, this is pretty fun, and is what you might expect. There is a demo, so you can decide if this game appeals to you.Bear in mind, though, this game has a pretty steep difficulty cliff right out of the gate. I was having brief trouble with 1-star difficulty levels early, and a lot of the early levels will either require knowledge of pathfinding, or teach it the hard way to players. Even early manipulating blocks are presented with the ""here's a new thing! Figure it out yourself"" instruction. This is not a casual game.This is, for those looking for a challenging puzzle game, a neat idea.Graphics have a solid, consistent style. Music is actually pretty good, never mind for an indie puzzle game. I don't much care about these for a puzzle game, but they're both capable here. Controls are a bit clunky. If you are those who wants controls to work for your specific style, instead of being ok with dealing with a not-quite-super-intuitive interface, you might have some issues with constructing your solution at times. I personally didn't much have a problem with it, but I know some people who will very much like this game's concept might have issues with the interface.Each puzzle after the brief tutorial is rough. And then, once you learn what the game is maybe expecting of you, challenging. And then, you'll come back to the game and solve something you struggled for almost a half hour with, a single puzzle, immediately, after time to sleep on or ruminate on the level. I've only gotten to the later parts of the first half of the main pack, but I can see this idea being the norm for this game. And ""only"" 65 or so levels becomes a complete, double-digit or so hour game when each level takes several minutes of thought, and possibly pencil and paper, to complete an individual level. And then, you can use what you've learned from that difficult level to beat more easily/accessably solved future levels. And the rare past level you chose to skip.And this is a barometer for which I will judge harder puzzle games. I'm fine with learning the ropes for them, and once you do, this game becomes a game where you have a eureka moment randomly on a level and then beat said level reasonably quickly, after staring at it and trying hard for a while on with no progress.The dev is also very receptive to the game's users, including being, in the past, willing to allow previous purchasers of the game elsewhere to get a Steam key for free when this was first put on Steam (From what I can tell from the game's discussions forum). I got this game during a sale several months after this went on Steam, but for smaller-scale games like this I like seeing how the dev(s) act with roadbumps in the release process. This game has, in the past, had a strong dev interest in its playerbase. I definitely consider this in my opinions, and this game passes with flying colors here.And on that ""graphics"" front, the spray-painted ""29"" in the game's interface for the challenge mode is a subtle change that almost represents this puzzle game's strengths too perfectly from those who dedicate the time to complete this game. Originally, the challenge was to clear the game with 3,000 tiles covered, but because of the community, it was discovered that one could beat the game covering (as of now) exactly 2,900 tiles. It's worthy of optimisation; and that's pretty big for a game that's not super-big to achieve; an ultimate challenge that even the dev underestimated, to an extent.I'm digging this. I might update this review as I play on, as I've not gotten past the first screen. But yea, this game is difficultly engaging for a puzzle game fan like me, almost to the point where I'm learning a bit about data structures (and am inspired to learn a bit about types of coding) from it."

Personally I think they could have done more with the presentation, but it's not so important. If you are looking for an intellectual challenge and are interested in finding the most efficient solution to something then this will satisfy that itch."

Not that expensive, and comes with very difficult puzzles from the beginning; Doesn't suffer from holding your hand too much, as many puzzle games do nowadays. You can tell that the dev put lots of polish and personality into the game."
,Recommended,319270,12143313,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Minx,"The game is a puzzle, but it's tricky and is not so usual puzzle. At first glance the levels are simple. However, after a while they can make you crazy and take hours and even days to solve.The gameplay is rather unusual. In regard to the graphic and music, they are simple and not so enchanting, but the game has its own style.Thus, if you prefer to solve interesting puzzles which can blow up your mind, the game is for you. Otherwise, be careful."

In first sight it is easy to bet game, but this small gamefield is impossible big when you try to solve another puzzle. No, really if u don't want to break someething after another wrong solution - don't buy this game. Otherwise if you like real strong puzzles - it is for you!"
,Recommended,319270,14554915,"Posted: 19 February, 2015",all,advancedspuds,"Great Permutator is real brain-burner puzzle game.  This game is a lot of fun but wow does it make you think.  It reminds me a lot of programming logic and such.  It's really fun, and you feel like a genius after solving almost any puzzle after the first couple easy ones.EDIT: After some time I will add this:  The game is still really fun, but unlike games like spacechem or infinifactory, there are very limited amounts of solutions.  It's more of a find one or two unique solutions or it won't work, rather than let you solve it and try to optimize.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does feel somewhat constrained."
,Recommended,319270,32695351,Posted: 23 June,all,dubesor,It's a great puzzler but incredibly hard. For me personally the difficulty started spiking too hard already after 7 or 8 levels. Not for the faint of heart. Incredibly challenging.

,Not Recommended,319270,13785150,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Pjoelj,"I want to like this game. I like puzzle games of most sorts. I enjoyed the crap out of Spacechem and Manufactoria. But while the way of thinking is similar, I quit playing this game wihtout having spent much time on it. Why?Because it just didn't feel good. Not only are the controls terribad, but the very premise just feels off. In all honesty, it feels like there was meant to be something more than moving things from point A to point B, before the devs noticed that was hard enough. The game feels like half was removed because the other half was nothing but a mess.If you're thinking of getting this, Manufactoria is both free and better. If you've already played Manufactoria, you'll just be disappointed by this."

On the second page introduction of the fuse-and-change machine greatly increased complexity so I decided to drop. Actually for an engineer A+ is good enough so I never tried to find the global optimum solution.Also, randomizer is not random at all. Rebooting Windows or even play the game tomorrow will not change the result. The seed of random number is purely based on the path that the boxes take. So neither luck nor replaying the level will help with randomizer level, which does not sound like a real randomizer for me.10/10 for workflow (they really ""flow"" on the conveyor lol) design and the price"

,Recommended,319270,16322020,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Pharap,"It's a simple concept but a lot of the challenges are surprisingly difficult.Some of the levels feel a bit too dificult, but I'm probably just being a bit thick.The only absolutely negative thing I can say about this game is the music is really irritating.Not all of it, just some bits, which makes it worse in a way because then I don't want to mute the good bits.It also has a 'build your own level' feature which no where near enough games have.So if the actual levels feel a bit tough you can make your own and watch someone else fail at them.The only other game that I can compare this to is Zachtronic Industries' SpaceChem as both have gameplay that is very much like programming. In particular the Great Permutator's swap machine, randomiser, duplicator and what is effectively the equivalent of an if-statement make the whole game feel like a cross between some sort of esoteric programming language (an obscure language that exists purely for entertainment) and the kind of puzzle games that people used to make for handheld consoles, but with 16-bit console/retro PC graphics."
