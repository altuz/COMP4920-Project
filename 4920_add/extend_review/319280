,Recommended,319280,16989807,"Posted: 11 July, 2015",all,ManBehindTheWires,"So, total disclosure - I've been working on this review since launch because it's quite a tough game to rate. In short, it's the weirdest blend of incomplete yet perfect that you can imagine. The fighting is razor sharp and, for a 24/7 fighter fan, that's all that matters.A lot of gamers and reviewers are making the obvious comparisons between 98/2002 Kof and Street Fighter III: Third Strike, but I feel it's more like a combination between KoF's unspoken cousin, Garou:MotW and an early Samurai Shodown title. There is a lean towards big juggles and weapon-enhanced pokes that I haven't felt in a long time and the polar differences between L and H normals and specials means that the art of constructing a decent combo will literally keep you up at night.The character selection is sparse, but mechanically the range features something for everyone, even mix-charge fans like myself. Furthermore, despite the complaints I've seen online, my cheap, fake, Chinese fightpad hooked up automatically, as did my notoriously PC-unfriendly RAP VX-SA fightstick - something that some fancier PC fighters have struggled with.The hitboxes are tight and tidy, which again separates it from its KoF siblings, and it means that you'll often find yourself trading and, as a result, relearning trade-tactics, even at a low level. Other nice features include KD recovery and the much desired KoF hop options. There's 2 buttons dedicated to the game's Third Strike inspired parry system, which I feel would have been more valuable as a direct rip-off - utilizing the forward & aggressive crouch positions like its origin. As buttons, it just feels a little detached, but it's still an appreciated feature that forces you to bet on your reads.Infact, with the ranged pokes, the parries and the KD recoveries, its fair to say that they've really captured that old-school ""reads"" mentality. Every throw, every hop, every meaty is a solid statement that you know the fight better than your opponent - something that's missing or diluted in modern fighters.Next up, the online is pretty slick. Despite lacking its previously promised GGPO inclusion, I've been getting some pretty great, seamless fights in, with only the occasional ""underwater"" match occuring. Furthermore, you can view pings, adjust frame delays and mess around with a bunch of other stuff to customize your online experience for the better.Another good sign of a thoughtful online mode is the ability to dip into practice mode without leaving a lobby, so you can work on those special cancels between bouts.So, as an exercise in making a perfect fighting game, there you have it - Yatagarasu  AoC is about as good as it gets. It takes inspiration from the greats, melds them together and comes out with something that's nostalgic yet new, punishing yet rewarding.However, that's coming from the perspective of somebody who cut their adult fighting teeth on the alpha series and Third Strike and, as others have mentioned, this game is a bit of a love letter for fighter fans of that era.Mechanically, it's all there, and that's all that matters to me, but if you put it up against almost any other fighter, the presentation of the entire thing is pretty jarring. From the minute you hit play it feels like you're in some kind of debug mode on an arcade cabinet, with a range of options and essentially dipswitch functions being the first thing you come into contact with.The menus and in-game navigation is also pretty funky and learning your way around training mode options and the two different, but never explained, arcade modes may leave the casual fighter fans and the capital G gamers yearning for a more polished experience.Personally, I like it and see it as another shoutout to the kind of player that knows the smell of burning silicone on a CPSII board, but it's not something for everyone.Likewise, the characters are almost at a Mortal Kombat level of pallete swappy (and a little goofy), but their styles are unique, they match up nicely with their movements and the hitboxes and hurtboxes are all in the right places, so the game exercises as a great fighter, regardless of how creative the character design is.There are some nice, thoughtful design features in amongst the rough bits like the assist commentary and the Samurai Shodown style hype-factory of an announcer, that will keep putting a smile on your face throughout with their comedy one liners and old school Akihabaran hatred towards throw tactics.Jumping straight into this game, guns blazing, it took no time at all to find a few links and combos with some bite, with the standard KoF build of jump in heavy, crouchy-standy mix-up into a special/overhead. Specials can often beautifully cancel into other specials, but there's no meterburn or drive cancel cost to do it, which will undoubtedly lead to some awesome acrobatics when Yatagarasu picks up competitively.My verdict here, despite its presentation, is that Yatagarasu is a top tier fighter. If you're begging for a new era of Third Strike and the like, this could be it. It keeps that old techy stuff alive, it's a future classic, it's both beauty and the beast. Just make sure to look for the diamond beyond all that mud."

(I'd recommend to buy this with a heavy discount though. I'll get to this point later)That said, the game is really mediocre in some aspects.What do I mean? Well, the menus are ugly and so is the HUD, it only runs on 640x480 resolution, and above all, it's the goddamn 2015 already, c'mon, take a look at Skullgirls, the same price, but it does have plenty of resolutions and modes.The game is really lazy in this aspect, but the character sprites and art are cool (sprites aren't Blazblue tier, but are good enough for the purpose of the ""classic"" feel)Also, some inputs are messed up (at least on a 360 pad, diagonals are inconsistent, nothing gamebreaking, but can get annoying for half circle moves)So, do I recommend the game?: Absolutely, the game is great and fun as hellDo I recommend to buy the game?: Not now, wait for a sale, 15 USD for this game is a rip-offEdit: Netcode is actualy fine and not terrible, just be sure to set-up the delay frame between 2 and 5 and you're ready to go"

Some work flawlessly, others don't at all even with proper drivers.-Stages are ugly beyond belief (personal opinion)-Menu system looks straight out of a flash game. Seriously, while trying to rebind my keys it felt like I was trying to config a ""Meet N' F**k"" game-Announcer portraits are LITERALLY PHOTOS WITH THE BACKGROUNDS CUT OUT-HUD is incredibly sloppyThe best way I can describe this game is if you took a fanmade MUGEN fighter and then....Well that's it really.It feels like a MUGEN fighter based on 3rd Strike mechanics complete with all of the ugly, lazy design that's plaguing what COULD otherwise be a decent fighter. As it stands now nothing has really changed from the early builds of the game and there's no way that it should have been released like this without going through an extensive Early Access phase first. Luckily I didn't contribute to the kickstarter for this trash, and Steam allows refunds now.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS IS MADE"
,Recommended,319280,17166804,"Posted: 21 July, 2015",all,Mikey (RitsuKing),"Quick review:Yatagarasu is fantastic. Yatagarasu has great netcode. Yatagarasu is beginner friendly. Yatagarasu is very fast, but Yatagarasu is not an anime fighter. Yatagarasu, quite frankly, looks like garbage.This is a game in which individual player skill, quick wits, and experience will win out over meticulously practiced combos.Thoughts:Yatagarasu is the first fighting game I've seen released since the launch of Street Fighter 4 that presents the player with an experience which boils down the SF-influenced 2D Fighting genre to its core. It apes Third Strike pretty hard, but it's much easier to pick up.At the end of the day, 99% of 2D fighters are just Street Fighter 2 with a gimmick. Yatagarasu has no gimmick. Parrying, to me, feels like the most natural extension of what could possibly done with the genre without changing the fundamental gameplay that Street Fighter 2 layed out. Parrying quickens the pace of the game without simply upping the speed. Guard breaks also keep players on their toes, expanding upon the typical guard, grab, 'n chip damage solution to turtling.In essence, while this is a more offensive game than SF2/4, your options for defense have been expanded considerably, creating a beautiful balance which keeps both players on their toes. Mounting an offensive takes much more than a block strong riddled with high/low mixups and the like.Please, play this game. It honestly looks really bad, it's obviously still in development (menus are very poor, stage icons use in-progress art), and personally, I think the the character designs are really boring. That said, the mechanics of this game are top notch. If you like fighting games, if you want to get good at fighting games, this is the game to play."

Great thing about this game is that there is a demo being offered. So you can try the game out before you buy it. From what I heard, you can also try the online aspect of the game as well.

76561198029345622,Not Recommended,319280,16932888,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,dreamprobe,"A disappointing fighter that I cannot foresee being substantially improved even after another development cycle. Sad to see this coming from some former King of Fighters developers, who probably shouldn't have gone indie - someone should tell them that SNKP is hiring for devs to work on KOF XIV right now. Note that I played the original doujin release of this for a good while before trying the Steam version, hoping that things would be improved after the Indiegogo campaign finished up.The HUD elements besides the life and super meters, and the menus are bar none the most poorly designed and confusing I have ever seen in a commercially sold game. Right when you start up the game, you'll notice that Arcade Mode is listed TWICE...how the hell did this pass basic playtesting? There is no Steam integration whatsoever, and the online settings probably require some sort of computer science/engineering degree to use - a bit much to ask of fighting game freaks.The graphics are okay, but uneven. Characters are generally well drawn and animated, but players who have more than a passing familiarity with Capcom and SNK fighters will notice some shameless sprite edits, especially with Jet inheriting several moves from SF's Dudley and KOF's Ralf Jones. The newer stages range from average to good-looking, but the ones made earlier in development all look like lazily photoshopped wallpapers, or even unfinished. The soundtrack varies from not terrible, to completely awful as in the vocal screamo song. There isn't a single song I'd remember or would listen to outside the game. There's no 16:9 support, but I wouldn't have used a stretch option with invisible walls (like in MvC2 on 360/PS3) anyway.The characters and mechanics are rather unremarkable and derivative. Most of them are lazy clones of famous Street Fighters, and four of them are just palette swapped clones of each other. Yatagarasu makes no bones about its heavy Third Strike influences, with its selectable supers and parries, but completely lacks the finesse, production values and charm of that game. There's two parry buttons instead of needing to input a timed directional, which doesn't really work too well. There's a story mode (listed as a second arcade mode), but it's boring and bare-bones as crap, the translation is kinda off, and it fails at giving us any more of a reason to care about the doofus wannabes that make up the roster. Admittedly, the four characters added as a result of the Indiegogo funding are somewhat more original and well designed, though Hanzo's moveset is a complete mess.The people promoting this made a big deal about the commentator feature, where canned clips of several well-known FGC personalities (or at least I think they're well known, I didn't recognize a single one) will play during the match in response to what's going on. I found this to be nothing but inane, annoying and immersion-destroying, especially with the real-life photographs popping out all the time. We don't need stream monster crap escaping Twitch and venturing into the world of the game itself. At least you can turn these off, but I don't think you can disable commentators used by online opponents.I applied for a refund and probably won't be revisiting the game unless it gets hugely overhauled. Why would you ever want to settle for a vastly inferior clone of Third Strike? If you want an under-the-radar 2D fighter that's actually really cool, original and memorable, check out Chaos Code on PS3 (a Steam release has been hinted at)."

79569199074321708,Recommended,319280,17691825,"Posted: 24 August, 2015",all,AceRei,"Cool fighting game, quite rough around the edges but definitely worth checking out, especially for fans of Street Fighter 3rd Strike looking for a 2D fighter with a parry system.If you're looking for a polished and visually appealing menus, you will probably be disappointed, as they look rather rustic and can be unintuitive to navigate. However, if you can look past that there is a great fighting game here with very mechanical movesets and battleing.As with most fighting games I would recommend it more for multiplayer than the singleplayer aspects, as while the premise of 1920s ninjas is pretty cool, the storyline isn't particually interesting. You could have a lot of fun with netplay vsing other players. The game also has a very in depth training mode that, although a bit unintuitive, can aid a player to prepare against almost any incoming attack.The main draw of this game is the parry system from 3rd Strike. While in 3rd Strike you had to press forward as the hit connects, in Yatagarasu there are dedicated buttons for high and low parrys. This means I would say this would fit right at home with people who want to try learning a similar system to 3S and want something new with the parry system.There isn't a large variety of characters and they are quite limited and reuse sprites, for example, I'm pretty sure Jet and Jyuzumaru's pants are exactly the same and there are a few characters who are basically the same character with slightly different moves and a different haircut. Several of the characters are near rip offs of 3rd Strike characters like Jet is very similar to Dudley and Hanzo is very similar to Chun Li etc. That said there a variety of combos attack methods to perform with each character, the characters do perform differently.The pixel art is great for the characters, they are very nicely animated and look interesting, however the backgrounds are quite poor and don't mix with the character art at all, they look like they are on different planes of reality. Only the street background looked like it had any effort put into it, some literally look terrible and I cannot tell what they are supposed to be or look like.Music ranges from mediocre to really good like the opening which is great. The voice acting is good and so is the sound effects, they sound very authetic.Overall, its a good fighter that needs a bit of polish around the rough edges but is definitely worth checking out and isn't too expensive at $15 at time of writing this review."

A lot of the story/text feels thrown in and slap dash and the presence of Arial Font for the text during these scenes just feels cheap. I find myself completely ignoring the story and just mashing the attack buttons to get to the next fight.I also feel like the game needs some kind of Villain or Final boss.. as the game stands it just sort of fizzles when you beat the arcade mode with no real climax.I think the reason for those downsides is that the game seems inteded to be a multiplayer/tournament focused game with a competitive community, and in that respect it pretty much hits the mark. I just feel like all of the ""story"" aspects of the game either needed to be fleshed out more with better visuals or removed completely, it feels very out of place.Otherwise it is a very good 2D Fighter and very reminiscent of Street Fighter 3."

Despite the record, I should've played around 50 hours or so.Reason for not recommending: not worth $15. I only kept it because I missed refund.The game is ok, it has decent amount of character with some variety. Unfortunately, you won't be finding any originality here, all of the moveset came from somewhere else like KOF and Street Fighter. It has some defensive move, some offensive move. Parrying is the selling point. Since the game focuses on simplicity, you won't be spending too much time learning how to use each characters.Here are problems: online, menu UIs, little controller support.There are very limited online players out there. If you are lucky you can find 10 people. If you are bad at the fighting game, enjoy getting beat'en up for a while. I spent about 1 hour getting defeated for over 20 times by same person. I also wanted to point out that hosting a match is a nightmare. I tried with my friend and it did not work.The promissed GGPO netcode is not included. You must port forward your router, but then again, not all of the router will allow you to do it fully, so in worst case scenario you will be stuck playing on random match only.The menu UI is not very good. Online is difficult to see, confusing, it's not polished at all. Seeing ""2 arcade modes"" doesn't make any sense. There are some options in training mode, but hard to navigate.Unlike many other fighting on steam, this game has very small support for controllers. Keybinding is pain in a butt, you have to go through your system file and open document in notepad, reading them in JAPANESE.If you still need explanation for not recommending this game, just think for a moment- you have 2 options, between Yatagarasu and Street Fighter. Both have similar style, but Street Fighter have far more characters, more online players, and most importantly, more single player options. Even with its double price, the Street Fighter is what I would get, in fact, what I SHOULD have gotten. It really doesn't matter if it's doujin or big company game, there should be no excuse for poor quality- you are the one who's paying for it.If you bought majority of fighting games on Steam, then I guess this is your limited choice left. If you just started to look for fighting games, I don't recommend this game. If you are limited to your budget, go get Skullgirls.

Port forwarding is needed in order for players to join your lobby (which could be problematic if you've never done it before), however those with experience with the GGPO client will have no issues, seeing as GGPO needed ports to be opened for it to function.There's also been complaints about the look of the HUD, launcher, and the lack of resolution options but personally, I don't have an issue with that and I hope that doesn't keep players from enjoying this game.Do I recommend it?

The AI too isn't too bad, I've seen worse.I think the problem of this game is in the expectations of the buyers.If you expect a very unpolished, dirty, badly adapted game that looks like a mugen project brought in a haste over to Steam... well, if this is what you expect than you might actually enjoy this game and its fighting core which, as I mentioned before, is really nice. (there's more depth than most probably expect, especially in the intuitive parrying system and in the plentyful combos you can easily make)If you expect a small, polished title, then you couldn't be more wrong and you will be sorely disappointed.Sprites are nice, characters are nice and original too, there aren't too many animations but I've seen worse titles.The stages are mostly just a fixed painting with no animation or depth whatsoever, the menus are very unpolished (the illustrations are nice) and there's quite a bit of recycling in the characters. At least 2 are basically a sprite-swap of two other characters.Which wouldn't be a big deal if there were a lot of characters, but alas it's not the case.Settings too are very confusing and badly adapted to steam and there are several issues with Gamepads (it's a mess to make it recognize the analogue triggers as digital buttons).I personally do not suggest this title. If you wanna get it make sure you do so during sales and that you know what to expect (there's a nice demo that can help with that!)"

The game definitely has a reasonable cast of characters that feels appropriate for the genre and fight a bit differently without being overly different in their usage, and the paired down move list gives a more simple yet satisfying experience for the fighting game enthusiast. The game probably shouldn't have come out of early access in my opinion, as the polish around the edges especially with UI and in game inconsistency in elements is apparent after playing for a period of time, but that doesn't overlook the good solid fighting base here. It's no Skullgirls, but if you're looking for competitive fighting at a low cost, this may be up your alley.Gameplay Footage and Video First Impressions:http://youtu.be/i7HAEz5pHz8Lists:+:Solid Simplified Fighting Mechanics that aren't overly complicated, and focus on simple strikes and combos while not being overly reliant on combo strings.Good Character variation that doesn't hit too much of a range of different methods/strategies, but does just enough. Characters may have specific focuses like Grappler or Zoner, but the base gameplay is accessible to most people in the end.Characters designs are simple but they work. Good color schemes for most characters and they don't detract from battle.I like the idea of commentators and choosing them, and while it may get old after a long period of time, did appreciate their inclusion, as it helped to add to the spectacle of battle.Like the simplification of the low/high system and eliminating the medium.Feel like the game plays better for players who want to be more aggressive, which has been different then a lot of games for fighting (Ultra SF4 being a prime example)-:Story mode is weak,  like most fighting games, and especially with a new franchise it's hard to follow along with what's going on.Missing polish. Things like the Story mode reading Arcade, and simple ideas like a dizzy symbol over the head is missing to add to the game's overall presentation.Trigger buttons are not able to be bound on Controller.UI elements at time can be ugly, and feel like they were thrown together at the last minute, especially in story mode/arcade mode."

,Recommended,319280,16970451,"Posted: 9 July, 2015",all,The Midboss,"TL;DR at the bottom!The best way one could describe Yatagarasu would be if 3rd Strike and King Of Fighters had a child.This child is a real throwback to the late 90's early 2000's for fighting games, with simple combos and confirms, gorgeous sprites, and a killer soundtrack.You won't find any massive combos in here like you can find in games like Skullgirls and Marvel vs Capcom 3, instead this games primary focus is footsies, you need to be able to safely get in and get a hit to confirm into a small combo ending with either a special or a super, all while making sure you're not punished in the process. But tha also means you'll have to defend against people coming in at you, and you have multiple tools to do this. You have your standard anti-air attacks and blocks, but you also have a parry, something 3rd Strike players are very familiar with. But beware, if you miss this parry, you can eat a lot of damage from an incoming combo.The netcode, while a bit scary at first, is very good, with adjustable inputs to to minimize lag and work with whatever ping you have. (I have heard a rumor, however, that it will eventually be getting GGPO, which will be prettier and easier to use, but comes with all the problems GGPO entails, i.e. frame skipping rather than lag).With a cast of 11 characters that all play differently, there is variety in the cast.There are also ""commentators"" in the match, these range from the in game characters to actual commentators in the FGC from both Japan and America, such as Tokido, James Chen, Ultra David, and Maximillian. This is a nice novelty, but eventually they all run out of quips to throw out, and get's old after a while.One thing this game has the people may see as a problem is an intentionally low resolution, so it could better emulate the feel of the fighting games from the era it draws so much influence from, but the people who place a high importance on this should be warned.The only real negative this game has is the unpolished UI, such as 2 different modes both being named ""Arcade"", text overlapping in the lobby select screen and while doing the challenges in training mode, but im sure this will be touched up in future patches, and is a negligble complaint as is.TL;DR - Amazing fighting game, total throwback gameplay and visually, great netcode - if a bit intimidating, subpar UI, 8.5/10"

A combination of 3rd Strike and KoF, this game is really well presented in terms of mechanics. Only reason why I can recommend this to people who plays fighting games regularly, but not to those who aren't familiar with the genreSound: Great soundtrack. However, most of the time, the songs are not very well looped. A minor inconvenience, but not unbearable. The japanese voice acting seems on point, and the and I love the effort that the developers put in for the community, adding the voices of people who are popular in the fighting game community, such as Maxilimilian Dood, James Chen, etc. and included the voices of each playable character.Artwork / Graphics: I'm not sure what to say about the graphics in game, since this is developed by a small group of people. I'm sure that they were going for a more, classic feel like 3rd Strike and older KoF games, but needless to say, I'm a little dissapointed by how the characters look in game, especially since it's 2015. Character artwork is great, but minimal, one per each character. Also panties and♥♥♥♥♥♥for the fan base.Port: The port of this game is a HUGE mess. The horrendous and lazy looking UI will make you think this game was developed by someone who just got out of college. Get used to seeing a lot of text over a bland square of white because that's exactly what the pause menus look like. There are translation errors everywhere. From cutscenes to the option menus, no one can escape the engrish. The controls can get messed up, going by the bugs forums. Keyboard, controller, and sticks doesn't work sometimes, and there have been problems with the game inputting down for no reason. Several bugs. Only one resolution size, so steam overlay looks messed up. That is, if one can open up the steam overlay. I personally can't open it up, but there might be people that can. Developers definately needs to fix this up if they want a running community.TL:DR good game that received a bad port. I look forward to the oncoming patches, and hope they clean up the mess they've made. I understand that this will take some time, as this is a community funded indie game. I only recommend if you're a veteren of the fighting game genre.7/10, not enough fan service"

Every single time.-Shimo is there. Shimo is best girl. Buy the game for Shimo.-I love startup options in games. I'm glad that Yatagarasu has them.-Netcode is good. I like being able to choose what the delay is. GGPO is going to be implemented in the near future, so it's only going to get better.NEUTRAL:-The announcers are kind of neat, but they were a bit annoying to me, so I turned them off. Some people may like them, some may not.-Older sprite style may be off-putting to some people, but I personally love it.-The twitter integration in the game is interesting. It's not intrusive or anything, but you can set it up to send out tweets when you create a lobby, play in a ranked match, or play in a tournament. There's also an option to tweet about a combo you've just pulled off in training mode.  Could be very useful for streamers, or other people who host lobbies quite a bit.-You have to port forward to be able to play online. This is easy, to do, so it's not that big of a deal. This might be changed when GGPO is released for this game.CONS:-UI is a bit ugly. But that's not a big deal, since you spend most of your time fighting, not staring at the menus.-Steam overlay didn't work for me.Overall, this game is really fun.I'd give it a 9/10, and if you like fighting games I think this title is worth your time."

The stage art clashes with the character art pretty badly at times.The bad:1. Online play is confusing as hell. Port forwarding and technical setup aside, when you join a lobby, you have no control over the cursor unless you are host. Lack of any chat feature means you are basically waiting for the host to decide who gets to fight who and set the match up.2. GGPO is supposedly coming in a future update. The game needs it now. The slowdown and online wierdness is pretty bad as it currently is. Being able to set the frame delay before the fight is great, but doesn't solve the problem.3. The mechanics are deep to the point of craziness.

,Recommended,319280,17275214,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,DJ Mad Struggle,"This excellent fighting game was designed by three developers who previously worked for SNK, which most notably produces the King of Fighters series. It plays in the style of Street Fighter III 3rd Strike with a revised version of the game's parry system. The basics of the game are easy enough for new fighting game players to get into, but the parry system allows veteran players to take advantage of predictable opponents.Anyone who enjoys or is interested in getting into fighting games should try out Yatagarasu. At only $15, it is  definitely worth your time."

However I would like to note that it would seem as if the sword wielding characters (like Hida) have alot of range and damage on certain moves that makes it seem as if there is no way to get around that unless you turtle and play the game in a very defensive way. I would like to see a change in that from the next patch, otherwise I would suggest this game to my friends."

However, the fighting is smooth and has worked pretty well with my controller. Characters give you a nice standard mix.If you're looking for a polished game, this is not that game. If you want to get your fighting fix and don't mind an ugly interface, might be worth the purchase."

The thing that sunk this game on arrival is the lack of any reliable online play. Hopefully with their recent small update this is a sure sign that they will implement GGPO very very soon.EDIT: Boy was I wrong that they would ever implement GGPO at all, let alone updating this game. I am now going to update this review to further reflect the current state of Yatagarasu.Don't buy it. Developers ditched this game. No GGPO, no improvement over the UI, nothing for the gameplay at all. Not worth it.It's a fun game but nothing added over the years to improve the game."
