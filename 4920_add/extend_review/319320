76561198030080447,Recommended,319320,15253642,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,PrinzEugen,"Time Myteries 3: The Final Enigmais a typical Hidden Object Game by Artifex Mundi. At its core, it's a relatively easy point-and-click adventure, featuring (rather) beautiful scenes, attractive Hidden Object screens and some small puzzles. Both puzzles and hidden object screens are quite easy, so that even complete strangers to this kind of game will find something to their liking here. The story of the game, still the core of any adventure, is however rather bland, especially during the first third of the game. Featuring the same female protagonist as in the earlier two games in this series, the game tells about the need to ""save the world"" and how Esther manages to do so by altering the past, in order to save the future. With the help of Time Crystals, she can travel to different dates in the past and search for clues in order to avoid the upcoming catastrophy. It's nothing original, but the story picks up after some time and kept me interested during the latter part of this (rather short) game.This edition also contains a bonus chapter which tells the same story from another point of view: a neat touch that added not only an hour of extra gameplay, but an original view on the game a well. While the visuals are up to Artifex Mundi's high standards, the sounds certainly are not. The voice-acting is one of the worst I've yet heard in a game by Artifex Mundi: completely artificial and never giving any character something like a personality. The music is too repetitive: I muted it very early in the game. As ususal, Steam integration is perfect, complete with trading cards and a series of easy-to-get achievements which should give you another ""perfect game"" without much as a hassle.All in all, I'd like to give this game a ""neutral"" recommendation, but since the quality of Artifex Mundi does shimmer through even in one of their weakest game, I will still give a ""thumbs up"" - but there are many other, more recent, Artifex Mundi-games  out there that offer much better quality.Overall score: 6/10."

,Recommended,319320,16166228,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,*IC* Smiledozer,"The Final Enigma; Artifex Mundi's last installment in the Time Mysteries Trilogy. As a pretty avid Hidden Object Gamer, I love Artifex Mundi and all their work. If you're familiar with them, you already know that many of their games share a similar engine and similar play styles. This usually makes it easy for one to write a review about, but Time Mysteries is a difficult series, one which I believe I may find myself split on with aMixed RatingTime Mysteries is probably the single trilogy that seems to not get the positive ratings that Artifex games always get. I can tell particularly, several reasons why. It is hard for me to speak on this series, given that I have only played 75% of the way through of this particular game, which happens to be the last. Therefore, I didn't want to judge too quickly, but I've noticed these several things enough that I feel I can speak as to the pros and cons ofthisinstallment. I have sunk maybe an hour or two into it, which if you know Artifex Mundi, you know that their games are short, but never lacking in content that truely makes the game. Artifex Mundi is known for its' great puzzles, HOGs, and storylines. These are the issues that I find are excellent and poor points of The Final Enigma...Pros:- As always, beautiful scenery and great artwork- The time travel element of the game is great. Using the special time clock you have is almost like using the map in other Artifex games, but something about it is just different and fun! :D- The story is very solid- Dozens of areas in the game to go to, more so than past games- The cutscenes can be amazing (at some points. It seems that AM has possibly changed up their cutscene style??Cons:- The voice acting in AM games can be a bit corny, but we deal with this because we love AM! But, this game, barring the protagonist, has a fair amount of poor voice acting.- Sometimes, the voices can sound overdriven or not mixed so well.- The puzzles difficulty level vary rapidly. I've found extremely easy and difficult ones just as well. This is probably a game to play on the Expert mode.- The cutscenes can be poor (at a minimal level, only sometimes).Verdict?5/10- Sorry Artifex, I love you, I really do. The Final Enigma wasn't all that I expected. the mixed and negative reviews made me think that they were people who just weren't that into HOGing or Artifex in general. Upon playing this game, I realized why the reception was so mixed.The first Time Mysteries is about to be released on Steam (after a reconstruction process, this is why some of the first games from the AM trilogy are currently missing). Before I write this series off as a sub-par trilogy, I would like to play through the entire series. The second and third (this one) have often recieved a thumbs down or negative reviews. It is probably for the above reasons that I am truely split on this game. For the first time I actually do wish Steam had a ""Neutrul"" Button. IWILLrecommend this for the time being. Why? Because it has a bold, newer style to it. The way that you travel throughout time and space is very cool. Also, the concept of the entire game (and probably series) is an interesting one.Give it a chance if you love Artifex Mundi or Hidden Object Gaming. You might just like it. For those who are not sure about it, this probably isn't for you if you're casting even a little doubt. I would highly recommend these AM titles; Grim Legends, Nightmares of the Deep, or Enigmatis."

Good graphics, good music and more interesting storyline than the original.  I think Time Mysteries 2 was the best in the series due to its length.  While they are all easy, since they are casual games, I found this one a little too easy compared to what the rest of the series offered.  Still though, if you enjoy the genre, well worth a playthrough if you catch it in a bundle or on sale."

The cut scene videos were a bit off and the voices didn't match up completely. But hey it wasn't a bad game by any means. A decent point and click, but a lot of time traveling to get to point A to point B to complete different puzzles.The graphics (asides from the cut scenes) were good, but not the best I have seen from this developer. Either way, a fun game if you can get it on sale. I beat it in about 3.2 hours, which is a bit shorter than others I have played in this genre.Do I recommend it? Only if you like point and click games. It's average in my book. And it wasn't difficult unlocking all 11 achievements either."

The protagonist also seems to be... well... kind of dumb, discarding objects after one use for seemingly no reason, when they could easily come in useful again later. However, so far i'm finding it oddly addicting. I've played hidden object games before of course, however it isn't a genre i'm usually interested in. This is different though, adding in the very interesting mechanics of being able to time travel and see your changes in the past reflected in the future. There's also sometimes quite a delay between finding an item and being able to use it, or vice versa, giving that lovely eureka feeling of ""OH I remember what I do with this"". The puzzles aren't too difficult, just enough to make you think but not enough to frustrate you, with lots of variety in the types of puzzles you have to solve, ranging from simple ""find these items"" to connecting fuses in a way that reminds me a little of Bioshock's pipe puzzles. This game ended up surprised me in being a lovely game to play casually to wind down in the evenings."

A solid ending to a hidden object game trilogy.Long version:One of the largest problem with Time Mysteries 2 was the lack of story and continuity with the first game. Final Enigma chose the opposite path: not only it’s completely plot-focused, but it features characters and places from both previous games. Sure, it’s basically a huge rip-off of Terminator, but fits well into the established canon.It seems the story was such a priority that the development team forgot to work on the puzzles; they pose absolutely no challenge. Even the hidden object scenes are a letdown with only a few dozen items per scene. The contrast is even more apparent in the bonus chapter, which reuses parts of the second episode. (It also lacks any original content, making it possibly the laziest bonus episode we have seen in a hidden object puzzle game.)To sum it up, if you have been along for the ride since the Inheritance or if you would like a nice and easy HO game for a change, then it’s more than recommended to get this one."

Most of the time, the rest is fun too though.I'm a bit undecided here.I like this one a lot more than the previous ones.The hidden object games are just right for my taste (medium difficulty).The alternate to the HO games is great. Same as in Time Mysteries 2, where I don't have the option to just play it from the Extras, but it's possible here! A different kind of matched-blocks-disappear game. That adds a lot of replay value for me.I could follow the story better in this game (than in the previous ones), and it's interesteing, but it still feels disconnected. Maybe I'm just not for time travel. The immersion I am used to from other games, including other Artifex Mundi titles, was missing.The jump-to-room-and-time function is great to save manually walking around, but here it increased the above mentioned feeling. As before, I ended up just ticking off of exclamation marks from the device.The puzzles (mini games) could use an explanation on what to do.So, with all that, in the end it makes a thumbs up.There are few games where I don't turn the music off first thing, so I can't say anthing about that."

Before buying you must accept the (*) point at the end and its length.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------Time Mysteries 3: The Final Enigma is a sequel of Time Mysteries 2: The Ancient Spectres.You play as Ester Ambrose to save the world of an evil cataclysm that a hooded face wants to happen. She will need to time travel in order to be able to save the world and prevent the cataclysm to occur. And then begin a new journey for her.As every Artifex Mundi game you can move freely in different area and need to solve some puzzles and find all objects in hidden objects scenes. The game has (different difficulties?) and a guest feature: every one of the family can play an independent save and resume the game where they left it. When you first play the game you’ll have a notebook where you have all your objectives as well as all your notes. You’ll also have a time travel device showing a map that allow you to fast-travel. Adding to that you’ll have a hint button that will help you in many ways but be warned that you may not use it in any puzzle or hidden object scene (HOS)or investigation scene (IS). Hints can be used to know where you need to go, where is the next interaction or to show an object or clue in an HOS or IS or to skip a puzzle. To conclude this part, you’ll also have an inventory to store useful items through your journey.Puzzles are good and different. Hidden objects scenes (HOS) have only the classical one (as far as I remember): find objects hidden with the help of their name. Orange names mean that you need to interact directly with the scene or use an item in the scene.One of the very good thing of this game is that there are 2 unique features you won’t find in any other Artifex Mundi game (except Time Mysteries):•	You’ll be able to freely move through time (and space) with your time travel device.•	You’re able to play a unique mini-game instead of the HOS. (I don’t really suggest it if you’re going for achievements though.)To do so (to time travel) you’ll first need to find it (?) and to retrieve every token to be able to travel to specific dates.And for the mini-game, as far as I recall I think that’s a matching game: you need to click on a chain of three or more adjacent balls to remove them. (The aim is to let some kind of token to fall out of the screen or to remove adjacent balls?) Each time you remove a token you remove also an item in the hidden objects list.(*) :In addition to no skip or use any hint while playing every puzzles and Hidden objects scenes, there are a few more missable achievements. Two of them requires you to complete a puzzle and a hidden objects scene under one minute. And 2 other hidden objects achievements ask you to find 3 objects within 3 seconds or to finish a scene with less than 4 misclicks.Finally if you missed anything while finishing your first playthrough, you’ll need to play the game again. I guess but I’m not sure that you need to play on the same profile to get the “One of a kind” achievement."

It looks like the general consensus on Steam as to the Time Mysteries series is a 'pass' on TM1 and 'recommends' for both TM2 and TM3. And I agree. You'll miss nothing but disappointment by skipping TM1 and starting the series with TM2. The only negative I really have to say about TM3 is that the bonus game was lazy garbage that added little-to-nothing new to the story and seemed slapped together with what appears to be very little thought or effort. No likey. Besides that, I enjoyed TM3 and otherwise recommend it. Played well for me on Linux Mint 18.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review.

Like the first two, the puzzles are straightforward and it shouldn't take you long to finish the game and get all the achievements. The voice acting is still bad, but the writing has improved a bit for this one and sends you in better time-looped circles than the first two.Improvement in the graphics is sadly offset by typos in the main menu and game text, and some explanatory text which doesn't make sense (have a look at the chess game puzzle). To top off the 'we rushed this' attitude, the trading cards still have the Time Mysteries 2 logo on them.After being a bit more impressed with the Nightmares hidden object games, playing through all three of these games I keep coming back to the same thought - there's a really neat concept here with the time travelling family with its roots in the Merlin mythology that's been butchered and given poor, rushed execution. While this continuation of the story is an improvement, the series still leaves a bitter aftertaste in knowing it could have been done so much better."

You also have to save Viviana, the villain from the second game. This game has a lot of time line changing in it to fix everything and create a happy ending.Game play is standard hidden object flare. Lots of hidden object scenes and lots of fun mini games plus achievements to collect. The artwork is stunning and it's fully voice acted, Michael getting a huge upgrade from the first game.

It's presumably one of their more dated projects, and it shows. Not only is the game short (I beat it in 2 hours, including the bonus story, though I'll confess to skipping two or three puzzles in addition to about two-thirds of the cinematics), but it's just a little clumsier than what I'm used to seeing from them. The hidden object segments are hit and miss, but mostly miss thanks to lower-res images and a tendency to hide the most identifiable part(s) of some objects so that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be when you're looking straight at them. (An inevitable few confusing labels - ""handle"" for a knob, e.g. - are old hat, but still annoying when they happen.) The usual nonsensical ""keys"" and progression items are at play, which is forgivable but not ideal, and it definitely has one of the weakest and least well-integrated plotlines in the library. My biggest gripe, though, is that this game only offers two difficulty options, basically divided into a kiddie mode that holds your hand constantly (this is what I settled on, contributing to the brevity of the playthrough) and an exasperating mode that forces you to find and remember every detail of the often unintuitive environments if you wish to progress.That said, the successful AM formula - a good balance of puzzles and hidden object scenes, nice visuals accompanied by good voice acting, etc. - manages to keep the overall experience positive."

On normal, it seems pretty eager to let you skip puzzles/hidden object searches after a short time, and quite actively leads you around the adventure parts by highlighting relevant places to go/things to click.Downsides:The usual adventure problems where the solution can be a bit obtuse, but nothing too taxing;Hidden object is so naturally evil (unexpected interpretations of the words, physically improbable hiding places), but this doesn't go too far into that kind of thing;Some of the puzzles are a bit boring.Upsides:Time travel plot;Hilariously dodgy character models;Good variety of locations"

The gameplay is quite fun, as it is in most of their games, but something that surprised me is how interesting the story turned out to be. Usually in these games the story is not a strong selling point, and especially not in this game's predecessor, ""Time Mysteries: The Ancient Spectres"". The story in that game is horrible, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sequel managed to do a better job in that department.I do however advise against playing this game if you haven't played the predecessor ""The Ancient Spectres"", as it would detract from the enjoyment. So either play that one beforehand or don't play this one at all, since a big part of what this game managed to do right is in allusion to the previous title in the series .So yeah, that's my advice."

Wonderful that they currently always support Linux, but the cloud synchronization should be turned off — it's common problem for all Artifex Mundi games.Also it's awesome that games always have Russian translation, including graphics.One drop of poison: there's a tend in AM games to turn all the tasks into ""find where find-an-item-game has appeared"". These find-an-item-games become very boring after 4-5 time, so I hope AM will finally come up with something new."

The time travel was ok; it initially pulled me out of being immersed in the game while I tried to figure out the mechanics. The puzzles are not too difficult and the voice acting's similar to what I have experienced in other Artifex Mundi titles. Time Mysteries: The Final Enigma is worth playing, but I recommend getting it during a sale. $10 seems like a bit much."

I played on the expert mode (which usually works for me fine) and noticed that the hint-button didn't really work outside the hidden object scenes where I specificly would have needed it on a few occations. It pointed to the time travel machine and when I opened it it said to press the compass (?) and then it always gave the same note saying that exclamation points mark the active areas but THEY NEVER DID.So no help there.I haven't played the first two games which might be one reason why I didn't always see the game's logic clearly. I skipped the previous ones because of bad reviews. I hear this was hard. I guess it was. I was lost.Still I'd recommend this, just maybe played on the easier mode."

There is nothing that really makes this one stand out. The artwork is good, the puzzles are pretty standard, the story is okay and the voice acting is a little ropey in places. Even though it is not the greatest hidden object game it still provided a few hours enjoyable, casual entertainment."
