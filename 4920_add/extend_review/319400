,Recommended,319400,12865379,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Bobbith ㋡,"Super first game for my 3 and half year old twins.The game is a very simple hidden object adventure game in the form of a children's pop up book where items need to be clicked in the right order to progress the story, the presentation is charming, and obviously the characters are all instantly recognisable to little folks who have seen any of the Pooh related Disney merchandise in the past.  Poohs voice is fully voice acted, as is the narrators, the rest of the cast is mute other than the odd funny noise.  Gameplay itself is pretty repetitive, but perfect for little folks who are just getting to grips with  moving a mouse around for the first time.The game appears to be fairly short, after about an hour of the two of them taking it in turns to do pages they were on page 15 of 20 shown on the main map screen, apparently there are mini games they have unlocked but we haven't looked at those yet.  If a game was this short and I had purchased it for myself, I'd be saying “to short” or “buy it on sale” however the full purchase price was worth it just for the moment when they were both excitedly sitting at my desk shouting “it's a pooh game!”.4/5 honey pots"

It's basically a video game adaptation of the 2011 Winnie the Pooh movie. However only the voices of the Narrator and Pooh are a part of the game, so don't expect a complete experience. Still, my son can play the game by himself just fine and my daughter loves watching, although she's not quite coordinated enough to use a mouse by herself yet.If your small children love Winnie the Pooh, it's hard to go wrong with this."

This is a game about retrieving Eeyore's tail.There's only two voices, Pooh and the Narrator, which wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't keep drawing attention to it by having the characters 'talk' to one another.It's uglier than the real game and looks like it was animated as an afterthought.Nothing worth clicking on, it's always bushes rustling or pots moving with very few sound effects.Every single 'game' is just counting to five.No songs.There are collectable honey pots that do absolutely nothing.  But for all I know I didn't manage to collect them all as there is no way to tell if you've missed any."

Played straight through the whole game with my kids (3yo and 1yo) and we all had a blast.  The game is built to look like a popup book and the narrator reads the story to you.  At times the story will stop and you'll have to click on something on ""the page"" to advance the story.  The item that needs to be clicked has a blinking outline.  There are other things you can interact with on every page including hidden mini-games, but the ""main story progression"" stuff is blinking and obvious to even the youngest of children.You can even choose to just sit back and have the whole story read to you.  I don't see myself trying this anytime soon, but hey, figured I'd mention it.It's near impossible to find games that I can enjoy with my very young children.  Mouse + Keyboard is way beyond their depth and gamepads are too large and confusing to them.  This game gave him a chance to manipulate the mouse for the first time and to sit back and ""guide"" the action when he didn't feel like clicking himself.  We've tried a bunch of other games together and this is the first one we both had a great time playing.Can't reccomend this enough if you're looking for a way to spend some quality gaming time with very young children."
,Recommended,319400,28548690,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,Thoughtforms,"It's not often there comes a game that knows how to keep a player coming back for more. Disney Winnie the Pooh however, is one of those games that falls under this criteria. From the rich gameplay, to the charming characters, Disney Winnie the Pooh is an experience that demands to be felt by everyone capable of playing a video game.To touch brief on the story, the game centers around detective Winnie the Pooh, a former member of the narcotics division of the Hundred Acre Wood Police force, and how he has to piece together why his troubled ex-wife, Christopher Robin, has returned to see him after 25 years of silence. The story goes much deeper beyond that, but for the sake of preventing spoilers, I won't continue on more. As the game progresses, the player is introduced to a wide variety of characters. All booming with personality and each one just as memorable as the last. Pooh's old friend from the force, Piglet, is easily one of my favorites in the game. Piglet, once a former member of the Hundred Acre Wood Police, is now trapped in the dump known as ""the vice"" where he spends his days dreaming about his glory years. While there, the player encounters two of Piglet's colleagues, Tigger, and Eeyore. And yes, it's that Eeyore. As seen in Disney Metal Gear Solid for the Sega Pico, Disney really had a way of promoting their game huh? Tigger and Eeyore are a dynamic duo that Pooh comes to grow chummy with, and they soon (along with Piglet) become some of his greatest friends. I'm only scraping the barrel with Disney Winnie the Pooh's characters, but I assure you, the pay off for meeting and seeing them yourself is worth it.Moving on to the gameplay, Disney Winnie the Pooh is a detective game that requires you to be engaged and inqusitive throughout. A mouse cursor is used for pointing at objects and people of interest, and interacting with them. My favorite part is when on the flight to Christopher Robin's house, the player is given the option to allow Pooh to grope the stewardess (sick ♥♥♥♥). When the player isn't interacting with various entities found throughout the game world, there are intense shooting scenes that can be played with the Sega Saturn Virtual gun, Playstation Mouse, Namco Guncon, or 3DO mouse. Of course, the standard controller for your system of preference will work just as well, but aiming will be a tad bit difficult. No matter what input you use, there is no denying that these moments in the game are the most intense and nerve racking. The player simply moves a crosshair across the screen and shoots their gun at their target. It's simple, yet somehow very satisfying. On the screen, Pooh's ammo count is displayed (he has infinite ammo) and above, is his health bar. If Pooh's healthbar is reduced to completely red, then the player gets a gameover and ends. Fortunately, the player's health is restored after each scene. Making the journey much more seamless.Being that this is a mystery/adventure game, one puzzle in particular where Pooh and Piglet have to open a jar of honey is absolutely nerve racking and defintely will try your patience. The game has many other puzzles through out, but instead of me telling you about them, you should definitely see for yourself.Though the game's gameplay and story hold up, how do the visuals and music?Well good news, the graphics and music are absolutely fantastic. The steam version of Disney Winnie the Pooh utilizes the NEC PC-9800's 8086 5MHz processor that allows for fluent animation and cinematics that will make your spine tingle.  From the opening shot of Pooh sitting at his desk eating a jar of honey to Piglet driving a car, Disney Winnie the Pooh's jaw dropping cyber punk noire 80's graphic style is sleek, stylish, and down right sexy. The breathtaking visuals are of course complimented by an allstar soundtrack composed by John Williams, Robin Beanland, and Kevin MacLeod, an ensemble of absolute awe. Some of these tunes are even iPhone worthy, begging to be listened to even when the game is off.In summation, Disney Winnie the Pooh is hands down one of the best gaming experiences of 2016. From the jaw dropping graphics and music, to the memorable and attractive characters, Disney has really outdone themselves. Once again providing the world with a classic that will be cherished for decades to come."
,Recommended,319400,14692538,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,phoenix_advance,"Oh bother, where to begin? Think, think, think. I bought this game because I felt like hearing Winnie the Pooh's voice. And it delivered tremendously! It also delivered in a chock full of Poohey atmospheric plot goodness. The narrator was also excellent and is as addictive as listening to G-man from Half-Life.Although this game is most likely designed for kindergarten, prep aged kids and probably TotalBiscuit, I am most impressed with the approach of ideas to the point where I’d even tell off a few game developers that make mindless FPS mechanics to learn a thing or two about basic gameplay concepts with Winnie the Pooh.It’s mostly a game where you have to click and find things on the screen. These things are mainly mini (memory recall) games, finding hidden honey pots and interactive hotspots to aid in the progression of the story (which cleverly sneaks in complex words). This is good, because it’s educational to the target audience.The story is presented as a pop-up book. Where each page is a level that unfolds before your very eyes. The unfolding animation is a cool concept. I know this cause when I was a kid, I use to love pop-up books to the point where I’d even make my own. Why can’t there be anything artistically similar that drives the gameplay of an FPS game?You can even go backwards and forwards through pages you have completed. There is also a home page which displays a map of your entire journey. I like this very much! It’s not stated what game engine was used, but that it’s a custom designed one from Avalanche Software.Some things that weren’t a big problem was the 1280x800 screen resolution. However it would have been nice to have at least 1920x1080. There was also a part in the game (page 13) for me where I clicked everywhere furiously trying to find something, but it crashed. The only fix was to start again from page 12, because going directly to 13 would end up crashing the game immediately.For an adult, it’s a short game, about 90 minutes long. Those are quality minutes! I definitely recommend this game. Also how often do you get to own a game called Winnie the Pooh. Pooh! POOH! POOH! … POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Pooh-Pooh."

There's 19 levels, all with unique environments. You got the forest, the city, the jungle, the snowy mountain, the volcano, the beach, the ravaging tornado, the firey pits and of course the torture champer room level. All levels have their own music track and it's absolutely beautiful. You got your standard heavy metal and dubstep music playing in the background while you're playing this Dance Dance Revolution type of game. Many would say that this racing game is a bit violent for the average person, but. I think you should give it a try.Also. It's a high performance game, you need to have a big computer to be able to play this.I've written the pros and cons below for all you tl;dr people.Pros:- Triple A game with beautiful 3D graphics.- Great heavy metal music and dubstep music.- A wide variety of guns.- Collecting horny pots is always fun.- 19 amazing levels.- Tight controls.- Everyone can pick it up and play it.Cons:- Can be a bit too violent at times.- Some racing segments can be a bit of a pain.- High performance game. Can hardly run it on medium with my GTX 750ti.Overall a really really nice game that you can easily bear. 9/10"
