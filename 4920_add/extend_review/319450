I was waiting for it to come to PC, then one day I searched for it and was suprised to learn it had come out with basically no hurrah.Anyway it is one of the best couch co-op games I have played. I imagine it would be kind of a lonely experience to play alone, but with a friend it is excellent. You pull along a dead king in his Chariot, he comes out as a ghost to berate you for not finding him a good enough resting place so you continue on a journey through underground catacombs.You need to keep the king's chariot near you most of the time, as you can't pick up gems or collectables on your own. So your two characters ""physics puzzle"" (best verb) their way through the world with the king in tow. You just need to watch a short video to get a feel for how the game plays but in essence it feels very smooth and manageable to get around. It is surprisingly effortless to get the chariot over bumpy terrain and on and off platforms, though I feel bad for the guy and girl who are doing it.I thought perhaps having to look after the king might become a burden after a while, like one long escort mission, but because the chariot won't move on its own (unless you leave it on a slope of course) and you have such fine controls to move it around, it hasn't gotten frustrating yet.The game also looks great, very crisp. If anything lets it down it is these dark levels half way through, they are quite oppressive compared to the earlier game, I am hoping they don't continue like that because it really bums me out when you miss lots of things because you can't see, it forces you to compulsively explore every nook and cranny which isn't really that fun (Edit: Watched a trailer, looks like they don't stay dark, it is just a few levels, so all is well!).Overall though it is very nice to look at, very enjoyable to play moment to moment and a lot of the puzzles, especially the special gem ones that require two players, can be very challenging. My friend remarked that it kind of feels like a game Nintendo could have made and I can understand that. Nothing that bad every really happens, except now and then a bat might steal some of your loot.That skeleton needs to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up though seriously skeleton shut the ♥♥♥♥ up."

It can be challenging at first, but when you learn this game's innovative mechanics, you'll be amazed how much fun you can have, especially in the co-op environment. Beautiful visuals and soundtrack make this piece of entertainment very unique in its genre.I would recommend controller for this one.Definitely worth the price. ;)"

When you I first started this with its soothing music and sound effects I thought I was in for an easy ride how wrong was I in thinking that.The first level is easy enough breaking you on how the chariot handles but after that it gets harder pretty quick to the point where I nearly gave up and put it in my I can't be bothered anymore this is too hard and frustrating to continue I have lost count the number of time I took my anger out on my controller to the point of smacking it on my desk a few times. BUT I don't know why or what it was I just kept on coming back for more time after time until I got onto the next level and then found myself going back and trying to 100% every level I must of been mad.Anyways this is a platformer that you have to have in your collection because the satisfaction you get from completing this game is awsome I am now on my second  play through I must be crazy but it keeps pulling me back for more.Thumbs up for the devs and lets hope they do a Chariot 2

I say this, because that is how I played it and cannot comment on the keyboard and/or single player experience. My guess is that it would be significantly less fun. The focus is very clear in this title.Essentially, you and a friend are tasked with taking a coffin to a final destination. You will be pushing/pulling this coffin all over the land capture collectables and complete puzzles. There is a store for upgrades between levels. There are 'gadgets' that alter gameplay and strategies. It starts with a very reasonable difficulty, but I hear it ramps up alot later in the game. I'm fine with that.Pros:+Controls are butter smooth.+I love solving puzzles with friends, and this is where this title really shines - it is FUN!+Graphics, music, voice acting, and menus are all really well done. Very intuitive and crisp.+Although there is a begining and and end in a level, there are lots of routes and overall options (including multiple entrances, and speedruns).Cons:-Can't really pick on much with this game. I will update if anyone comments on a 'con' that I am missing, or if I come up with anything as I play more.Full price is like 15$, but I only paid~4$. Its worth full price, IMO."

Infact, the gameplay really reminds me of Journey (which is another game I love heaps).So as soon as Frima Studios announced that the game was released on Steam I knew I would be buying it straight away. But, I saw that steam recommend that you play this game with a controller...unfortunately, I don't own one.Eventually, I brought the game and decided to try playing the game using the keyboard. At first it can be quite difficult to but I say within 30-45 mins you'll get the hang of it and will be fine with it.I have been playing as a single player which is still fine and great but I do recommend playing this game with a friend, buddy, pal etc. You'll have tons of fun as there seems to be alot of levels."

Co-op and the various gadgets available in the game extend these options further.The difficulty of the game is also spot on. It gently introduces you to its mechanics, and then ramps up the difficulty continuously. By the time you reach the final (secret) level it throws some of the hardest challenges in any platformer I've ever played at you, but never feels arbitrary."

You are a princess who has to take her father's funerary chariot around to amass a treasure worthy of a royal burial.  The game mechanics of this physics based puzzle game are easy to grasp and pretty much acts in the way you think it should, which makes the barrier to entry low enough that I just started playing the game with a friend in co-op and was immediately able to manage my way pushing and pulling the wheeled casket (chariot) around the obsticles and puzzles.

It turned out to be really fun to play and had the right amount of challenge (and yelling at your co-op partner when doing the optional tricky treasure hunts). I've only played co-op and I didn't finish the whole game yet so I can't answer for singleplayer, but the gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's a physics puzzle game built around pulling a cart with a rope or two. You can unlock stuff inbetween stages when you find the parts for it in the levels and collect enough treasure. The levels are quite big and the artstyle is cute. Not sure how long the game is but we did everything we could find in each level so far and I think it took about 40 minutes or more per stage.

,Recommended,319450,17389275,"Posted: 4 August, 2015",all,SupaLeetHaxor [Twitch],"Soooo this game is hard to decide wether it wants to be a good platformer or not, purely because of development issues and/or oversights, I'll make it as simple as possible to explain...I first saw this game on a Let's Play and instantly fell in love with the couch Co-op implication, as well as the aspect of the game itself, very inviting and intriguing to play. I downloaded this game without hesistation because I love playing adventure co-op games with the partner for hours of joyful fun, but after an hour or so, it started to go downhill, but I'll get to the issues as they come to mind.Gameplay & Story - 7/10 - You drag a dead king in a box to lay him to rest in a suitable area, but sorry, your resting place is in another plot of land! That's the main plot of the story thus far for me, which looks like is the whole game, the gameplay is addictive for completionists, but leaves me frustrated when the game doesnt allow you to get that thing which is arms length away due to an item you get later on in the story, it's frustrating to not get the best score possible just because we haven't completed it yet.Sound 8/10 - The sounds are okay, nothing special, the latch onto the coffin thing to save it from oblivion will be heard alot, and the caves arne't too bad, but it's nothing too noticeable, feels the same every level.Visuals 8/10 - I would give this game a higher score for visuals, but I just cant when so many things look the same, no memorable landmarks and nothing that wows me, apart from the pretty plants that bloom from the chariot, and the glimmering lights alongside pretty collectable gems, which is a nice touch.Issues - As well as what was mentioned in the Gameplay paragraph, there are technical issues that have made us quit the  game a few times, again, the concept is great and so is the game, but here are the things that should be fixed- Controller jams up, and one player takes the form of an out of control chicken in Zelda, rendering the player useless to maintain control of him or herself, the ""chicken"" will fly around in the air whilst holding onto the chariot, this can only be fixed by disconnecting the controller and trying again, losing your stance if you are currently holding the chariot.-Whilst climbing your own rope, you can glitch and fling yourself somewhere unexpected if you have the chariot in a tight position-The physics of the game are not explained clearly, I know we shouldn't have hand holding, but some things punish you too much for falling off a ledge (Yes I'm looking at you Co-op challenges and platforms the side of a pea)-The ""maze system"" and multiple paths are opinionated, some parts you can't get to can be annoying and having to pause just to see the map is a bore, halting the experience, mainly what was explained earlier, completing a level perfectly doesn't mean you did great, just means you're going to want to grab it all again when the story takes you back through the area.Verdict 7-10 - I can't say it's a bad game, it's very pretty and feels good in my Steam Libary, but I also can't say it's great, I'm hoping to keep playing it but the issues are too frustrating to ignore, even after coming back fresh and ready to try again, I shall recommend The Chariot, but I'm skeptical about doing so, fix the issues, and everybody's happy"

Some achievements are only unlockable in co-op (there's no online co-op here, and if you wonder why, just go and look in the game's forum/game's hub and the devs explained their point of view which I totally agree with), other achievements almost needs to be ''purchased'' to be unlocked, and I think this is why this game hasn't received that more recognition.This is a game I put way up high at the top of my favorites games of all."
