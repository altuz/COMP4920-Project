Its full of fun little cyberpunk references, has lots of humor, exciting music, and the artwork is cute. Gemma is a fun character to play and how she interacts with her dad and brother is very amusing. Her dad owns the pizza shop and he tries to help her deal with her problems, while delivering pizza twenty stories up of course! Each level starts with a quote from dad about how pizzamaking is a metaphor for life... or something.Pros: Well designed platforms, good story, great characters,Cons: not terribly challenging at default difficulty, levels get repititious a bitThat said, I can't think of any other game that is both funny and emotional like this is. If you're interested in something different and like speed platformers this may be the game for you!"
,Not Recommended,319470,19901484,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,vczh,"Too many bugs. The character always gets stuck on a jumping mode or a crouching mode when it arrives at the corner of something (e.g. wall) and there is no way to get up again. Sometimes the spacebar just doesn't work. So many things are happening when the character was running, it ruins the feeling.When I sent out this comment I have already played for 2.1 hours so it is too late to return, so I keep finishing the story. During the time, there are more bugs:1) When I do the speed run and finish the running, and I hit ESC after the score pops up and than I hit ESC again to close the menu, than the ""Home / Rerun"" menu pops up, and it cannot be clicked or highlighted!2) I don't understand why but the game frequently goes into a strange situation, than the screen begin to shake.3) Sometimes the game doesn't react to my key if I am pressing too fast (I play Starcraft!). For example, when I am landing and hit shift, the character crash into the ground.I don't need to comment on the game play or design. Only talking about the the technical part, it is enough to make me don't believe that those developers really want to make a game."
,Recommended,319470,18260372,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,SMishra,"A wonderful game about the emotions and feelings I think a lot of people go through in their life, all wrapped in a slick take on classic platforming.Each level is generally quickfire as Gemma rushes to deliver her latest pizza or help a friend by rushing to her destination and triggering the next story element, and while it starts out quite a simple A to B affair with some jumping it quickly adds in new interesting elements like other Ninja's who will bully and belittle you or new environment hazards/utility elements such as poles to swing from or trampolines to bounce off.While I find these added complexities interesting and enjoyable to overcome I can understand it might make the game a bit challenging for younger less experienced players, fortunately Disparity Games has them covered with difficulty options that can make things a bit more manageable or even crank up the complexity for people who've played more Sonic the Hedgehog than we really should have.There's also a neat system that is used to manage Gemma's mood across the game, as she gets bullied more and more or goes through a tough time you can boost her spirits by changing up her outfit or having a cup of tea with her family :)I wholeheartedly recommend Ninja Pizza Girl, it's charming, thoughtful, and above all really fun to play."

The terrain isn't the only obstacle you must overcome: rivals and self doubt torment the young protagonist. In the later levels what seems like the slightest thing will break her resolve (mildly frustrating).Pros:-Interesting and challenging level design.-Decent music.-Compelling story.-Collectibles (if you're into that sort of thing).Cons:-The cursor does not loop from top to bottom in any of the menus, I know its minor but still annoying.-Sometimes enemy placement is unfair.-Occasionally difficult to tell a background object from a foreground object.-The TLC system and the results/consequences are explained properly."

It feels great to run through a level, ducking enemies and hopping over gaps while keeping up your speed, and there are plenty of opportunities to do just that. Also in an hour of play, I never once found myself thinking ""Oh that's not fair, I was close enough to that pipe, I should've grabbed it!""Although it's an early-access release the game is actually complete, the developers just haven't finished tweaking everything just yet. For this reason I was expecting one or two crashes, but instead the most heinous offense the game committed was 'taking two more seconds than expected to start the 'Level Failed' dialogue when in midair', which I feel I can forgive.From what I've seen so far, the story is surprisingly upbeat - yes, rival pizza delivery people are out to get you and it's a little sad seeing the chirpy, friendly protagonist Gemma repeatedly belittled by these d-bags - but there's a lot of friendship and family and comedy too. One chapter concludes with 'No pants, no pizza!' and Gemma hurtling aforementioned pizza off a balcony in protest of a man's refusal to answer the door wearing pants. And I don't feel bad about spoiling that because there are a dozen other funny occurrences and dialogues that are equally amusing.There is definitely an aspect of the game focussed on the social issue of bullying, but it A) Doesn't get in the way of the gameplay in the slightest. B) Isn't being used to deflect any criticism, and C) Is never too over the top to take seriously. It's a down-to-Earth, relatable game, about a pizza-delivering ninja being harassed by a rival corporation.Overall, this is the kind of game which I would hesitate to call perfect, but nonetheless I genuine cannot name a single notable flaw. A must-buy for fans of quirky indie platformers - I can definitely see myself obsessing over getting the fastest time and highest score once I'm finished. 9/10."

I press the button to attack any incoming enemies but the enemy still attacks me first, almost as if it's scripted.Hitboxes for enemies is bad, and also unreliable.These are the sorta bugs you expect from a low-budget phone game in this genre.This is afullyreleased PC game.This sorta stuff should be fixed in it's development phase.The actual gameplay is fine, at the core, but as stated above it gets destroyed by all the bugs. It leaves a terrible taste in my mouth throughout the game.The story is basically trying to be an anti-bullying campaign but the game doesn't actually do that what so ever, and the main character, you, is the exact opposite of an anti-bully.She is insensitive and mean and doesn't compliment the story at all.This is another example of a game that has a great idea behind it but was executed and developed by seemingly un-motivated developers. The game hasn't received any update to it's bugs in almost a year as of posting this review either, so that says something.There are tons of other platformers out there that lay ahead of this one.Playing this game with a keyboard is also a nightmare as there is no keybinding menu(or virtually any real menu at all except for volume sliders and a resolution slider).This game requires a controller to play.Stay away from this unresponsive, bug-riddled game with story and gameplay that contradict one another.Made by lazy developers that don't bother fixing bugs in the game post-release."

A challenging platformer with a cute story, awesome electronic music, and very original mechanics regarding it's ""health points"". While most games track the character's health as it takes damage, in Ninja Pizza Girl what suffers is your self-esteem, and gosh is it accurate. Those ninjas laughing at you after you tripped and fell were so infuriating at times. Which is the point of the game actually (also, punching them in the face isn't as rewarding as completing the level in a new record time. Who's laughing and streaming with ther phones now? Not me, because I'm not a jerk like you stupid ninjas).Anyhow, this was a great game. Within it's 'indie' boundries of course. Yeah, it has some visual and audio glitches at times, and I must admit the comic style is not exactly my cup of tea, but remember this was made in a kitchen! It's quite remarkable as it is.Also, as a final note, I love, love, love the family quotes in the beginning of each level. It's not just cute, but it shows that in Gemma's young mind her family is the greatest source of wisdom and advice. And I can relate to that. I think we can all relate to that.Great job developers.

But hey, here we are.This was quite the surprise to me. I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it, other than that it was about it's namesake: pizza-delivery ninjas. I got so much more than I bargained for, and the true intentions of the game came to me like a slap in the face. I won't spoil it for you here, since I truly believe that this is a game that needs to be played to be believed,  but just know that, if you go in completely blind, you will probably end up crying. A lot.PROS-The very concept is ludicrous, and yet delightfully so. It never feels too out-of-place despite being completely irrational to the logic of the real world.-The controls take some time to get used to, but once you do, they're very simple and easy to remember.-This is one of the few modern-day games to feature unlockables such as a 'big head mode', 'motivational mode', and other such callbacks to old PS1&2-era games. It adds an extra bit of silliness without discarding the more serious nature the game takes on in the later half.-The story is simple and easy for children to understand, and yet it treats the subject matter relatively maturely (considering the title, that's pretty damn impressive). It isn't nearly as juvenile as games like CoD that expect you to just kill everything in sight because ""HEY GOTTA BE EDGY AND CONTROVERSIAL, RITE?!!""CONS-The dialogue is a bit stiff sometimes, and it far too often feels like people reading from a script rather than actual people speaking. This doesn't hold the more serious scenes back too much, but it can often feel uncanny.-I hate to rip on the art because it grew on me, but it's...not great. Proporttions are off, characters feel like they're constantly off-model, and the expressions are, much like the dialogue, uncanny.BEFORE YOU BUY-This game is meant to be played by anyone of any age group. Don't expect any kind of violence aside from momentarliy knocking people out/being knocked out. If you want to sate your bloodlust go buy CoD or something.-This game is really short. Like...REALLY, short. Like...90 minutes kind of short.FINAL SCORE: 7.8/10"

It was on sale at the time, and it looked kind of like a 2D Mirror's Edge. Well, after beating it, I'd say that's pretty accurate. But it's more than that, too. The game pieces together a story about overcoming the struggles of being bullyied, which I feel resonates with the younger folk. (such as myself) There's also plenty of pretty deep quotes that the game shows you. It's not a long game, but it's really fun and sends a good message.

The setting is fairly well developed for a platformer game, with lots of references to other science fiction/cyber punk societies. I like the self-esteem health system and the (mostly) fluid animation - also the guidance system, so you never have to stop running to try and work out where you are or where you need to go.I ran into a few bugs that caused me to get stuck in ledges, as some of the animations seemed to overlap in certain spots.

The final level of the third section is based around keeping a pizza warm, and to do that you have to stand near heaters. Now, normally this kind of slow paced level wouldn't bother me, but the issue is the speed at which the pizza heats up. In order for the bar that indicated the pizza's temperature to build up halfway, you have to stand next to the heater for THREE MINUTES and the pizza's temperature drops back to that point in less than 30 seconds. So the entire level is based around standing while I browse twitter or watch a youtube video instead of actually playing the game, and after spending over 20 minutes trying to beat this level I just gave up."
