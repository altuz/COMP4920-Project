,Recommended,319510,11784122,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,イナゴ,"Five Nights at Freddy's is an awesome little indie game that's become very popular in a short span of time. The gameplay is simple - you're in a room and have the ability to control the lights and doors of your office as well as the ability to monitor the cameras dotted around the building. You need to keep an eye on the four animatronics that will move around and kill you if they manage to enter your office. To make things more difficult, you have a very limited amount of power which is drained more quickly if you keep lights turned on and doors closed, effectively meaning you need to leave yourself exposed if you want to survive.As a horror game, it works very well. The robots are suitably unnerving and the game makes you extremely paranoid thanks to the lighting and sound effecs. There's nothing unfair about the game - if you can keep your cool and use your resources effectively, you'll be fine, but more often than not the player will end up panicking and being punished for it. The atmosphere and story are fantastic as well - the messages and notes left behind for the player all add up to create a very enigmatic yet creepy story that people are still speculating on, combined with numerous other easter eggs.The developer seems down to earth and willing to listen to his fans, and has already promised a sequel. I would recommend buying the game to support him for this reason and so that we can hopefully see more games like this. The game is not huge, but it's a great addition to the horror genre and is definitely something all horror fans should want to see more of in a sea of action games and zombies."

I kept the doors shut the whole time and drained my power in less than five minutes. I give this game major props. I have bad anxiety, and this game has actually helped me a bit with that. The paranoia and anxiety I experienced through my multiple play throughs of the night one and two, helped me realize that things that make me nervous in real life aren't as bad as being chased down by killer animatronics. So thanks for that.I'd definitly recommend this game to anyone who can last the five nights. I know I sure as hell can't (made it to night 3), but that doesn't stop me from trying."

,Recommended,319510,12594135,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,Schmoes,"Five Nights at Freddy's is an Indie point-and-click horror game that literally bombed the Steam Store on its very first month of purchase and is infamously known as a fresh breath of games that play along the themes of tension, paranoia and sudden fear. It is also most known amongst fans of the game that famous Youtubers such as Markiplier and PewDiePie who have made the sales of this game boost even higher than usual indie game sales. As a small synopsis related to this game, you'll be waddling through Freddy's game of don't-hide-but-seek, right to the very perilous end.With only little power reserved for poor old Mike Schmidt in the Security Guard's Office of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a family restaurant complex, you'll be struggling to stay alive and out of danger on your six hour shift of work, starting from 12 AM to 6 AM for five days straight, hence the title of the game. With every night progressively getting worse in both psychological fear and paranoia. The repulsive animatronics that run alive during the night become much more unpredictable, with unexpected jump scares that will leave your heart to skip a beat and without a doubt, make you want to rage quit the game as quickly as possible. You will be having to deal with Freddy and his fearsome buddies, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox. Rather cute names, yet really ugly faces indeed.Inspired by the beloved restaurant, Chuck E. Cheese, now, the deepest nightmares of those kids have come to life as these animatronics in game don't want to sing you no birthday song or throw you a party. They simply plan to crush your body into a mascot costume, completely mashing, fracturing and probably suffocating you in the process. Pretty gruesome way to die, no?What makes this game very intriguing is the community's efforts on theorizing the deeper meanings of the game's overall plot and context. Ranging from how the phone guy is the actual killer, to Foxy being a good animatronic rather than a bad one. This is all deeming down and shredding away the structure of the story that makes us think in our own perception. And I love the community's reasons for that as it takes devotion and well-thought ingenuity to piece together the mysteries that still lingers on, even to this day.The game honestly doesn't become as scary as you may think. If you have been playing for hours upon end, it becomes somewhat highly addictive in a sense. Not to spoil anything about the game, but after the main five nights, you have an optional 6th night and even after that, you can proceed to the insane 20/20/20/20 difficulty mode, where you're doomed from the very start. Unless you can manage to live through it that is.This game actively toys around with your mind, as you will mindlessly switch the lights on and shut the doors in the much more frightening and perilous nights ahead. Things begin to get real hectic as odd noises protrude from various locations in the restaurant, from the animatronics humming, to random musical tune, to loud footsteps and of course, the demonic laughter. You never know if Bonnie and Chica are ganging up on you or even worse, if you can't turn the lights on or shut the doors, knowing you're doomed with an eventual jumpscare at the end. Even Foxy begins to act creepy, since he's the biggest reserved essence of paranoia for me; you never know his patterns directly and you're left shook up if or when you witness his hasteful, creepy run down the hall, leaving you only little precious seconds to slam the emergency door down, or else you'll be greeted with an expected jumpscare and a game over.Definitely recommend this game, and the time I recommend to play this game perfectly fits at midnight, all alone in the dark. I bloody dare you and if you have completed this game, congratulations! Move onto the even more scarier sequels that wait up ahead, brave soul. It's about to get a whole lot more nightmarish."

Believe me when I say it is one of the most terrifying horror games ever made and it really is as scary as most people make it out to be. The way it plays with your head and toys with you makes you feel so vulnerable and isolated, it isn't like anything else I've felt in any other horror game.What makes this game so unique is two things: its gameplay, and how you have to survive. Normally in horror games you've got the ability to roam around the map, run, hide and pick up items to help improve your odds of survival. Not in this. You're confined to just one room with a device that lets you take a look at the camera feeds throughout the pizzaria, and in this one room are two doors to the left and to the right, both of which are JUST out of your peripheral vision. You've also got a light for each doorway, since it's completely pitch black through them, so that you can see what is through the doorway (trust me when I say you'll be needing to use those lights very often).Here you might say ""well why can't I just close these two doors for the whole night and not have to bother looking at the cameras or turning the lights on?"" It drains the power quite rapidly. If you drain the power early, it's game over... just not instantly. Because of this, you want to conserve as much of your power as you can, which means you won't have the option of keeping either of the doors closed for the whole time, nor the option to keep the lights on. This is where the game becomes pretty terrifying. And then there's Freddy and his pals...It'll be easy for those who want action in their games to dismiss this title, since you are only in one room for the whole game. But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥do things become tense very early and very quickly. If you are a horror fan, this is an ESSENTIAL title that you NEED to play."

The player's influence on the world around him is limited - the only way you can fend off the creatures is to track the threat and close the doors around you when they appear. Given that operating anything uses up your precious power resources, you're left exposed for most of the game and can only act in your own defence when the threat is at your doorstep. Furthermore, you can only know that the threat is there if you turn on the lights temporarily, and the knowledge that there may be something watching you from the black abyss that lies just outside the door is terrifying in itself. So throughout the game the player is left powerless, exposed, fearing the unknown, feeling like the enemy is one step ahead, and incapable of eliminating the threat, only delaying it. These are the emotions that truly thrill you and scare you. The jump-scare is merely the pay off to the complex and deep tension that the game creates. And it does all this on a shoe-string, exposing just what a solid and simple concept can do for the gamer.I now get why this game became so popular, and while the things you see and hear on Youtube may make you feel like the game is nothing more than a cheap thrill, I think it's a deceptively simple but masterfully crafted experience."

Whilst it's a place where kiddies go during the day to have fun and party, you aren't here during the day, no, you're the Night Watchman After all, you gotta sit the night shift through to get your meager living, how else will the bills for your crappy apartment get paid?What are you watching for? Burglars? Teenage no-do-gooders? No, you're keeping an eye on the Animatronics themselves, Now, the Animatronics are left in Free-Roaming mode at night so they don't break down more than they already have, they used to be able to during the day, but that ended up with one of the Animatronics being decommissioned and some poor soul without a frontal lobe.This wouldn't be a problem, but the animatronics will stuff any naked endoskeleton (I know there are theories that they're just murderous, but I'll just go with this for now) into a Freddy Fazbaer suit, it won't damage an endoskeleton, but with all those wires 'n crap in the suits, imagine what they would do to a person? Speaking of a person, guess what the Animatronics think humans are? (hint: An Endoskeleton)The establishment is in decline, after multiple lawsuits and events (including an infamous event where a man dressed up in a Freddy Fazbear costume and kidnapped and murdered children) it's low on funding, kids and their parents aren't as willing to come to if after the public events, and the whole thing is expected to be closed by the end of the year.Because of this state, they have a limited nightly electricity budget meaning that you have only a limited amount of energy with which to do things such as check the cameras, light up the hallways that lead to your office, and close the doors to prevent the animatronics from stuffing you into a suit, with limited power comes with the fact that closing the doors would mean you're wasting it, and you thus need to leave yourself exposed if you don't want the power to go off as Freddy sings to you his Toreador music box before he ends your night abruptly.The game has a dark setting, a terrifying atmosphere, and is a great title, everything from the dark hallways to the animatronics themselves, everything about this game is great, you're going to be blown away by the subtle yet terrifying world this game is set in, with rumors still circulating about its mystical yet dark plot and background of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, you're going to love Five Nights at Freddy's."

It's at that size where it's not small enough to be quiet but too small to create a fanbase that doesn't smother people who come into contact with it. Between that fanbase and the jumpscares, it's really easy to take these games for granted. Which is a shame, because they're genuinely good and unique in a lot of ways. The design and gameplay are simple and stylized really well. The jumpscares really are the weakest part of the game, but chances are you'll learn to accept it. Scott still knows how to evoke a sense of fear and dread between the background noise and the impending danger. Everything is very eerie in general. If you don't figure out the backstory, you'll have it spoiled to you. It's by far the most uncomfortable part of the game. Like Undertale, let the experience be your own and have fun with it. And if you can handle it, the fanbase really can be fun. Just try to find the fans that are fair."

When I turned 18, I was short on money so I got the latest newspaper and checked out it's jobs for hire section. My eyes became wide and pants tightened when I saw there was an opening as a night watch guard at Freddy Fazbears Pizza. I ran to the phone, called the number listed and after a quick interview, I got the job. I still had Freddy figurines, posters and pins laid out in my attic, enclosed in a secret room where I built my Freddy Fazbear Shrine. My prized lifesize Freddy doll laid there as well, who I would whisper to occasionally and caress gently until I fell asleep. After all these nights of praying to Freddy, he answered me. I must not dissapoint him. I began by ordering pizza. When it arrived I let it cool and rubbed the slices, slowly, all over my naked body, being very careful not to miss covering Freddy's favorite spots. The scent of pizza pleases him. I was ready and left my house. When I got there, it was clear the doors were left open for me. At 11:59 I entered the office. Then clock had struck 12:00 AM. I was ready for Freddy. As I began to undress I heard noises coming from the Dining hall. After removing the last of my undergarments, I checked the cameras and saw that the bunny and chicken had smelt my cheese and tomatoe sauce covered body first. ""NO"" I said, ""THIS IS FOR FRED"". I checked the band stage and realized Freddy was not there, He heard. I glanced at the cameras again. Bonnie was coming down the left hall and the Chica was in the kitchen. Suddenly the cameras to my right went down. Freddy was here. Just as I was going to go out for him, all the lights shut off. This was perfect. He knew how to set the mood.... he knew how...I liked it. Frantically, I dropped to the floor, got on my knees and bent over. I cried out ""THIS FOR YOU FREDDY"". I saw his face, his LED eyes shined between my thighs and the Freddy Fazbear theme began playing out of his speakers. Tears of joy began streaming down my cheeks. His pizza dispensing pipe began extending out from his pelvis. One thrust and he began filling me with his delicious pizza love.

What I found was, quite evidently, a labour of love by creator Scott Cawthon.Aside from the kudos toward him for creating the game by his lonesome, it's evident that he's taken much effort to make the game as 'low-fi' as possible. The engine, Multimedia Fusion has been largely untouched since the mid-90s; upon ripping apart the game's files, you'll find all the graphics in the game are encoded in the original CompuServ GIF format - aptly debuting in 1987 (coinciding with the game's entirely ambiguous 'Bite of '87' of which you are informed of the first night); the sound is encoded in earlier versions of FruityLoops (even so far as to be from FLS1.1 - which has been largely unavailable outside of DOS discs from 1997), and even the infamous 'SCREEEE' sound when the animatronics pounce on you is, as far as I am aware, pulled from a public service announcement from the late-80s regarding child safety in the kitchen. Beyond the technical achievements (or rather, deliberate /under/achievements) of the game, the story is told outside of typical explained means, allowing the user to rely on breadcrumbs, theory and superstition - even going so far as to backmask portions of Paramahansa Yogananda's 'Autobiography of a Yogi' into the game's garbled ambience.Cawthon's done as much as possible to set the game's mood, and while its threats reside nigh-entirely in recyclable (and eventually predictable) jumpscares, the atmosphere, sense of isolation, memorable characters, and easily-grasped,  simple mechanics serve a purpose to make this a refreshing and, in a way, quite charming survival-horror game - of which I'm glad to hear will be sequelised.At £4, you could do far, far worse."

A killer killed 5 kids and put them inside the animatronics and the souls of the kids posses the the animatronics, but nobody knows.2. The gameplayYou can't move which adds to the feeling of helplessness.Cons:1. The gameplayI know it makes you feel helpless in the pros, but the gameplay is quite bland, because all you are really doing is looking at cameras and closing door occasionally.2. The jumpscaresAt first the jumpscares are scary, because you don't expect it. That's what a jumpscare is. After a while it just gets annoying, because they are stopping you from progressing further into the game.To be honest, get this game if you want to. It's really up to opinion."

,Recommended,319510,11790869,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,[TPZ] Cereal Killer,"About The Game:Five Nights at Freddy's is a Twitch/Thriller adventure centered around Mike Schmidt, a faceless job seeker who just happened to find the perfect job with decent hours and as a bonus you earn below minimum wage! (You know the kind of job everyone is looking for!)Reguardless of the strange choice in job you chose, the game spans out as a very simple and very easily playable & basic designed game.What you believed to be really simple & easy work turns into one of the most horrific & difficult but 100% worth it times of your life.The Story:The story is really simple & i basically explained it above, you're a job seeker who found an ad in the paper about a really easy job being a security guard at Freddy's Fun Farm doing the late shift of a night that's a Monday - Friday.The Gameplay:You're to spend 6 hours a night in your little office doing the night shift at Freddy's Fun Farm as a Security Guard, the premise of the game is very simple, make sure that nobody intrudes into Freddy's during the night while trying to avoid the strange & earily creepy Freddy & his robotic friends as they roam the building during the night.Not everything is as peachy and friendly of a night time though as you'll soon find out because you're running on a timer during the night as power is scarce & you need to save the power as much as you can so that you can keep an eye on Freddy & his friends as they happen to be quite afraid of new people & tend to... well kill people who aren't familiar to them.Each night becomes increasingly difficult & not only that but it seems to take longer to complete each night, of course if that's not bad enough then you'll find comfort in the fact that Freddy & his friends become more and more active through the week & require a lot more thorough checking in order to avoid winding up like so many other Secutiry Guards before you.This game really relies on you to be 100% alert at all times & not only is hard to do that because you're constantly switching between camera's & checking outside your office doors but Freddy & his friends tend to just randomly screw with you on certain playthroughs by disabling the power to your doors or by disconnecting your cameras, not only do they do that but sometimes they completely obscure the camera vision with their evil smiles or to make things worse sneek into your office & while you're busy watching the camera's feel the need to scare the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you!Worst of all is when you're almost finished & you run out of power only to see Freddy's wonderful smile & hear his jolly music as he stares at you from the door way, at this point you're either very lucky as time ticks over or you're left in the dark awaiting Freddy's embrace as he rips the flesh from your bones.The Verdict:There are SOOO many good things i can say about this game but i don't have enough characters to type all of these things, and very few faults i can pick at with this game.Although this game is designed solid & it's scares are not those small little ""Oh i saw that coming but it still scared me"" scares they're truly terrifying when they happen because you never really know when you're going to get caught by Freddy or his friends & whenever you do it's generally off guard they catch you.The AI in this game although very simple is Flawless an it always manages to be challenging even if it's so simple & due to the randomization of the gameplay you never experience the same thing over and over.Sometimes the game can feel unfair when you're almost finished and run out of power, or when Freddy & his friends turn off the power to your doors so you can't close them, or even when Foxy just spawns outside of his cave and runs at you right in the beginning, but it never feels 100% cheap it is just the game really screwing with you and tormenting you, wanting you to continue but at the same time showing that you'll never be guarenteed a win even if you're so close.The setting in this game although simple is designed perfect to be creppy even if it is a few different static backgrounds quickly slapped together, it's a flawless attempt at making a horror experience and it works 100% without a doubt.I give this game a 10/10.And i give it this because there's really no flaws in it, it's just designed perfect in every way, The game is meant to be difficult & it achieves that by occasionally putting you in situations of intense thrills & other times you breeze through without even seeing Freddy or his friendsEven though the game is very much the same each time it makes the experience different each playthough so it gives it replay value & then there's the thrill of beating the levels and knowing that you've overcome the odds and made it through to the next day!Do I Recommend This Game?:Yes i do recommend this and i suggest that people buy this game because it's so damn cheap and a well worthy experience.

Although it appears quite simple and even a little silly on the surface, what with Chuck E. Cheese mascots running amok, the actual game itself is very tightly made and exceptionally scary. I rate this above Amnesia and possibly even Silent Hill 2 for just how god awful it makes you feel.Your sense of paranoia escalates to levels I didn't even think possible. Your anxiety reaches new depths and the death scenes, even when you know they're coming after you suddenly remembered that you forgot to check the camera just outside your office, are bone chilling and are a rare example of a jump-scare that actually works and doesn't feel cheap!Once you look past the surface and notice all the tiny little nuances, all the little minute sounds the characters make and even figuring out the hidden lore behind everything, you realise just how much depth this game has, and it makes it just that little bit more unsettling.Of course, this game wont be for everyone, but if you're the kind of person who likes horror games that tap into your sense of paranoia with a nice spoonful of dread for good measure, and you appreciate subtlety rather than all guns blazing (ala Dead Space) then Five Nights at Freddy's will push your buttons in such a way that you'll never want them pushed again for fear of heart failure.Highly recommended.

I'll admit it's scary the first time you play it because you don't know when the jumpscares are coming and if they're scary, but then after the first couple of them you realize it's just the noise that makes you jump and the actual jumpscares aren't scary, it turns into a strategy game. You can see if a jumpscare is coming if""it's me"" flashes on the security tablet thingy or if the power is off and if you see eyes flashing and hear music. After the first two or three levels it starts to become boring (play in bursts?). There was something I liked about the vague ending though.In conclusion, it's not bad, but not good either. It isn't really that scary to me, more adrenaline-rushing when I need to close the door fast (which needs power to close?!), so if you like strategy games with horror elements or something, then this is the game for you.and for the love ofgod...

Cheese or your terrifying moments of youth at Showbiz Pizza Place well....terrifying, then Five Nights at Freddy's just might be up your alley.Initially I wrote the game off seeing the banner on a web search because it sounded like some kind of sleepover mystery puzzle solving game with cartoon animals - oh boy was I wrong!  A family friend's son introduced it to me after seeing that my old Atari games looked like a particular element of the sequel (I collect Atari 2600 games, that should tell you how old I am).So lo and behold I got introduced to a NEW game franchise finally, and the nice part is I could actually sink my teeth into it because it did not require hours upon hours of learning how to play the darned thing, and I could play it in short spurts.The genius behind Five Nights at Freddy's is that it's a very simple game that's easy to learn, but tough to master.  On one hand, it's pretty obvious after the night 1 phone call what can be done to defend yourself, what is not obvious though is how to properly impliment the resources given to a particular strategy to survive six in game hours a night while the Animatronics hunt you down for whatever reason it is they hunt you down for.  This sort of gameplay element to me feels like it's a lost art in today's mainstream game landscape.  This is a HUGE reason this game got so popular.The atmosphere of the game is perfectly punctuated by the graphics and sound.  It really does feel like one is sitting in a delapidated old Childrens Entertainment Pizzaria that's been around since the early 80's without a remodel (or apparently a Janitor, seems Bonnie sees the cleaners more than the cleaner guys do).  All of the animatronics carry that friendly yet somehow undertow sinister tone to them.  Fans whir, the sound of aging electrical devices buzz and fizzle, the animatronics themselves though kind of sound more like some guy in black coming to take you away than some kind of creepy cartoon robot seeking to stuff you into a suit.What's also nice is how the violence is implied, but not overdone, keeping the series appealing to a broader audience than usual - meaning I don't have to put a password on this when my family comes around, nor do I feel really strange for playing a game full of cartoon animals.  Another nice plus is this early in the series, the lore is not the primary focus of the game, the gameplay is, so you can dive as deep into the lore as you want (or as little as you want), and still enjoy the game regardless.An impressive bit to think though how this game generated so much attention and eventually grew to have multiple sequels, a freebie RPG spinoff (FNaF World), and now quite a lot of merch (Freddy and co were stalking me through the stores all through X-mas 2016).  And it was all done by one guy - a Christian game dev and animator working at a humble chain store at the time.  It really does show you don't need a 1000 person team and a million dollar budget to make a good game, and as a retro-gamer I'm rather tough on that part of things.  I like seeing my games in my collection as ""art"" rather than as some kind of major marketing effort.Overall, I highly reccommend this title.  While it's not some bloody gorefest like some horror games, it has that magic to it that an old Disney or Looney Tunes cartoon has - a little something for everybody, without veering too far in one direction or the other."

If you can get past the increasingly cancerous fanbase and look at this game as a horror game, then you SHOULD be able to tell it's different for the genre.The core objective of this game is to survive the onslaught of Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. While the base game includes numerous jumpscares, the atmosphere is what truely gets me. The paranoia of just knowing that Foxy could charge your door at any given moment, or that Freddy may be lurking just around the corner. Just that instinctive feeling of knowing that you could be killed at any given moment by the animatronics somewhat petrifies me. The only thing saving you is your own wits and a door.I would 100% recommend this game to somebody who wants something different in a horror game. Great concept, decent execution.9/10."

Sometimes. But they're more than that. They're fun. They don't take themselves too seriously. Or they take themselves too seriously, to the point where no one else can take them seriously. That's kinda where this game falls, between those.It's easy to see that this game is low-budget. It was developed by one man, and he's not a billionaire. This ain't Bill Gates. He's off in Africa somewhere carrying small African children on his back like a spider, trying to find the fountain of youth and wrestle lions that keep attacking his villages. This game came up from the streets. It's not a very pretty game. The art style works. But it's just not done very well. It's definitely dark, and atmospheric, and gets you in the mood to yiff♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with murderous robots. It gets the job done. But you can see visible warping in the environment as you move around. And you can't really move much in the game anyway, you're stuck in a room defending yourself from furries, so it's not like they had a lot of environments to design. The least they could've done was make the one room you're stuck in look nicer.At the same time, the art style seems to help make the game. Something about the entire game's slightly off appearance makes it creepier. It invokes the uncanny valley feel, and in a way seems fitting when you consider it's a game about animatronics. Which are creepy as ♥♥♥♥ to stare at. Their lifeless, mechanically blinking eyes.... Its mouth, hinging and unhinging unnaturally, as it sings you Happy Birthday in a southern American accent... It's vile. Disgusts me in a deep, spiritual way. It's just wrong. Animatronics are just a crime against the greater good. Yes, this game is very personal to me. I stopped going to Chuck E Cheese a long time ago. We don't talk about it anymore.The atmosphere and feel are done very well, as low-budget as the game may be. The core mechanics tie directly into the tense feel of the game. Or rather, mechanic, as there's only really one game mechanic. All you can really do in the game is check cameras, open lights, and close doors. You're a security guard locked in a room. You check your cameras to make sure you know where your horny robot friends are. If they're not where you can see them, you open your lights. If you don't♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, turn off the lights. If you do, make sure you close the door or else you're dead. That's the game in a nutshell. Incredibly simple, yes. It's not a complex game. But there's beauty in subtlety and minimalist design. The fact that you have very little control over what's happening builds the tension. You're helpless in the truest of senses. All you can do to stop death is check to make sure it's not there, and if it is, close the door. And not only that, your defense is crippled even further by your limited resources. Everything you do will consume electricity. And should you run out, you suddenly can't do things anymore. Which leaves you at the mercy of the robots.It's an incredibly tense game. It's paranoia-inducing, and drives home a sense of terror. And yes, when the monster gets you, he pops out and goes ""Boo"" like monsters do. Five Nights at Freddy's thrives on the jump-scare. Is that a bad thing? Yes and no. They definitely do rely on it. But jump-scares are a staple of horror. Everyone uses them. Do they use it a little too much? Yes. The game can be summed up with ""I looked in the spot. The monster was in the spot. Nope. I'm not looking in that spot ever again. Let's just turn this game off and go take a long shower. Forever.""The jump-scares are done decently. They're adequate pay-off, but the tension is the best part. The stress, fear, and paranoia are the things that make this game great. Not the jump-scares. They're scary, yeah. But they definitely do bring with a little baggage. As the nights go on, you'll find yourself being assaulted more often. The patterns that the animatronics follow will get mixed up, and they'll be more active. A lot more tense when suddenly they're not where you expect them to be and actually right there in the room with you. But at the same time, dying much more often for the sake of difficulty can also be frustrating.A good jump-scare is like taking it up the butt. You can't rush it. You need lube, you need to go slow, and you need to be in the mood. No matter how ready you think you are, it's gonna surprise you when suddenly there's something in your butt that shouldn't be there. When done right, it's an enjoyable experience for everyone. But when suddenly it's happening too often, too fast, and when you're not in the mood, you're not gonna be happy. You're just gonna have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up your butt and be very upset about it. That's how Five Nights at Freddy's starts to feel at the end. Not to mention the jump-scare is a little ridiculous. It sounds like a baby pterodactyl. Or maybe like you stuffed a box full of gerbils into a wood-chipper. But, as Five Nights at Freddy's sort of embodies the horror B-movie, I feel like how stupid it comes across as is really just part of the fun. No one is actually really terrified by the Killer Klowns from Outer Space. It's all part of the fun. The people tearing this game up about how ""dis game is so bad, i showed babby and didnt even cry, 0/10 not scary, anoyone that older than 2 year old do not buy"" miss the point.If you can't appreciate the nature of a bad horror movie, this might not be for you. It's not a perfect game. It's clearly low-budget and gets by on cheap thrills. But to neglect the clever mechanics that promote paranoia and fear in unique ways because people enjoy it is stupid.It's like watching amine. You don't tell normal people that you enjoy it. It's just a secret that you talk to your loser internet friends about. You can wear your Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt in the safety of your own home. In your closet, when your parents aren't home, while you jack off to furry porn.I won't tell anyone you do it. It's okay."

This is a game you either like or dislike, that is obvious.I am not a horror fan, I hate being jumpscared, I have actually played very little of any of the games in this extremely popular series. Yet I am a big fan of the series because like most fans like me, appreciate the lore of the games and how far the games have come.I mean this is a series created by a single near unknown developer and within 1 1/2 years has become so popular that there is now: 4 games, a spin-off title, a novel and a movie in the works. Along with billions of views on Youtube, a line of Merchandise and about a thousand knockoff titles.This is exactly what happened with Minecraft! And that gets roughly the same about of criticism thrown at it.I agree that the fanbase is..... bad. But there is a large amount of it that are brilliant like the Theorists, Song writers, Youtubers, animators and artists.I know that i am going to get a lot of s*** from this review. But I dont really care, all I ask is for people to show a little respect for the little game that has changed not only the horror genre but gaming and gamers as a whole.OK with that clarified, Im going to start the review.It's doesnt have the best graphics nor the best gameplay. But it is the story that keeps some players coming back for more.It does have that initial scare factor, but it will wear off after an hour or 2 once you have learned the patterns. But it is a refreshing take on the traditional horror game, rather than a walking down a dark hall simulator, you are unable to move and the tension comes from know that something is coming but you don't know when and what is coming.Horror fans will as i said either love it or hate it.It is a good game, it's innovative, but it wont appeal to everyone. That is just how the industry works...EDIT: Best make that 5 Games now.....  Good luck MatPatEDIT EDIT: A second novel. Clearly FNAF isnt quite dead yet."

I thought: Surely this game isn’t that scary. So I bought the first game.I click new game and was greeted with the following message from phone guy.“Hello? Heeeelloooo! Uhhh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Umm., I actually worked in that office before you. I’m...finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact so...I know it can be a little overwhelming, but i’m here to tell you: there’s nothing to worry about, uhh, you’ll do fine! So...let’s just focus on getting you through your first week. Ok?”I thought oh how nice. At least this guy’s friendly.“uh...let’s see. First there’s an introductory greeting from the company i’m supposed to read. Eeh it’s kind of a legal thing, you know. ‘Welcome to Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza: a magical place where kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazzbear entertainment is not responsible for damage, property or person. Upon the discovery of the damage or death of the third, a missing person’s report will be filled within ninety days or as soon as property and premise have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached and the carpets have been replaced. Blah, blah, blah.”At this point it started to get ominous. I thought: “What do you MEAN death?!”“Now that might seem bad, I know, there’s really nothing to worry about. Uhh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No! If I were force to sing...those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So remember: these characters hold a special place in the heart of children. You need to show them a little respect. Right? Ok.”It was at this point I fell in love with the animatronics and I even felt bad for them.“So just be aware: the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uhh, they’re left with some kind of ‘free-roaming mode’ at night. Uhhh...something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uhh...they used to wander during the day too, but then there was the bite of eighty seven. Yeah...i-it’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, ya know?”At this point I got the chills. I froze with fear.“Now concerning you’re safety: the only real risk to you as the night watchmen here, if any, is the fact that these characters...uhh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won’t recognize you as a person. They’ll-they’ll most likely see you as a metal endo-skeleton without its costume on.”This calmed me down a bit. I thought “Oh well that doesn’t sound too bad.”“Now, since that’s against the rules at Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza, they’ll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazzbear suit. Umm, now that wouldn’t be so bad if the suits themselves weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area, so you can imagine how having your head forced inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uhh...the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth would pop out the front of the mask. ...Yeah they don’t tell you these things when you sign up...”And with this the fear was back. “WHAT?!” I screamed.“But hey! First day should be a breeze, I’ll chat with you tomorrow, uhh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright. Goodnight.”And with this the gameplay started. One of the first things I noticed was that I can’t move. That was truly terrifying. At least in other horror games you can run away from the things trying to kill you.I checked the cameras as I was supposed to. Everything was fine until 3 am. That’s when it really got ominous. One was missing. So the guy wasn’t crazy after all. I wasn’t really paying attention to him, though I did listen so I was lost.I figured it out but at four a.m. I experienced my first jumpscare: Bonnie.He was the first one to kill me and because of that I fell in love with him.My second jumpscare was Freddy. Freddy was just meh for me. He was just a big teddy bear for me.Next was Foxy. Oh man Foxy. I froze when I heard him bag on the door, and when he screamed bloody murder at me, I jumped back what felt like teen feet.I never did get Chica or Golden Freddy though."

Don't buy this.Okay, before I rant on about this, let me say this: This review is in no way affected by the fandom, and I do not rate a game by it's fandom.First off, the gameplay. The controls feel awkward. This takes place in a first person perspective, right? In order to turn your head, you have to move the cursor to the different side of the screen. Which makes for poor sensitivity. Don't bring the controls of console FPS games to the PC, there's a good reason why console FPS games suck: There's a deadzone.Also, the buttons, for the lights, are very awkward. In order to leave a light on, I'd expect to hold it, but no. You have to use it like a toggle. Sometimes, I find myself wasting power by turning and forgetting to click to turn off the light.Oh, and the laptop, don't get me started on the laptop. In order to pull it out, you have to hover the mouse over it. Sometimes, if I move over to the other door to check, I accidentally pull the laptop out, then I ""die"".The graphics look awful. Why is it that it looks like the background is just a wallpaper wrapping the inside of a tube. It looks distorted and disorienting. Also, even though the game plays in 1080p on my monitor, it looks like 480p.One of the worst things in here is the lack of settings or pause. If you can't see crap, then too bad, you're going to have to deal with the automatic gamma correction. Need to take a crap in the middle of a game? Pressing ESC will only shut the game down.Also, everyone says it's scary. I think the enemies look plain dumb. And if you happen to get screamed at by one of them, I don't get a heart attack, they just make me angry. It just plays the same old trope of something screaming at you from a poorly lit room. How original.I give it a 30%. It's terrible. Save your money and buy a better horror game, like System Shock 2, Doom 3, or I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Those games are actually scary, and if you surgically removed their spookiness, they would still be fun.By the way, I think the sequels are bullcrap too. They made so many of them in a short amount of time. Three games in seven months. And they all play similarly to each other. You know how people on the internet complain about Call of Duty having too many repetitive sequels released every year? Imagine if they done that for every 2.33 months. At least Call of Duty is somewhat fun compared to this garbage, by far I'd rather have CoD than FNAF. At least CoD has a redeeming factor for being a game: Gameplay. FNAF has neither of the two redeeming factors: Gameplay or story."

,Recommended,319510,12041931,"Posted: 10 September, 2014",all,Bonnielicious,"Hello, fleshling. You will love this game, or hate it. But that depends on your subjective and partial view of it. FN@F was developed by Scott Cawthon using Clickteam Fusion 2.5 as engine. The controls are fairly simple, you only use your Left Mouse Button and there are only 5 interactive objects (well, 6, but that last one is a small Easter Egg played for laughs). You can't move from your position, and instead only look on your left or on your right. The basic mechanics are fairly simple too: your goal is to survive from 12AM to 6AM each night, avoiding being caught by the suspiciously free-roaming Animatronics. Easy? Well, yes, the first night is easy; after that, the difficulty increases exponentially each night, introducing new enemies and improving their AI, even actively adapting to your survival tactics. And of course, it's not only a matter of using the correct control at the right time: it's a matter of using them with moderation. Yes, because all you do requires power, and your power supply is limited. Very limited. You don't want a blackout occurring on the job.This is Creepypasta material: NO SPOILERS, but the story is NOT a long one, but hell, when you realize it, good luck sleeping. It may require some maturity and sometimes patience to understand it. Some theories are still open.One last thing: the game is priced 4.99$. If you think it's too much, you must be in a desperate situation and you have all my sympathy. So, for your information, there actually is a DEMO on Moddb. And it's Free.However, considering you have internet for reading this, supposedly a home and PC, electricity, water and I hope for you food, then 4.99$ shouldn't be too much for you."

76561198155097558,Recommended,319510,25100499,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,Wyatt,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click, horror survival game created by Scott Cawthon. The game centers on a fictional pizza restaurant called ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"", where the player must act as a night security guard, defending themselves from the malfunctioning animatronic characters by tracking their movement through the facility using security cameras.The player must survive their shift, lasting from midnight to 6:00 a.m. without being attacked by one of the animatronics roaming the facility. The player, who sits in an office and is unable to move, is given access to a network of security cameras throughout the facility to track the movement of the animatronics. Four of the five characters have distinct movement patterns while the fifth, ""Golden Freddy"", only appears when certain actions are taken, however, most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics.Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out, leaving the player with no defense against an attack.FNAF is actually a fantastic game. Even if the animatronics aren’t scary, the lore behind the series is the most talked about, most researched, and perhaps the biggest lore of any game ever. Heck, it’s the only thing that keeps Game Theory running! (No offence to MatPat. You are one my favorite Youtubers)If you have never played FNAF, you really should. Even if you don’t enjoy the games, the lore behind the whole thing, is something worth checking out. 10/10Three sequels have been released:Five Nights at Freddy's 2Five Nights at Freddy's 3Five Nights at Freddy's 4 and soon,Five Nights at Freddy’s 5 : Sister Location"

,Recommended,319510,30571810,Posted: 17 March,all,Lucas,"Five Nights at Freddy's is the hit new Indie jumpscare simulator game developed by Wisdom Tree for the Sega CD using click and play. In this game, you take control of some loser whose only job he can even get is being security guard at a children's baby play place. Now because this is a spooky Halloween scary game, it's got all the things you expect to make you wet your diaper if you're a big little baby idiot.It's got all the creepy music, and sometimes you see someone looking at you over there, and... Oh look out suddenly he jumped out in front of your face you weren't even gonna think you would've saw that right then! But you did, and now you're probably scared.What really ties together Freaky Friday is its innovative revolutionary gameplay system. It really maximizes the horror that  those blender Chuck-E-Cheese mascots have to offer.To play Five Freddy's, you click cameras and sometimes maybe close a door. You do this for convenient 10 minute bursts, designed with the big name Let's-Players in mind. Now some of you might be asking ""But ROCKCOCK64, is that all there is to Five Nights at Freddy's?"" And to you I would say... Yes. Yeah, that's it.Now it may sound really easy, but there's actually a lot of depth and strategy behind the gameplay. Sometimes you have to close both of the doors!Graphically, this game is perfect. Now, while in most other games, this look, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ugly, pre-rendered garbage wouldn't really work. This game however is a horror game, so you get to be totally creeped out by the one pre-rendered room you're stuck in that has this weird pixelated cylinder filter applied to it. You get to be totally creeped out by that and then pay like, a dollar or two on the app store to put a little plushie on your desk.The scares are also REALLY effective. Especially when you run out of power or one of your doors is broken, so you already know the loud scream scary spook is coming. Jumpscares work best when I know about them ahead of time. Then I get to plan out my funny facecam reaction. Some people say that jumpscares are a cheap and effortless tactic to try and instill horror. And that's just insulting and dismissive of how brilliant of a game Five Night Freddy is. Cheap and effortless are the LAST two words I'd use to describe this game.Would a cheap and effortless game have a sequel almost entirely finished two months after the original release? No!Would a cheap and effortless game take advantage of free ad space on gross websites to extend its audience? No!Would a cheap and effortless game try to milk microtransactions off of cheats and cosmetics through a mobile version that was hastily slapped together? No.Overall gamers, Weekend at Bernie's has earned its spot as one of the most legendary horror games ever. A game about being scared as the guy dressed as Chuck-E-Cheese giving you a pizza belongs in the same league as a game about the scariest thing the Internet could think of: A very tall, well-dressed, white man.Any dumb idiot can play it, and it makes a loud scary noise here and there, what more could you even ask for?FINAL SCORE:3/10 GAMEPLAYS2/10 GRAPHICS2/10 SOUNDS10/10 HARDCORES4.25/10 OVERALLS (BEST SCARY GAME OF ALL TIME!!)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fYR9G6K3NQ"

The ebbs and flow of the game work in direct synergy with the gameplay, which while it is limited in scope, the extra resource management coupled with it's frantic pacing ensure you won't have much time to think about it. The surreal scenario only enhances the game further, as the unfamiliarity and constant looming uncertainty drive home the point that YOU do not belong here, YOU are the trespasser in this territory.Somewhere down the line we'll all look back at this and laugh about the whole thing, but for now it is the high-water mark for the ""BOO!

Combine with lore that would make the Human Centipede frightened, and you have a recipe for success.For those of you who don't know, Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click horror game that takes place in a Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant, where animatronics are the main attraction. The four main animatronics (Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy) were allowed to walk around freely during the day, until an incident known as ""The Bite of '87"" took place, in which a customer lost his/her frontal lobe, due to a bite by one of the animatronics. After that, the animatronics were restricted to being able to walk around at night. You, as the night security guard, must watch the animatronics using a camera system, closing your doors when they get too close. If they find you, they will assume that you are an endoskeleton without a suit on, and will try to stuff you in a suit, killing you in the process. The difficulty of the game is that you have limited power, and anything you do (turning on lights, checking cameras, closing doors) will use up some of that power. If you run out of power, Freddy will come out and kill you.I would also like to point out the game's difficulty (for me, at least) as I have never made it past the 4th night. This might be because of my tendency to shut off my computer whenever an animatronic is at my door.So that's it. If you couldn't tell already, I strongly reccomend this game to anyone, horror fanitics or casual gamers. The lore of the series alone is enough to keep me intrigued for a long time. Make sure to watch the Game Theorist videos, becaue they are amazing(Also, it says I only played 1.2 hours, but I usually play this game when I don't have internet. It should be about 4-5 hours.)"

With its new widened audience came the FNAF fanbase. I know I shouldn't judge a game based on the fanbase alone but I can't seem to get past the screaming 13 year old fanboys every time I get ""jumpscared"" by Bonnie. Speaking of which- the jumpscares in this game are wildly overused and pretty cheap. After a few of said jumpscares, there comes a point where you just stop and say, ""Alright... Is this it?... Is this all I have to expect from this game?"" And it truly is. Other than the survival aspect of this game (Which mainly consists of waiting to push a couple buttons) that's pretty much it.

That's fine. What makes something ""scary"" is subjective, after all. Even if you don't have a fear of animatronics or don't react much to jumpscares, the one thing that I think we can agree on is this: The tension in this game is very high.Managing only one resource--power--seems simple enough but the room for error dwindles as the difficulty increases each night. Even if you know each character's behavior and how to monitor them, the speed with which you have to address them ramps up and you're bound to make more mistakes. Meanwhile, the atmosphere is doing its best to unnerve you to a higher degree as you progress. The noises in the game aren't so bad on their own but the last thing you would ever want to hear while checking the cameras is footsteps in the hall or Freddy's laughter, regardless whether or not they indicate an actual threat.Throw in some hallucinations and Foxy channelling Usain Bolt and you're almost done with Night 3."

It's not scary, truthfully, but the suspense keeps you on edge. You expect it yet you don't expect it. It's not a bad game at all.-Would I recommend this game? Naturally, given the jumpscares, no. But with how the game is designed, both in mechanics and visuals, I'd say yes. The game is comprised of a series of GIFS, not animated models like what we're used to today, this is more akin to older games. Very well done for that fact alone.-I sound like a broken record, but it does a good job of keeping you on edge, trying to determine which of the animatronics will pop up and from where. Bonnie and Chica, of course are fixed on sides, Foxy can come from either side and Freddy pops up when least expected under some occasions.-Even for each night lasting nine minutes, the suspense makes it feel so much longer.And the atmosphere adds to this. Eery.My recommendation for the game, personally, is to add more background compared to the skimpy details observed on the walls. Storyline based details. News stories clipped to a bulletin board only take us so far.Hopefully there will be an expanded sequel."

This ment I could pass Night 2-7 (4/20 mode) on my first try aslong as you follow a routine each night. A good thing to know before you play is that F2 resets the game but ESC quits the game.On the overhand I don't recommend this game to anyone with a faint heart or is elderly as you will expect lots of jumpscares.

The game's main scares come from freddy and pals jump scaring you, and not knowing if they are getting close to jump scaring you.  The idea that you are stationary and (mostly) defenseless makes for an interesting game, and it does a good job holding up until you are done with it.

I liked looking at that stuff. I even binge-watched Smike's videos.It wasn't until this year that I actually bought all five games and realized what I missed. And though I enjoyed Five Nights at Freddy's, I can't disagree with what people are saying this game needed:Being able to move around(sorry...)Less jumpscaresMore horrorA fanbase with less autistic children and furriesI've also noticed some flaws with Scott Cawthon's perception of old pizzeria animatronics that make design holes in the game:In the game, the animatronics can walk around and need to keep walking or else their servos would lock up, but real life pizzeria animatronics couldn't walk around at all due to being bolted to the floor...In the game, the animatronics appear to be made entirely of metal, but real life pizzeria animatronics had fabric coverings and rubber masksIn the game, you take the ""night shift"", but I'm not sure if animatronic-based pizzerias ever actuallyhadyou stay there to take care of the joint from 12am to 6amOverall, I do like this game. I do find it scary, mostly because of the uncanny presence of the animatronics and the creepy sounds coming from the cameras.

It felt unique and its storyline was absolutely fantastic. But now I only see a horrible monstrosity which has been milked empty. First and maybe second FNaFs were made with love and passion, but the last ones were... crap. Syrupy fanservice to milk some money. And yes, nowadays I dislike the franchise as a whole, but there IS reasons why I don't like this first game in particular.I'm positive that almost all of the fanbase is there because of the storyline. I'm not saying the fanbase is horrible and it certainly isn't afflecting my opinion in any way. Anyway, the game itself is dull and short, almost not worth its price at all. I admit, I only liked this game for its story. I was amazed how dull it was in reality because in all the videos it looked awesome.And that's the main reason I pressed the red thumb under this box. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE WATCHED ANY WALKTROUGHS, IT'S NOT WORTH IT! At first the idea of anomatronics was interesting and in fact scary, but after three games and so much hype they became no scarierer than basic teddy bears. Jumpscares were scary, but now when you can expect them, they are not scary at all. Believe me, watching videos about this game is much more entertaining than playing it.Few GOOD things about gameplay features:+ Unique and interesting systems.+ It really can feel frightening+ Cameras are an excellent idea.And then there's these not so good things.- Short. Not worth it.- So overhyped.- Franchise has been milked dry.- No replay value at all.If you are one of those very few who found this game only recently and you've not yet watched anything about this, this game is ok. I don't like its gameplay, it's something that Greenlight usually gives birth to, nothing less, nothing more. It can feel frigtening when you play it for the first time, but after watching 100hrs video material about it and played it trough 100 times, it's not so interesting anymore.If you still like the storyline, nothing is in your way to theorize about it and attend discussion. This game can't give you any more information than let's plays do. In fact, it gives less. I strongly believe that this whole great story was born accidentally."

You have to survive 5 nights at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque place called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza'. What do you have to survive? Animatronics, yes, animatronics. The four main animatronics are Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who all have different attack patterns; different ways to get to YOU. Here are some things that Five Nights at Freddy's does well: Making the player feel challenged: Five Nights at Freddy's starts out very easy but then ramps up the difficulty, especially in the later nights. Making the player feel helpless: Now, it goes without saying that if you were stuck in a place with 4 killer robot furries, you'd feel pretty helpless. And sense you're in a tiny office just waiting for you to get stuffed into a suit, it amplifies it. Fear: Five Nights at Freddy's will obviously be scary, right? Yes, it is scary. If you fail to stay alive through a night, you will be killed by one of the robots in a... jumpscare... ""A cheap jumpscare? Really?"" you might ask. Yeah, the deaths are jumpscares, but it isn't the jumpscare that scares you, it's not knowing when it will happen. If the death is predictable, then it isn't as scary.As a final review for Five Nights at Freddy's, I give it a 9.9/10."
,Recommended,319510,13534287,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,Waffles©,"The question is should you buy Five Nights at Freddy’s?YesFive Nights at Freddy’s is a first-person horror game developed by Scott Cawthon.  The game revolves around you as a security guard and five animatronics who will attempt to get into your office.  The object of the game is, of course, to keep them from getting in using your video cameras and the doors.  There is a setback, you only have a limited amount of power and failure to limit your power usage wisely results in a jump scare.The gameplay is fairly simple and quickly gets repetitive.  You slide your mouse to the bottom of the screen to pull up your cameras.  From there you can select different rooms to view excluding the kitchen, whose camera is disabled for some reason.  Sliding the mouse down will exit out of the camera view and put you back into the office where you can open/close the doors and flicker the lights on either side of you.  While simple and repetitive, this gameplay choice surprisingly enhances the game as it gives the player a sense of hopelessness at they can’t move or try and hide from the animatronics.  The animatronics themselves are reminiscent of the Chuck E Cheese animatronics and have different attack patterns.  For example, Foxy requires you to view the camera in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥constantly or he will rush to your door resulting in a jump scare and a game over.The jump scares are affective in scaring the player, but the game as a whole is enough to fill anyone with dread.  Once the infamous phone guy hangs up you’re left in a startlingly silent environment for a few seconds before you begin to hear strange sounds.  Random laughs, pots and pans clattering, and strange whistling sounds can be heard and are enough to put anyone on the edge of their seats.  The atmosphere is brilliantly crafted, creating a desolate environment that fits the story it tells.The greatest thing about FNAF is its story.  While most horror games have no story or shove its story in your face, FNAF forces you to root around if you want to learn more.  At the beginning of the first four nights a man, lovingly referred to as Phone Guy, will leave you a voice message that both instructs you on how to play, and tells small tidbits of the restaurant itself.  After that, however, you are on your own for the rest.  Posters of news clippings will change telling you more about the lore of the place, but most else is left to the imagination.In the end, this game is worth the five bucks you shell out to buy it.  Not content to just be youtube bait, this game goes above and beyond what is considered to be a good horror game.  Simple gameplay, actually scary antagonists and environments, and a story that gets more interesting the more you dig into it.  The game is not perfect, the gameplay does get repetitive and the animatronics do loose some fear points as you get used to them.  However with the games that have been released to us as of late, it is refreshing to see a unique and enjoyable experience from a game that should not have delivered so much with so little.I also made a video review on Fnaf.  I say the same thing, but if you perfer a visual review then you can view it herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYxPSPJV3Ns&feature=youtu.be"

Stuck in one room with a laptop controlling the security camera, two doors, two lights, and a limited amount of power to ward off Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy, the animatronic characters that roam the place at night.    With errie ambiance, a creepy back story, the occasional possibility of a 'golden' 5th character, and jumpscares that haven't freaked me out since the days when Resident Evil was good, this game is a short but awesome delight for any horror game fan.You'll never listen to Les Toreadors in the same way again!...playing with headphones is a must....and in the dark....with only candlelight....and a window open....because that's how horror games are played."

It is fear in gaming distilled to its purest form; an experience that forces you to give it your full attention and focus while it strips you of any sense of balance or safety. It is unnerving and upsetting to its core.What truly makes this remarkable is how simple the game is. There is really only one action: Close the Door button only and always when you think you're about to be attacked. Close too early, and you waste power. Close too late, and you are doomed.All the rest is window dressing to this, but what is there is so perfectly executed. I must emphasize that what I say is praise. The simplicity is to its benefit, providing you with absolutely nothing to distract you from your feelings of foreboding, dread, and terror.This is, in many ways, the perfect horror game."

Its story gives great background information about the characters and various going-ons throughout the game, especially the ""phone guy,"" along with the newspaper article as well.  I love the sound effects in the background that makes one just feel the suspense and when something may or may not be closer or at either door on either side of the room you're placed in.  There's probably only one thing, whether it's an actual part of the game or not, which would be some of the mechanics; they're a bit glitchy, mainly the door lights on either side of you.  They tend to stay on for either a brief moment or for quite awhile after being clicked the second time in order to turn them off.  Despite this factor, the game is absolutely astonishing as well as pretty freakin' scary!  It definitely gave me the creeps during my first go-around, but 'cause I'm just ""too pro"" at my gaming hobby, I'm totally over it now... except when Foxy jumpscares me though.

I'm a huge fan of horror and have played just about every horror game, watched every horror movie (even the cheesy ones) and read every online ghost story and creepypasta there is so obviously, I'm a bit more harsh when judging a piece of horror. I can't necessarily say Five Nights at Freddy's is ""scary"" as much as it is tense. VERY similar to Slender in that the game relies on the tension caused by the feeling of paranoia and the feeling of being hunted to get into the player's mind. The problem though is that this game's tension is built more so out of the fact that you don't want one of the animals jumping up and screaming at you loudly, not so much that you actually feel in danger like you would in Slender or games similar. Because of that and the fact that while you don't know EXACTLY when the jump scare will occur but get a good idea of when it's coming (animal is close to your room in the camera feed, clicking sound when trying to turn on light, etc.) leaves this game feeling more like a digital version of a jack in the box rather than a real, horror experience. All that being said, I still very much enjoy this game and (especially considering the price) would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in it. A good piece of horror? No. A good experience? Yes."

While that is kinda true, it's also the thing that makes it horrifying. You see, there is just you and the animatronic dolls. Thats the horror of the game. You have nothing to do but to sit there and wait for the evil presence kills you. You're trapped.As with Amnesia this game is supposed to be played in a pitch black room with your headphones on. Unlike Amnesia this game has tonnes of jumpscares but no cheap ones. Since the entire game builds up for them so well. Infact there arent much else. But a well places jumpscare with a lot of build up can make or break a game. The atmophere is key to horror games and this game NAILS it.There have been 3 great horror games during the last 5 years. Amnesia, Outlast and Five Nights at Freddy's. All of wich are horror to their cores. All of wich put you up against horrible creatures and all of which you are helpless against. The feeling of not being able to fight back is so horrifying that it's not even funny but in this you have nothing else but to sit and wait.You dont have an objective to escape or take revenge, something to keep you from dreading the monsters chasing you. In this your objective is to survive. Not to run but just to last til morning. You cant run, you cant hide and you cant fight back. All you can do is wait for the clock to tick. Add the creepy setting, sounds and general feel to it and you sit there and just hope for the in game clock to have mercy on you so can make it to 6:AM.Oh and did i mention the amazing reason you place yourself in this position. 120 bucks.

They run around, knowing where you are to ""tag"" you, however you get several cameras to spot them and doors to close to make it harder for them. You have a time limit and power, of course, but the reason they do this is because after 6 am, they have to go to their original spots until 12 am. While you are working there, your buddy, Christopher, calls you and drops several hints, so you need to listen to him. Best part of all, you get free pizza, drinks, games, you meet famous characters, and, to top it all off, you get paid just for having fun with those characters.Overall, this is a great, fun, casual game that you can just come home to start it up and forget all about your worries.12/10"

This is the reason games like Dead Space or Doom 3 aren't very scary--as usually the jumps are predictable and are startling, not *horrifying.* This is because there is no atmosphere or pacing which are requirements for a true horror game.  It’s also impossible to be truly horrified if you’re carrying enough weaponry to turn the installation you’re inside into ash.So, why do I love FNAF, when it proudly boasts that it has tons of jump-scares?  It is because it also has the other ingredients for a true horror game:  Good atmosphere and sound engineering, a very scarce and crucial resource for survival, a feeling of helplessness and insignificance, and the fact that in addition to the many jump-scares, your imagination is what produces most of the feelings of dread and terror when playing this game.  This is what makes the game stand out as a true horror game like Silent Hill 2 or Amnesia, the game gives you the tools to interact with it, a plot with basic instructions,  and then sits back and lets you s*** your pants by yourself.  Buy it!  We need to encourage more innovation like this.Do NOT play if you have hypertension or heart trouble, or if you have a full bladder."

The one bad part I have encountered so far (after 3 nights in my first playthrough) is that it is not a hard game if you find the right strategy or strategies:(Both these things are explained in game [Nights 1 and 2] and there are no big spoilers from the rest of the recordings on these nights or any other nights)- You need to try and save 50% from 12-3 so you have the other half of battery life from 3-6, which isn't that hard if you know what to do and when to do it.  If you have a strategy that can help you do this, you'll make it to 6 AM usually, and therefore it won't really scare you as you know what to do and how to last the whole night.- If a character is not on one of the cameras they are most likely at a door so it really eliminates any scare tactic there, unless of course, you forget that part of the recording and don't realize that until after you see it.Overall it is a really good game, but it may benefit from having more rooms added without cameras (or ones that have blindspots where the animatronics can hide) so it eliminates the problem I have with the second point.  I'm not sure how it would be possible to fix or change the first issue I have, unless it actually does become very hard for nights 4 and 5, which I have yet to start.

,Recommended,319510,34545308,Posted: 27 August,all,CharlieBrownTV,I recently just got this game to play with my 4 year old son. He has been loving playing any type of horror game lately and we have been testing different games!  The most recent we have played is Hello Neighbor and Bendy and the Ink Machine.Gameplay: 6Combat is easy and intuitive to learn even for my son's age group. You just click the cameras around and keep track of the various animatronics trying to dismember you.  The basics are easy enough for him to understand while keeping it challenging for me.Controls: 10Everything works great here.Story: 9I love the story of being a security guard stuck at a restaurant with possesed pizza animatronics!  It is child friendly enough to play with my son while still making for intense jumpscare moments reminding me why I should always be afraid of Chuck E Cheese.Graphics: 7The art is beautiful in this game and the animations all work nicely. The only downside is the there is no option to adjust any of the settings that I was able to find!Overall: 8Reccomend this game to anybody looking for a short fun experience filled with jumpscares!  It is a very basic game but was very fun to play and record with my son for our channel.Gameplay video of our splitscreen adventures:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsKCHh6NEFs

Headphones are definitley recommended for this game."
76561198015769128,Recommended,319510,14379834,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,qaza04,"If there's one thing to congratulate Five Nights at Freddy's for it's that it succeeds at being intense and oppressive even without the horror elements. The game could easily be about combatting viruses as opposed to the game's animatronics and it would still be as intimidating to play thanks to the management of power.Much as the game loves to tell you otherwise, it's actually not a jump scare showcase. In reality, FNaF is about preventing the most sharp and uneasing jump scares through your effective management of power through the use of doors, your camera and the lights which reveals nearby animatronics. The other jump scares barely warrant as ""scares"" as they're basically just warnings to make you do the equivalent of a quick time event but in a very organic way that requires you to actually think. I welcomed it greatly, as the actual jump scares are not worth the build up the game gives you (though thus far, I've only died once by animatronic, all the rest have been power outtages). The game relies on you to be able to track the activity of the animatronics which greatly contributes to the fear factor.However, tracking the activity of the animatronics essentially makes the game very much based on trial and error and the animitronics lose much of their creepiness factor once you learn how they operate. The sole animatronic to induce fear to me was Bonnie the Bunny, and it wasn't on account of his appearence (he comes off as silly in many of the camera shots), it's because he quite literally teleports to whatever room his can move into. It makes it near impossible to guess when he will show up outside the Office. Chica and Freddy have specific routes, and you manage how Foxy and Golden Freddy operate. Incidentally, Golden Freddy is a pathetic jump scare which is just unfair to new players. Lift your camera up when he shows up and you'll be fine.Leaving that aside, though, the game does a spectacular job at creating an atmosphere as well as providing gameplay that encourages constant retries. Each night only lasts between ten to fifteen minutes in real time (assuming you don't die), which speaks very well for the game given that it can very quickly establish itself. Even if marred by Bonnie the Bunny and Golden Freddy, the animatronics all have personality and do well to work with the already intense power saving gameplay. It's worth playing simply to say that you've spent a night at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza."

But what you know of it from the countless YouTube videos of people screaming, breaking down the lore, etc. is very different from experiencing it yourself.I feel as if some people have somewhat of a bad assumption of the FNAF games solely based on all of the reception the series has recieved over the past year. But coming from someone who's experienced all of the games first-hand, I can truly recommend them to anyone who likes the horror genre.As you know, you play the role of a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Restaurant and you're tasked with monitoring security cameras to make sure the four animatronics don't goof off. The gameplay consists of closing your office doors, monitoring the camera, and using your door lights all while making sure you don't run out of power by the time 6AM rolls around.The scariness factor in this game spawns from the inability to move or see certain spots. It's the fear of the unknown. You never truly know where the animatronics are at all times. They could be hidden in a blind spot outside your office, or possibly waiting to jump out at you from inside your office!Even if the horror gameplay doesn't appeal to you, the game packs some pretty interesting lore that even hardcore theorists can appreciate.In short, it's no wonder the game has become the gaming phoenomenon it is now. Looking at the games themselves, I can really grow to appreciate the FNAF series as they are. It's just the cancerous 8 year-old fanbase that really makes me get a bad taste in my mouth."

It has good use of the paranoia made from uncertainty, fear of losing and the things we are told are gonna be done to us if we lose and  of course, the jumpscares, but to be honest, behind the simplistic gameplay, is the real reason we love the game so.The hidden backstory is what got me here, along with memorable characters. I won't spoil it here for those who haven't played it, but it's movie worth. The gameplay as a movie, not so much, but the story is so darn deep, that even to this day we haven't got a solid one.Even with the prequel, it's still unclear. But the story is just too darn intriguing, and the characters are unique to me :3If you plan on getting this, focus on the story. Trust me, you'll love it :D"

Well after about a year I was watching one of my favorite YouTuber's. Markiplier, play this game. And he really got in to it so i was like ok i should try this game out. So I put down the $4.99 and got the game stayed up late in the night and started the game, and just in the opening where I click new game I was alrady feeling uneasy and hearing what the guard befor you had to say was just down right shocking. So I was watching the security cameras for about one minut or so and then I put down the cameras and there was this freaking bunny right there is my face, I jumped out of my chair and was runing for that light switch, and then I came back and hade my older brother come see how scary this game was. And of corse he did it with out seeing anything or anything jumping out at him just like freaddy was taunting me. He got up told me that this game is not scary then left. So I got back on this time on night 2 where my brother left off and all hell brock loose there where things runing around this duck was standing out side of my door and every time i hit the light switch there he was just watching me. So I shut the door's and then saw that I was out of power the lights whent out the door's opened up and there was nothing. Not a sound then there he was standing there watching me, then pow! this thing is in my face im runing for the hill's and never looking back. So yeah over all I give this game a 5 star rating and recommend this as a must buy."

Now I can say I'm pretty scared of animatronics. This game is great, not perfect, but it's definitely a satisfying and refreshing take on the horror genre. The controls and gameplay are simple, but it does such a good job at instilling sheer panic and paranoia, that it becomes much harder than it seems. You are forced to fight against your own sense of fear and vulnerabilty in order to save power. The story too is actually very interesting and haunting in itself, especially once you play the later games (fnaf 2/3) as well.Only 'issue' really is that it doesn't take long to learn the patterns and behaviors of the animatronics, meaning the game becomes more predictable and less scary. It's not too hard to develop a strategy to easily make it through all six nights. However, after all six nights, the game does offer a custom night mode, where you can take on the dreaded 4/20 mode if you dare. It's great because, although it is very challenging and frustrating, it adds replayability of the game and it's very rewarding once you get your strategy down and beat it.All-in-all this game is solid and I definitely recommend it.

Some people might say that the only scary feature about Five Nights at Freddy's is the losing condition of being greeted with a jumpscare of an animatronic screaming in your face, but I disagree that it's the ONLY factor in the game.The fact that there's always a sense of paranoia and anxiety about when you're quickly clicking through the cameras to try and find the animatronics is horrifying. You hope and pray that you can see each and every one of the not-so-friendly characters on-screen, or else they could be at your doors...

So much nope.Most valuable resource:the unique, disempowering game design.Of interest to:people who want a really unusual survival horror experience, or who enjoy feeling helpless.Never.  Again.  Nope.  No.  Done.This game has one very well designed feature though: upon hitting escape the game immediately shuts down, no questions asked, which is great because in my panic that is what I did, and that is the result I wanted.Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifying.  I will not be playing it again (maybe), but I give it mad props for being the most innovative, creative, inspired take on survival horror at a time when there are so many games out there just trying to be Amnesia or Slender.  Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifyingly original - and that's a large part of the reason I was completely lacking in any immunity to even the most basic scares this game dropped on me and I had to quit out at 4am on the second day because I was having heart palpitations.The brilliance of the design here is that unlike every other survival horror game I've ever played, in Five Nights at Freddy'syou do not move,.  You stay exactly where you are in the one room with minimal ability to change your point of view, monitoring the goings on on the security cameras, listening to noises, flicking on the lights to see if anyone's outside your room and if it's worth spending electricity to close the safety door - and through the whole experience you cannot move, you can't run, you can't hide, you can't do anything at all except stand there and wait, and watch, and listen, and know that eventually they're going to come.   It is a uniquely terrifying; in every other game you can give in to your urge to run (whether that's a good idea or not) but in this game you literally cannot.  That instinctive reaction, that self-preserving power is taken away from you, and that fact makes the game so much more unsettling, just that fact that your natural instinct is gone.  When for the first time I flicked on a light and saw an animatronic standing there, stationary, leering at me, I panicked.  In any other game I would have taken shelter, hidden, prepared to fight, whatever, but here?  I was paralysed because none of my instincts knew to do anything other thanmove.I have often said that indie gaming brings creativity and innovation in much the same was as structured poetry does.  When you have to work within the rigid limitations afforded by your budget and timeline, you find ways to really drill down and focus on the most important aspects, the critical features that are essential for your game.  In Five Nights at Freddy's they took a game with a simple, no-physics point-and-click interface, and handful of static visuals and a whole lot of atmosphere and made the scariest experience I've ever had in front of a computer."

Chica stayed in the bathroom/kitchen. Freddy stayed on stage, and foxy just looked at me through the curtains.Second night.Only bonnie chica, and foxy were my predators. Bonnie came first, maybe a couple seconds after the call ended. Bonnie stayed for maybe two minutes, then left. Chica game for a surprise, and I shut the door and she went and cried in the kitchen forever. Foxy made one attempt but failed horibly, because the door was already closed because bonnie had been there. Bonnie came back and stayed at the door forever, and it drained all my power. Luckily freddy's jumpscare was cut short by the ""6 Am"" Message. I also got the rare screenshot of the 3 crying children posters in the hall.Third night.First night I died, bonnie came around a lot, but never stayed for too long. While no one was around I was too dumb playing around with freddys nose on the poster to notice freddy was actualy coming fter me. After a while I realise freddy was gone, I couldn't find him anywhere, then I go out of my camera because id went out and I had a birthday surprise by Freddy ♥♥♥♥boy.Fourth night,I got seconds in and then foxy killed me, That sucked. But the next time it was too easy, only freddy and bonnie came by, freddy was no trouble and neither was bonnie, so it was pretty easy.Fifth nightI'm crying now. I've tried several times but freddy won't leave me alone. No matter how much I beg, I close the door, he doesn't leave, and I run out of power, I open them for a second, freddy kills me. I am so close, I only have a hour left, and 10% I decide that since freddy was not in the doorway I would open it. I've been opening and closing it before now, and little did I know freddy was already in the room. I check the camera, no freddy, anywhere. I knew the exact places the animetronics could appear, and freddy was either in the kitchen, or nowhere at all. I exit out of camera and kills me, it was only seconds till I could have won.I beg, I pray, I make teddy bear sacrifaces, nothing works. I honk freddys poster nose, I get a bet farther than normal, but still can't win. I've played 116 minutes. I originaly owned it just to show kids how bad♥♥♥♥♥I was, but ended up playing in front of some friends, I've screamed and cried, and even smacked a friend in the face by accident.

Five Nights At Freddy's (FNAF) is an interesting twist on the typical horror game. In this game you play as security guard on the nightshift at a resturant named 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza'. So far nothing seems scary about this game you're just watching an empty resturant, right? Well you couldn't be more wrong. Of course it wouldn't that simple.Whilst you are on the nightshift you have to protect yourself from a group of anamatronics that roam the resturant at night, if they find you they will waste no time in killing you and you lose that night. In order to survive you have to use your power wisely in order to survive the night. But that's easily said than done.What really gives this game it's scare factor is the jumpscares and how they can come out of nowhere, but another thing that makes this game scary is the suspense that you get. That feeling of 'do i have enough power to last this night?' or that fear of turning on a light and seeing an anamatronic glare at you through the door. Those moments of panic and fear are what to setup the biggest fright of them all, the jumpscares themselves. This combination is what makes FNAF such a good horror game.I haven't played this game alot, but like I said at the top only play this if you know you can handle it. Overall I think this game a great horror game and is well worth a go.Please don't ask me to play this. I think 0.9 hours is alright for me. ;)"

Scott Cawthon, the creator of the FNAF series (which you probably already know by now if you've been keeping up with the fandom since this got released) has made a very simple concept something that kept me up at night for weeks.((This is paying no attention to the fandom whatsoever and my opinion of this game is based off the game itself - I've been out of the fandom for quite a while now as it's become too toxic and full of negativity; although I still really enjoy the games ^-^))You play in the role of Mike Schmidt, a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The objective of the game is to make it through five nights in an office checking the cameras around the building (using your trusty touch-screen tablet slamming you in the face whenever you use it) and protecting yourself from killer animatronics by checking the lights of the doors to your sides and closing them when an animatronic is peeking in.The simplicity of the game sounds so easy yet when you actually load it up it can bring out your worst fears - I've played it enough to get used to the noises and jumpscares but when I first played it I couldn't stand checking the lights in the doorway because of the chance there would be someone looking back at you.Scott has a great skill with this game in taking what would be seen as harmless and turning it into your worst nightmare, and I really congratulate his skills on coming up with something so unique in both the horror genre and the entire gaming community. A very well done to you, Scott Cawthon :3I recommend this game and series to those who enjoy horror, and not to those who just want it because they're in love with a particular robot or want to ""yiff"" Foxy (he wants to be left alone - didn't you read his ""SORRY, OUT OF ORDER"" sign?? XD)Thanks for reading this review and I hope it's helpful to you! ouo/~Pet"

,Recommended,319510,11813965,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Grey Moth,"Lets review!This game is intense, and not for your usual survival elements that make big name games what they are.You are confined to a single room. This room has a monitor which provides your only eyesight about Fazbear's Pizza, and two switches; a door switch and a light switch. Your objective is deceptively simple. Survive the night, using these three tools as your only means to see 6 A.M. alive.Might seem easy, at first. The first night will be a breeze, a true tutorial of the game to get comfy. By night 2, you might be surprised to pop open your cameras only to find out one of the animatronics is already out and mucking about.By night 3 you'll understand what real horror is. It isn't in 'Do I have enough bullets', or 'oh damn, I have to outrun this big bad oogy boogy thing'. It's in watching a power gauge go from 100%, and praying to God it doesn't hit 0% before dawn comes. Or hoping Chica will finally go away from the window, while you're trying to maintain three different things and watching your reserves just drop and drop.The jump scares are pretty okay. They'll surprise the hell out of you, and may cause you to scream loudly and in a broad, colorful stream of obscenities. But this is only the icing on a seven layer cake straight from the bakery of Hell. The atmosphere, and tension are the real key factors here. Combined with a resource management scheme that works really well, and becomes significantly harder to deal with, this is a real gem of a game!There are some cons. For instance, your neighbors next door of your apartment will not appreciate the sudden stream of slurs you echo throughout your apartment building. Also, a great deal of the A.I. is either left up to luck itself on whether or not you'll survive, or I somehow was... good, I'm not sure which. Foxy never broke out of Pirate's Cove during my five nights, though he did come sneaking out of the curtain. And Chica decided to jsut take up a five minute vigil outside of my door, which quickly became annoying and cause my only death due to dealing with her while trying to keep an eye on everything else. But at the same time, I'd chalk up such paranoia inducing shennanigans as all part of the experience.Welcome to Freddy's. It's one half skill, and the other half luck. Will yours hold out til 6 in the morning?"

I got through Night one pretty damn easy and thought well its not that bad but then night two rolled around and i thought ok this cant be that hard.  Boy was i wrong i cant seem to make it half way through and even with me checking the cameras regularly and seeing a couple of them and having an idea where they are as soon as i am done looking boom i am dead.Not only am i dead but i have shrieked like a 10 year old girl and turned the game off straight away as that is enough for one time.  That was Halloween night and well i was done till the next morning and tried again and well it went slightly differently with how i saw them on the cameras but still at around 3 am boom i get done looking through the cameras and i get eaten because i completeley missed one of them and yes i srieked like a 10 year old girl again and had to turn it off.I guess if i continue playing it time after time i could see the reason why people give it negative reviews and say what they say but the whole point is for it to give you a scare and then leave it and go back. For now though it has gotten me to where i can play it till i die then i leave it alone to keep the scare factor going.So overall what i can say about this game is ithat for the price it is well worth it even of you pay full price it is worth it for such a simple little game that does not have wow look at the graphics on this or much that you need to do gameplay wise (you do not to be an avid gamer to play this) it is a great little buy and great for you to let friends play who may have never heard about it either just so you can see their reactions when they get killed.8.5/10*Edit 11/7/14*Ok so I finally made it through Night 2 by the skin of my teeth, i had 1 % power and 6 am hit and i was sooo nervous that i wasnt going to make it, i have owned this game for a week and still can only bring myself to play it once a day and let my gf play it once also.  I am really not ashamed to say the game terrifies me to no end and i just cant really explain why.  I guess it is just the fact of knowing that something bad is going to happen but you dont know when, like when you are on the rollercoaster and it has you stopped at the edge of the drop and you know its going to happen but you scream anyway.I am not sure if i want to play night 3 as i know it is only going to get worse.  It is not a game that should give you nightmares or anything like that but for me personally it is just one of those things that i can only compare to the Daleks from Doctor Who."

,Recommended,319510,14161626,"Posted: 25 January, 2015",all,Gumi,"As with most things that receive so much hype that they're made out to be the holy grail, you may be asking whether Five Nights at Freddy's lives up to that hype. Now I want to make it clear, I do think it's a pretty good game but I don't think it's the masterpiece people make it out to be. People are of course welcome to think it is and it's understandable why, as the game certainly has its fair share of great merits. I will address both the good points and bad points of this game. Keep in mind while reading that I do have an overall positive opinion on FNAF.One of the most important factors of a horror game is obviously whether it's scary. FNAF is scary... to an extent. The atmosphere is most definitely there. The player fills the role of a security guard working the nightshift at a family pizzeria inhabited by animatronic characters. The sounds are largely what make the atmosphere so amazing. From faint tunes apparently coming from attractions within the building, to ambient spooky noises, to even the whirs of the security cameras, the sound design is absolutely excellent in building suspense. The animatronics look terrifying simply standing there on the stage, in the dark, looking a far cry from the delightful entertainers they're supposed to be. One can't help but feel the fear build as they become aware of these characters beginning to skulk the halls, simply roaming, with no programmed objective, thus making them unpredictable.So where does the horror fail? In what it all ultimately builds up to. It's actually something the game points out when it starts up. To me, it's like the game's announcing a major flaw that it doesn't actually see as a flaw. I am of course referring to jumpscares. They're not inherently bad but by god can a work of horror fall back on them too much and FNAF certainly does... not just a little bit, quite a lot. Fortunately I do personally think two of the common jumpscare game overs aren't badly done - these being Foxy's and one of Freddy's (if he catches you before the power goes out.) This is because the animatronics in question look horrifying while doing the attacking. They look nothing like cuddly mascots, only wretched husks of metal and plastic, horribly failed attempts at endearing characters... just as the creator of the game no doubt intended.The other common jumpscare game overs unfortunately don't pull this off in my opinion. The animatronics attacking in those game overs... really do just look like cuddly mascots. It's a delicate art making colourful cartoon animatronics look and seem scary. The game succeeds most of the time but it almost looks like the creator didn't try during those jumpscare screens. Of course jump scaring is a lazy tactic that doesn't require any effort in the first place, so it needs some kind of scary imagery to go along with it. But there is nothing really off about the animatronics during these screens. Arguably Chica looks a little off but I don't feel it.That is the horror of FNAF at its core. Absolutely brilliant build-up, so-so execution due to the far, far too common practice of all horror works - jumpscares. It's just fortunate the game wasn't spoiled altogether by the jumpscares. It's also worth noting, there is a story to the game, both immediately obvious and not so obvious. Those who like to theorise and investigate should like it. That is, if the godawful community doesn't spoil the story for you. I'm also fond of how the game gives you the very brief ""pauses"" between the horror. The only thing that could possibly be considered something of a break in the horror is the guy who leaves a phone message for you every night. They're short, and in parts creepy in themselves, though usually there's still some lightheartedness to the creepiness. I don't know whether the creator intended for these phone calls to be something for the player to latch to due to there being nothing else to distract from the horror but it certainly works well. Unfortunately if one tries the same night more than once during one game session, the phone call no longer activates, so they have to restart. This is something I'd personally like to see patched.I have a few other issues with the game. First of all, its ending... if it can be considered that. FNAF is in a lot of ways a fairly simple game that one can get a lot out of, so a simple ending works in theory. But for all the effort that one has to put into this frankly very challenging game, the ending kind of feels like a slap in the face. I'd have preferred a bit more, even if it was short. As for the difficulty, I do feel it's somewhat too difficult for a horror game. It ends up making retrying the night feel like routine and the horror starts to fade as a result. Kind of like Slender: The Eight Pages but NOWHERE near as bad. Again, only SOMEWHAT too difficult. Finally, the lack of an option to adjust the screen resolution or any other option for that matter. This is probably why I had to restart my computer to start the game the first time. Why exclude such basic features?So those are my thoughts on FNAF. A pretty good horror experience that could serve to be amazing with a few tweaks here and there. Certainly a thrill to play, however and I would recommend it. It's also quite cheap. If you like horror and generally like what you've heard about this game, there's no reason not to get it."
76561198035552233,Recommended,319510,12031920,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,DizzyDragon,"It is a great indie game with an affordable price! A really fun short horror game where your only way to defend yourself is to close the doors to deathly animatronics while watching their movements and managing your power usage. It is unique to horror games as you cannot run, you can only defend and hold out. It adds a level of tension to the game which is rather unique. The big scare may just be jumpscares, but it is the tension of holding out that makes it a great horror game. My only gripe is that there is not a great incentive to replay it, as it is not as rewarding to play through nights you have already beat. It is a short game, and expect it to beat it in an afternoon or less for the main game. However for a short indie title with such a unique sense of tension and mood, it is great.

76561198044770180,Recommended,319510,12135064,"Posted: 17 September, 2014",all,"I'm Mr Meeseeks, Look at Me!","If you frequently browse the internet, you've probably heard of this game. Just about every YouTube let's player out there has taken a crack at it, and fans everywhere request it and proclaim it's supreme scariness to the world. Of course, there is also an equal and opposite reaction to this positivity from fans, with people saying it's an overplayed, overhyped jumpscare-fest that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Having been intrigued by the game after watching Markiplier play it, I downloaded the demo, and was compelled enough by the experience to quickly purchase the full game. After having completed the main game and the optional sixth night (and unsuccessfully attempting the infamous 4/20 mode) I believe Five Nights at Freddy's is a wholly worthwhile experience and a damn scary game to boot, but not perfect.Five Nights at Freddy's is an incredibly unique approach to horror compared to most of its contemporaries. The typical formula for indie horror games these days is running around some abandoned building or tunnel system, possibly while collecting items, and being chased by a monster, with a few jumpscares along the way. These games are based around making the player do something they don't want to do: put themselves in danger of a monster. Five Nights at Freddy's, on the other hand, draws horror from making the player do nothing. In this game, you are a night guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a Chuck E Cheese-esque establishment, but the twist is that the animatronic characters get a bit ""quirky"" at night, and by that I mean they move around and try to brutally murder you. You have nothing but a camera tablet and two door lights to keep track of them, and doors to keep them out. Simple, right? Wrong. You see, your power is limited, and using the cameras, door lights, and closing the doors drains power. You have just barely enough power to make it to 6 AM, when your shift ends, so you need to use your tools to survive only when absolutely necessary.This is brilliant, as the player has all the tools they need to survive, but they are forced not to use them, as running out of power causes a blackout, at which point the titular Freddy will come to execute you. This is as much a strategy and tower defense game as it is horror, as you must figure out the best way to ration your power while also keeping the animatronic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s off your back. In fact, calling this game a horror game is almost a misnomer, as it’s more of a paranoia simulator. You know they’re coming, but you don’t know when, and you go crazy trying to keep yourself from shutting both doors because you know you can’t afford to waste that much power. Still, the game is not unfair. It rewards players for remaining calm and using their resources intelligently, and with this and some knowledge of the animatronic robot’s patterns, you can easily succeed.This, however, is where the game’s biggest problem arises, as once you’ve learned all the game’s tricks, which doesn’t take too long, it becomes predictable, and predictability is horror’s number one enemy. As such, once you get the game down, while the game doesn’t become any less challenging, it becomes a lot less scary. By the sixth night, nothing the game did even fazed me, and I reacted to any deaths I had with frustration rather than fear. Also, the game is rather short. If you don’t die, you can beat it in just under an hour, and even if you die constantly it’s not likely to last more than 3 hours, even with the optional sixth night (4/20 mode will add at least several hours of extra play time if you decide to attempt it, though). Still, this isn’t a big deal, as the game is only five dollars, and in my opinion, the scares and unique challenge this game provided while it lasted is well worth that price. If you’re not sold, though, I’d recommend trying out the free demo, or waiting until the game goes on sale. However, I recommend you don’t watch any let’s play footage, as this game is best going in blind.On a side note, the presentation of the game is solid. The graphics are early 90’s pre-rendered 3D style, and while they don’t look that great, the game still manages to convey a solid atmosphere with them, and it almost helps the scares, as this game, being about animatronics, takes great advantage of people’s fear of the uncanny valley, and early 90’s 3D was no stranger to things that looked real but not quite. The sound design is simple but effective, and does a good job of keeping you tense and paranoid (the deep laugh that plays when Freddy moves still fills me with dread). The voice acting from the former security guard (or whatever he is) who calls you throughout the week is good enough to make him seem like a real character and maintain the atmosphere, even if it’s nothing particularly noteworthy. Overall, the game focuses less on impressing with flashy, high-budget effects and lets the mechanics drive the scares, which is exactly how a horror game should be.Score: 8/10"

,Not Recommended,319510,12971573,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,Caly(pso)-2B,"--WARNING--This review represents my own, objective opinion about this game. This means, that I will not praise the game for the good things and don't mention it's flawes, but I also won't talk only bad things about the game to make it look completly worthless. As far as the review goes, it will have spoilers, so i'd recommend either reading on, if you don't have a problem with that or simply ignore this review. Viewer Discretion Advised.--Introduction--Five Night's at Freddy is a Horror Point-&-Click Adventure game made by one developer (Scott Cawthon).The game reviewed alot of positive reviews by a lot of people and already was Let's Played by several big Let's Players.--Plot--The plot is very simple in the basic. You are Mike Schmidt who's going to work for the Freddy Fazzbear's Pizza as a Night Guard for a week during the summer from 12AM untill 6AM/ a day. Your Job is to watch the animatronics (the main attraction of the Pizzarea) as they are wandering around at night and are not allowed to be shut down or they will lock themselves.This and many other advises and mentions about certain events are being told by a guy on the Phone, who's the only ally for the player, you reciev every night untill the 4th night. He tells right in the first night that the animatronics might come to your office and might mistake you for being an animatronic without a costume and, since this is against the rules, you'll be forced by the animatronics into a costume, which has wires and beams, and won't fit a human body in, resulting in your death. The only defense the player has are 2 doors (1 to the left and 1 to the right), the lights near the doors for the blind spots and your camera to track them down.--Gameplay--The game is being controlled only by the mouse and the only interaction you have are the 4 buttons in your office and the monitor, from which you can switch through different camera feeds. As mentioned earlier, you control with the buttons the doors and the light in the hallways outside the doors. To make things more ""difficult"" you only have a limited amout of power you can use to protect yourself. That means that closing doors, using the lights and cameras consume power. The more things you use at the same time the quicker the power depletes. If your power is completly consumed, you die unless you are close to 6AM and still have some seconds to have a chance to get to the next night. There are a total of 4 (with ""Golden Freddy"" 5) animatronics you have to watch for and each of them are more or less unique in their aproach. The first active animatronics will be Bonnie (the blue bunny) and Chica (the yellow chicken). They will roam randomly through the building and will sometimes aproach your office. The further you get in the nights, the more active they'll get. The next animatronic is Foxy (The Pirate-Fox) who's malfunctioning and is ""out of order"" in his cove. He is the most easylie predictable animatronic if you know his pattern (although that is also random which means you wont know exactly when he is going to attack). the 4th. being freddy and, in later nights, the most agressive animatronic if not dealt with. The 5th. being Golden Freddy, but there must be certain events activated to summon him, which is in the most cases very rare and can be avoided very easy.If you die in this game, then your death will always be a jumpscare, which will be more or less predictable, and you have to start the night from the beginning. And there is no ""Pause"" function.--Things I like about this game--One thing the game is realy good at is building up tense. The feeling, that an animatronic will attack at any moment and , if you don't watch carefully you'll be punished with a Jumpscare, can happen every single moment. This works pretty good with the random mechanics, since every night is different from the previous, even on new attempts. There is also a form of balance in it to prevent abuses of certain mechanics to get through the game. The strongest element of the game is the fact, that it has plenty room for theories which can tease the player to speculate about with others.I actualy used more time to read theories and making my own theories then playing the game (which is actualy not something good, but i will talk about this later).--Things I don't like about this game--As I mentioned earlier that the game has random mechanics, they are not random enough (at least for me).The biggest problem being the animatronics attacking from the same spots (Bonnie from the left door, Chica from the right door, Foxy only approaching the left door and freddy from the right. This leads to a fair amount of predictabilitie and using ""strategies"" which are not exactly fun in my opinion. For instance: you simply have to check the left and right door with the lights and be ready to close the door for chica and bonnie, since they won't ""unexpectibly"" teleport into your office. This will make the cameras for them pretty much pointless and the camera will be used for someting more simplier and more predictable. This means you will watch a total of only 2 cameras in an entire night, and you won't even look at them for long. The cameras will be used to slow down foxy and Freddy to prevent them from attacking and to check for foxy, when he is ready to attack. Another thing is the lack of ""animation"" in the game. all (except for Foxy) animatronics simply teleport from room to room, making the cameras to watch their position almost pointless (for chica, bonnie and Freddy) since they can almost instantly teleport near your office and before you find all of them, one will be in your office, ready to attack. If the animatronics would actualy ""move"" and even attack from random doors then the camera would get a much better mechanic in the game and it is more crucial to watch their positions in order to know when and WHERE they attack. The last thing the game being to short. I didn't complet the game to 100% but i got from night 1 through night 5 (with night 5 completed) in slightly above an hour and I died only once in night 1 because I was unaware of Foxy being active in the first night if you dont watch the camera at all (I was using only the lights since I knew that only Bonnie and maybe chica are active in this night). Since one night is aprox. 8min and 30 secs I would've complete the game in less then 1 and a half hour 100% using the same strategy and I would not have to replay the game again for pure ""fun"" in gameplay. instead I would or still am speculating about theories then, which is by far more fun espacialy with the 2nd game being out. The last thing being the lac of options. You are not able to set resolutions and adjust the game volume which doesn't nececcary destroy the game, but is rather annoying and woth mentioning.--Conclusion--If the game didn't have these theories and a ""deep story"" which you have to uncover yourself, then I would probably ignore the game and the game would've been not worth at all with it's to simple mechanics. I know that it was only 1 Developer and that it would've much more difficult to animate every animatronic. But it wouldn't be impossible since Foxy is almost fully animated and the jumpscares itself are animated aswell.

The game puts you in a cramped space where you can be ambushed anytime and could be jumpscared anytime. Of course you'd be scared but the game doesn't earn it. Eventually playing it gets tedious and annoying really. Also the lore is not great. Like the area of a Chuckie Cheese like area is a great environment but the ""hidden plot"" is still quite bland and I bet Scott Cawton just read a bunch of fan theorises to get the lore for the later games. It's isn't worth your money, get literally anything else. Wouldn't recommend."

This game has taken those robots that kids love, and created a straight-up nightmare.Five Nights at Freddy's is amazing. It is a unique horror game that is simplistic yet so satisfying to play. This game has you responding to a local newspaper ad for a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a place that is very similar to Chuck E Cheese's. With singing robots, pizzas, and parties, it should be a place that brings much fun. Freddy's has a very dark and mysterious past and has one feature that keeps it from being a pizza-filled paradise: the animatronics tend to ""roam around a bit at night"". Normally this wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that these robots will recognize you as a metal endoskeleton without a furry suit. This is strictly against the rules at Freddy Fazbear's and these robots will gladly obey the rules by shoving you into a suit. This wouldn't be bad either, if it weren't for the fact that these suits already have endoskeletons, so you won't survive the plunge. You must survive each night of the week as you manage security cameras, large metal doors, lights, and a dwindling power supply that will certainly spell certain doom for you if it diminishes completely.With gameplay mechanics never seen before and an extremely creative setting and characters, Five Nights at Freddy's earns a solid 9/10 from me.My only wish is to see updates bringing new content to a wonderful game and I hope to see more from Scott in the future."

When I heard about this game I actually try to advoid it as much as possible. It wasn't until I heard the lore behind the game that really got me to actually get it. Here was I think:Positive:1. Very Unique, compare to other horror games where you chase or run away from monsters, this you can't which really gives your the feeling of hopeless as they are trying to get you.2. Even though jumpscares is cheesey, it always gets you all the time even when you expected it. This is the mother load of jumpscares.3. I have an older brother who always watches scary movies............he won't play this game. Enough said on that.4. You have to look closely and quickly but there are a few humor in this. For example, there a list of rules somewhere, reading it you'll see a rule that states ""Don't poop on floor"". I want to hear the story behind that one.5. Creepy characters: Yes they are not scary, but you have to admit that they are pretty creepy. I'm actually scare of Golden Freddy. *Shivers*Negitive:1. Loses it's charm: if you play it long enough it starts to lose it's charm.2. Very repeitive.Yes I haven't played it for a while, but seeing videos and reading ""phone guy's"" dialog it really creeps me out even to this day.

Although I am a huge sucker for jump scares, and that's the whole point of this game, I really enjoyed playing it.Here's the breakdown!1. It was easy to understand. There isn't much to tell you what to do, but to be honest the first night kinda plays out like a tutorial. There is still some risk to losing, I assume, but that in itself would be a hard thing to accomplish (unless you left the doors closed and the lights on the whole time). In my opinion even people who don't play games too often would quickly understand that the main objective is not to run out of power!2. It's very immersive. I find that this point is one we often take for granted. How many games can you honestly say you have been completely sucked in to? So much so that you forget that the time is in fact not 2am, and you are not sitting in a creepy office blubbering and praying that the adorably creepy animatronics don't pop to stuff your body into a metal suit, counting the seconds until 6am, or machoing it up and pretending like you don't care that your power is on 1% and it's only just hit 5am!3. The sounds are creepy AF! Having worked on a few mobile games with an indie company I know first hand that sounds play a key role in any game. They can literally make or break a game. This point is also something I think a lot of people take for granted, but I have really got to hand it to the developer here! The ambience is spot on for this game, and I can't decide if I hate that fact or love it.4. It's actually scary. I don't know why, I don't know how, but I was on the edge of my seat while playing this. Sure, I've seen one or two videos on YouTube of people playing this game, but it is NOTHING compared to actually playing it. The difference between watching it and playing it is astounding.For all the positives there are, there isn't much that really brings the game down. Keeping in mind that this is an indie developed game, and there was probably no budget going into it, I can see why it has taken off and developed into a thriving series. The only thing I would do to improve this game is maybe add in a pause menu, or at least change the fact that the esc key completely terminates the game. I accidentally pressed it in an attempt to close the in game monitor before I realised you just hover the mouse over the [VVVVV]."

Granted, it doesn't have sparkling graphics, but FNaF proved that you don't need it to make something genuinely spooky. On the downside, I now get a little unconscious jolt of panic whenever I see a draining battery symbol. On the upside, I no longer need to go to the bathroom.Just for the record, Scott, you owe me a new pair of pants.As the restaurant's (apparently suicidal, from how many times you go back) night guard, it's the player's job to keep a close eye on the animatronics after dark and keep things under wraps for the company. However, with the dark corners and blind spots perfect for a mischevious bunny coupled with energy resource management, this quickly went from a slightly eerie quick game to play to a legitimately unsettling and really freakin' tense experience, made all the more nerve wracking by the 'crew' and their tendency to violently invade your personal space at a bowel-evacuatingly frequent pace. Probably my best (worst?) and first experience with Bonnie resulted in a couple of broken computer accessories and very sore kneecaps.Seriously, the rabbit might not appear all that from a distance, but that's no ordinary rabbit. Just look at the bones, he's got a vicious streak a mile wide.All in all, I definitely don't regret buying this game, nor do I regret playing it.I do, however, regret not being ready for Freddy.Definitely worth a play or fifty, whether you're prepared or not."

It's not often I were to sit down and play any horror games (especially something similar to the Five Nights at Freddy's series) but I find it to be fun. It does get challenging at times especially as you have to check on all of the animatronics at the same time as well as making sure you're not using too much power (I suppose that adds to the challenge of the game: Managing power as well as checking all of the animatronics and surviving). I feel the creator of the series did a good job at creating it and developing it by himself.Do I recommend it? If you like psychological horror, of course I recommend it. This is one of my favourite games within the horror genre."

The complete story of the game is that you find an ad in the paper. It says you could work at a place called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza' for 120$ a week(when you play the game, you'll find THAT IT IS TOTALLY NOT WORTH 120$ A WEEK). Anyways, it says that you could be a nightguard, ensure safety of the anamatronic animals, make sure (that they stay in their proper place)that they don't get stolen. But the problem is, when it becomes nighttime, you aren't alone. The anamatronics(as far as I've heard) are little kids stuffed inside the costumes by the employees. And now they're trying to get revenge. So they come to life at night, and, yeah, try to kill you. There are four animatronics 'Bonnie' the bunny, 'Chica' the chicken, 'Freddy Fazbear' (the main character of the anamatronics), and lets not forget (my personal favorite, notice my profile picture) 'Foxy' the pirate. But anyways, the object of the game is to keep watch of the cameras, manage your power, and make sure the anamatronics don't come near you. If you like repetitive games and jumpscares as well as excitement and dread every second you play, I highly recommend ""Five Nights at Freddy's""."

76561197966672413,Recommended,319510,11844517,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Mayhem,"When I first started this game, I was struck by it's immediate warning, which had the words ""light"", ""loud"" and ""scare"" - already that sounded like the kind of passive agressive / insane temperament I was forced to grow up with as a child in Long Island, NY in the 1980's.After many hours being in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, I can say this place is one that you owe yourself, as a human being who uses a computer, watches films, and likes a good story - to vist at least once.I appreciate the source of emotion this game uses - the fear of inanimate objects being imbued with life - the sadness of tainted childhood (let alone - LOST childhood...) - the anger at an unappreciate employer (you have NO idea what I have been through...!) - the joy of victory...that last one will only last briefly.The plot is that you are a night watchman at a nearly defunct children's party place, akin to a Chucky Cheese, which was the source of video games/arcades in the 1980's and is what helped even spawn the popularity of games today (this game, in essence - is a twisted homage to the very origin of mainstream gaming).  The game was ""sold"" to me that you were making sure the puppets do not move, and do not come to your room.  I was very confused - to me this game looked HORRIFYING but there was no hint at the horror, and it felt more like a ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" mixed with ""Child's Play"" type of experience...why are all these screenshots so scary, yet the gameplay sounding so innocent?Because the game itself relies on your fear: of the strange, of adults, and of corruption.The things I love most about this game are unfortunately, what I feel most big budget developers, and most gamers now, would and will try to change.  I see ""complaints"" about Five Nights At Freddy's, but to me, are it's sordid virtues:- The game cannot be played in windowed mode (which means..no distractions! - when you play, you are immersed in the game as if you were playing it on a TV/Console or Arcade - you can't multitask, typing in Word, ordering crap on Amazon, changing songs in iTunes, check your Wordpress, Facebook, Farm, etc. etc.)- The game can't change resolution or ""insert setting here"" (because the developer perfected it for you - this game is an artfully created experience - it's like a video game version of a French Film from the 60's - it's an ""auteur"" at work - the game's creator knows what he is doing, trust him - and go with the sound settings and graphics he picked - let the ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" take you as its prisoner.....in every way...)- There is no save setting (The beauty of this game is that an enjoyable play session can go anywhere from 2-20 minutes - and the learning curve is steep - save settings and short levels become redundant)This game is worth every penny of it's price.  I purchased it based on it's uniqueness and that it spoke to me as a lover of a good story well told.  I was rewarded with an amazingly crafted and simple Puzzle Horror game that I could play at day or night - and within seconds be swept away to an intense little cramped office, where all that mattered was immediate survival - ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" is not just about watching cute animatronic characters in a security camera - it's about why you're watching them - are we as ""dumb"" as the person who took this job?  Maybe he just wanted a scare and a challenge too.Play it, enjoy it - take your time - then go watch a horror film and play a game - ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" is an ode to both."

Despite the overall lack of depth in gameplay and frustrating difficulty, I still find this game to be a unique experience. It's refreshingly simple and does a good job of breaking free from a lot of the cliche's of modern horror games, especially once you realize that this game does not take itself seriously. At all.The game is simple: you are a security guard at a pizza parlour that includes animatronic animal entertainers. You work the night shift. The animatronic animals like to ""roam around"" at night. You have a limited amount of power with which to use security cameras to keep track of them, and keep the doors to your office (the only physical location in the game) closed when the animals get too close. If you don't keep track of their movements and they enter, then you're dead. Power tends to run out pretty fast, so the main aspect of the game is that of resource management.It's a simple mechanic, yes, but it will have you frantically switching between the cameras as you lose track of one of the bots, and as panic mounts you'll realize that HE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR! I can see this game being a big hit if played on a big screen at a party or something, considering how fast it plays and how simple it is. As power drains and tension rises it can be hard to focus on conserving power, and when the end comes it is usually hilarious.My main problem with the game is that it's a one-note joke that wears thin after awhile. If you are wanting to play this as a serious game, then move on. It's a gag that will entertain you for 3 hours max, until you let someone else play and don't tell them anything about it. Then you'll get more enjoyment. And probably fewer friends :DFor five dollars, I recommend this game. I think it's a good price for something that's a light-hearted, more competent and slick version of the scary maze game. It tells me that the makers understood what they were doing and didn't want to make the game out to be anything more than it is. And for those of you that think you shouldn't buy it because you've seen a youtube video of it, I'd give the game more credit than that. You don't know what it's like until you're sitting in the security office panning frantically between cameras, hearing them singing ominously in the dark halls of the pizza parlour. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE, MAN!"

YouTuber's are all posting Let's Plays of them, and the hype of this game spreads far and wide. For five dollars, one must ask, ""Why?"" I mean, it's a really cheap game from a relatively unknown developer. Why does everyone adore this game?The answer: A refreshing change from the generic modern horror theme.This game offers something that isn't showcased in the majority of top dollar horror games, especially from the developers who have established a series such as Resident Evil and do not wish to deviate from the action theme. In fact, I believe this spin on modern horror is so unique in nature and mechanics that this is the core reason this game is so popular. And for good reason.I'll break it down for you.Imagine the following: You've applied and been accepted for a nightwatchman position at a local pizzeria. The restaurant is famous for its lovable animal robots, namely Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy. During the day, these animatronics play music for the crowd, and please the kids while they chow on pizza. During the night, things turn for the worse. Said robots are a little stressed out, and they love to walk around to ""work out the kinks"". And you're charged with keeping an eye on them with the cameras. And they are programmed to stuff any endoskeletons (you) exposed into costumes (death). And they love to stop by outside your door, and you must be aware of where they are, for if you don't catch them outside your doors fast enough, they love to pull a jumpscare on you. And you have limited power to work with; using the cameras, lights, and doors drains your power. And you have to survive 6 hours (game time). And you only get paid $120 for 5 nights. I wouldn't take the job even if it only included the last contention.The unique spin is that you never actually have the power to combat or face your foes. You are a helpless lamb; you must use intelligence and perception to survive the night. This deliberate siphoning of force from your hands is the reason why people are always coming back. And it's the reason why I defintely recommend this game to anyone wanting a refreshing spin on horror games. The only downside I could consider is the one dimensional style of play, but I definitely foresee expansions and mods coming out for this type of game.Oh, and did I mention that it's five bucks? w00t w00t.Overall rating: 4.5/5, would freddy again"

Five Nights At Freddy isnt like and normal horror game, ya' know, walk around some random place, dont get killed by the many creatures that lurk the area, and once you escape, you win. Five Nights At Freddys however, is alot diffrent however. You are stuck in a room with limited power, and once that power runs out, Freddy Fazbear (as I like to call him, Freddy Fagbear), will come to end your long night. This game REALLY builds up tensity, because half the time I press escape (if you didnt know, the button that instantly closes the game), and most of the time I just keep flipping the camera to kinda help slow down the anamatronics in there position. A few flaws though is once you know how to tell an anamatronic is is your room, or one is running to your room, it isnt as scary, but still, it makes me extremely tense.

This game uses new mechanics combinded with a awesome concept. Never have I seen a game based on animatronics in a pizza parlour. The idea is original and great to build story and lore off of. The end of the game leaves you clueless and makes you wonder what happened in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza before you got your job there. It's surprising that only one man had worked on this as it would have taken alot of time and talent to make such a great game. This game didn't follow in the footsteps of the sterotypical first person horror. The jumpscares were not cheesy and jumpscares were sometimes not even needed to scare the player. Gameplay was always interesting thoughout the whole game as none of the animatronics had a set path making it very scary and intense to not know what they might do next. It was great to add in the feature when you thought you had finished the game on the 5th night you actually hadn't. Also finding some of the hidden lore and easter eggs in this game makes the player more interestered in the story. If you are reading this and you haven't bought this game yet, Immediately scroll upwards and buy this game! For $5 this game is worth it.

I've played a good number of scary games, but none have made me feel as helpless and paranoid as Five Nights at Freddys. When you start playing and watch the animitronics move around, it's one of the most intense experiences you can go through. Just sitting there, unable to move, and the fear of a robot animal sneaking in at any second to kill you, the fear filling yu with each second. Every time you look at the time, it feels like your chances of survival slip every more quickly as you realize it hasn't even been an hour since you last checked that clock. No other game has made me feel like turning on all my lights and huddling in a corner like this one. Now, this doesn't make it perfect. One of the big flaws for this game is the repetitive atmosphere. If you sit there for a few hours and play this, the fear just dies, because you figure out when your threatened and when you need to use that valuable power.

I think that the lack of movement in this game also adds to the experience, because the feeling of helplessness forces you to rely on your cameras which is argueably the games greatest strength. by using these cameras it creates an atmospheric kind of scare rather than cheap jumpscares (which are in this game i should note) but for me what really stood out was the way that this game portrays this childrens pizzeria, and makes it into a place that looks like it could be home to a slasher villian.this game is a little limited in gameplay but its very atmospheric and the animatronics are all memorable and in an odd way have their own unique behaviors.  Although the game has several flaws, such as a stupidly low power meter, and doors that open when the power goes out for some reason, the overall experience comes off as being creative and fresh for the horror genre.p.s. much better than any of the sequels in my opinion"

I can hardly even press the continue button now. The title screen freaks me out as well. On the first night, it wasn't too bad; the animatronics were not active for the duration of the first call of the Phone Guy, which saved me a couple of hours. (The only thing I did during that time was listen to call, get used to where the cameras are located, and getting to know the controls). But on the second night...I didn't even get past 50%/3 AM. Bonnie made me scream. I died horribly. After I returned to title screen, I just quit. The most scary thing about this game is that you are alone, and it is EXTREMELY quiet (Apart from footsteps, banging noises, etc). And you know that you are going to get jumpscared when you LEAST expect it.Do I recommend this game?If you have played many, many horror games, and are used to being jumpscared, then why not?

In the game you are a security guard tasked with overseeing several animatronics out to get you, and using methods such as looking at cameras and closing doors the player must survive from 12-6AM for 5 days. The game becomes progressively harder as the nights go on and the intensity increases exponentially. Although most jump scares are a cheap way to terrorize the player and occur randomely FNaF uses them in a unique way. The jump scares do not occur randomely and only happen if the player has failed in maintaining an eye on the animatronics and allowed them to sneak up on him/her. The game may seem unfair at times however with a chance of dying randomely and no way of preventing that in the alter nights. Aside from being unfair at time the game maintains a spooky atmosphere while also being fun to play. The game has replay value with a bonus night and custom nights.

To be honest, I only saw a few minutes of it and thought, eh, I don't think it's all that great. However, I didn't realize how much limited power in the game adds to the suspense. I was under the impression that this game would be easy. I did not realize that you used power by using the cameras, doors, and lights in the game. I played one of the five nights and got lucky. The suspense is what makes this game terrifying. I haven't even gotten a jump scare yet and I was already panicking when I realized the robot animals were just a room away from the security room. Locked both doors just to be safe, ran out of power and the doors opened and I held my breath. Then the clock chimed 6am, and I realized how close to death I could've been in the game.

Do you feel your nightwatch security gaurd should be completely immobile from the waste down? Then Five Nights at Freddy's is a game for you. In Five Nights at Freddy's you are the new nightwatch security gaurd of a haunted Chuck-E-Cheese knock-off. You are a man/woman of few words and you are there to do a job. A job that quite frankly, no one else was desparate enough to do. You will find yourself desparately trying to manage resources as you slam doors in the faces of murderous animatronic animals, and try to survive till your shift ends at 6:00 am. Watch those cameras, don't forget to check those doors, and pray you don't fall short on power. Sit in your office and survive the night or rather 5 of them, here at Freddy's.Pros:+Keeps you on the edge of your seat+Genuinly stressful (But in a good way) once you get into it+The story is hidden, but it's there and it's pretty good+Atmosphere is great and has that feeling of terror that one would experience being helpless, alone, and hunted+Affordable: $5 is less than that grease burger meal at that fast food restraunt you visit way too often to be healthy+Doubles as a minimum wage simulatorCons:-The games concept may have crippled itself in it's simplicity.

It really puts you in the HORRIFYING shoes of a night-watch security guard who is making taking care of the pizzaria over night.My top 3 rules about FNAF for the full effect of terror are as follows:1. Play at night when noone is around or maybe one other person that is watching you, but make sure its quiet everywhere else in your play location.2. WEAR HEADPHONES <<< I cannot stress enough how much scarier it is when the sound is condensed and blasted into your ears only!!!3.

The staff didn't even offer us a free drink or anything to make up for THEIR mistake! It wasnt until we FINALLY sat down for our meal that we noticed how run down the place looked. The decor looked very old and dated, The carpet was matted and the place STANK of old. It honestly looked like it hadnt been cleaned since the 1970s.Despite not even getting a ""Sorry for you're wait"" from the waitress, we were pressured into ordering our food as soon as we sat down. Me and my partner both ordered a Pepperoni while our son got a plain cheese. When the food EVENTUALLY arrived it was awful. The pepperoni may aswell have been called 'plain cheese with a hint of pepperoni' and neither of them had been cooked all the way through. They were more like FROZEN pizzas than resturant quaility pizzas!After finally paying out bill (which we were BLATANTLY overcharged for) we made straight for the exit.

I generally love point and click adventures and use them as a bit of a timewaster. A prime example of this is Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, a story about a kid who goes into his closet to find the ""Land of Darkness"" to capture ""Darkness"" (the main antagonist) and put him in a lunchbox. This is a prime example of a fun and enjoyable point and click adventure.This point and click adventure will have you on the edge of your seat as you try to stop 4 (maybe 5) animatronic creatures murder you in the dead of night at your low paying job.Needless to say, I love this game in the weirdest way possible.

Was it replaced with mindless mass appeal action with a horror theme yet no actual fear factor? Yes... and no. The horror genre has been placed in the hands of indie developers and in those hands it still thrives with games like this. The indie gaming industry proves it can continue to add new ideas to the genre while still providing that heart-attack inducing fear we felt the first time we played Silent Hill, Resident Evil or Eternal Darkness. Amnesia showed us first person games don't always need guns and weapons, it also proved that if you've already evacuated your bowels while playing the next scare will bring out unprocessed food.Five Nights at Freddy's shows us that heart attacks are can happen to people of any age.... okay all jokes aside this game really does stand out in the horror genre. You don't actually do anything, you aren't walking around or looking for clues. No instead you just sit there... knowing something will happen and you don't know when it will come or what will come at you but you know. It's a feeling of dread and fear that I... honestly havent experienced in a horror game before. Something about these ungodly abominations just toying with you, gives you the sense of helplessness as if you're at the mercy of these things. Usually these types of indie games don't appeal to me. Like all those knock versions of Slenderman.... actually I didn't even like Slenderman. But this, this is not some indie horror game from the quick and easy production line up of such games like Spongebob Slendypants... no this is a stand out title. Almost like a point and click adventure but without the adventure.The person/people who made this game knew what scared people and they utilized that with game mechanics that require you to think clearly and react to what you see and hear. Which is extremely hard to do when your having a bowel evacuating heart-attack. Nonetheless I love this game and it's something I hope to see more of."

You work the night shift at a children's pizza restaurant akin to a Chuck-E-Cheese; however, that is where the similarities stop.  Fazbear's Pizza has a shady past, and a few ""malfunctioning"" animatronics seeking your inadvertent death.  You have to survive the nights with only your cameras, doors, lights, and quick click reactions.  Don't be too hasty or your limited supply of power will run out!There are three unique aspects that make this a must play--the simple design/gameplay mechanics (you are stuck in a room--no escape just survival), sinister environment (camera features and sounds play with your sanity), and the constant suspense (you see them coming closer and CLOSER).On the other hand, the jumpscares get tiresome and the gameplay repetitive, but that doesn't overpower the great aspects of the game.

The bad thing about this game is that the jumpscares are very repetitve, as they are all pretty much the same thing.

I haven't beaten it yet (stuck on Night 4) but from what I've played, it's great fun. The graphics, while only really just mostly still images, look great and really pop out. The animitronics  actually look scary, and when I first saw them, I was really creeped out by them, just like the ones at a Chuck E. Cheese, (seriously, those ones scared the sh*t out of me the first and only time I went there.  The controls are very good in that its super simplistic to play. The sounds the game makes are absolutely terrifying, it's a very creepy game. And I also love how the story of the game, really is something you have to figure out yourself. But what most people out their might be wondering about the most important think. Do I think this game is scary? Well, let me put it this way, in SomeCallMeJohnny's review of the trilogy of FNAF games, his brother said the jumpscares aren't the really scary thing, it's the anticipation for the jumpscares. I can say the exact same thing too. The jumpscares aren't super scary like some Youtubers make them out to be. But the anticipation for it is truly terrifying. I swear sweat was dripping down me when I was waiting for the jumpcares. It's truly a great way to get someone scared. Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. The reason why is because the game is fairly short. But everything else, is great. Kudos to Scott Cawthon for creating such a great game."

,Recommended,319510,28602750,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,tagenar,"(A review of the first 3 games.  Game 1 is the only one worth paying for, so I am leaving my thoughts here.)Five Nights at Freddy's 1: you're a security guard of a kid's pizza restaurant, and the animatronic performers on stage start moving around at night.  If they make it into your office, you're dead.Why do the doors require power to stay CLOSED?  Why does the security system run on a battery?!  What are you guarding???Illogical as the setup is, it's entertaining and creepy.  The gameplay is intuitive, and it's a fun challenge to find the rhythm needed to survive the final nights.  Understanding how each creature behaves is crucial to managing your resources, and as limited as the graphics and gameplay are, they are well-executed.Five Nights at Freddy's is an experience as memorable as it is creative.  It creates a real sense of dread, helplessness, and panic, all from still images in poorly lit rooms.*Five Nights at Freddy's 2 isn't as good as the first.  You're a security guard again at a new and bigger restaurant location.  No doors to close this time.  Now the creatures can get into your office, and you can't stop them.We're expecting the jump scares, so it isn't a surprise this time, and now you have a flashlight, so getting such a good look at the animatronics kills their scare value.In game 1, all the creatures move about in observable ways, and you can and must track them on camera, and you know when to close the doors and when it's safe to open them.Not so with 2; creatures sometimes just appear in your office for no reason, and you only have a fraction of a second to put on the mask or the game is over.  Closing doors to keep the creatures out is intuitive in game 1.  Game 2 has fuzzy rules.Looking at the cameras is pointless because it affects nothing, unlike game 1, in which it is the only way to keep a couple monsters from moving.  The monsters don't always have consistent paths through the building, so keeping track of them wastes too much time.  Winding the damn music box is the only reason to open the cameras now, and it means your eyes are permanently glued to camera 11, and the player doesn't get to see the building or observe the creatures at all.Checking up on Freddy's and Foxy's locations in the first game makes the cameras part of the game because doing so prevents them from moving.  In game 2, the cameras don't serve a purpose at all.  Being able to shine light in the dark rooms affects nothing, and it takes away from the subtlety.In FNAF1, the animatronics move in subtle ways, and because you can't see them clearly until they are right in front of you, at first you wonder if they are moving at all.  FNAF2 lets you see them clearly at all times, and yes, now they are obviously moving.The sound effects are subtle and creepy in the first game.  Some could be mistaken for ambient noise.  In the second game, they're pretty blatant and loud.  Foxy even has a theme song that plays when he's nearby.  Doesn't add to the creep-factor.This game feels like the cartoonish knock-off an imitator would make, not a sequel.*As for Five Nights at Freddy's 3...  The pizza restaurant is closed, and now you're a security guard for a haunted house based on Freddy Fazbear's restaurant.  I beat the game in less than 90 minutes, and I don't know how or why.  The rules are so unclear the game is more confusing than frightening.  I couldn't find the damn creature on camera!  Despite clicking on every view a dozen times per night, I never saw it apart from a couple sightings in the vents, so how was I supposed to play?!If there is a place where you're told to use audio to lure it away from the office, I didn't hear it.  I read that's what you're supposed to do in a community guide.  I figured since I had made it to night 4 without taking any action, I should find out what I'm actually supposed to do.  So I hit the audio in random places throughout each night, and eventually I beat nights 4 and 5.  Did it have any effect?  It must have, but I didn't see a result, and that's the big problem with this game.  Game 1: close door, prevent death.  Game two: put on mask, prevent death.  In game 3, there is no connection between an action and preventing your demise.I've read you must complete the minigames in cryptic, unintuitive ways to get the true ending.  I will not bother.*I enjoyed the first game.  The scenario is illogical, but the gameplay makes perfect sense, it is genuinely creepy, it is intuitive, and the experience is memorable.  I'm guessing the success of the first game killed this as a franchise as the creator cranked out the sequels too fast to think them through.  I have no faith the other games in the series will be any better."

The game has a great scare factor to it as well as the startegy you need to win. There is a second game out at the moment however, I would play this one first, as it also has a great storyline and has several characters, which are 4 animatronics by the name of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy. The idea of the game is thta you are the night watchman at a pizzeria named freddy fazbears. The animatronics that dance during the day are left in free roam mode of a night because of their servos locking up. They search for where kids are which as of a night, well you can guess is you iun your office. The idea is that you watch the cameras to keep them from coming to you, it has the concept of the weeping angels from doctor who. You also have doors either side of you to keep them from coming in, however you have limited power, this is where the strategy comes in.Overall, if you would like to try somehting new with horror this is a great game to start with. 10/10 game and is real cheap for what you are getting!"

,Recommended,319510,11929137,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,Gameking47,"Five Nights at Freddy's. A game that has grown more controversy than Donald Trump himself. (That's not even a joke. It's actually true.) It's a game that when you observe the source code and basic algorithms used to plan out the game, is really and truly random generators and timers glossed over with a creepy and unsettling art scheme. Such a simple concept, but I must admit it is done very well. Especially considering one person is behind it. However there are flaws. The first is that the game itself is not very complex. You must conserve power, but the more you conserve, the more you become paranoid, and the more paranoid you are, the more you look for enemies, and the more you look for enemies the less power you have. The game relies on you being scared and clueless as to what's going to happen and scares with the classic jumpscare. horror games I respect like 'silent hills' scare you on a deep psychologically torturing level. But that's apple's and oranges. The next flaw, is the replay value. Scott Cawthon is a good marketer for his game. And he knows how the populus operates. From giving free early copies to populer youtubers, to getting this game on steam early, he is clever indeed. In addition to this he announces his sequels JUST as he figures his last one is losing interest. And to add to that, he is incorperating a vague and unexplained storyline to add to it. Which is how the FNAF controversy, and Scott's fortune was born. That clever rat.. Anyway the next flaw would have to be the simplicity. Once you get used to the game, it really gets boring until around night 4 or 5 difficulty. Cause by then you don't know for sure if you will win. The difficulty is what makes a game good. Letting you be able to customize your difficulty was a good move. To end, the game is good but simple. The scares can get you if you don't pay attention, the concept is beyond creepy and the frantic micro-managing the damn cameras to keep freddy and foxy in their place is strangely fun and annoying. I'll give this game an okay 77/100 for it's uniqueness"

What you have are 2 doors, the cameras, and lights for the doors. you watch the cameras to make sure you know where the animatronics are. Bonnie and Chica go for your doors, and you can catch them in the blindspots(Right outside your door!)if you check the light and you cant find them anywhere. when you DO catch them in the lights, SHUT THE DAMN DOOR! there is one big thing many players die from. the POWER meter. the building is on limited power during the night, and keeping the doors down drains that power quickly. same with using both lights and doing ALL AT THE SAME TIME WILL GET YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MURDERED. so only close the doors when you have to, and only check the lights once every time you pull down the cameras. One big flaw to this strategy is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself, FOXY. keep those cameras off for too long and Foxy comes running down the west hall(yes RUNNING instead of actually just ♥♥♥♥in standin there)and instantly ends your night. you CAN block him with the door if you got lightning fast reflexes OOOOOR you know he's coming. he WILL take a bit of your power from banging on that door though, so try not to trigger him and keep the cameras on frequently but not too frequently.Freddy FAZ♥♥♥♥ over here is the ultimate troll. he gets active on Night 3 and will hide in the dark so you usually wont see him until he enters the East Hall Corner. AKA near your door. no one truely knows how Freddy Fazbear works in this game, and thats the reason why the MANY, MANY deaths on night 5 were infact caused by mr FREDDY FAZ♥♥♥♥. he can also kill you with the power out. lose all that power on ANY NIGHT and he will play ""Toreador March"" for a random time. the longest possible windup is about 1 minute, but most players were ""Saved by the bell"" when 6 AM hit DURING Freddy Fazbear's Toreador March. so what do I think of this game? Great! its a great addition to the horror genre and while it isn't very scary nowadays, it still gives me those chills from time to time.Grade:A-ACTUALLY, THERES GOLDEN FREDDY TO.

Definitely gets the adrenaline going and the uncertainty of how to handle certain characters in the game makes this a very exciting one to play.

,Recommended,319510,11982249,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,R To Restart!,"Stop. Think about what you are doing.""Oh this game isn't scary. Pffft its just a bunch of jumpscares! I can handle it.""No. You are wrong, because that is exactly how I felt when I bought this game. I'd watched the trailers and the lets plays. Then I actually tried it from behind the keyboard and I couldn't even do it. Its not wrong to say that this game is mostly jumpscares, and jumpscares are widley regarded as the lowest incarnation at horror. However Five Nights at Freddy's does something different than other horror games. In most horror games the jumpscare is just a one-and-done, a little one trick pony to startle you and which is totally ruined if you see it coming, and ruined even further in the context that in games jumpscares usually don't kill you.In Five Night's at Freddy's, the jumpscare is the lose condition, it is the game over screen. You know the jumpscare is coming, and the game has given you all the tools to prevent the jumpscare. Thats why this game is scary. Its not the jumpscare that gets you, its the anticipation, the stress and the anxiety that gets you. Ben Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once said that most horror games can be summed up with ""A man in a scary mask jumps out and yells 'Aboogiewoogiewoo!' while in a good horror game, the man in the mask is behind you. You know he's going to jump out and yell 'Aboogiewoogiewoo!' but he doesn't he's just stays behind you and lets the fear sink in.""Thats this game. This game isn't about the jumpscare at all. Its about the fear you feel when you know the jumpscare is coming and your frantically trying to avoid it.So DON'T buy this game because you think it won't be scary, or because you think you'll impress your friends by showing how brave you are. Buy this game because its scary, because you WANT to be scared.And if this game doesn't manage to freak you out even once, I would love to talk to you personally because I need to know your secret to managing stress and anxiety."

""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"". The pay is $120 for surviving the five nights which I think it isn't worth. You gotta keep out five animatronics. Which I will name and give genders. Bonnie (Male) Chica (Female) Foxy (Male) Freddy Fazbear (Male) and Golden Freddy (Male).  You gotta becareful of how much power you use. Because once you run out of power you are ♥♥♥♥ed. Unless your luck and make it to Six AM before Freddy kills you. You also gotta becareful of Foxy. If your not fast he will get you. Keep an eye on him but don't look at him to much or he'll just come after you anyway. Bonnie is the most active. He is the first one to move on Night 1. Then sometimes. Chica will join in on night one. Which is unlikely. Foxy and Freddy rarely move at all. Also becareful checking Camera 2B. If you see a golden Freddy poster you are screwed in five to seven seconds because he kills you and crashes your game. But there's a way around that as soon you see Golden Freddy put your Camera up and he'll disappear. For a bit of spoiler for those who don't know. There is a sixth and seventh night. But the seventh night is just a costum night where you can set up the level of the animatronics. The highest is 20 and the lowest is of course one. For a game that's $5 USD. It's a good game and worth it. My favorite are Foxy and Chica. The others can just leave. So if you enjoy a bit of horror it's so worth getting. It does get much harder each night but just as much more fun. 10/10"

If you want a look at what the game is like, then I am posting a video below:https://youtu.be/SfMdWO9R3ZsIn this game, you play as an employee in charge of monitoring (and basically trying now to be killed by) these robot animals. You have the use of the security room's CCTV cameras, which is how you track and monitor these enemies. They will move around whilst you are not watching and come to hunt you down. You are also equipped with lockable doors on either side which are to be used if they get too close. Survive till 6am, and you pass the level. Pass 5 levels, and you beat the game.Overall I enjoyed my experience with FNAF, but would not really play more than a couple hours before tossing it away, only to be brought out when you've got some friends over ect. So, yeah it's worth the price, and if you are a fan of these types of games, then you'll surely get your money's worth."

"" 11/10 - IGNBut let's be serious here, FNAF is one of the most scariest games I have ever played. Oh and believe me when I say I played 100's EVEN 1000's of different horror games. This one really makes your heart race, palms sweat and just overall terrified. When I first saw this game, it didn't look scary to me at all. I thought ""this looks boring....NEXT"" but as I'm glad I contiuned to watch more I realize how truly scary it was. Oh god....when I played it for myself I had nightmares for 2 straight weeks.Now let's talk about the concept of this game. Well, it's unique and very simple. All you do is feel isolated in a room, check the cameras so often, use the lights and doors on either side. That's basically it. You may say ""OH DATS SOUNDS SO BORING UGRH!"" But as you see and hear these creepy animantronics getting closer to you. You have no choice but to wet your pants. But...since the concept is so good, devs are trying to steal Scott's idea. What amazes me is, just pictures put together with a very simple concept can make a game truly terrifiying.FNAF 2 has been greenlit. I'm indeed looking forward to the game. I love the new animantronics. I love the new room that you are now isolated in. I love the brand new mechanic, which is you can put a mask on to fool the old animantronics. But since the new animantronics have better technology, they can see you as a human unlike the old and slighty broken animantronics. But the thing that worries me the most is that FNAF 2 will get boring and won't be scary after about 1 hour like FNAF. I still find FNAF slighty scary but not as scary when I first played it. So if FNAF 2 manages to keep you on the edge of your sit at all times, then we will be wetting more pants.  But I am really looking forward to FNAF 2.  The time when I'm writing this, it's Halloween so HAPPY HALLOWEEN FNAF and all of you guys too.If you did actually read my review, thank you ^^ HAVE A GREAT NIGHT SLEEPING."

It's something that you should definitely pick up as it's only 5$, and you'll get in a ton of good screams. It's more of a point-and-click type of game, as you won't need to use your keyboard at all to play this one. There's not really any skill involved either, it's more of just getting down the technique of the game and making choices that depend on the location of the wandering animatronic robots. It's almost a puzzle of sorts, but you'll need to make gambles as well. risking your precious power, which is always decreasing. It's definitely a fresh take on the whole horror genre, and will also make for a great Twitch/YouTube game to broadcast. There are definitely richer experiences on the Steam Store for the same modest price of 5$, but this is a game that is very unique and deserves your time.

The game is rumored to take place around the early 90's due to the amount you get paid (about $125 at the end of the week) being the minimum wage for that time. Also due to the pizzaria's one defining quality; animatronics of child-friendly creatures. Foxy the Pirate Fox, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny and Freddy Fazbear. What could go wrong?Did I mention the whole ""these guys are here to kill you so have fun surviving"" bit?In the game, you are forced to survive six hours per five nights as these four animatronics try to kill you, each night getting more challenging than the last. As the nights progress, phone messages the previous night guard left for you are played, giving you hints about what to do and posters begin to change on the walls, desribing how a once-loved restauraunt became the nightmarish hell it now exists as.The game mainly relies on jumpscares for its horror, but the true horror shines when you start paying attention to the posters on the walls and phone calls given to you. (Also I'm about to SPOIL most of the story for you so you might want to leave if you don't want the story spoiled).***SPOILER ALERT***Posters of the animatronics begin to rapidly change into posters of a crying child, a poster of Freddy becomes yellow, resulting in the appearence of the ghost-like, limp Golden Freddy teleporting into your office, crashing the game as he kills you. Finally is the rules poster that changes into four different newspaper articles, describing the story of a man who killed five children and stuffed their bodies into the animatronics that now roam the halls looking for you.Did I mention the phone messages decribing an event known as The Bite of '87, where the front of someone's skull was bit off by an animatronic?***END OF SPOILERS***So needless to say, the haunting tale behind why the restaurant looks so abandoned in the game is some heavily disturbing material that only gets more disturbing as the second game expands upon it.Now, of course, the game's mechanics are simple, but in my eyes, the best thing about this game is the anticipation of the jumpscare. You know that if you get caught you will be jumpscared, but you never know when it could happen. The scares are pretty lackluster, minus Golden Freddy the first time you encounter him, but the anticipation of them helps to balence them out.There's also the fact that, by night 4, you're only checking two places on the camera to make sure the two toughest animatronics aren't moving from their spots. This makes the entire camera gimmick much less substantial to a game based around using security cameras and can take away from the game.Then again, not having your eyes on half the animatronics by night 4 to actually stand a chance just brings the tension up even further.So, to summize, Five Nights at Freddys, or FNAF, does great in:A creepy settingCreative way of giving instructions on how the game is playedCreative, fragmented storytelling that allows for a lot of interpretationGreat tensionWhile it doesn't do so great in:Jumpscares being relied on so muchLittle use for the security camerasFinal Score: 7/10"

,Recommended,319510,17632668,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,Zed Cola,"I will review the game AND the fanbase seperately . Because this game blew up, of course it will get hate.First game in the Series, 3rd setting in the lore.FNAF 4 Fredbear and Freinds --> FNAF2 Freddy Fazbear's Pizza  --> FNAF 1 Freddy Fazbear's Pizza ---> FNAF 3 Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction.FIRST NIGHTS IN GAME:When you first install the game and play the first night, yeah if you listen carefully listen to the phone guy and explore the buttons, you will get the point of the game. You do not move, you do not walk around with a lantern and find demons, but you do have lights, doors and a camera. It's the fear of the unknown that's scary and this game delivers it well, and at a good pace too.When the phone guy mentions moving children entertaining animatronics, you have a look and one is gone (Bonnie). Most people will panic, shut the doors and search frantically. The first jumpscares aswell will deliver fear and that is why this game blew up so much.When they show up at your doors or disappear and reappear in a scary position you are urged to close both doors and check cameras but the power says otherwise and it's finding that balance that makes the game scary.As the nights progress, it get's more complex than Bonnie and Chica moving around, the Phone Guy gives more details on the game mechanics and new animatronics and their patterns like Foxy and Freddy. As you get more used to the first jumpscares the newer animatronics will confuse you and re introduce that fear of the Unknown. That peaking out head and the running noise will surely give you a game you will remember.LAST NIGHTS:BUT honestly the jumpscares are the most basic 'Scary' element to this game and it does wear off after a bit. You then try to strategise a pattern of beating the ever growing hardness of the game. Some people have beaten the impossible 20/20/20/20 mode. But the game goes from horror to spooky strategy.GAME MECHANICSThis game was one of the most unique horror games of this time. After Scott's bad reviews on his holy games he took his negative reviews and adapted them to make this game. The game uses horror like never before mixing the moving animatronics with stopping them from getting in with power management.THE LORE ;The lore is long  and explained over multiple games.To get all the lore you need, you will have to dig in all 5 games of the FNAF series. here is the lore Wiki;http://freddy-fazbears-pizza.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:897435Basically one employee (Purple Guy) is a complete madman and lures in children and muders them and stuffs them into the suits. The spirits of the deceased children haunt the animatronics and with help of the Puppet (From FNAF2) they take their revenge by making the Purple guy become like them and get trapped in Golden Bonnie, SpringTrap, just like them by making him hide in the suit and then have it lock up and impale him. As seen in FNAF 3 good ending.When FNAF2 launched it was secretely a prequal where you would see 'New' improved animatronics of these charicters. More lore before FNAF1 was revealed. Then onto FNAF 3 wich takes place after FNAF1. Then you get FNAF4 wich takes place from the chid of 'The bite of '87's perspective. As the games progresse more and more lore is revealed but there are still questions that need answering.THE FANBASE ;It's kinda creepy. The fanbase is honestly scarier than the game. You have the plot nuts who are frantically searching for the plot, The animators that do a good job of making funny or cute animations featuring the animatronics that may twist with the story or explain the cannon a bit more. Or the just downright redicules animations with no point at all just to make us laugh.Then you have the haters. These guys are trolls or low lives who seek out people who enjoy the game and hate just because of it's popularity or just to poke at the games theme of jumpscares as 'Trash' and not scary. This game is not perfect as it was made by one guy but please do not just content hunt on this. And you have the twisted guys who make 'graphic' animations of the animatronics wich honestly ruin the good animations and you can't find anything else than b00bs.HONESTLY IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GAME, IF YOU HAVE PLAYED IT MAKE A BAD REVIEW AND LEAVE, AND IF YOU JUST HATE BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE, LEAVE.FINAL THOUGHTS ;The first game, it is a classic, not too complex or simple. Keep the animatronics from making you their b#### by closing doors, tracking their locations and keeping the power  for 6 hours. The method does go down to checkign door lights and pirate cove and closing right door as they just teleport around the Pizaria.The building runs on two AA batteries so the fear comes in from not checking the cameras to save power and only shutting the doors only when needed. If you are too cautious you will loose power, and hence your protection leading to your demise by stuffing into your costume that you where not wearing. The longer you do not check on the animatronics, they more tension created hence leading to scarier jumpscares.GAMEPLAY:Honestly good for the first time, and the competition of hard nights and 20/20/20/20 .HORROR:Good for power limitations and the unknown to deliver fear. Jumpscares, get boring after a bit but do their job in the first few nights.LORE:Rich in detail and not given on a plate. Requires digging and still leaves questions unanswered. Filled with murder and corruption and the supernatural.9/10Must get if you are interested. TrulyUnique.Will be remembered as the indie game that took the world by storm.Willalwaysbe remembered."

The death noise I guess is ""scary"" but only if you're not expecting it. It's a fun game that makes you come back for more, and although it might look like an old MS DOS game, it still has amazing gameplay. My final rating for Five Nights at Freddy's: 9/10."

,Recommended,319510,18808741,"Posted: 31 October, 2015",all,Night Druid,"Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie survival horror game, with the unique twist of being mostly point and click. You play the security guard in a pizza restaurant that has a bit of a problem...Its life-sized animatronic mascots like to roam about at night and kill anything that has a security guards badge.Gameplay:The aim of the game is to make it through five night shifts.To stay alive, you flick between different security camera feeds in the hope of catching the killer robots on the prowl. You need to manually shut the two doors to your room to keep them at bay, but you can't leave those doors shut forever...The doors that save you from time to time drain power from the restaurant's generator. And when the power goes out, so do the lights...Five Nights at Freddy's doesn't have half of the production values as other games in the horror genre do, but it's just those eyeballs in the dark...  Big, murderous, googly eyes....Scott Cawthon really targets those childhood fears of your old worn out dolls coming to life to eat your face.Audio:It's no wonder there have been millions of Let's Plays of this game already, because it's loaded with jump scares and unsettling audio such as the pirate fox singing, Freddy laughing at your attempts to save yourself and Chica clattering around in the kitchen.You're in a permanent state of tension, because you can't keep an eye on everything at once and you inevitably become more paranoid with the eerie sounds playing in the back ground.Of course, copping a jump scare means it's already too late - you're dead. So it's all the tension in trying to avoid the ever looming death that makes this game effective in its tactics.Graphics:The visuals are not as polished as the audio, but what do you expect from one man?They serve their purpose, and give a semi cartoon look to the Animatronics.Final verdict:It's clever how managing that one resource - your electricity level - has been made so stressful. It's a constant balancing act, juggling your use of the cameras, the lights in the hallways, and the security doors ... as you watch the power drain and the clock tick to the safety of 6am... you're not always sure you're going to make it. And each shift only gets harder as the animatronics become more active.If you like spooky scares, this might be for you.Score:9/10"

You were stupid enough to keep coming back to work every night. You deserve their wrath.Game doesn't get too hard until maybe night 3-4. I would of been on night 6 if Chica will stop DICKING OUTSIDE MY DOOR AND LET ME FINISH THE GAME!Anyway, good game, fun, wasn't sure if I would enjoy it, but I did.The Cons:No options menu. I am cool with no pause button, but come on.. sometimes I wanna play while on voicechat and I would like to be able to turn the game down just a tiny bit so I can hear my friends easier."

,Recommended,319510,14521579,"Posted: 17 February, 2015",all,Snort Cannon,Five Nights at Freddy's is the horror game thats so popular right now you cant go to youtube without hearing about it but will you want to jump on the band wagon ? In Five Nights at Freddy's our goal is simple. We are the security guard at Freddy Fazbears pizza and the goal is to watch over 4 animatronics while trying to stay alive until 6 AM before the animatronics kill you. So how is this game ? This is actually a really fun game and its quite challenging too. The game is a very simple game you sit a room and watch over cameras to see if the animatronics arent near you. If they do get close you have a set of doors to close until they go away but theres a catch. The place is a run down dump and has very limited funds. So to save money the place runs on limited power. The power runs out when you use the cameras the lights and the doors. If you run out of power and youre near 6 AM you can win because it gives you time to get to 6 AM. The game is also really nerve racking and its quite intense because the nights do get harder and the animatronics move way faster so youre reflexes need to be on par to win this game. There are a couple negatives. The game can get boring fast because nothing reallly changes up as nights go on. The game is also pretty difficult. So be ready to repeat nights over and over again. Overall Five Nights at Freddy's is a very fun horror game and is definetly worth the asking price. I give Five Nights at Freddy's a 8/10

I know this is one of, if not, the most successful indie franchise of all time, and you're probably saying""Erghmahgawd, another hater! Bad review!"". But I got solid reasons to hate it.First of all, I want to clear up that FNAF 1 isn't a bad game.I must recognice it was a pretty good game, and pretty original too. But, my reason to hate FNaF, doesn't come from the game. But rather the whole series.Why?Because in less than one year, Scott Cawthon released (at least)4 GAMES, without actually improving the gameplay, and overexploiting it. What do I mean? That this is just a mold of every single FNaF game ever released. Yeah, FNaF 2 had no doors. FNaF 3 had traps for the only actual enemy, but, do you see a gameplay alteration? Do you see an actual improvement between FNaF 1 and 4? No, you don't. You see Scott basically altering the MECHANICS of the game, but NOT improving the game. He said FNaF 3 would be the last game of thetriologyfranchise. But, a month after that, we see FNaF 4 up on the steam store! Why? Because his fanbase is not only mostly consisted of kids that aren't used to the point 'n click genre, but because he knows that if he just adds the word ""Freddy"" on one of his games, the sales of it will rise up, mostly because people will think they're going to play something new. And it could easily be a simulator of Freddy taking a dump over a computer. But, where's the FNaF on it? On the Freddy sprite.As nonsensical as it sounds, it's right. FNaF 3 is basically a game that could EASILY be deleted of the franchise, and yet NO timeline-related issues would occur! Because the lore itself isn't even present in the game. Whenever you're buying FNaF 2, 3 or 4, you're just buying this game I'm reviewing right now, only that it has altered game mechanics.""B-But, it's a whole new game! It has minigames!""you may say. Yes. It does have minigames. But does it alter the story of 5 murderous robots that are trying to kill you? Nope. It's an add in. A filler. A way to fill the game, so it feels new.Scott is just taking the same game over and over again, editing it a little bit, altering the way the characters look and behave, and replacing the game system over and over again. First it's a tablet and 2 doors. Then it's a light, a mask, and a tablet. Then a reset system button, with the ghosts of the past characters. And now? Yet another new concept. Don't get yourself fooled. If you're playing the game for the story, it would be better to watch a gameplay rather than spending your money on a carbon copy of a past game. Simple as that. Scott is taking your money, and he's releasing games faster and faster, because each time he says ""Five nights at freddy's"", lots of little kids that haven't ever played a point 'n click get their wallets ready to buy the exact same game again, only that with a different mechanic. Just like Toy Story 2 and 3.Both blockbuster movies. Both go the same way. Both end the same way.It starts with a large scale action sequence, that is later revealed to be an exageration of a game being played by other characters.It introduces ideas and pictues reflecting change and ultimately the idea that toys don't last forever.Unwanted toys are then gathered, and a mistake is made where one or more of the main characters ends up where the unwanted toys are supposed to be.Toys get placed in a new enviroment, meeting new characters, where one of them is a plumpy and seemingly kind toy with a deep voice and a cane. This toy is later revealed to be the antagonist, filled by the traumatization of feeling unloved and unwanted, taking their anger on other characters.This toy promises the main characters that where they landed on is paradise, and they will be loved for generations and taken care of.A factory resetted Buzz Lightyear locks up one or more of the protagonists,An overexposed flashback sequence happens where they show the antagonist and toys new to the series being left out  on the countryside by their previous owners.The protagonists end up on a large scale industrial contraption where the antagonist is disposed of in the process.The antagonist is then ultimately left to an owner with no care for their well being whatsoever.And it still made TONS of cash.Same with FNaF."
,Recommended,319510,27773144,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,ManyNekoZ,"A very simple and straight forward game. You play as a security guard, working the night-shift at a ""Chuck-e-cheese"" style establishment. Every night the animatrionics come alive and attempt to stuff your soft, squishy body into an animatrionic suit, but you can't let that happen. So you use the tools available to you to prevent this from happening. You have doors on either side of you, which you may close them or shine a light to reveal any unwanted guests. However you have limited power to do so. So your objective is to survive 6 hours of the night while conserving power and resisting the urge to soil yourself. Have fun.The only downside to this game is that it feels way too over-hyped. The jumpscares are not really all that terrifying, more annoying than anything else. For what it's worth, the only real thing these games have going for them is the lore behind them. You get a deeper experience from learning about it through blogs and videos. Check out the games if you're bored, or if you want to find all the hidden secrets. Good luck.Buy it, play it, find Golden Freddy."

In fact, I did enjoy this when it wasn't popular, like a cool little gem for five bucks on steam. But the popularity of Pewdiepie made this game popular, made the sequels. Another thing, I found a parody on gamejolt called  One Night at Flumpty's more fun than any of these games, ONAF was just more cartoony, and wasn't trying to be scary even though it was, and the creator didn't let the fans take over, he made two games and that was it. His fans are begging him to make a new one, and we'll probably get another ONAF, but he's taking his time, not creating a sloppy mess and than slapping his title on it just to make a quick buck. Overall, I'd reccomend to not get any FNAF game because Scott will probably take the money and run away."

I've watched the videos before playing this game (played the demo first) and i thought it wouldn't be so scary now that i know what it's like. I was dead wrong and i learned why the hard way. Though theses animatronics do scare you, it doesn't give me nightmares. The reason why I almost fall off my chair every time i get a jump scare is because of how sudden it was and i never expect it to hit me.The only downside would have to be is how unforgivingly hard the game gets as you go through each night. Bonnie and Chica get more active, Foxy needs more attention and Freddy teleports in the dark if you dont stare him down enough. It requires a crap load of multitasking which can make you more nervous when something goes wrong.Other then that, I love the game, the scares get me everytime and i get to laugh at myself for jumping (i find myself doing that a lot and so will you), and i think its worth more then $5, which is one hell of a deal.Cant wait for the sequel Scott!"

I do recommend it to some but really, the game hasn't really aged that well since last year. So I'm going to say a bit of yes and no but I will put this as a posittive review.When going in to the game it looks like a simple sit and survive game. But you've got camera and doors and lights which all drain power so you are very limited for what you can do.There are 4 animatronics out to get you: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate. They all want to kill you and you must close the door at the right time for them to stay away from you. If either 4 get to you, game over (with a loud jumpscare which is not scary). There is a secret animatronic named Golden Freddy but he is very rare and when you see him your game will crash and you will be given a Golden Freddy jumpscare.The graphics are, meh, ok at the least.Finally, who should play it? I recommend this game to players who are new to the horror games side of things, or people who are younger than 10! It's not THAT scary guys!So that's my review."

It is not as much horror as it is strategy. yes the jumpscares are extreme, and check your pants the first time Bonnie or Chica pays a visit. A few tips for newcomers- time before ~1-2 am is safe on night one. Sit back and relax- Bonnie is a stalker.-Chica loves to hang out in the party room, and likes to cook. If you hear the banging of pots and pans, chica is in there.-foxy (Animatronic behind the pirate cove) will sprint down the west hall if you go to that camera. If you see the pirate cove empty, close left door IMMEDIATELY.-if you see this dead thing in your office and images flash on the screen, simply pull up the monitor and put it down. Do this quick, for failing to do so will crash your game. The dead thing is golden freddy- golden freddy can be summoned by looking at the west hall corner too much. if the poster that says ""lets party!"" changes to an empty Freddy Fazebear head.-You can hallucinate (Flashy images) anytime in- game. Some lead to jumpscares-Freddy will become dangerous on night 3 onward. he will make a deep laugh as he moves-BONNIE IS A GUY.-Stuff on the walls can change.-if you cannot close a door or turn on a light, Bonnie or chica are in your office. Keep the monitor down for holding out as long as possible.Haters gonna hate.

But once you do, it is pretty fun."
,Recommended,319510,12270109,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,ilikewaffles88,"Five Nights At Freddy's is a scary, fun, affordable game, where closing doors uses electricity. The goal is to survive the night shift at Freddy's Pizza, watching the security cameras with a limited supply of electricity. The only problem is, which you will find out if you listen to the voice message on the phone on your first night, the animatronic animals at Freddy's Pizza like to roam around at night. And when they roam around at night, they eventually see you. When they see you, they don't see you as a person, they see you as an exoskeleton without a costume. And since all exoskeletons have to be covered by costumes at Freddy's, they will automatically stuff you into a costume for an animatronic animal. This wouldn't be a problem, but the costumes for animatronic animals have wires inside, and would kill people if they went inside them. So, the former security guy wanted to call you and inform you about that.When you play the game on the first night, it looks easy. But, don't be fooled. The game gets harder as the nights progress. The first night is easy. you just check the security cams every once and a while, and if you see any of the animatronic animals on the east or west halls, close the right or left doors, so the robots can't get in. There are also two blind spots on your cameras for the east and west halls. if you turn the lights on, you will be able to see in these blind spots. Try to turn the lights on, close the doors, and check the security cams as little as possible, because all three use up electricity,which you have a very limited amount of. when your not doing anything, 1% of the power goes down every 10 seconds. If your closing one door, 1% of the power goes down every 5 seconds. If your closing 2 doors and checking the security cams, 1% of the power goes down every second. it is VERY important to save electricity, because if you don't, you won't be able to close the doors and check the security cams to protect yourself.So in conclusion, Five Nights At Freddy's is a good game, even though you can't move around. Lots of jump scares, and is a great game to play on the weekend late at night.Edit: I now know that this game could benefit GREATLY from the workshop, and that Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is even better than the first."

I have only bought two of them.  The two I felt worth bothering with.What many of the fanboys, and most of the haters don't seem to understand is that this game series is not what it appears to be.  It's not a jumpscarefest.  The whole point of these games is that the jumpscares (and defeat) are in your hands.  Typical jumpscare games just throw random jumpscares at you to startle you.  Other than FNAF clones (the best of which is Boogeyman) no other horror game gives you the ability to prevent a jumpscare.   This game does quite obviously have them yes, but that isn't what the games are really about.  What makes this series a horror series is the tension of knowing you can prevent the jumpscares, and need to to win.  It isn't the jumpscares that make these games worth playing, it's the dread of failing to prevent them.Do I recommend these games?  Only to people with an IQ high enough to get it.  If you think it's all about the jumpscares then do us all a favor and don't waste your money or anyone's time bashing the series."

Half the fright is the impending doom you can feel.Ones that don't like point and clicks probably won't like this. But I have tons of fun with it. This is my goto game to play during powerouts.

Lack of movement gave a sense of helplessness, and the suspense really messes with your head, though I think the sound during the jump-scare is more annoying than scary, however I'll admit it is startling; thankfully they changed it in the sequels.

It's a bit over-hyped on the Internet and I, like most people, really cannot stand most of the fandom, but if you give it a shot and approach it with an open mind it's actually a decent horror game, with some of the finest story-telling and mystery I've seen."

The gameplay was well done and does exactly what a horror game should do, keep on edge at all times. The little sound effects that you can hear as you play just add to how nervous you get and of course how can we forget the scream to with the jumpscare, all really well put together. I do understand that we got 4 games in a little over a year and granted it may feel a little rushed and maybe a little repetitive but there was more to this than just the game itself. The story was crafted with a cryptic finesse that no other game series has done and the entire horror game community was captivated from the day we all saw it on Youtube to the very end of Five Nights 4. Every clue and secrets hidden in every game and teaser image kept us all guessing and the mystery is what kept me following this game to the end. No game has ever built such an amazing community of amazing therioes and videos and you know what... No other game may ever do that again.

,Recommended,319510,11986403,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,Unamused Cat,"Jump scares. JUMP SCARES. So many of them. This isn't a hardcore horror gamer's game, but it's fun for the simplicity and the almost puzzle-style gameplay that you learn later on. Jump scares are only the basics of horror, and the ambience isn't enough to satisfy someone used to, say, Amnesia and Outlast, but the other mechanics make this pretty fun. The player has to check cameras and doors while carefully watching power reserves and learn how to balance everything, including which freaky animatronic thing to watch at which moment.Graphics are not special and animations are rare, but that's not needed nor is it the point, so it doesn't detract much from the experience. The only issue I have is not being able to run in windowed mode. Pressing ESC also simply exits the game and there are no options to start with.There is a little bit of replayability included as every time you start a night at Freddy's, each of the animatronics act somewhat randomly, so those who really enjoy the gameplay can do it more than once. Most will not feel the need to replay, however.Overall this is well worth the budget price and great for streaming, but horror fanatics probably won't be as scared as the average, unless he/she has a specific fear of childhood toys or Chuck-e-Cheese.8/10Edit: I forgot to mention that it's VERY HARD. Expect failure and enjoy it."

There is so much atmosphere that you completely forget the only payoff is a simple jump scare because you're putting so much concentration into holding onto your limited control of the situation. Every sound you hear could just as easily be nothing as it could be one of the characters moving into another room.My only real complaints are minor technical issues such as a complete lack of options (not even basic volume controls), and that a game about moving your mouse to the far left and right sides of your monitor doesn't constrain the cursor to the game window, meaning if you have multiple monitors you can easily inadvertently click outside of the game and force it to minimize (which in my case, usually means crashing it as well.)FULL REVIEW"

,Recommended,319510,12209793,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Loyal Lackey,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror game in which you play the role of the security guard, Mike, and try to survive until your next shift against 4 (or 5?) bloodthirsty animatronics.GameplayThe gameplay is amazing, especially if you're a fan of the horror genre. There are 4 (or 5) animatronics in total: Bonnie the bunny, Chicathe chicken(not a duck), Foxy, Freddy Fazbear, and Golden Freddy (who is kind of an easter egg) and they're ALL out to kill you. You have a limited amount of power every night since the manager is a cheap♥♥♥♥♥ so you've gotta conserve your power (closing the doors that keep the animatronics out, using the lights in the hallway that illuminate your blind spots on the cameras, and using the cameras all take power). It's hard to predict what the animatronics' next moves are gonna be sometimes, which makes the game that much more terrifying.One thing I didn't like was how the animatronics all have set paths. Bonnie and Foxy always come down the west hallway while Chica and Freddy come down the east. It's still scary when they poke their ugly heads out from around their hidey holes, but I hope it's more random in FNAF 2. The game does get really hard on the later nights though (and alsoextremelyrepetitive), and that takes away from the replayability value to me.SoundThe sound in this game is probably what immersed me the most, so I've got no complaints here (other than the fact that they all seem to do a slightly different variation of the same scream when they pop up at you). From Night 4 onwards, Freddy is on the move and you'll know it. If you hear Freddy's signature laugh, close the door to the east hallway and CHECK THE CAMERAS. If you hear footsteps, force your hand to stop shaking for 2 seconds and close the doors to the west hallway. Foxy likes to chill in Pirate's Cove most of the time, but when you get on his nerves he hauls♥♥♥♥♥down the hallway. There's a lot more freaky sounds that the animatronics can make in the game that ALL add up to make beautiful ambience of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. If you hear Freddy's song... bye-bye.ConclusionThe gameplay, sounds and music all together create an amazing atmosphere for a horror game that, depite its flaws, is sure to scare anybody at least once (unless you're extremely lucky and happen to glide through the game without dying once, but that's nearly impossible). If you're interested in this game at all, it's definitely worth the 5 bucks to at least try it out. If you're a horror fan, then I don't know why you wouldn't already have this and be eagerly awaiting the sequel by now. Have fun playing it, and sweet dreams!"

It's unfortunate that the fandom of this series drives allot of people away from these games, their not as bad as everyone thinks they are, yeah they mainly rely on jump scares but hey sometimes it works lol but anyway if you take that out of consideration the atmosphere, the eeriness of it, and of course... the lore. My god i haven't never been so interested in the lore of FNAF, The murders, the killer, the stuffing of the dead kids in the animatronic's  the reason behind it, and theory's galore even if you don't play the games you can still find stuff about it it's extremely interesting and keeps you thinking and on your toes looking for every single reference in the game to try and connect it to the lore. Anyway sorry for getting off track for a bit. The game its self is a fairly simple game that rely's on jumps scare's allot but like i said before the atmosphere and the ambient's of it does make it kinda scary. If you're interested in playing this games either for the rich lore about serial killers and the supernatural or just for a good cheap scare. These games are really fun to play especially at night with the lights off and your headphones turned up, You'd be in for a good fright if you do that haha.~ Discord"

Five Night's at Freddy's is an amazingly original game that is mainly psychological horror and has you frantically pressing buttons and constantly worrying that you can't see 'so-and-so' and if they are right outside your door. The game is also reasonably priced for the amount of content you get with the game, however be warned. This game can get intense. It is also greatly aided by an amazingly deep story that no-one can really claim to know the truth about, which you can choose to completely ignore if you want to.Positive+ Amazing Story+ Terrifying+ Very OriginalConclusionA greatly original game created by an amazingly clever developer that has filled it with hidden stories and easter eggs, things that have a 10,000 to 1 chance just help make this a very enjoyable, if stressfull game."

76561198127258241,Recommended,319510,12061156,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,「The Cosmic Hobo」,"Given the rise of popularity of this smash indie-horror title, I felt I should do a review.Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game where you play as Micheal Schmidt, a security guard who as him, basically try to survive against four animatronic animals trying to kill you. The catch? You don't move and you have a limited power supply, meaning you have to be conservative with your power or else Freddy the Fazbear, the titular character of the game, will come and murder you.Five Nights at Freddy's pits you in a broken down (I call it that because of how decrepid a lot of things look in the game) pizzareia that hosts a number of animatronic anthromorphic animals (like you would see in Chuck E. Cheese), most infamously Foxy the Pirate himself. Each animatronic has their own A.I., meaning that they do NOT act similar and will try to use their own methods of killing you. You, the player are left to utilize a set cameras set around the place, a set of doors that go down in an emergency (when Bonnie or Chica are right outside your door) and door lights for when you have NO idea where they are on the cams.As the nights progress, the animatronics will become more and more aggressive, with more frequent attacks, and sometimes they will linger outside your doors for longer periods of time. Though it's on Night 4 when Freddy himself becomes a bit of an issue himself, as he can litterally sneak in while you check the cams and gives absolutely NO warning when he's in the room, making his jumpscare all the more startling. Though for newcomers for the game, there is a sort of guide in-game to help, through a series of phone calls left over by the previous security guard.These phone calls give you helpful hints as to being able to survive the nights (such as checking on Pirate Cove periodically, making use of door lights and playing dead if the power goes out). While Five Nights at Freddy's isn't exactly scary, it's more nerving wracking and paranoia-building, making you panic when Bonnie, Chica or even Freddy can't be found on the cameras, and that actually makes the game arguably even more terrifying.Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a good horror game that brought new ideas to the table and made them work, though the game is a bit short.Five Nights at Freddy's gets 7/10"

I don't hink I've ever jumped from fright quite so much in a game. Quite a lot of swearing on my part when they get me!The game it's self is quite simple. Work the night shift and monitor cctv cameras. Simple. However evertime you use the cameras it draws down power and there is only so much power to last the shift. Closing the control room doors also uses powetr. So it is very much a case of balancing monitoring cameras and the corridor outside the control room. The tension really builds as the power drains and the ""creatures"" move around. Once they get to you it's game over.I have not got past night 2 yet.

Simple indie horror where your a watcman, who has OCD and constantly needs to turn on hallway lights to make sure the evil animatronics wont come at you........As simple as it is this game scares me more and more often than most of whats out......Replace the badguys in OUTLAST with these furry A$$holes, and i'd still scream!!"

So I thought I would make one for the others.Basically this series is overshadowed by one reason. Its Fanbase. MY FELLOW PEOPLE (Yes I actually like this game call me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I dont care) YOU ARE THE TRASHIEST LITTLE SONS OF GUNS EVER. What everyone thinks is that Bad Fanbase=Bad Game but its really Bad Fanbase=Nothing, a game in my philosophy isnot affected by its fanbase so if the game has a bad fanbase the game can still be good. (FANBASES DO NOT AFFECT A GAMES QUALITY).REAL REVIEW:FNAF is one of my favorite horror games (as I said I dont care about what you say about me) it is overshadowed by other horror games mainly because some may argue that it is not as scary as other horror games (which is probably why it attracts 9 year old scunts) but that does not mean it shall be bashed. The trash evil side of the fanbase has covered the game is warning signs causing other people to not go near it and actually try it. PLAY IT, it will not be as much harm as you think it will so even if you dont have it find a somebody (family, friend etc) who does and just PLAY IT.

Let me start off with my list of positives:-Uh... I guess my heart rate did raise a little. So that's something, I guess.Alright, with that out of the way, the negatives. Keep in mind that I'm a bit of a tech snob.:-Locked at 720p. WHYYYYYY?-Upon trying to window the game, it crashed. Holy hell, this is a technically bad game.-No video options whatsoever. Have an issue with screen tearing? Sorry! Have a 1080p screen? Outta luck!-Most of the graphics are prerendered. You can tell when you turn in your office and the monitors on the desk warp. This would be acceptable in the N64 era, but not now. I mean, just look at Final Fantasy 7. That aged well graphically, right?-Even with the prerendering, the game is uuuuuuugly. I mean, I know a single dude made this game, and I'm not expecting Crysis level graphics, but still, the asthetics are butt ugly as well. Super Mario 64 is a more visually pleasing game than this, and it came out in '96. As an aside here, have you seen the trailer for the newest FNAF? It still looks like it was put together by a middle schooler in a video editing class. You have all that money and you can't make a good looking trailer? Sheesh!-Minimal gameplay. It doesn't really feel like I'm in control. I know that's kind of the point, but still, if I wanted not to be in control, I wouldn't be playing a video game. Night Trap, back on the Sega CD, had an almost identical gameplay gimmick, but was lambasted for it. Why does this game get a free pass?-Little story. One thing I always hear when people sing this franchise's praises is that the story is fantastic... I'm not seeing it. It's not really touched upon in game, other than one of the robots bit a kid.-JUMPSCARES. ARE. GARBAGE.-The motivations for the game don't make any sense. Why does someone have to be there to watch the robots? Why is the power grid so crappy that you can't keep a door closed? Why don't they frigging replace the killer robots?-The escape key instantly closes the game without warning. And that's when I stopped.In conclusion, I don't think this is a very well put together game."

It's like a book. I've delved into many theories and facts to find out more of the secrets that lie within this universe. As a horror fanatic, nothing strikes me more then a hook to reel you in. And animatronics possesed by children who were murdered by mysterious dude who possess a cuddly bunny suit is amazing.What I don't like: The game. Seriously. If I had to recomend any of the games, it would be this one. I do like it, but I'm not recomending it for reasons that I will explain shortly. All three games are the same with very little changes to warrant being a ""new game"". Are they fun? to an extent. The first being the most fun because I like the rundown look of the restearuant. It brings back childhood memories. If you already own one of the games, you're set. If you don't own any, don't buy. Watch a YouTuber play it, because seriously, every one and their mother's have played it. You'll get the same amount of entertainment, if not slightly more. If you're like me and are infatuated by the story, then just look through wiki articles and fan theories. If you honestly feel that you can find more for yourself, then by all means, I won't stop you from buying, but come on, you really don't need to at this point. It's a point and click jumpscare simulator."

Five Nights at Freddy's is a rather mediocre game when you look into it. First, the graphics. If your computer runs on a toaster, then this is the game for you. Not only do the graphics require little to nothing to process, on account that they're JPEG'd to the max, but they give off a good 3D illusion. However, this can easily be spotted, and the illusion will be ruined within minutes. Next, the story. It is essentially Slenderman, but to a somewhat greater extent. Its about five kids getting kidnapped and stuffed into suits, similar to Slenderman where kids get kidnapped and killed. The suits are possesed by the kids, and those kids apparently want to kill you. Way to go the borrowed box, Scott. The gameplay is rather boring. All you do is sit still and flick off the lights every now and then, same goes for the doors. The fanbase... well, lets just say the bronies and Slenderman fans had a baby and it had extreme cancer."

It provides creepy antagonists and an amazing sound board. Like animotronic robots at your favourite child fast food resturaunt? Play this game and you will want to bring a bat with you every single time you go. Especialy if you work there.The story is that the robots are given a ""free roaming mode"" at night and you have to make sure they dont get out of ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"" A resturaunt dear to childrens hearts. When you get the job and start your work you will notice that they are moving about the resuraunt. Being the cautious person you are, you stay in your booth waiting to get out and earn your $4 per hour. On your first/second/third/fourth night you will be called by the previous night guard. He tells you a bit and say to conserve your power, this is an important feature. After that you are free to try and survive the nights as you wish.I Strongly recomend this to the people that love scary movies/games, this will make you crap yourself.""Stay the f*** away!"" ~Markiplier"

Welcome To Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria a place for children and adults alike!It is so beautiful at day time!But you're not here at day time...Your here at night to work 5 nights to look after the animatronicsWARNING: FREDDY FAZBEARS WILL NOT PAY COMPENSATION FOR INURY,DISMANTLEMENT AND DEATH...So then i hope you enjoyed my custom advert ;DSo then lets talk about this creepy game!It is very basic when you first start. Check the cameras check lights close doors and loose power then die!So is quite awesome!This game starts off kind of easy then through the 5 nights it gets much harder.Also when you complete all 5 nights you can unlock night 6 which is much harder then night 5!Then you have the custom night and the scary 20/20/20/20 mode which took me god knows how many times to win O.OSo then lets talk about all the animatronics!Freddy Fazbear is the lead Animatronic in the group. He becomes more active after night 3 as in the first 2 nights he does not move.When he does move he is very hard to spot. Just look out for two white dots in the cameras...that will be him...When he sneaks into your office unlike the other Animatronics he will wait to kill you.You can tell as when he walks he makes an odd chuckle and when he is in your room he chuckles alot!Then when he does kill you he will launch from your side with black eyes and he looks like he is trying to take a chunk out of you!Bonnie is the first one to move he is quite a creepy little crackhead!In one shot you can see him staring into the camera with pure black eyes!He comes from you're left side and there is not much to say about him.Chica is simular to Bonnie except she comes you're right side!Then we have Foxy the pirate who is out of service.His attack is he runs out you so you have to quickly close the door!Then he was the odd Golden Freddy...Now to tell the truth i haven't encouted Golden Freddy...yet...I have in the 2nd game which i will review soon Though.So then this game is a very good horror game...10/10!I will do FNAF 2 review soon guys!THANX FOR READING GUYS BYE!"

As the player, you can have fun watching him or his friends in all of the different rooms through the security cameras. Tip: To get a happy ending in each level, you must unite with Freddy or one of his friends. Who will you unite with first? The best part is that you get to play together for five nights in a row. Highly recommended to boost your mood."

Foxxy is already peeking out of his cove. Barely makes it to through the night with 2% because Bonnie kept appearing at my door.Night 3 - Oddly, only Chicka is moving and stays in the kitchen for an hour. Foxxy is peeking out of cove. Around 2 AM, everyone's gone and Foxxy is standing outside of cove. Crapping myself when Chika and Bonnie are 1 room away from the doors. Freddy keeps laughing like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Makes it through with 15% power.Night 4 - Everyone's gone at the start, and Chika keeps disabling my cameras. Bonnie doesn't come to the door, but stands in hallway half the time. Foxxy is peering out. I'm managing well with 30% power at 4 AM. Goes to view hallway and suddenly Foxxy is running through it. Tries to shut the door but Foxxy comes in. *DEAD*This game is freaken genius. Despite that it's obviously a jump scare game from start to finish ... it's an excellent game entirely. The way you have to WATCH the monitors in order to save your hide, and that one of the bots (aka Foxxy) can break the rules at any time, is pretty tense. I give props to the developer, since his last game got heavily criticized for all the critters being robo-like.

The aim of the game to beat the night with being killed by one the five hungry animatronics. If you have played Erie, Amnesia, Outlast, or Slender... then prepare for a challenge. I myself enjoyed this game quite a bit. The graphics do have a bit of a 2D render thing going on with them which is slightly dissapointing but the game itself and the sheer challenge and detail of it all is amazing. The difficulty is pretty hard past night three but once you get the hang of it all... you'll prabably still keep failing. I have infact beaten the game and beaten the extra night. It is gruelling and painful to finish but is also satisfying to complete. I highly reccomend this game for any completionists or horror fans.

It doesn't require much pc power at all and it's a fairly inexpensive game, so it's a game that you can just decide to play on a whim right then and there. It's a very ""backseat driver"" type game in which even though one person has the mouse, everyone can keep an eye on the screen and help out with the game. Even though it wouldn't be considered fast-paced, it keeps you a bit paranoid for each 12am-6am shift you work (which is about 9 minutes actual time).The game is a great concept and was made very well. Even though the concept of the game is a bit out there (free roaming animatronics and doors that take up power to keep shut? right) it's an easy to ignore as it taps into a silly fear that I'm sure many people have had of ""what if these things came to life at night"" that we keep right next to our fear of clowns. I can't wait to see any DLC that might come out for it (I'm hoping for new locations and characters)!"

Makes me somewhat suspicious of the forums given so many silly 'I had a heart attack while playing' type random posts.  The graphics are decades old, so it doesn't even feel realistic.  Had they actually had real footage with people in animatronic costumes doing this, that would definitely be creepy.In any case, it's a great concept, but its more memorizing how to beat the script triggers of the game.  There is very little strategy since stuff is so railed (dont look at this camera on this day or the puppet will activate, check this puppet often or he will attack, etc).  Got to day 2, but died at 4am.  After experiencing the gameplay, I have no desire to even try again.  Would be better if there was more to control, like blocking more doors, maybe protecting your security guard partner who roams around patroling.. just more randomness.  Unfortunately the gameplay and graphics are not enough to keep me interested in memorizing the list of trigger orders to win."

I love how Foxy gives you a reason to use the cams at later nights when you find you don't have to look for the others and can see them in the door lights when they get closer enough.The only thing I never likes was the fact that you can't move around the pizzaria, but I guess it does add to the feeling of helplessness...

Also there really isnt much for you to do. You spend 90% of the time waiting for the game to do something. Now I get where that is suppose to build suspense but for me it just made me bored and decide to play something else. I think the other factor is what you find scary.

I didn't go into this game expecting much but I still recieved less than what I expected. Poorly made button controls for the door lights were irritating more than anything and the game is honestly incredibly boring. Did I jump when chicka came barreling in the door to kill me, yes, but not in the sense that it was scary. Rather in the sense that oh god something is coming towards my face. In no way shape or form will this game give me nightmares, make it difficult to sleep or make me question my life decision when sitting in an office late at night. Over all, a poorly implimented game that could have been a lot better, with some added atmosphere."

The game that started such a huge trend.To start i would like to say im am not a fan of Mr Cawthon's *recent* work as i believe he is milking the franchise far too much. But oh well, further on we go with the reviewSo what is it?You play as a security guard (i guess) who has to keep watch over Freddy Fazbear's Pizza place. now of course no horror game would be the same without moving things that shouldn't move and camera controlls.The whole idea of the game is to make it through 5 (2 extra) nights right through from 0:00am to 6:00am (please be aware that the clock goes up per hour and does not show how many more minutes you have left.) The increasing difficulty of the nights starts to get repetitive as once you have seen the jump scares, you become immune to such a scare again.What makes it different from other horror game?To be entirely honest with you, not much. There are plenty of horror games out there that have the same feel to them. Of course out new animatronic friends are unique and have never been seen in any other game before, i feel like the effect they have on you is a wear and tear kind of feel which links to what i said earlier, once you have already seen it many times, you become immune to such scares.Is it worth its current price tag?Good question! Yes and no. Yes the game has a decent enough amount of content to keep you going for good set of hours, but the game does lower in price a lot and once there is a sale you can expect to see the game go for £1.99 or $3 so i would hold out.Pros:Scary, whilst it lasts.Will keep you going for a while.Good idea behind it and the lore is.... Well, lets just say it keeps the series aliveCons:Seems like he spent perhaps a week making this gameGets boring after about 2-3 hoursJumpscares become less ""scare"" and more ""oh its him again""The developer is badly milking it with these gamesEven with the pros of this game, i am afraid i simply can't recommend this game.If it goes on sale, well its your money so buy it if you wish but i would prefer to hold out.Its a no from me"

,Not Recommended,319510,12427455,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,a very fine polish surname,"First Night strategy:At 1 A.M, close the left door. I like to flash my monitor on Pirate Cove around 4 A.M, only once though. At 5 A.M with about 3% left, open the left door. This worked for me.Shock horror is very subjective. However, using a jumpscare to shock someone is a very cheap tactic, and you don't get shocked because it's scary. You get shocked because it's an instinctive reaction. It's really only scary the first couple of times. While I know horror, as well as humor and such, are subjective, I think most can agree that a jumpscare is more of a way to get you screaming rather than a way to get you sleeping with a baseball bat at your side because you are having night terrors.I don't like to factor in communities as something to count in my reviews, because communities are more of a by-product of the game rather than a factor. I also don't like talking about communities with  almost nothing more to say; this community has already been ""reviewed"" by many people. In short though, the FNaF community feels the need to make everything an animatronic, feels the need to roleplay, and feels the need to use logicless arguements to defend the game.Here's avery, veryold ""review"" of the community, copy and pasted word for word:""At the beginning of this year (Janurary 2015), the FNAF Fanbase and fan made material seems to be ""dying"". What I'm trying to say is that since this year, the FNAF Fanbase has been swarmed by people who don't even own the game. When I mean ""people"" I mean preteens who only like the game to either: A.) Fit in B.) Be ""cool"", or C). Markiplier plays it, (I DO own both games, I'm not a hypocrite) and people who make unsupported theories that are merely speculation. The ABC is intentally related. The people who speculate do something like this (Not a real chat here):Me: I keep getting killed by Foxy.MereSpeculation: well, foxy wants to hide with u but u get a heart attack. he doesn't like getting stuffedGoldenBonnie: he screams because his voicebox is broken but he wants ur helpMe: Where in the game do the animatronics attempt to stuff Foxy in a suit?Or:MereSpeculation: ZOMG FNAF IS REALMe: Really?GoldenBonnie: YES GAME THOERY SAID SOPhotoshopper: LOOK AT THIS IMAGE [link]Timeline is this (I don't know the dates):August: FNAF is released (or something)Markiplier plays FNAF, and he gains a boost of subs (;)) (I remember watching him in late-2011, so funny)FNAF gets many new players (including me, happened around November)Some Bronies make FNAF songs. I don't really care.December: Around the time FNAF2 is released.Speculation is flooding forums.Markiplier plays the game.(I get the game, still December)More Bronies use FNAF/2 for their fanfics.OhLook ItsFnaf starts playing.Janurary 2015:The fanbase is falling apart:Most ""theories"" are not logical and mere speculation (There are some good ones, just saying that the majority are just spec.) They also flood forums.poniesponiesponiesponiesponies (Bronies use it FNAF/2 much more)Absurd amount of people named after the animatronics, as well as roleplaying.Tons of hate aimed at Scott for ""milking"" the series (and yet it's OK to milk Pokemon. Poor Scott)I make this discussion.tl;dr? Go back up and read it.I'm not hating on people like Smike, who make FNAF videos, people like Markiplier or OhLook ItsFnaf, who play the game for entertainement, Scott, (ignore the haters! ;) ), or Game Theory, who propose theories (I haven't watched it, but I've heard they're pretty good vids).I'm just DISCUSSING ABOUT (not hating) people who flood forums with speculation, people who roleplay the animatronics and are named after them, and people who write nonlogical, pointless fanfics.tl;dr?

Anyone who knows much about how 'power' actually works will know that the power-usage setup makes no logical sense. In fact, there's no logical sense for you to be there.Instead, this game focuses on what it SHOULD focus on, great gameplay. Just a lowly security guard with a job to do, only to be haunted by animatronics behaving as terrifying as you'd imagine them to be. Each time you're too late, or even just unlucky, you're treated with an oh-so lovely jump scare death. The game knows how to really use jump scares as an advantage, not just a cheap gimic or scare, and the jump scares constantly work so well because they're reserved for your own demise. Most of your time in the game will build up an atmosphere so thick and tense and even stressful, that you can't help but feel that moment of terror whenever you die.Course, when you don't die, you're just treated to a LOT of tense creepyness, constantly wondering if they're gonna jump out yet... or dreading your power running out as 3% is left and your door lights have been jammed. :)All in all, it's a very creepy, atmospheric game with a simple, easy-to-grasp gameplay that actually manages to be enjoyable and stressful at the same time. For the price that it's asking, you seriously cannot ask for anything better, and my personal hope is that this game will allow for this type of gameplay to become more famous, thus allowing other future fantastic games to come about."

However; even though i thought i was going to be good at this game i found other wise, needless to say it made me jump out of my chair and find the nearest nuttella jar in a 50 km area.!!BACKSTORY!! The game is set in somewhere around 1987 - 1995. You are a security guard who works at a restaurant known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria. You have to work there for 5 normal nights in total with the addition of a 6th and 7th night (Nightmare and Custom). The animatronics: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox are going to hunt you down from 12:00 AM until 6:00 AM, this is something about their ""servos"" locking up.!!GAMEPLAY!!You're eternally bound to a security office, you have a camera, doors/door lights and the joys of the front wall of ugly-ness. The aim is to check that camera of yours all the while avoid getting yourself stuffed into a Freddy suit (It kinda hurts).!!PROS!!The game can be full of surprises be it the lore or anything else that you might find exciting in this game *winks*FNAF requires some form of skill in order to be ""Good"" at with self set challenges such as 20/20/20/20 challenge for Night 7 or maybe its a type of permadeath type where if you die, you start over.The jumpscares in the game are a great asset to the game's over all horror feel, after all; you cant have horror without jumpscares ;)!!CONS!!Five Nights at Freddy's can sometimes feel like it falls short in some aspects of gameplay, I mean that by the fact that it feels kind of repetitive when you find and use strategies.Even though I complimented the jumpscares I have to say that they can get a bit bland after you learn the AI patterns or the charaters.!!SUMMARY!!Five Nights at Freddy's is one of the scariest games i've played in a long time, it truely rustled my jimmies. The game does in someway require a healthy level of paranoia accompanied by a high level of observance. If you dont pay enough attention then you will find yourself in a Freddy suit in no time at all. FNAF was a game that took the market by storm and had sold pleasingly in the first month of it's release. I only have one request: Please for the love of God put video/audio settings in the next game. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 HYPE."

,Recommended,319510,16328537,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,Newfzilla,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for eyebrows in the history of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.Five score years ago, A great animatronic, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Eye brow Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Animatronics who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their in-expression.But one hundred years later, the animatronic still has no eyebrows. One hundred years later, the life of the animatronic is still sadly crippled by the lack lack of eyebrows.one hundred years later, the animatronic lives on a lonely island of eyebrowless-ness in the midst of a vast ocean of eyebrows. One hundred years later, the animatronic is still languished in the corners of Eyebrowed society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our Primary location to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of eyebrows, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all animatronics, yes, eyebrowless as well as eyebrowed, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable eye brows"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of eyebrows."" It is obvious today that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as his citizens of eyebrowless-ness are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has given the Eyebrowless Animatronics a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient eyebrows.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient eyebrows in the great vaults of opportunity of this Pizza chain. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the eyebrows of freedom and the security of eyebrows.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind Freddy Fazbear's Pizza of the fierce urgency of Eyebrows. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of eyebrowless-ness. Now is the time to make real the promises of eyebrows. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of eyebrowless-ness to the sunlit path of eyebrows. Now is the time to lift our Pizza chain from the quicksands of eyebrow injustice to the solid rock of facial expression. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of Scott's children.It would be fatal for the Pizza chain to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the eyebrowless animatronic's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of eyebrows. Nineteen-Ninty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the eyebrowless needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the resteraunt returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza until the Eyebrowless is granted his eyebrows. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our pizza chain until the bright day of eyebrows emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of eyebrows: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for eyebrows by drinking from the cup of eyebrows and facial hair. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with eyebrow force.The marvelous new eyebrow  which has engulfed the eyebrowless community must not lead us to a distrust of all eyebrowed animatronics, for many of our eyebrowed brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their eyebrowedness is inextricably bound to our eyebrowless-nessWe cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always have eyebrows.We cannot turn back.There are those who are asking the devotees of eyebrows, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the animatronic has no eyebrows. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, bare-faced, cannot gain eyebrows.*We cannot be satisfied as long as the animatronic's eyebrows are missing. We can never be satisfied as long as our brothers are stripped of their eyebrows.* We cannot be satisfied as long as an Animatronic in Utah cannot look normal and an animatronic in New York believes he is nothing without eyebrows. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until we have eyebrows.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from the assemly line. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for eyebrows left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds the eyebrowed. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.Let us not wallow in the valley of eyebrowless-ness, I say to you today, my friends.And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.I have a dream that one day Scott will give me eyebrows.I have a dream that one day all my counterparts around the nation shall have eyebrows.I have a dream that one day even the state of Utah, all bunny animatronics will be able to emote properly.I have a dream that my friends and I can sing and dance together on stage, all able to emote and look proper in the rights of eyebrows.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious eyebrowed animatronics, with its Lead Singer having his lips dripping with the words of ""eyebrows"" and ""eyebrowless filth"" -- one day right there in Alabama little eyebrowless animatronics will be able to join hands with little eyebrowed animatronics as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day every resteraunt shall be exalted, and every show stage shall be made low, the dirty floors shall be made clean, and the pirate's cove shall be made fixed and active; ""and the glory of Scott Cawthon shall be revealed and all animatronics shall see it together.""This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of eyebrowless-ness. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our resteraunt into a beautiful symphony of eyebrows. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to sing together, to struggle together, to become obsolete together, to stand up for eyebrows together, knowing that we will have eyebrows one day.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of Scott's children will be able to sing with new meaning:My eyebrows 'tis of thee, sweet hairs of liberty , of thee I sing.Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,From every sister location, let eyebrows ring.And if Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is to be a great resteraunt, this must become true.And so let eyebrows ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.Let eyebrows ring from the mighty show stage.(Ran out of characters.)"

At the end I saw this gorgeous staff member in the souvenir shop. She was dressed like it's 1888 (yeah, Jack the Ripper era) and had this scary-stylish make-up on her pretty face. So, I asked her if I may have a picture taken of both of us. She said 'yes' and someone from her team took a picture.If you are the pretty staff member and reading this....message me, please!Did you know there were buildings on the London Bridge once upon a time?

It is an extremely scary game.Audio- The sound in this game is the most terrifying. You will hear things that you will never forget*Unique(For the time)- This is a unique game when you compare it alone. It's not free roam and sparked a generation*Custom Nights- This was a genius idea from Scott, and I love itCons------*Not Replayable after being beat- After you beat this game there is really no point to come back to it after the custom nights.*Predictable- This game can be beaten pretty fast, because of how predictable the animatronics are! I feel on it's own though the animatronics are fine.Like I said it's hard reviewing this game, but I recommend it! It's nice to see what started the FNAF series with a simple, but scary game!"

All to keep you company is a loud♥♥♥♥♥desk fan and your tablet screen, which doesn't even have iplayer or anything, just feeds from the various cameras in the rooms of this diner/murderhouse.You just have to make sure all the animatronics are in their proper places (ha) whilst balancing your power so your lights/doors don't go out/open, and when that does, you're pretty much screwed. No lives here, no second chances, it's all insta-kill.There ain't no pause function, so if you hit escape like the little ♥♥♥♥♥ you are the game will just close.The game is terrifying in its general feeling of dread, and reserves its inevitable jump scares for when you haven't bothered doing your job and just turtle out in the office, wasting your power.A great game, terrifying yet highly effective.

And instead of having all of Disney's power and money to shut down any attempted Electric Parade uprisings posthaste, you're working at a second-rate Chuck E. Cheese called Freddy Fazbear's that has just enough electrical power to keep the desklight and the security cameras running between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m.An extremely difficult job at that. AND NOW THEY ARE PLANNING TO MAKE A 3RD ONE!? WHAT. First of all, FNAF the first one, Is just for the scare... then the second one they are starting to develop a bit of a story line. Now with the third one you have to pay attention to what you see. Easter eggs that lead to incredible creepy pasta theories. Buy the game if you're into jumping out of you're chair and swearing at the computer screen for a good 5 - 10 minutes.Good Luck ! 8/10"

I hope there will be more books, future games and the movie coming soon. This is my favorite set of horror game along side Resident Evil 7 Biohazard.

76561198110900433,Recommended,319510,13259433,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,Mite,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror game, where the horror doesn't come mainly from the scary-looking things. No, it's your mind that's making the game gradually scarier for every night you complete, as the difficulty keeps rising and you'll be more likely to receive a jumpscare with a loud scream. Yup, the game over here is a loud screamer nobody likes.You may think now that screamers make a bad horror game, but you should definitively think again here: this is one of the most true horror games out there, as it's actually a proper game instead of just walking around. You'll need to focus on many things at the same time: forget one, and you'll be screwed. It's like those tactical games many gamers appreciate, expect the fact that it's single player.Overall, I'd rate this one high, as it's a horror game with very good gameplay. Also, many horror games keep you awake at night or make you feel scared even after playing it, but Five Nights at Freddy's is only scary when you're playing it, which I find a good thing. However, I've heard many tougher horror gamers (I'm a little scaredy cat) getting nightmares, so you'll probably want to try it out yourself."

This game is fantastic, and the best in the franchise.In FNaF, you must survive until 6AM for 5 nights, and I beleive one or two bonus nights. There are four animatronics: Bonnie, Freddy, Chica, and Foxy. Each character is unique. Bonnie sticks to a certain ""pathway"", same with Chica. Freddy sticks to a certain movement pattern, from night 3 and on. And he is VERY hidden from the cammeras. Also, running out of power will result in Freddy killing you. Foxy comes out of his cove when you don't check the cammeras enough. The game is shrouded with mystrey and lore, so complex that it would take four games to get half the story out there, (wait, that did happen)...Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a great game, and I really like it.

Lang here to talk about today’s doodle in honor of Akira Yoshizawa. Lang is considered one of the world’s masters of the art of origami. His design techniques are used by origami artists around the world, and he lectures widely on the connections between origami art, science, mathematics and technology. - Ed.Akira Yoshizawa (1911–2005) is widely regarded as the father of the modern origami art form. Over the course of his life, he created tens of thousands of origami works and pioneered many of the artistic techniques used by modern-day origami artists, most notably the technique of wet-folding, which allowed the use of thick papers and created soft curves, gentle shapes and rounded, organic forms. He also developed a notation for origami that has now been the standard for origami instruction for more than 50 years.Yoshizawa took up Japan's traditional folk art of origami in his 20s, and eventually left his job at a factory to focus full-time on his origami creations. His work came to the attention of the west in 1955, after an exhibition of his works in Amsterdam, and rapidly spread around the world. In his last decades, he received worldwide renown and invitations from all over, culminating in his award in 1983 of the Order of the Rising Sun.I had the great fortune to meet Yoshizawa several times. In 1988, he came to New York to visit The Friends of the Origami Center of America, and spoke at a panel discussion I attended. There, he addressed a wide range of topics: one's mental attitude, the importance of character, of natural qualities, of having one's ""spirit within [the artwork's] folds."" Although he was the consummate artist, his work and approach was infused with the mathematical and geometric underpinnings of origami as well as a deep aesthetic sense:“My origami creations, in accordance with the laws of nature, require the use of geometry, science, and physics. They also encompass religion, philosophy, and biochemistry. Over all, I want you to discover the joy of creation by your own hand…the possibility of creation from paper is infinite.” - Akira YoshizawaWhile there were other Japanese artists who explored their country’s folk art contemporaneously with Yoshizawa, his work inspired the world through a combination of grace, beauty, variety and clarity of presentation. To him, each figure, even if folded from the same basic plan, was a unique object with a unique character.In 1992, I was invited to address the Nippon Origami Association at their annual meeting in Japan, and my hosts arranged for me to meet the great Yoshizawa at his home and studio. When I was ushered into the inner sanctum, Yoshizawa greeted me, grinning, and then proceeded to show me box after box after drawer of the most extraordinarily folded works I had ever seen.When I was first approached by Google to help create a doodle commemorating Yoshizawa’s work, I jumped at the chance. Google set the parameters of the design: the Google logo, of course, but to be folded with origami and then decorated with examples of Yoshizawa's designs.I created examples of two logo styles for Google to choose from: one in a classic origami style and a more three-dimensional version based on pleats. Google liked the pleated version, so I set about designing and folding the rest.Two versions of the Google ""G,"" each folded from a single sheet of paper.To design these (or any letterform in this style), one can take a narrow strip of paper, fold it back and forth to trace the outline of the desired letter, unfold it, mark the creases, then arrange multiple copies of the strip pattern on a larger rectangle. The resulting crease pattern is moderately complex, and it gives a lovely 3-D form when folded, but conceptually, it is quite straightforward.If you’d like to try to create your own origami doodle at home, you can download PDFs of the crease patterns for each of the letters. Print them out and fold on the lines: red=valley fold, blue=mountain.G                          o                          o                         g                           l                          eThe butterflies in the doodle are folded from one of Yoshizawa's earliest, yet most iconic designs. It is deceptive in its simplicity, but can express great subtlety in its shaping and attitude. The combination of simplicity and depth is part of the essence of origami, and is key to Yoshizawa's work and legacy.""Geometry alone is not enough to portray human desires, expressions, aspirations, joys. We need more."" — Akira Yoshizawa, 1988Posted by Robert J.

I'm not lying when I say that the first time I got killed I screamed.  The game is pretty simple: there are some animatronic furries and they want to kill you.  You can only avoid them killing you by closing the door to keep them away.  Keeping the door closed uses energy, which you only have so much of per night.Each animatronic has their own ""personality,"" some behave more aggressively, some are completely unique.  The end result is a game with a very creepy atmosphere and really genuine scares."

I was on the fence before buying the game and I after playing it I feel like I have got a lot more out of games I have paid the same price for. It is unique. It has screamer jump type scares but it doesn't really build suspense or ambience like a good horror should. The entire game consists of you sitting in a room watching security cameras and looking through doorways. After you get the hang of it and beat it once I anticipate you won't pick it up again. Wait for the steam sale on this one if you unsure about the purchase.

Upon starting his first night, Mike is informed by the previous night guard of his duties; check the cameras, make sure everything stays in place, and don't get murdered by the animatronics.  You know, the usual. Mike must now survive five(seven) nights in the building making sure to not run out of power, not get murdered by haunted robots, and get his paycheck.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is fairly basic; easy to learn, hard to master. As your job is to guard the building, you must constantly check the cameras. This will allow you to know where the animatronics are, and keep some of them in place. Along with the camera you have the doors and the lights. The doors are used to keep any and all animatronics at bay should they decide your office would be a nice place to sneak into. The lights will let you know if Bonnie or Chica are outside of their respective doors, so that you may promptly close it right in their faces. Be careful not to forget that this pizzeria has fallen on hard times, and is running on a battery of sorts. All appliances run on this battery, and if you run out of power; it's over.FINAL THOUGHTSFive Nights at Freddy's is the first horror game I've ever played. In my first couple play sessions I was spooked solid. The game left me on edge, paranoid, and gave me a cold feeling inside. Sadly, the feeling didn't last. After a couple more play sessions it wasn't scary, it was frustrating. It had devolved from a horrific version of Night Trap to Night Guard Simulator 2014. I could only get enjoyment out of it by playing it with friends in a skype call. While I still enjoyed the whole look of the game and got quite engrossed the lore behind it all, I couldn't slog my way through all the nights. Five Nights at Freddy's did not leave a lasting impression, but I'll give it props for trying.Also, minimum wage for that? Bull.♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Within the first 5 minutes I knew this was not the game for me. I'm not so sure that I would even really call it a game, as it feels more like something optimized for mobile (which I think they did create). Very minimal game play, infact, the entire thing revolves around looking at security camera footage, opening and closing doors, and cheap scares. I suppose the real ""challanges"" in the game come from conversing your available power, which you use up by doing the two actions you can perform (looking, and using doors). I've heard it gets terribly challenging later on, but I barely want to waste 30 minutes on this game, let alone hours.

Everything about this game is incredible. The lore, the characters, the gameplay itself, it's amazing. My favorite thing about this game is the characters probably. There are a wide variety of them to know and love. My favorite is Freddy fazbear and he always will be. :3  Ok, now that Got that out of the way, I'm going to talk about the gameplay.The gameplay is really creative, unlike any other game I have played. In Five Nights at Freddy's 1, you have to try and defend yourself from the animatronics by checking the cameras, and the door lights, and you must close your doors only when it is needed due to the fact that you need to conserve power. Or else ;)You have to check pirate's cove from time to time, which is VERY important. XDIf you do beat the game, you can then do custom night and change the animatronics' AI levels. the higher the AI, the crazier and more dangerous they will become. There is my review for this game. So i might as well talk about the other four games while im at it. (because reasons)In Five nights at freddy's 2, you have a TON of things to watch after. Now you thought lights, doors, and Foxy was a bad thing, well, get ready for a music box, a long hallway, vents, and many other coincidental things that are perfect for animatronics to crawl through. XD In this game, freddy fazbear's pizzeria reopens its doors. ""The grand reopening.""You must check the vents, and the hall for any of the characters. If they happen to get into the room or the vents, there is a Freddy Fazbear mask sitting there for you to use to ward them off. (This does not work on foxy, the puppet, or BB)To keep the puppet from getting to you, you have to go and wind the music box (rev up that music box m8 XD)It keeps him in the box. Also, there are minigames that help explain some of the lore which is really cool! :DYou also get custom night if you beat this game.In Five nights at Freddy's 3, you are the new security guard that works at Fazbear's fright. Now, the old animatronics that you knew of in the other two games are used for ""spooky props"" for the pizzeria. Now you have only one real one to deal with. Springtrap. In this game, you have to play audio in a room to lure Springtrap there. (I think he is attracted to BB's voice. ;) ) You want to keep him out of the vents, and far away from the office as possible. If he gets into a vent, you can now seal them (which would have been helpful in fnaf 2 at the time) You also have maintenance panel to reboot things such as the ventilation, the audio, and the cameras which WILL go down during gameplay to make it more difficult. Also, hallucinations of Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Puppet, Mangle, and BB can cause you to have to reboot things. When you beat this game, you are greeted with an extras menu, and Nightmare mode. So fun! :3In five nights at freddy's 4, the terror follows you home. You must play as a child and defend yourself against your own ""nightmares."" You have only a flashlight and doors to protect you from the animatronics. You must check the closet in front of you, the bed behind you, and the doors that are on both sides of you. When checking the doors, you must listen for breathing (which can be hard to hear sometimes) If you hear breathing, the worst thing that you can do is to try and shine your light down the hallway. IT WILL NOT WORK. Instead, you will rudely shine it right into the face of Nightmare Bonnie or Nightmare Chica. You must keep things such as fredlings (fredles) off of the bed, or else you will NOT be ready 4 Freddy. XD Now, the closet acts as pirates cove, so once foxy is in there, you will need to keep an eye on him. If you survive the night (song reference) you get to play a minigame, and do something called ""fun with plushtrap"" You need to use the flashlight and try to stop him on the ""X"" which will advance you 2 hours into the next night. When you beat the game, you also  get to see an extras menu, and nightmare mode. :3 There is also a halloween edition for this game that is EPIC. XDOmg so much typing. XD This is the last one i swear. In FNAF world, you get to play as your favorite characters in a really colorful and fast rpg game. I thought it was a really cute setup, even though it got bad reviews. You must find out whats wrong on the flipside, and save the day. there are multiple endings, and many characters and attacks to use. It is really fun. There is an update 2 coming someday! XDSo there is my review on the entire fnaf series. Scott is also working on some kind of a fnaf sister location thing too which I can't wait to see. anyways, Scott, if you are reading this, thank you for everything. You are amazing! :)"

I mean, you've got a bear, a rabbit, a fox, and KFC's bin material chasing after you in a handicapped game of pacman. It's really a simple concept that's good for a while...and that's it. After that, it's just gathering dust in your games library.(Which is exactly what my copy is doing).I don't know if anyone shares my viewpoint on this, but I feel as that I could appreciate it more if Scott Cawthon didn't milk the hell out of the franchise. I mean, remember when Fnaf 2 came out, and you found out there was no doors? He literally removed key game mechanics that defined the series, and chuckled; ""Hey, man, here's a flashlight"". Really?Then comes along Fnaf 3, and there's only ONE leftover furry costume(Which could be a good thing, actually). And then, he throws in hallucinations just to ♥♥♥♥ with us, as if the protagonist was high of his♥♥♥♥♥on blow the whole time.And I'm not even going to comment on the fourth one.Basically, if you've got money to waste, buy it. But if you're like me, and have barley any cash,(You can tell by my name) don't pick this one up. You've got better things to spend it on. Hell, even spend it on a damn microtransaction if you want to; just stay away from this mess."

I would recemend it to other people. I'm gonna say it's not exactly horror. it uses the jumpscare which can be scary/suprising at first but after a couple of times you just get mad. It's not my faverite FNAF game but it's good. I'm gonna be honest and i'm gonna have to give it a 7.5/10.

If you are new (like really new to the game) you can still get jumpscared by it, but as you play too much you might get immune to the jumpscares. Might gave you a panic times if something happens (like random 'It's Me' messages came out, or the door can't be closed).A great way to start a game, and a great way to introduce a new gameplay mechanism in a video game.For you who might already played horror games (or already have a lot experience in horror genres), you might already immune to the jumpscares. So i recommend this game for those who are new to the world of horror game."

But, as time went on, the game lost its sense of fear (pretty quickly, may I add.). The game also became very boring. Checking the cameras became practically useless near the end of the game, the things you end up using most are the doors and the lights. I never really understood the hype and popularity or the games, and it doesnt help that the sequels are even worse than than this one.4/10"

,Not Recommended,319510,11941811,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,Scorcho,"PLEASE NOTE - The game is not bad. It's true to horror games. It makes you feel paranoid and I even looked outside my door in real life a couple of times. It truly plays with your mind at times when you bring up the cameras at the beginning of each night or when the messages left by the night guard ends because you will get messed up images pop up and you get a true feeling a paranoia and you will know everyting at Freddy Fazbear's is out to get you.-------------------------------My issue with this game is the price and the replayability. The quality and length of the game makes it seem like a flash game you would find on IndieDB (which it was before it came onto Steam) or at least free to play game you would find here on Steam. Problem is, it isn't. And at the time where I wrote out this review, this game isn't worth the price. It should be a free to play game if anything.There's very little replayability, and to me even very little is an understatement. There is no Achievements, no Trading Cards, no Unlockables, no Co-Op, or anything else that is worth you going back to play this after you complete it. Sure, after you beat the game you get a fun little custom night where you can modify the difficulty of each animatronic robot that is out to get you, but there is no completion bonus for that or any reward.I'm not saying you shouldn't get this game, if you are a fan of games that pull off jumpscares, make you feel paranoid and make you feel suspense, or even just like them for that matter, get this damn game. I'm just saying don't buy it, that's all."

The thing is that FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) is a game that exploded because of youtube, nothing more and nothing less. I have to confess that I WAS a FNAF fan because of the deep story, but when you put that aside and judge the game for what it is...then we have a problem.STORY: 2CRAZY2EXPLAIN...Ok no. FNAF's lore is way too convoluted to explain, but the basic jazz is that you're a security guard in a pizzeria that has killer robots...yeah, not the best place to be in. You have to survive 5...6...or 7 nights and at the end you'll get a paycheck...or a goodbye message that means you're fired...THANK GOD.PRESENTATION: Since this is an indie game we can't expect much from the graphics, but FNAF does a decent job in terms of looks. You're office is basically a stretched out 2D image that looks like a cylinder when viewed up close, this is not the best option when you want you're game to be frightening, however when you're playing you barely notice. The sounds are typical horror game cliches like footsteps, weird noises, ect, but we do get to hear the animatronics everyone in a while. The game does a perfect job with the atmosphere, I can say that much, however it doesn't do as good of a job when trying to maintain it, since all of the tension goes away when you find out that all the animatronics do is just scream at you and that's it, and that only happened to me once in my entire playthrough. You know you didn't do a good job in terms of horror when someone like me (who gets scared even by Minecraft) finds the game more repetitive than scary and speaking of...GAMEPLAY: In terms of how you play...it's very lackluster. You use the mouse for all of you're actions, to look at the cameras, to shut doors, to use the lights, etc, which is not necessarily a bad thing, I mean, plenty of horror games have even less control and they still manage to be good, but FNAF exploitable AI throws that possibility out the window. There are 4 animatronics to face (5 if you counts Golden Freddy, however that's completely random), Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Freddy. All of them do specific...explodable things that make the game very easy when you know how to use them, you wanna know how? HERE'S MY GUIDE!Bonnie always shows up on the left, so all you have to do is turn the lights on and off and shut the door when he is there, do some flash, flash, flash until he is gone then return to the pattern.Chica is the same as Bonnie, but she goes to the right so you'll have to do the process with that in mind.Foxy will never leave his place if you look at him even for a split second, so all you have to do is maintain the camera on him and switch it on and off while you're also turning the lights on and off.Freddy is the most troublesome when he leaves the stage, since he can attack you at any time...but you can avoid this by simply checking on him just as you do with Foxy and he'll never leave his place.With this in mind, to beat the first 6 nights all you have to do is: Check the light in a pattern of Right, left, right, then check the camera and go to Foxy's, then go to Freddy's, the to Foxy's again, then pull off the camera, left right, left, camera, left right, left right, OU! There's an animatronic, shut the door, camera, left right, left right, is it still there? keep the door shut, camera, left, right, left, he's not there? open the door, left, right, left, camera. Rince and repeat and there you go you've beaten the game in only 1.1 hours like I did. The only night where this doesn't apply on is the 7th night, but I'm not gonna go over that because...holy cheese is that madness.Though keep in mind that everything you do in the game will drain power, so you have to do this pattern very very quickly. You have a total of 100% power and depending on what you do it will go down faster or slower. Just keep that power until 6am and booya! you win...that's it.CONCLUSION: Overall I honestly can't recommend this game. It is very easy when you know what to do and it's not very replayable. I got my copy with 50% off and honestly I believe you should too. It's not really worth it even at the price it currently is...however for Halloween this can be a fun distraction."

Yes, I only played for less an hour but I think I've seen enough of what this game is all about. You basically play as a security guard sitting in a room in some Chuckee-cheese like place looking at security cameras to see if the animatronic characters are moving or not. If you look at the cameras, you lose batter power slowly and you need to make sure you have enough to last out the night from midnight to 6am. And you have to do this for five whole nights. So yes, the animatronics are creepy and there are some jump scares, but this is really it.Come on, this wasn't an amazing game."

Let's get started, shall we?Gameplay: 3/5Original at first, but after 2 nights it gets boring, I do not understand how people would enjoy playing the same game with a few new things added. (I know SL was almost 100% different, but SL is a terrible game)The Graphics: 2/5The ""Graphics"" of this game are hard to describe, the whole game looks like an image inside of a tube, when I look left and right the game glitches, not to mention the textures are blurry and look all around bad. Some older games look visually better than this.*Sigh*Be prepared,The Fanbase: 1.5/5Now, this part does not effect the review of the game in any way. The fanbase used to be people devoted to finding out the lore, but once Markiplier touched it, the fanbase quality dropped, now it is just pure trash, as I said. This does not affect my feelings about this game.Overall: 2.5/5 Original idea, there just needs to be more variety like SL, but even though SL had variety, it still felt like a badly made TellTale game (Mostly story almost no gameplay) So, that's my review. Leave your opinions in the comments, please."

And learning that the movement of the animatronic characters is RNG-based has caused the game to lose a lot of respect from me. Especially in the later levels, skill alone isn't enough to save you. You need to be lucky as well. At that point, you'd most likely get more fulfillment from playing Yahtzee or even flipping a coin.The biggest appeal of FNaF (for me at least) was the suprisingly dense lore, and the lore clues hidden in the games. Watching people try to put everything together in a coherent universe and story over the past few years has actually been a lot of fun. But you don't exactly need the games to watch people put the lore together, so save your hard-earned cash for something else."

Expressing the fear of working a night shift at a pizzeria that is tormented by life-like animatronics. Or it expresses the fear of having fans draw sexual act's with the animatronics. WHAT IS THIS GAME? No, seriously? What is this? Is this game for sex appeal? OF COURSE NOT! Then why do so many players sketch their favorite robot having sexual intercourse with another animatronic. WHAT IS THIS? Most of the people that follow this game, eat, sleep and poop Five Night's at Freddy's. For some reason people have fantasies about this game.. fantasies involving sex...and a lot of it. Let's continue with the actual game... the gameplay.. Is it good? Yes? Sure. The whole concept is creative..I don't enjoy the whole backstory. It's just there so they can continue making more games.  However, the gameplay can be enjoyable at first.. It's something different, creative, a new concept of gaming.. And it's pretty easy! Does that mean the game stays enjoyable? Of course not. After 2 hours this game becomes so boring.. Sure, there are different nights and eventually you can reach the end and challenge yourself by setting the difficult of each robot... but eventually that get's old fast as well. What would you expect? It's an indie game.. with some really odd fans...like really, REALLY odd fans. And a creator that's just doing this for money! 10/10!

You play as the protagonist, Mike Schmidt, who is a security guard at a local Chuck E Cheese-like establishment, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. During the day, the animatronics there, Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate entertain the children. At night, however, they're out to kill you. Using limited power and security cameras you must survive for five nights from 12 AM until 6 AM. If the animatronics catch you, they'll stuff you into an empty Freddy Fazbear suit. For those hesitant about buying the game because it's scary, it isn't really. There's only jumpscares (turn the volume down, headphone users!), and people over react to the game on YouTube and Twitch all the time. It's a gem of a game, and if you like it, I recommend the other 3 (soon to be 4) games in the series."

I can see how some might find this game to be scary, but I didn't, and I'm not saying that as a ""tough guy"" thing either.  I've played all of the Amnesia series, Outlast (anxiety attack anyone?), and most recently, Alien Isolation, so Five Nights at Freddy's just feels far less intense by comparison.  The premise of being a security guard and seeing odd things on fuzzy closed circuit cameras is unique, so I'll give it points for trying something new at least.  But killer animatronic characters?  Hmmm... I'd think this would work better (be more scary) in a psychiatric hospital, or perhaps a city morgue... ehh, I dunno."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

,Not Recommended,319510,26172199,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Rosita,"Ah, yes, Five Nights at Freddies. The most overrated horror game (Not sorry) in the history of horror games. To start off, I'd like to convey my disbelief that I actually had to BUY this game. As in exchange MONEY for it. It's about the least engaging game I've ever played. On top of that, it looks like a game that should be open to download and play for free rather than having to actually pay for it. That being said, it does stand out from its' indie game counterparts in several ways, like a Mexican immigrant standing among a group of US Army Rangers. Moving on...As for the positives, there aren't too many. I suppose the most I can say about it is that it did, indeed, create a tense atmosphere and it certainly made me feel slightly anxious. The thought of strange, disturbing animatronics stalking you in a small building where you're powerless to fight back is something that the game recreated perfectly. Sometimes I even found myself turning around to check whether or not I was alone, so the game certainly knows how to create a nervous feeling for the player. That said, that still doesn't redeem it.The level design is flat out...what's the word? Basic? Simple? Linear? It basically consists of several still images where the only change you'll see is Chuck E. Cheese popping onto the screen for a couple of seconds and then buggering off to his Child sex dungeon, before showing up again with a face that says ""I'm done down there, did you miss me?!"" And that's why I had second thoughts buying the game. It seemed I needed to pay for more than the game was actually worth. ""£5 worth of sitting around watching the Happy Tree Friends over here wander from room to room until one finally finds me and sinks his teeth into my manboobs? No thanks, Steam..."" That's the problem with FNAF. It's TOO basic. The gameplay is boring, the level design is about as linear as an 80 year old Man's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and the only sense of horror you feel is when you see the animatornics, which only show up for a couple of seconds.Then, we have the jumpscares themselves. I'm not even going to mention the huge leap in logic that a reinforced door required power to stay CLOSED. But here's my main problem with FNAF. The whole game exists for the premise of a jumpscare, which contradicts what a jumpscare is actually FOR. It's not just a punishment for losing the game, Scott, it's a climactic moment that is supposed to be built-up through atmosphere and tension. Although FNAF does a fantastic job of building up said tension, that feeling dissipates before the jumpscare actually happens. FNAF, like many other horror games nowadays, lacks pacing. That beautiful little trick that naturally builds up a beautiful amount of tension without even trying. When the jumpscare happens without warning, it does nothing but jolt the player awake, rather than actually scaring them.So, do I recommend this game? Personally, no. I didn't find it to be particularly fun whatsoever, and found it less engaging than eating my own♥♥♥♥♥♥ I suppose, if you just want to scream into a camera to rack up a large view-count on Youtube, this is the perfect game for you! Problem is, whereas FNAF considers itself a horror game, it's more of a point-and-click minigame with some horror-inspired elements. So, no. Personally, I'd say spend your money on something else..."

,Not Recommended,319510,13399532,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,Jeremonté,"I wanted to like this game. Bought it because it was cheap, looked interesting, and everybody all over the internets are crapping themselves playing it, apparently.I used up all my power quickly on the first night while listening to the jackass on the phone and got killed at like 2 or 3 AM because a big teddy bear appeared and I couldn't close the door. Loaded it up again and pretty much just sat there for 90% staring dead ahead (both in-game and irl) to conserve power, checked the cameras closest to my doors the remaining 10% of the time, and made sure to shut 'em in time if one of the robotic carebear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s got close. Easy.Second night was more frustrating. Every time I got to around 3 AM I got jumped by the purple ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Bonnie or whatever. I realize the whole game comes down to observing and responding to the patterns of these bigass pooh bear dolls before they jump you and make sweet animatronic love to your corpse, and I realize that if I stuck with it I could figure out these patterns and respond to them appropriately, and I ALSO realize that this is where a lot of the 'fear' that's supposed to drive this game is derived from.The problem is that I can't find anything compelling enough about its presentation to bother with it.It's far too formulaic; even if the animatronics have increasingly complex or unpredictable patterns of movement that increase the likelihood of sudden death and generic ho-hum jumpscares (the lamest form of 'horror'), EVERYTHING is rooted in repitition. The interactive element of the game is so sparse it almost feels like you're just clicking on random pictures in a slideshow until 'AHHH uneckspected soscary.gif' inevitably pops up. And they're the same pictures each time. ALL you can do is move the character's perspective left and right while you're in your office or whatever, open up the camera, and check all the security cameras one by one. Oh, and close and open doors and turn lights on and off. That's it.In theory, the idea of restricting player control in the interest of generating fear is a good one; but it's implemented poorly here due to a lack of variety and a heavy reliance on cheap scares."

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I personally found the game more frustrating than fun.A game with solid tension, sound design and build up, but can beaten easily when you figure out how it works. The jumps scares are not scary, but the build ups are. Before I knew how to win, the game was frustrating; you've almost made it, with one hour left, then you get rushed by Foxy ahd have to do it all over again. At one point I had Bonnie at the door, who I avoided, only to be instantly followed up by Foxy. Even when checking the cameras to the side rooms I could not see him coming. The game has little to no interaction, and relies HEAVILY on jumps scares as the horror payoff. Here's the thing: Jumpscares are NOT scary. They breifly catch you off guard. Being scared is to fear something, being breifly startled and taken off guard isn't being scared. Because you aren't allowed to move, you have no choice but to sit there and just take the jumpscares, which get boring very quickly. Overall a game that captures the atmopshpere of horror games well, but flawed in that all tension and challenge can be defeated when you know how."

But am I the only one that thinks this is overrated as a horror title? I mean I have to have jumpscares to be scared, but this is only momentarily scary if:A). You do not see your death, or them jumping in the room coming.B). The wolf runs into your room abruptly, and unexpectedly.C). You have a few mental illnesses like me, that warp reality, thus making your immersion in the game near perfection.D). You really do scare easily.E). You have deep psychological reactions to, ""jump scares"". Even my first time playing, my adrenaline spiked the first time the wolf killed me, I never even screamed on my old live stream on youtube, it's not up anymore, I know, convenient. But it just is only good as a strategy game for me, and a damn good one at that! Managing power consumption, resources, and door lockdowns. I cannot get passed that stupid wolf on night two. I also hear they are making a second one, and they can supposedly traverse vent shafts now. If you're like me, and love horrors, and strategy games. You cannot go wrong here, I do not have many hours played, simply because I have over a hundred games. I am a bit strapped for time, trying to play them all, watch science channel, or read.Pros:What I have played, is truly decent, and the strategic elements shine.Great atmosphereThe ambiance is superb.It can truly get down right TENSE at times, which makes a good horror.The power management, from what I have seen, is VERY original for a gameplay element. Haven't seen many games, except for games of this category, implementing such an idea! Arguably, only games like this SHOULD implement the idea.Cons:Really overrated if you do not scare easy. I've seen people die, truly. Nothing scary here at all. But than again, most NEVER witness death.If you cannot fully immerse yourself in atmosphere, and ambiance. You will find NOTHING but jump scares here.It's not that I think the enemies are bad, to me personally, if they do not jump out, and yell at you. They are about as frightening as a puppy, and kitty in the same boot, omitting they are attempting to relieve you of your life.I'm a girl, and this scared me once. Maybe twice?Lets see, it can get overly tedious, the feeling of this whole ordeal, just being an attenuated endeavor, is well, strong. It CAN be frustrating, you CANNOT flee, until in the morning, when their internal clocks reset, and they view people as a customer again. This makes it sometimes trial and error, and thatis NEVER a fun aspect.Maybe I am knitpicking, but just honestly. If this was more than $15, to $20. It would be getting in the, ""Overpriced range"", I guess I shouldn't be typing this, it is WORTH AT LEAST TEN, and you're paying five. So this isn't an issue, but there isn't much depth, AT ALL! This has about as much depth, as a shallow puddle. Albeit, the strategic elements outweigh this.Final verdict: Just buy it. It is five bucks, you LITERALLY cannot go wrong, if you do not like it, I cannot believe I am saying this, I never waste money, it is just five bucks. DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXPECT!!!!!!! AN ACTION TITLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are NO action elements present to my knowledge, so avoid if survival horror is your thing, this is what I would call, ""Psychological/Strategic"" horror. Definitely overrated, but worth it.7.0/10"

Well it isn't.. In the begining.You see after night 4 you basicly need to follow a certain pattern in order to win, which ruins the atmosphere. Because, if you succeed the pattern and keep up the whole night, you win. The jumpscares will just get annoying at a point and not scary anymore.See I respect Scott (the dev) for this game, but the second one.... That's another story.Also whats a fnaf review without mentioning it's fanbase. It sucks. Don't argue with them, you'll die of laughter (if you don't know dying isn't very fun) Wanna know something else about the fanbase. Half of them didn't even play the game and just like the story. WHich is : a guy kills 5 children. The end. Now you might think ""but I heard so much good stuff about the story"" it's all basicly a big (mostly bad fanfiction).So if you wanna pick up a cheap horror game that will entertain you for a few hours and scare you at the beginning.

I am a hardcore gamer, and when I am out of mountain dew, I would appreciate the ability to pause the game to go.  There is no way to change sound, so I can't use my surround sound set up, I have to use the default sound on my computer.  The game is also slow, and I am on a decent rig that runs other games (namely every other game I own) fairly well.  I would also like to note the fact that the entire game cannot be put into windowed mode.  I record, so windowed mode helps me a LOT.  It also doesn't ""kill the mood"" the lack of proper controls kills the mood.  Camera moniter got stuck, light button got stuck, door wouldn't close, then wouldn't open, etc.  The game also wasn't centered.  If I have to play it in full screen, I would like to see the whole game.  I couldn't even see the buttons on the left side.  I was randomly clicking.  While recording, the game was glitching in sound.  Everything possible to go wrong did.  Not to mention the waiting.  The ""ominous music"" was downright horrible, not scary, didn't make me feel terror, it made me tired.  I literally sat there with nothing to do.  The story had potential, they could have made you roam a little bit, made a 3-D guard, SOMETHING, but no.  You were forced to sit there with nothing to do but snooze.  Then if and when you lost, it wasn't scary.  Scariest game in years, ha! Most boring game in years is a much better title.  Now, this is getting lengthy and I am very tired of sitting here typing, it reminds me too much of the game.  The scariest part was the lack of settings menu, the glitches, the slowness of it all, and the broken game.  Great concept, depressing results."

76561198096079278,Not Recommended,319510,11823051,"Posted: 22 August, 2014",all,FriendFive,"Here we go again, another game where, I wish there was a ""maybe"" button, but I think I have to go with ""No"" on this one. I was curious about this game because I like the creepy horror titles like theSlendergames that freak you out without all the blood and gore. The concept of this really piqued my curiosity. The idea of being a night watchmen with a 12am to 6am shift in a Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant with the weird animatronic characters seems like a good setup. But seriously this ""game"" has such minimalistic ""gameplay"" that there isn't much to it other than some, admittedly effective, jumpscares.Here's the gameplay in a nutshell:Constanly check your camera monitor, switching between all of the various locations in the establishment to track the progress of the critters as they creep toward youpan your view left or right between the two doors leading into office you are sitting inOccasionally press the light button next to one of the doors to see out into the dark hallwayOccasionally press the corresponding door button to close the door when you know one of the critters is right thereThe game tries to concoct some sort of narrative reason why you can't just keep the doors closed constantly (it takes power and your bosses are cheap so you have a set amount you can use) and why the robots start walking around at night, trying to kill you (the owners don't want the robots' servomotors freezing up, or some such nonsense), but it makes me feel the same way I do about the aliens in the movieSignscoming to invade Earth, which is three-forths covered in stuff that is fatal to them. To say that this is all contrived is an understatement.I feel like the first night is pretty much handed to you as a way to present you with some narrative exposition (however laughable), but I had a lot of trouble getting through night #2 without running out of electricity; I kept getting to 5am but couldn't survive until 6. Now that I am on night #3, I am not sure there is much point in pressing forward. Honestly, I feel like you can see everything there is to see in this game by looking at the screenshots on the Steam Store Page. I don't feel like nights 4 through 5 are going to offer much more; the critters are just going to move faster or be more unpredictable. Just go watch some videos on youtube of other people playing nights 3, 4, and 5. Seriously, one video I watched of a guy playing night #3 was him flashing the door lights on each side, back and forth, occasionally checking the Pirate Cove stage to keep Foxy at bay, and then, when necessary, closing a door temporarily. Back and forth, back and forth; click, click, click. That's not gameplay, it's boring repetition.This game has a somewhat cool concept that tries to get away with very minimal gameplay by some weak narrative reasoning. If you really must check this game out, wait for it to go on sale, because even at only 5 bucks, it feels a little thin."

I am sorry, it was a good attempt and I like the gameplay mechanic (a bit), but IMO it wasn't executed too well.First the good stuff: the gameplay mechanic was innovative, almost like making playing a horror tower defense game. You can either look at the cameras, light the door-lights at your doors or close the doors at the sights of an approaching monster. That was interesting to try out. And you certainly gave the game tension with the whole ""limited resources and visibility"" aspect, but that is it.I don't know if this was a one-man project or how long it took to make this game, but the graphics was more something that I could expect from older games like the 7th guest. The surfaces certainly look like it and even the fan doesn’t help .The only exception here is the kill scenes, which is both animated okay.And now we are talking about the kill scenes, aka when the ""monsters"" show up in your face, it is always treated as a jump-scare with a high pitched noise. That isn’t scary! That is startling! And when startling gets repeated, it gets more annoying and less startling. The other horror elements given in this game range from the “horror” kind to the gross-out kind, which is the lowest kind of horror writing (referenced from Stephen King). If people like that sort of horror, it is okay, but the essence of horror is invoking a fear in you, the more abstract the better. And when we are talking about the games writing, a lot of it feels quite forced: a summer job for a pizzeria for that low a salary but high fatality rates and even known murders. HOW IS THAT STILL IN BUSINESS? The phone calls are set up to be support to the player, but it seems so obvious that it really tries to make the situation more, scary than it is. And that is also one of the aspects that make the horror level drop to between horror and gross-out: your “mentor” keeps telling/hinting that the animatronics will kill you, if they get to you. But he also explicitly tells you, what they are going to do to you (basically stuff you inside a modern iron sarcophagus), if they get you, which define gross-out.The gameplay, although I praised it before, doesn’t help much either. The only bit of gameplay that is there aside from the doors and lights, are predicting the animatronics movements, which is easy to do. A point, where the camera gets disabled, still tells about the movements of the animatronics. If you take it easy and think about administrating your power a bit, most of the nights will be a breeze. I got from 1st to 4th night in one go with no problems.But one of the game’s biggest crimes is that it is boring! As I said, the gameplay is very simple, which makes it borderline swallow and non-engaging. The other close thing to gameplay (again, aside doors and lights) is looking at cameras to predict the animatronics movements and position. But that also takes away power, so when you have nailed the movements and quirks of each animatronic, you will end up most of the time just looking bored at the clock instead of being scared or terrified (that was at least where I was).If it was designed to be a short game with little to explore, then it succeeded and matches with the price for the game. But as a horror game, I did say that there are easily others, who have done it better:The gameplay was a noble attempt, but just didn’t go well. The horror elements go more for the lowest factor, which ends up biting its own♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics look like something that would pass around or more than 10 years ago. The soundtrack is pretty much missing (aside from an overly simple menu screen and a music-box version of the opera “Carmen”). And in the end, I felt more like joking whenever I saw an animatronic rather than being scared.If you like/love jump-scare, minimal gameplay and have a fear of animatronics (that you would like horror to explorer), then you might like this game.But all I can say to dear Scott Cawthon is: better luck next time, because this wasn’t it."

Thats not too bad, some things just didn't look ""nice"" (I am by no means the ""need Ultra-HD 8K Graphics""-Guy), but also no window mode. Sure, you can argue - window mode in a Horror game? Well, sometimes I prefer that, when Alt-Tab isn't working.- Pressing ESC quits the game. Surely, this is just me being dumb, pressing ESC a second... a third... a fourth time, accidently when I want to pause the game, or just exit the Tablet/Camera View. Why does it have to quit instantly?- There doesn't seem to be a Hotkey for bringing up/down the Camera View, cycling trough the cameras? Light On/Off.. Doors Up/Down- What am I doing there? I am a nightguard.. and all I do, is wall myself in, when a bunny stands in Front of my Door?WHAT do they pay me for! I don't do Nightguardthings at all!- While we are at this topic.. Bunny in Front of my Door - I press the light on switch, and well. surprise there is the Bunny.It doesn't move. The light is on.. It grins the same way. Well.. Maybe close the door now... I wonder what happens if I open the Door again.. Oh, surprise. The Bunny is still there! Well, it still doesn't move, I let the door open, gonna look at my tablet again. Nothing.. Okay, taking the tablet down. Oh wow. The bunny. It is screeching in Front of my (Monitor)-Face. Game Over.Well... That.. wasn't scary at all.- Why does a closed door need power?In which way is my Tablet connected to the Door Power? Questions I can not answer. But I can let this slip away with ""Game Logic"". This just seemed strange to me.- The phone calls.. annoying jibber-jabber about uninteresting Stuff.Pros:+ I can mute the phone callsI played 4 nights. Those 4 Nights I just felt like I was watching multiple Pictures, put together, changing only when I looked somewhere else. Camera View on the Stage, Clicking to Dining Room.. Clicking back to the Stage... Oh a Puppet is missing.I never saw anything really moving, except the Bunny which jumped into my face before the Game Over.I, honestly can't understand how this has 3200 Positive Reviews. I don't know what I am missing here, but to me.. This is just pressing Buttons without any story, emotions, or deep gameplay.So.. Well.. Don't buy it. Just don't. Sorry that I am downvoting this game, you 3200 People who liked it. Just my honest opinion. I don't think I would have continued playing this, even if it were free."

It really blew up and got popular, but it falls flat in a few areas.First off, the game does a good job of building tension. The puppets are creepy to watch through the cameras. The audio clues and grainy cameras really add to the creepy atmosphere.However, this is all ruined when you actually are killed. Upon dying, whatever puppet kills you shows up in a ""jumpscare"" which is more annoying than scary. It is here you can see just how goofy the puppets actually look. Do not be fooled by the ""scare cam"" videos that everyone and their brother put out over this game. People are hamming it up for the camera and this game only has one ""scare"" for you which is a speaker-cracking ""scream"" when you die.Puppet movement is random. This mean some levels, you are doomed to lose through no fault of your own. For example, the Fox puppet shows up (he shows up if you view him too much or not enough on thecamera...what?)and to stop him, you close the door. He pounds on the door and saps energy, increasing with each subsequent visit. One game, the Fox was sent at me three times within a minute (the game resets him after each attack but sometimes resets him to his ""going to attack you soon"" phase). There was nothing I could do to stop it.I do like the premise and it is very creative. However, it all boils down to whether the game allows you to win rather than player skill and for that, I cannot recommend it."

The graphics are only just images, and each level it's almost the same thing just you sitting in a office, looking through cameras, and making sure that the animatronic robots that are imposters of Chuck-E-Cheese's try to kill you for whatever reason. What I did not like about this game is how you only stay in one place and not actually travel through places and defending yourself. This was a little bit different though, and I was surprised when my sister showed me it on Youtube of this guy playing it being scared to death therfore being the reason why I bought it thanks to my sister making me spend my own good five bucks on it. Also the game does not make any sense. First of all how could animatronics be able to walk around and kill you?! They're not designed to do that in the first place because you know how animatronics, in general, just stay in place and do not walk? Animatronic are not advanced enough to walk because people who make them just make their legs stationary so they stay put and stand up as if they're a statue. And how can a animatronic think for itself, by knowing where you are and even know how to kill when all they're is just robots only programmed to do certain actions and phrases? I does not make sense! And if the restaraunt that owned them , Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Parlor, if they knew they were dangerous then why won't they just get rid of them, do they care? Do they care about the safety of their restaraunt and customers. In conclusion this game is interesting and different, however I believe that this game is not even worth purchasing but rather it should be a game you can play for free on Adobe Flashplayer or Java because both of those programs could easily render all of the cheap images and graphics that game has(however I thought it was a little impressive how one man made the game, but still it can improve). This is not realistic in two ways, the concept of the game of how animatronics try to kill you at night, and also the graphics literally."

It has its moments but the only thing that is scary is the jumpscares. I find the premise interesting but lacking. It's worth the money but I would not pay more for it. A good horror game gives good atmosphere and doesn't need to rely on jumpscares to get you like this game does. It's okay once or twice but quickly becomes boring. One of the times I was scared was when I accidently opened the security overlook my first time playing. That's not a good thing.

It was recomended to me by a friend, and he had alot of positive things to say about it. But I never judge a game by it's reviews. I bought the game and tried it myself, and I was very disapointed.The game is full of poor, 2D jump scares of robotic animals that don't even look the slightest bit frightening. The only actions you can do are look at cameras, turn lights on/off and close doors. For the entire 6 nights, thats all you do.  The game crashed 3 times for me aswell. Twice when I was '""caught"" and once when I was in the middle of a night.I would have liked this game more if there was more actions you could perform, such as standing and walking around. Or possibly trying to find more batteries around the map. Also, a death animation would be nice. Where the robots take you and force you into an exoskeleton.This game isn't even worth the $5.00 I paid for it."

That could very well be the reason why this one's priced a bit lower than the others; your life literally depends on how you manage your power, and unlike the other games, if you lose power in this game, you're left defenseless for the rest of the night, and the animitronics are sure to getcha.No reason for me to not recommend it though!"

What makes this game even scarier is the fact you cant run either so you feel so defenceless. The simplicity of the game mechanics is what makes this game so unique plus the animatronics are so creepy which adds to the scare factor. Then this game has a lore so deep becuase Scott Cawthon is good at hiding little secrets here and there, this is what it became for. This game is so simple and unique or better yet scary. I have no negative comments about this game, it is so well balenced. I give it a 10/10."

I thought I would try it myself. Got a steam card at GameStop. Spent 5 dollars on the game. Installed it. Played it. I was 9 years old, and I didn't get scared. Last year when I got the game I didn't want to play it, because I was scared. Now I don't want to play it because the fandom ruined it. All it is is 10 year olds like me screaming when they hear Freddy's laugh. It used to be a good game, but now it isn't. After FNAF 2, it became a waste of money. It really iritates me that the only topic this MOFO Nicolas Biele talks about is ♥♥♥♥ing FNAF. I got in a fight with him. I was running to get a frisbee and he wanted it too so he PUSHED me, and in my mind I'm like ♥♥♥♥ YOU! So I pushed him and got revenge. Then he starts kicking me. Then I take the frisbee and give it to my friend as he had did to me earlier. I was running to get the frisbee, and I was closer than my friend, Logan. but that ♥♥♥♥♥ Nicolas took it and gave it to Logan. Anyway, I threw the frisbee to Logan and I kicked him back and before that I said ""That's what you did to me!"" And he said ""No I didn't."" So i kicked him back and he's a dumbass so he kicked me back. And then I said ""YOU PICKING FIGHTS NIC?!"" And he comes over to me and I grab him and he tries pushing me, and he didn't punch me because he's a ♥♥♥♥♥. So I take my fist and I slam it into the side of his face. He started crying then, the little ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥. So someone snitched, and of course I go to the principal's office. I should have kept punching but I didn't. The principal said I ASSAULTED him! He got off scot free and I was getting an in school suspension. My mom called the of my in school suspension and said it wasn't fair that he wasn't getting an in school suspension too. So the principal said he would, but she ♥♥♥♥ING LIED! SHE'S A MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥! So he didn't even get warned. The point is, my principal doesn't understand retaliation. That's just another reason to hate FNAF fans. The game makes Nicolas Biele♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants. That makes him a ♥♥♥♥♥, so he didn't punch me back when I yelled ""GET ME BACK NIC!"" in his face. SO ♥♥♥♥ YOU NICOLAS BIELE! Just so you know this IS Kaden Sheiffele speaking. But since I'm not saying this at school, you can't ♥♥♥♥♥ to the principal! ♥♥♥♥ YOU! I want to fight you again.

The controls are so simple, you use your mouse to look from side to side and look at the cameras. You use left click to turn on the doors/lights. That's it. Altough using anything drains more power. There is NO blood/gore in this game(At least from what i've played), so that's a major plus.Pros-No blood-Simple controlsCons-Low replay valueOverall I would say 6/10, DLC would be awesome."

None of what I said is bad, though, as I thoroughly enjoyed this. The concept and execution are simple, in that all you really have to do is click a couple buttons to make sure some rogue animatronics don't kill you. Sounds easy, right?That's the brilliant part about this game. Even though you stay in one room and really don't do much, the game can be incredibly difficult with the limited amount of power you have. As the nights progress, the animatrons get more and more aggressive, and your reflexes have to be up to the task. If you're not quick enough, then you'll be greeted with a horrifying scream as one of the abominations ends your life. The scream comes on both ends too - the surprise of the animatron sneaking up on you may cause you to scream in horror.I applaud Five Nights at Freddy's for taking something so simple and making it a challenging, horrifying feat that keeps you on the edge of your seat."

You might wish to return for the scares, or you might wish to never visit this ""perfectly fine"" pizzaria again. Some, however, are like me, creeped out by the atmosphere but always wanting a challenge. Regardless of which of these three descriptions fits you, continuing after your first try is the best step to take. You WILL fail. You WILL forget any advice which was given to you before playing. You WILL fail several times.However, you will eventually begin to overcome the anamatronics, your finger poised over the left clicker on your mouse. Your reflexes will improve, allowing you to blast through the light-checking process and keep an eye on your two very special ""friends."" You will find yourself becoming less anxious as your power dwindles, and you might even gamble against the A.I. by blocking all entrances to the Office, risking an instant-kill from Freddy after the power goes out in exchange for keeping him and Foxy at bay. You will eventually notice that these attempts work in your favor.The first gamble will most likely be an accident, but you learn. Most learning experiences in this game stem from near-death experiences. You continue to uncover how the animatronics act when unleashed, and eventually you learn so much that all fear will subside. At this point, it is only a matter of time until you complete the game.As a player who has cleared the entire campaign, including the nightmarish night 6 (on my second try, no less) and has completed everything but the 20/20/20/20 mode (plus any other Custom Nights), I can tell you that this game is worth much more than the $5 price. The animatronics will try to deter you from their home, but staying opens the doors (pun intended) to an incredibly well-developed strategy game.P.S. : I didn't call it a horror game for previously stated reasons. It is simply an amazing strategy game once you learn the ropes and tie up the A.I.'s plans with them."

Although the later statement is true for a $5 game it does give enough entertainment to make it worth the money.A lot of people also mistake this game franchise as being bad just because of the community. Although the community for this game is right up there with hitler and satan, the game itself is worth getting if you're looking for some quick, cheap entertainment.With all the above said, this game still does have some very interesting underlying lore to it, and the portion of the FNAF community dedicated to this lore is actually good in contrast to the rest of it.

This is much different from games such as Silent Hill or fatal frame as resource management is the main challenge and it's focused largely on defensive strategies/timing. It starts off as relatively simmple but then quickly gets more difficult, with the fifth night leading to you often getting freaked out and mad at yourself.I've read some complaints about the enemies being too random but I think that's fine and adds to the challenge. I had to try various strategies on the different nights before being able to pass some of them, even after I read some tips online (which usually amount to just that, tips, as there can't really be a guide for this).Cool new take on the survival-horror genre.

Obviously you can see that I haven't dedicated enough time on this gem to gain any credibility to my review, but I have it on my phone, I've seen the YouTube videos, and let me tell you: Sweet s***.I won't go into depth about the game since everyone and their grandma's dog know about it, all I can say is that this is the very first game that has made me literally scream in shock and fear. This is the ultimate jumpscare, but even if you aren't easily jolted, the puzzle element will appease you as well. Each haunted character has their own AI, their own triggers and paths to follow and you only have a limited amount of electricity to work with. As each night passes, the difficulty hikes up until it's a frantic race to survive.Either for the scary element or the thrill of micromanage or die, I recommend this game to everyone. As long as you don't take it too seriously, you will have a blast."

I was just steam rolling through.So, I played the 6th night. It still wasn't scary. I didn't lose even once.Finally, I played the 4/20 7th night, the hardest possible scenerio. From Youtube stars, it seemed like it would be incredibly difficult. One said it took him 24 hours another said 9 hours.

One of the brilliant things about the game is that if you analyzed the game mechanics alone, it would actually be fairly easy; it's the perfect, intensely unsettling atmosphere that makes the game hard, because you'll be so shaky and jumpy you'll make constant mistakes. It doesn't hurt that the game also seems to be of the ""learn by doing"" school; while the phone guy will give you some tips that establish the basics of the game, the particulars of each animatronic are something you'll have to discover for yourself by playing, even as the phone guy gives you hints to their tricks.The only downside of the game is that once you've worked out the patterns, you start to settle into a very simple and repetitive pattern of your own that will let you simply skate your way to victory barring unusually bad luck, but the same can be said for a lot of otherwise-great games, and even here the atmosphere and jumpscares are so well-executed that you'll never feel completely safe.

Cheese's, almost makes me scared to go back to Chuck E. Cheese's ever in my life.+ The characters are likeable in the""I absoultely hate this character""kind of way.+ The atmosphere itself is beyond creepy. A place that is going to shut down by the end of the year, children gone missing, more than likely murdered and stuffed into the animatronics (hence the foul odor emitting from the robots). Now they haunt the pizza parlor and pretty much kill anyone they see. Tell me that's not creepy.Neutrals:/ While the game doesn't exactly rely on jumpscares entirely, there are a lot of them if you don't time yourself right or just have crap luck. Once you get used to a loud ""SCREEEEEEE!"" in your face, it can get more annoying or frustrating, rather than scary.Cons:- The only negative thing I can say about this game, is that it spawned a bunch of Furries dropping down on it like a dog's fresh, warm, steamy dookie, on your just cleaned white carpet.Other than that, I'd recommend this game to anyone that's looking for something to play for a few minutes, have a good scare, or laugh if you're making your friends play it.

The Slender aspect is the characters that can come at you at any second and they're watching you, and the SCP is like using the cameras. You take your eyes off of the camera and the characters will move. I know I don't have a ton of time played on this game, but sadly I can't play it at night because there are people sleeping in my house and I don't wanna wake them up screaming my head off.Overall, if you love jump scares, life like monsters an the constant feeling of being watched, this game is for you. 10/10."

Five night's at Freddy's has utilized simple graphics, simple gameplay and simple mechanics in ways that was never been done before. All of the simple necessity's above flows fluently with the look, sound and overall feel of the game, giving it an atmosphere that just oozes with dread, helplessness and anxiety. All of which combines into a sense of horror that has not been taken advantage of so far. The vauge information that the game gives you in the plot just adds a lot mystery to it, making the game even more creepy and scary. So from my experience, Five night's at Freddy's is no doubt the newest scariest addition to the horror genre of gaming. Just remember, like with every other horror game don't play it frequently, excessively and or too often, otherwise the scare factor will fade away just like with all the others."

This game...my god, this game...It's soooo good and such a fantastic horror game and yet it's so simple in its design. Basically you are a security guard who has been hired for the night shift of watching Freddy's pizza parlor. All you have to do is watch the security cameras by pointing and clicking. However you have a limited amount of power so you can't use the cameras all the time. You also have control of mechanical doors to your left and right sides as well as lights that will illuminate the hallways to your right and left. As the night goes on, the mechanical mascots of Freddy's will move off camera and seemingly appear whenever you switch to a different security camera. Very rarely will you see one of the mechanical mascots actually moving within your camera, and when you do, you are usually done for by then. Very simple, very jumpscary(the best kind of scary in my opinion), and very good. I highly recommend it, one of the best, as well as the cheapest, horror games on Steam."

It is not the jumpscares that are scary; it`s just a robot jumping at you whilst screaming, but the long periods of nothing happenning. You feel the need to check on Foxy in Pirates Cove, or look where Freddy is because you missed his last laugh... But you cant, one look at the camera provokes the animatronics, so you have to have a clear strategy. I don`t think that this game is quite as scary as people make out, but it is more like a strategy game than a game designed to scare you. I would certaintly recommend this game!"

There's a lot that either scares you or it doesn't, end of story.This game's scary climaxes are really just cheap jump scares, but that doens't mean it doesn't do a damn fine job of feeling you with suspensful dread, no wanting to incure those jump scares. Keeps you on edge constantly, and is well designed in that every time you think you've found a strategy that breaks the game - guess what?

,Recommended,319510,12077125,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,MusiAH,"Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie point and click game done up by Scott Cawthon. The story revolves around a lone security guard, Mike Schmidt, working the graveyard shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. With the business struggling and closing down by year's end, no one's going to come by and rob it... It's the animatronics you need to protect yourself from. You must last through your six hour shift with limited battery power, and the advice from your colleague on the shift before.  You can find my playthrough below, take a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGA8DUzLeu8&list=PLk69TxLkva1bTDMZ_gwBuFR_9WeQ28U7o&index=1The premise of the game is highly simple, you must last six hours (approx. 10 min) on the Night Shift with limited power in the building. To defend yourself from the four animatronics (Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Freddy Fazbear) you've only your camera network to keep an eye on them, lights near your doors to check for them, and your heavy-duty security doors, all of these taking up your power on use. You do not have a weapon, you cannot run, you must sit there and wait for your shift to end.Five Nights at Freddy's takes a different spin on the horror genre; instead of pushing you through tasks you do not wish to perform, you must wait and observe your environment in order to protect yourself. Fail, and you'll be met with a final jump-scare, in which poor Mike Schmidt will join Freddy Fazbear's Pizza forever, stuffed into an extra Freddy Fazbear suit. Everything in this game is tailored not to frighten you, but to stress your mind and alertness which will make you afraid of anything with your hyper-awareness.Everything in this game is tailored to that goal, from the clever, predatory enemy AI, to the sound and character design, subtly pushing in horror elements to the once thought innocent anamatronic characters.  Despite causing terror, these subtle changes and movements of your enemies ramps up your own paranoia, especially as Foxy is introduced, and the enemy AI becomes signifigantly more difficult as the nights progress, Freddy himself becoming extremely aggressive and attacking your door on the Fourth and Fifth nights.Don't be expecting highly in-depth gameplay here like Amnesia or Outlast; with Five Nights at Freddy's the less-is-more approach does fantastic wonders. No background music makes the animatronics noises only ever more noticable, minimal ways to protect yourself only ramps up your fear, and the limited means of protecting yourself only makes those five nights even more harrowing. After the first five nights, a super difficult sixth night is unlocked, and after that a custom night is opened (which many people have been playing at max difficulty level in an effort to be '4-20' night, the ultimate Five Nights at Freddy's experience).For the game's low cost, Five Nights at Freddy's comes highly reccomended for anyone looking for a good casual game, or a hard-core scare experience. I certainly reccomend it to anyone looking for a great indie-horror experience.Grand Re-Opening 2015."
,Recommended,319510,12078183,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,Monokuma,"Five Nights at Freddy's, for someone who has never watched someone play it, isn't actually a very terrible game. There's plenty of scares to go around, and even when you think you may know what's going on, there could be a surprise at any given moment.The game gives a great sense of paranoia at times, and I find myself flipping through the cameras a lot, even though I know it's best to keep an eye out for Foxy and Freddy only.However, I DO have to say, after a while, the game doesn't get so much scary as to stressful, especially if you're trying to do harder custom nights. It becomes easy to guess when you're doomed to get struck by one of the animatronics, save for Foxy, and the game loses its scare factor.TLDR; If you haven't seen gameplay of it or are just wanting a good, (albeit cheap), scare, this is definitely a game for you."

At the first night most people are scared, which I don't blame them. But once the night progresse it gets harder, when the NIGHTS progress, even more hard, thats when the animatronic characters wonder a bit more every night, appering at your door much more. Once you complete the main five nights you have the option to go to a 6th night, which most people hesitate. After you finish that night you have another option to go into costom mode, where you control the animatronics motibility. When you complete that night, you are fired for tampering with the animatronics, seenis how you were messing with their stauts just for your own benifit. Once, before Scott thaught of making a second game, he made the night 7 code, 1-9-8-7, refering to the bite of 87' a secret ending of the game, now it is just a Yellow Bear (Golden Freddy) Jumpscare, leaving you at the death screen then to the start menu. So, I recomend these games to people are confedent, adventurous, brave. I do not recomend it to people who have alot of stress, paranoia, and other things like OCD, which infact this game is a Mental Paranoia and horror game. So, if you fit the qualities and like the story, why dont you play the game, and mabey the second, or third! There is more secrets to oncover, more stories to reviel, or you can just do it for the fun-of-it! But, be sure to look at the system requirments to make sure you CAN actuly run it, do that for all games, you can access your system information by going into your control pannel, then to the system catagory, and check if you meet the standards to run the game, so I hope you all have a good time playing this AMAMAZING game! And it only takes about an estimated 3.5 mineuts to download! Thanks for reading this and have fun!"

This game is different from other horror games because in most horror games you try to run away from the enemy but in this game you have to just wait for them to come to your door because you can't do anything else. Waiting for them to come is REALLY SCARY and the game has hidden lore that keeps players playing to find out the truth.This is one GREAT GAME!!!

Scott showed us all that people do not need a complex game to give an ambiance and immersion into a world. In the Five Nights world, a person feels as if they are actually the security gaurd fending for their life. The audio cues and the poor lighting that really makes you squint really set up this game. Sure, a person can blast through all the nights without looking through the other cams, but then about 90% of what Scott has created is lost. The game is complex on a psychological level that is matched by nothing, and is impacted even more so by the lack of controls, graphics, sight, and even movement."

The animatronics are left on to make them operate correctly, but they walk around the restauraunt. When they see you they think you are a animatronic WITHOUT its costume. So, they try to stuff you in it, which is bad since many wires are inside. Once you are in the suit, you are dead.When I first heard about it I thought ""Why is this game said to be the SCARIEST GAME EVER?"". Yes, it did take me a while to play the game because I wasn't thiking about playing it or watching gameplay until many months of talk. I saw gameplay and I was like ""Really.......this is the hype?"". I thought it was a game where you walk around the restauraunt and you run away from them. Anyway, I played the game for a while, and it is scary, by jumpscares, mostly. The story in the game AND the stories the Youtubers say makes the game a little creepy. The jumpscares got me, they really did. The game is a psychological horror, so it makes you wonder about the restauraunt. While the game's atmosphere and scares are great for a horror game. I give this game 10/10 stars for a game that is a Psychological horror."

,Recommended,319510,12395626,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Anime Trap,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror game fans of the genre waited for for so long. The game is unique in a way from most modern horror games. Insead of running around collecting items or finding keys to go to the next area, you stay in a small office trying to keep the animitronics out. Every animitronic has its own pattern (like Foxy becoming more active if the cameras remain off of him for long periods of time) and creepyness to itself. Like most point and clicks, this game requires strategy and fast reaction speed. One second an animitronic could be 3 rooms away from you, then when you check your door light it's there. That is the scare factor in this game: jumpscares. Like Amnesia : The Dark Desent, it focuses on build up and the ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ where did he go?!"" felling. I garantee this game will not bore you.As far as recommendations and enjoyment are concerned, I had fun with the game and creeped myself out in the process. If you don't mind jumpscares and want something to do on a weekend, play this game or better yet have someone watch you play it.The game is only $5 on steam and is worth every penny. Even if you play it for only 5 hours in total, it'll be worth it.That's why my final rating for this game is a 9/10."

She then came back to the living room to relax and watch a bit of television. But her concern for her brother in the hospital was taking her mind away from what she was watching.Bernie camne over next to her and sniffed at her dangling hand. He could still smell himself on her fingers, the same hand that had manipulated his sheath so many hours before. And he recalled how good her fingers felt on his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And that recollection was enough of a memory to trigger his lust once more. As he licked his scent off Carly's hand, his♥♥♥♥♥♥began peaking out of his sheath once again. And just as before its pale♥♥♥♥♥♥tip emerged a few inches. He then decided to be playful and started pulling at Carly's robe. ""Hey, stop that,"" Carly protested with a grin. She realized that the dog just wanted to play so she didn't put up much of a fight. The dog kept playing his little tug-of-war with Carly's robe, pulling it apart slightly as he tugged hard on it. Carly actually had to grab hold of the bottom of the robe to keep it from being pulled off. Unbeknownst to her, in the excitement of Spencer's accident, Freddy had left the camera on the tabletop on, as well as the website connection active. And as luck would have it, it was aimed directly at the couch where Carly was now struggling with her new dog. Bernie kept tugging, first from the right, then he would start pulling from the left. The whole while Carly's robe was being pulled further and further apart. Already her bare thighs were showing as she kept struggling with the dog playfully. And if she had bothered peeking at the monitor on the table, she would have noticed that the hit counter was steadily climbing into life. As the dog kept tugging playfully from left to right, Carly's head wrap towel came loose and tumbled to the floor, her long dark mane flowing over her shoulders. ""C'mon, Bernie,"" Carly giggled. ""Quit fooling around."" As the struggling went on, the belt holding Carly's robe shut came undone, allowing the terrycloth robe to be pulled wide open for the camera. Suddenly, Carly's young teenaged body was being shown in all its splendor on the Internet, and the hits kept climbing steadily higher. ""Bad doggy!"" She reprimanded him as she rewrapped the robe to cover herself. The tug-of-war continued between the teen girl and the dog when he suddenly changed tactic. Then, in a playful attempt to escape Bernie's grasp, Carly twisted her body 360º. But all this accomplished was to allow her arms to slip out of the sleeves of her robe, which Bernie quickly dragged away from her. Now Carly Shay stood stark naked in the middle of her living room in front of the still active webcam. She jumped up and shyly tried to cover her crotch with her tiny hands, while crossing the other arm to cover her ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Carly remained oblivious to the embarrassing predicament Bernie's playfulness was placing her in on the Internet, but she also didn't feel all that embarrassed by her sudden state of undress. ""Hee-hee-hee! I guess you won't tell anybody what you're seeing,"" she giggled nervously as she dropped her defensive pose. ""So, what do you think, Bernie? You think I'm nice looking?"" ""ARF! ARF!"" Was the playful response she got from the dog as he watched her displaying herself to him. She twirled from left to right, showing off her sexy teenaged profile to the playful animal, still not suspecting that she had a much broader audience than just the dog. She kept tugging and hugging the dog playfully, giggling as any young girl would while playing with her pet, even though she was now naked with him. And whenever she hugged Bernie, she would get a tickling sensation from his fur over her bare skin. This in turn was turning her on somewhat, but she wasn't all that familiar with that feeling at her age. In fact, she had only briefly tried masturbating herself, but she didn't get much pleasure out of it. She had become curious after some of her sex-ed classes when the teacher explained to the class where the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥would fit in a woman. Carly couldn't see how anything could fit inside her ♥♥♥♥♥ as it was much too small for anything so thick. This is what had led her to try inserting her finger at her ♥♥♥♥♥-hole, but it felt too tight even for that, so she didn't pursue it beyond that. But her arousal wasn't overlooked by the playful dog. His keen sense of smell easily picked up that distinct scent coming from any female in heat. Though he hadn't noticed any such ♥♥♥♥♥ in proximity, his prick was definitely beginning to respond to those pheromones, growing longer with every passing second. Then without any warning Bernie leapt forward and inadvertently buried his snout into Carly's virgin crotch.  ""HEY YOU!"" Carly yelped in surprise and giggled. ""No boys allowed."" Of course this chat was broadcast worldwide along with the canine sex-play that she was presently receiving without her conscious knowledge. But now that Bernie had suddenly found the mysterious source of that scent, his tongue finally came into play. He swiped his doggy tongue along Carly's labia.  ""O-h-h-h-h!"" Carly moaned involuntarily. ""Bernie, wha... what are you doing?"" Bernie's sudden tonguing caused Carly to step backwards and fall across her couch in a prone position, her ♥♥♥♥♥ facing flush to the camera. She was totally inexperienced in matters of sex, being still a virgin. She was even a bit shy about touching herself, or washing over her budding♥♥♥♥♥♥ The hit counter of the iCarly web page kept its upward trend and was now past the five million mark. ""You know what? That feels kinda nice, Bernie,"" Carly cooed to the dog. ""But you really shouldn't be doing that to a girl."" But the Collie knew nothing about right or wrong in this area. All he knew is that he found a ♥♥♥♥♥ in heat, even if she didn't realize that she was as yet, and his♥♥♥♥♥♥would need release soon. He just kept on licking Carly's upturned ♥♥♥♥♥, going from the crease of her♥♥♥♥♥right up to her inexperienced♥♥♥♥♥♥ causing her body to shudder each time. ""O-h-h-h-h! Bernie, you really should stop now,"" she kept moaning, trying to get the dog to behave. Just then Bernie shoved his snout forward hard, pushing Carly's ♥♥♥♥♥lips apart. His versatile doggy tongue was now able to snake its way right inside Carly's virgin ♥♥♥♥♥♥, reaching depths that she didn't even know existed. ""Please, Bernie, stop!"" Carly moaned helplessly to the dog's onslaught. ""Plea... O-O-O-H-H-H-h-h!"" Carly's back suddenly arched sharply, pushing her pert young breast higher up, as she suddenly received her first full-on ♥♥♥♥♥♥. And with her juices now flowing, Bernie got even more aroused and excited. From the Internet viewers perspective they could see the dog's♥♥♥♥♥♥emerging from its sheath, even if Carly remained unaware of this chain of events. All she knew, or cared, for the moment was the wonderful feeling that this dog was giving her young virgin body. This all being new to Carly, she didn't know what she was doing. It was as if her body took over her will. Her dormant sexual instincts, which she didn't even know existed, were taking over her body as she drew her knees up and spread her legs apart, thus offering herself to the ravishment of the dog's tonguing."

You got a laptop where you can watch cameras, do all of this for 5 nights and BOOM you beat the game, you unlocked an optinal 6th night. I think the gameplay is meh, you might get tired of shutting doors on animatronics from time to time, and watching cameras, also the game inplements the camera mechanic pretty poorly, you only need to watch one camera throughout the entire game, *cough *cough *pirate cove *ahem. If this is a game that is supposed to scare the crap out of a guy who like, never gets scared, than they did a poor job because I hardly even flinch to this game anymore, I bet an 8 year old would be scared of it, and people do overeact to it on youtube. I will say there are times where you aren't expecting a jumpscare, but the jumpscares in this game are atrocious... an animatronic sreams in your face and you die. What do I think of this game? I think the gameplay is pretty ok, but the presentation is bland and I would rather call this game a rage game rather than a horror game, because this game actually is pretty hard for a horror game! Would I recommend this game? No, unless you're 9 and you want to invite a bunch of friends over and play a horror game like this....

,Not Recommended,319510,19602110,"Posted: 10 December, 2015",all,Mega Weebis,"tl;dr:It's terribleActual Review:In this game, you play as a security guard in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a restaurant which is haunted by living animatronics during the night. Your job is to ensure that these animatronics don't kill you. You do this by closing your doors. That's it. Sure, you have limited power, but that doesn't change the simplistic and boring gameplay. All of the animatronics do the exact same thing, except for one of them. This system gets no different for the rest of the 6 levels (or nights). No new animatronics, no new gimmicks; nothing. It's just the same thing over and over again but harder. But the worst part is that it actually puts you on edge, it has the potential to actually make you scared. And then, when they kill you:Jumpscare. The laziest, easiest way to 'scare' someone. Of course a sudden loud noise will make you jump. The creator had the power to make this game a little better by making you feel scared, but after the jumpscare, all the eeriness is gone.Overall, I highly recommend you don't buy this game. It's terrible."

,Recommended,319510,20232508,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,pro jumanji™,"I honestly love this series and the lore surrounding it. Each game introduced a lot more material to the storyline and, for a lore nut like me, this is the perfect mix of horror and telling a story.This game is actually pretty damn revolutionary and it was a completely fresh outlook on horror before all the fan made games saturated the formula. A horror game where you don't move and can't do sh*t about your impending doom? Pretty damn scary, actually.A lot of people criticise the game for being jumpscare based, but I honestly think that it's a pretty neat finale to top all the paranoia and chills down your spine during the gameplay.So all in all, I give this game a 4.5/5. The only con is the cringeworthy fan base"

It's like if you started a slasher flick about a bunch of teens in the woods. Then for no reason all of them break both wrists. Can they survive the horrors about to unfold?? Not to mention sometimes one of the robots stands outside the door....FOREVER. Would be creepy and not frustrating if I didn't have to worry about the damn power cutting off. Then there's the question of: Why? Why is the power limited? This restaurant is so far outin the boonies that it doesn't have reliable power but makes enough to afford state of the art robotics? See? It's one crack in the premise that kind of unravels the whole thing for me.The rest of the game really knows how to do horror right, Sure theres jump scares but they're genuinely scary when they happen. Everything else is 100% atmosphere. If you're a fan of horror that gives you legitimate chills: Buy this game!"

Right, let me get this way out of the way right now: I don't hate the horror genre in any form of media, it just mostly bores me because very few people seem to understand how to do it properly. Unfortunately, this is one of those instances where the ""horror"" is in substance only yet not in actual gameplay. >.>Basically, while the backstory is fertile ground for a good horror film it's not brought up during gameplay but rather in the form of easter egg style newspaper clippings hanging in various rooms in Freddy Fazbear's. Notice I haven't gotten to the gameplay aspect yet; that's because this is the most boring part. You play as Mike Schmidt, the new security guard for a Freddy Fazbear's Entertainment location, and lucky for you you get to work the graveyard shift for five straight nights (no, really? XD) with the only slightly horrifying catch being that the animatronics that are the attraction's centerpiece are only allowed to wander at night rather than during the day after one of them bit the frontal lobe off of some anonymous customer in 1987 (the incident infamously named ""The Bite of '87"".) It's explained by the infamous ""Phone Guy"" that if you're spotted by the animatronics you'll be seen as a naked endoskeleton and since it's against the rules at Freddy Fazbear's to be outside of your suit, you'll be stuffed inside one of 'em, but this will spell out your death in bold letters, so the objective of the game is to keep the animatronics from getting into your office. Sounds exciting, but really it isn't. You start out every night with 100% power and it very quickly starts to drain to 0 and if it reaches 0 Freddy will appear right outside your door and you get an instant game over...unless you've made it to 5 AM. When the clock rolls to 6 AM, you win, so if you can preserve power 'til after 5 AM, you're pretty much guaranteed to win.The main gimmicks are as follows: 1. watching the cameras to keep an eye on the animatronics' location (there are four animatronics to keep an eye on...Bonnie the rabbit, Chica the chicken, Foxy the fox, and Freddy the bear), 2. pressing the door light button for either door if you can't find Bonnie or Chica, and 3. pressing the door button when the animatronics get too close for comfort. As explained by Phone Guy, you only get a small window of opportunity to react; the only annoying thing is that you aren't given any indication on how quick you need to be (no timer, no nothing like that) before it's decided you were too slow and die via jumpscare. Also, it isn't advised to watch the cameras, use the lights, and keep the doors closed all the time as this drains your power to critical levels very VERY quickly no matter the night. The only cameras you really need to keep an eye on are the one trained on Pirate's Cove, the left hallway when Foxy leaves Pirate's Cove, the stage, and right outside your right door when Freddy leaves the stage. Really the only time you'll ever need to look at the cameras is when you hear footsteps indicating the animatronics have moved.Now for the most annoying part: the jumpscares. Honestly, I did get jumped a few times myself, but only because I zoned out and wasn't expecting them to be so close (especially Freddy whose proximity is indicated by a slowed-down child's laugh that grows louder.) As such, the animatronics tend to play a wee bit unfairly. Here's the best part, though: break the game down to its basics and it's literally just you sitting around waiting to die.Five Nights at Freddy's as a game fails to be fun and engaging while trying to sell itself as a cookie-cutter horror game. I'm sure that Scott Cawthon was trying his hardest to make something enjoyable and worthwhile, but as it stands it isn't a good game and isn't worth its pricetag. If you want a better idea on how the game plays out, go watch Markiplier's Let's Play of all four games. As for me? I beat the first four nights no problem and only died a total of four times on the fifth night...dead serious. Take it from me, Dead Space and Bioshock are far better horror games."

I call this a game that will build your tolorence to jumpscares so that you won't get scared from just a simple ""BOO!"" to the face so if you want something that will train that and are looking for a nice story play it but just ask yourself this after you are done with the game.........Are you ready for Freddy?"

This is my thoughts on Five Nights at Freddy's.Gameplay: Not much to go off here. Four aninmatronics roam the halls of the pizzarea, and you, as the night guard, must survive for six hours on limited power. It's kind of like Night at the Museum, but spooooky. You start off with 100% power, using your camera, lights, or doors will drain the power. You hit 0%, it's game over(Unless the clock rolls over to 6AM, where the night ends). You have two doors, two lights. See Bonnie (The bunny), or Chika (The chicken), in the doorways using the lights and you slam the doors on the furry-faces. Other then design, they function exactly the same. Then you have Foxy, which bolts out of his domain from time to time, and rushes your office. If you see him run down the hall, you shut the door. However, Foxy does drain the power whenever he runs into the door, but there's no way around it. Then there's Freddy, head honcho. He only show's up during the later nights, or if you run out of power.  The only way to stop him is to keep the camera on him, which only stalls him. When you hear a low-tone laugh, he moves to a different room.The game focuses on luck and reaction time, rather then skill, which makes the later nights a little frustrating. The movements of the animatronics are random each night, which can sometimes be off-balanced. A lot of the time, your doors are closed for long periods of time, which kills the power early in the night.Controls: I'll admit it, the controls are a little funny to get used too. You do not need the keyboard whatsoever, the game is controlled by mouse movement and clicking. Click the door buttons to turn on the lights or close the doors, and you simply drag your mouse down to bring up the camera. There is escape, which just closes the game all together.Story: Nothing here, moving on. (There is, but only if you look for it. The story does not impact the gameplay. You are not directly moving the plot forward, there is cryptic hints guiding you)Final thoughts: While it does offer a more creative take on the horror genre, it does leave a lot to be desired. In Five Nights at Freddy's, the jumpscares are justifiable, but they could use a little more work. The atmosphere in the building is dark and scary, which adds to the game, but the mechanics don't really make much sense, such as the doors. That's why I rate this game 6/10. It's a fun game, but is it really as good as the hype claims it to be?"

But if you remember a time when cell phones came in suitcases and animatronic robots sang and danced while you chowed down on cardboard pizza, you might require serious therapy and a defibrilator. Jump scares might be cheap thrills, but then, so was Chuck E. Cheese's."

This was the good old days. Back when there was one game, not very many theories. I was enthusiatic about this game. And I actually thought it was scary! Later that night, I went to a school fundraiser Halloween Carnival thing. Since it was 5th grade, I had to work a shift for half an hour (just saying I was there 28 minutes late XD 2 minute shift!). I told my friend about this theory vid by TGT (game theory) and he was hyped. Naturally, we both wanted it (ish for me).Skip to November/December. My friend decided he was gonna take the ""challenge""(once again everyone thought it was scary). Anyways, he didn't even take the challenge till around Janurary.Skip to December.Iwas the one to take on the challenge!!! Of course, on my iPod. Yup.Janurary: My Friend takes the challenge.

There is a lot of plot if you dig deep into the game, and it does take some skill to play. You need to be able to adapt your skills to each night to survive. What worked for you on the first two nights might not work on the other nights.The game is also very unforgiving. If you make a mistake on one of the harder nights you will die. You got to keep on your toes. Not to mention the 20/20/20/20 mode which is the hardest mode in the game. That is insane, and Scott (the mastermind behind this game) even said that he thought that mode was impossible.Five Nights at Freddy's is a great horror game, and you should really give it a try!"

This leaves room for speciulation and creation of one's own theory (get in line, there are HUNDREDS of them created by the community).

At day, it is a friendly place for both kids and adults, at night, it is a different story. As a security guard, you are hired for looking after the many rooms in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza by monitering the rooms on a screen. You are placed into a room with one door to each of your sides. Chica the Duck, Bonny the Bunnie, Foxy the Fox and Freddy the Bear become posessed by long dead children, and you must survive the night by any means necessary. 12 AM to 6 AM you are forced to act or be jumpscared in a game that is ready to scare your socks off and send chills down your spine. This game was awesome and terrified me in an awesome way. Definitely one of my top 5 games. Thank you creater!"

But that doesn't defeat the freakiness and emersive detail of the jump scares, and how they give you battery life so you don't be a little nube and keep the doors closed the entire night. On the first night, just think of it as a tutorial. What you will have trouble with is 20/20/20/20. Are you ready for Freddy? Buy this game!

I had difficulty on night 2 most of the time due to either bonnie or freddy killing me most of the time which really started to annoy me. the difficulty stemmed from the power usage and how i needed to conserve it 100% of the time and it really takes time to make a strategy, Overall this game is definitely not for Casual gamers but more on the lines of Hardcore gamers who have experienced the survival-horror genre and had a pretty good time. I'm giving this game a fair score of 8/10. why i give it a 8 is because when i first played it scared me most of the time and it creates an area where you're not safe, kinda like earthbound. I recommend this game to anyone who likes a good jumpscare every so often or a hardcore gamer who wants a challenge."

However, the thing I like the most is once you play it enough, you lean how each animatronic works and can really put yourself to the test. There's something so satisfying to hear that 6am chime after getting through the night on your reflexes alone. It's worth the $4.99 for the game."

76561198058152392,Recommended,319510,15977211,"Posted: 23 May, 2015",all,Requiem,"I discovered this game quite by chance while browsing YouTube for some new game recommendations.I've always believed that I handled jump-scares (occurring at live haunted attractions and such) fairly well.  However, I am absolutely terrified of the concept of statues, mannequins, dolls and the like moving on their own accord.  It took me five days (pun intended) to buckle down and try FNAF experience personally rather than vicariously through someone else's gameplay.  They do say it's better to face your fears head-on, so...sure, why not?I'm writing this review after my first attempt and I can honestly say that, for me, this game delivered.It pretty much reinforced every deep-rooted anxiety and primal fear that I could possibly imagine (and some that I couldn't) leaving me in a serious, full-on panic wherein every light in the house had to be turned on and every lock double-checked.  It was probably a very bad decision on my part to start this so late at night.  So will I be sleeping tonight?  Nope.FNAF is a different sort of horror game than I've every played.  The graphics aren't fancy but, in the end, they don't need to be.  For a game like this, it's all about atmosphere, and I feel FNAF has that in abundance.In my opinion, the simplistic and limited mechanics of gameplay, coinciding with its dark ambiance and subtle alterations in sound only serve to increase the level of stress and the feeling that you are powerless.  Jump-scares are a pretty basic, yet effective, way to get a reaction and in FNAF they are executed well.  The static-filled screens and flickering lights strain your eyes and wreck havoc with your imagination.  Limited resources and a specific time-frame provide the foundation for nerve-wracking, split-second decision making and clock-watching.  Add in the that fact that your stalkers are a bunch of man-sized, animatronic stuffed animals (with eerie frozen smiles and staring eyes) who will never move when you're looking at them - this game can become pure nightmare fodder for some.As you progress, the tension becomes greater; the mood more sinister. The urgency to react faster becomes more prevalent - testing your awareness.  You're challenged to manage your resources and time against a menace that defies logic and with each night, it draws you further in.  Underlying it all is the question: why and how is it happening?  And, for that matter, how in the world is this place considered child-friendly?!  With little information to go on, the back-story is left to mystery and further adds to the suspense.At it's core, FNAF touches on the primal fear of being trapped alone, in the dark, facing a horror that wants nothing more than to happily chew your face off.All in all, FNAF is engaging and proves a game doesn't necessarily have to be gory and violent to be scary.  Is it for everyone?  Probably not.  If your reaction to jump-scares and minimal mechanics is 'meh' - this probably won't do anything for you.I recommend this game for any enthusiast of survival/psychological horror-themed games looking for something a little different.10/10"

Personally, i don't get scared by the jumpscares, but the amount of backstory and thought Scott put into this is amazing. If you dont know the backstory here it is:A man, called the purple guy is at Freddy Fazbears Pizza, dressed in a costume, supposedly a golden freddy costume.He lures 5 kids backstage. Years before this happens, the purple guy drove up to fredbears family diner, and kills a child. This child is assumed to possess the marionette. Anyway, back to what i was saying. The purple guy kills the kids. It is thought that the marionette (crying child) wanted to get revenge on the purple guy, seeing as he was his first victim, so the marionette put the dead children's souls in the suits, there untill the purple guy dies. So the animatronics come to your office and try to kill you. But in the 3rd game, the purple guy runs into Springtrap and dies, freeing the children's souls. Or did it? a fourth game is coming out, sometime in october. If you dont belive me, go toscottgames.com;)Ok,  that took a long time to type >.<also,  i wanna say that i beat the first five nights without dying once after some practice.

I was unfazed (Ha ha) by this, however, and it didn't ruin the gameplay experience for me. In fact, it MADE the experience for me, and catapulted this game into my ""Best games ever"" list. (At number 3, no less!) Thanks a million Scott, and if you're reading this, here's my words of encouragement:Don't get mad at the people who dislike this game. Instead, pity them. They just don't get how true art is created (And probably wish they had the skills to create a game this cool). Just look at Mario (former name Jumpman).  That franchise is iconic, and yet people loathe it (Yes, hard to imagine).  Go on, Scott. Make more games, and show those people that you are a great game developer!"

I could leave it there but that's to easy this game does things to me that no other game in this genre can do (besides me wanting to buy it), thats acually be scary without pop-up scares.Even though the game has them and uses them they're optional because you dont have to view them. this game makes you wait in a nearly silent room aside from the sounds of the shuffling, creaking, groaning and moaning coming from the halls. then when you go into the camera feed to check what the sounds are you notice that somthings different. because of a glitch in their programing freddy and his pals see people as a metal endoskeleton, which wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't a rule that states ""no endoskeletons outside of their costumes."" this means if the furry buch catches you you'll be forced into a suit and as the phone guy says ""now that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with cross-beams, wiring, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area, so you can imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of... discomfort... and death... Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth that would pop out the front of the mask. Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up."" so now the concern comes in for personal safety and survival. your nerves are the biggest problem as they'll make you think that theres somthing outside the door when there isn't and waste some of you precious power to check or try to be brave and not check.my biggest mistake was playing and beating this game at my friends house and not being ready for freddy.now not only am i ready for freddy and his fun time pals but i will survive to live another day and not listen to les toreadors ever again11/10 would play again also11/10 as they give free hugs in game."

It also will bring back nostalgia and make you remember how creepy you used to think the animatronics at Chuck E. Cheese's were. It also has a unique aspect of gameplay and a harder difficulty than most games, I love difficulty but if you're a completionist, this might be too hard because of night 7's 20/20/20/20 but still it's an otherwise amazing experience with amazing jump scares, forgot to check Pirate's Cove on 20/20/20/20 in only the past 40 seconds and you have your? DEAD! This is overall an amazing game with great replay value (If you're not a completionist) I would probably say this game deserves at least 9.0 out of 10.0 in a calculated rating.

There are 4 characters, 3 of which can be easily avoided. 1) Freddy the Bear, this guy hardly ever moves. 2) Chicka the Chicken, this guy likes to jump (move really fast) between the kitchen and the restrooms and the east wall. 3) Barney the Bunny, this guy is my least favorite of all, he jsut loves to attack you while you're using the cameras, also, he prefers to jump between the closet and the west wall. 4) Foxy the Fox, this guy just...he almost NEVER comes out on the first two nights, on the 3rd Night, he peeks out for a second or two, but isn't likely to attack unless you almsot never check the cameras. All of these A-Holes are going to try to kill you as soon as the game starts, I recommend you keep an eye out for the first three on Night 1 and Night 2. Night 3 is when Foxy will actually try.But, that being said, I recommend this game. I liked it."

I took one look at it and automatically assumed it was just a jumpscare factory. Sure, that may be a big game mechanic, but it is and will always be so much more than that. The thought that Scott Cawthon put into this now trilogy is magnificent. The story that goes behind the murders and 'the bite of '87' and the backstories to the animatronics is something that horror games have yet to parallel. There is nothing I love more in a game than hidden easter eggs, secrets, and lore that stretches the imagination. Just look at the craze these games have caused. Multiple channels on Youtube broadcast the terror of the games, and others shine light into the creative backstory and theories that make up the game. Who knows if we will ever know the true story, but as people say, if you can get this many people involved in a discussion across the world about several aspects of your game, you've done something right."

Yes.Will it leave you a screaming wreck? Probably not.Do not believe the claim that FNAF only jump-scares you if you lose. There are jumpscares sprinkled throughout, including when you lose. If you play it, you'll know what I mean. That, though, isn't really what makes the game work: What makes it work is that it essentially winds you up like a spring to the point of breaking, and you have no idea whether or not that will pay off via a jumpscare.There's one issue, however, and it's the same problem Alien: Isolation had, in that it begins to get rote over time. A jumpscare, no matter how well executed, is only scary the first few times; after a while, it becomes irritating. It doesn't help that the game gets very hard later on, with the result having less and less to do with your actions and more and more with the RNG. Ergo, you will likely die a lot, and fear will quickly be replaced by frustration.2. Gameplay – 6.5/10The basic gameplay of FNAF is fairly simple. Essentially, watch the security cameras to be tipped off as to when an animatronic is drawing close, and slam the doors on either side of you shut when one is. The trick here is that you have a limited amount of power, which drains continuously. What doesn't help is that literally everything you do drains power. Check the cameras? Drains power. Flick the door lights? Drains power. Have a door closed? Drains power. Foxy pounding on your door? You guessed it.Overall, the gameplay isn't anything groundbreaking, but it does its job well enough, holding the game up with solid, easy to learn mechanics. The more subtle nuances of the game aren't really explained, but the mind will probably pick up on them (particularly audio cues).As mentioned before, however, all is not well within the gameplay, and it has to do with the massive difficulty spike of the fifth night.The first four nights will reward your knowledge of the systems of the game well,  allowing you to conserve power. It will also help you immensely if you can exploit  the way the game works (If you see Pirate Cove is empty, for example, slam the door shut *before* looking at the West Hall camera).It's Night 5 and 6, however, where the game starts to unravel. Suddenly, skilled play isn't rewarded nearly as much as simply being lucky. Bonnie or Chica showed up at the door? Better hope they leave sometime in the next five bloody minutes. Better hope Foxy doesn't decide to charge you three times, draining a larger chunk of your power every time. Better hope Freddy doesn't decide to cross the level in ten seconds and then stand outside your door for the rest of the night.Custom Night's now-famous ""4/20"" mode (AKA: You set all the animatronics to their maximum difficulty) is almost entirely luck-based, and you'll only be able to beat this mode when the AI decides it'll let you win. For an idea of how long that can take, put it this way: Famous Let's Play Youtuber Markiplier took seven hours to beat it. I will readily admit, I've never done it, mainly because I lack the patience and time required to do so.Sound Design – 9.5/10I'll admit, if there's one thing FNAF nails almost perfectly, it's the sound design. Every animatronic has its own noises, from Foxy's humming to Freddy's deep laughter. Audio cues, such as footsteps and the clattering of dishes, allows one to (mostly) avoid looking at the security cameras. In fact, these audio cues become absolutely essential to surviving Nights 5 and 6 (along with a great deal of luck). The only issue I take with the sound design is the fact there's no real way to tell the difference between the footsteps of Chica and Bonnie, which would add a nice element of skill to the game (not having to flick both hallway lights to find out which side it's coming from, if any).Story – 7.5/10The story of FNAF is, to put it mildly, difficult to pick up on. I'm all for allowing a player to decide how much story they want in a game, but I think FNAF swings a bit too far in the “We will not tell you the whole story” bit. I get what it was going for – You're a night guard at a place where someone got their frontal lobe bitten off by an animatronic, the animatronics want you dead, stay alive till 6:00. Nice and simple, but it tries and, in some ways, fails to emulate the storytelling style games such as Metroid Prime use. If you pay attention to things such as the shifting newspaper clippings on the walls, you can find yourself in a far bigger story, all tracing back to when... (*******SPOILER ALERT*******)five children went missing in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.(********END SPOILERS*******)There's one major issue, though: That requires you take your focus off the animatronics who are trying to kill you. Since doing bloody well anything in this game drains power, shutting both doors and looking through the security cameras will suck away your power at an incredible speed. Considering that, from what I've seen, the newspaper clippings only really start to change later in the week, this basically means you will need to take screenshots, and even then, it's completely random when those clippings will show.Overall, for all of its issues in execution, it's quite a good story being told here, even with quite a few things being left open to interpretation. What is unfortunate, however, is that to truly understand the full tale, you'll need to buy the two sequels.Overall score: 32/40Would recommend, but only if you don't mind being jumpscared."

It has a good atmosphere that makes you feel closterphobic *sorry for spelling* and for people that hate animatronics it can make you really uncomfertable but when it comes down to the jump scares they're amazing. The only problem I had with this game is when you play it a lot the jump become watered down where itisn't that scary and the game becomes so hard that it's a task. Overall loved it great for jumpscares and makes a good laxitive -wouldn't recomend if you gotta pee-

,Recommended,319510,12435298,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,YA BOY BARKO,"SUPER DUPER MEGA SPOOKER.A lot of modern ""horror"" games nowadays rely on the idea of putting players in a dark atmosphere and occasionally popping them ewith a jumpscare before the player is put into your standard-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t action movie style shooting scene (resident not-so-evil). this is identical to the process of a magician playing the exact same trick over and over again. Its wrong, boring, and doesn't define the genre at all.even the amnesia games are guilty of not being able to produce enough of an atmosphere, and frequently relied on the hope that the player was still actually scared of the whole two enemies in the entire game.And thats what good horror comes from: atmosphere. tension. the idea of knowing that something bad is going to happen and you don't know exactly how much poop is going to dribble out of your pants leg when it does.In my opinion the best things are often made unconventionally. Conventional horror nowadays consists of dim lighting (which is reversed by tuning up your gamma) lots of blood and monsters or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t jumping around a corner to chase you.Five Nights at Freddy's has none of this:the premise of the game is so cripplingly simple, the resources used are equally artificial, and yet the game locks you into the seat that your character is in and straps you for a ride through real horror.where most games place jumpscares, FNaF simply sits there, like the animals themselves, and stands idly in the middle of a dimly lit security light, you're there, waching them as they stand there, eyeing off the camera or the doors to your room, and you experience terror that rattles the very fabric of your being when you switch back and notice another one is gone or god forbidPirate Coveis open. and as the game ticks on, so will your sanity as you find it harder and harder to cope with the onslaught and torment of those five possessed animatronics.Yes. There areFiveof them. And the fifth is the worst of the lot.in summary, FNaF does something in horror that is not frequently done due to its atmospheric risk: it dangles the object of horror right in your face, and lets it sit there. There's jumpscares. but those don't even hold a candle to when you watch that purple rabbit disappear from the stage for the first time.may Susano'o have mercy on your soul if you play this game, because God already boarded the Nope train straight out of ♥♥♥♥thisshitville when you started it up.If you're downloading it, get ready to experince the tenth circle of hell: Terror.

And is sufficient to do what its supposed to which is shock-scare you a lot. The environment alone, like an alt universe Chuck E Cheese is creepy as hell, as well as the animitronic demons that inhabit it.But the unfair amount of battery life to use cameras, doors etc, means you have to conserve and frequently sit listening for sounds of movement rather than constantly watch footage. It's a fun minigame, and it succeeds in making me job, and get my heart pumping every time.Great value for the price."

Cheese-style restraunt trying to keep the four animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy from nabbing you from 12 AM to 6 AM for five nights (duh.)The gameplay is kept simple and it's atmosphere makes it very unsettling. The idea of this game you need to stay vigilant, be conservative of your power, keeping your cool, and to make sure that the animatronics don't enter your office, you which may prove to be difficult as the the nights go by. Each of the animatronics have their own AI and have their own way of approaching you: like Bonnie with visit you more frequently and Foxy will come after you if you don't watch him enough.My complaints are that it just throws you in their while spoon feeding you little bit of information at a time and the scares become more predictable if your paying attention. But nonetheless it's definently worth playing if you like horror games or if you love a good scare. If you do get this game all I have to say is you better be ready for Freddy."

I thought it was gonna be bad and easy.I have never been so wrong about anything in my life.This game is simply amazing, it is the perfect horror game. It's simple yet it is amazingly horrifying, the sense of being trapped in one room and just waiting for the jumpscare to happen. Bare in mind I had no idea of the jumpscares and anyone who has played or watched videos of fnaf will be able to guess how I reacted, and how much toilet paper I needed. It was a lot.Recently I completed 20/20/20/20 mode and I was honestly so pleased. I got 9 hours out of this game for just £3, and I still comeback to it and let my friends and family play it.This is the kind of game that makes you fight with your feelings. It's like a war between fear and your will to shut the game down and your excitement to try and finish and reach the next night.If you're a fan of the horror genre then I certainly suggest you stop reading any reviews right now and install this agme.If you're not a huge fan of horror like me, I still suggest getting this game. There is so much more to it then being scared 24/7, although... that is a big part of it.10/10 Wish I had a rocket launcher in my office."

It takes a great step in the direction of what I think horror games should do which is to put you in tense situations with little to no power to deal with them.  It always is tense when you know that looking away from even the doors or from the monitors may give one of the animatronics enough time to move in and get you, especially on the last few nights.Pros-tense atmoshphere which intensifies as you progress through the nights-good graphics-interesting game mechanics that differ from most other games-Last nights are challenging-Easy to play, but harder to succeedCons-Enemy behavior or movement patterns can be predictable-may have a lower replay value after completion (custom night may correct this)-simple strategies can help you progress quickly through the nights which conteract most of the animatronics' tactics (door lights strategy)"

When you sitting in the office and have a big screen, and actually living in, in the game, it is like you are sitting there by yourself. The first time i played it i knew what i was up against. I have watch many videos on youtube of pepole playing Five Nights At Freddyy's. So i decided to buy it and play it myself. And i compleated night 1 and 2 on the first try. I got lucky that foxy never attacked me on night 1 and 2. But on night 3, he attacked me. I was so afraid of closing the camera and closing the door, so i took of my headphones and closed my eyes. I did that 4 times until i decided to be a man and actually try to close the door. I did it, and succeded. What i didn't know was that freddy moved on night 4. So he came to my office and i was like, what should i do??????? He is hiding but still out my door. and then he sneaked in and eated my face or something. I almost ♥♥♥♥♥ed my pants, quited the game and was like, I WILL NEVER, EVER PLAY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥AGAIN!!! but i played it more and more and liked it more and more. So after i got killed by every anamatronics (foxy,bonnie,chica,freddy) i knew how to beat them. So this game is from the beginning very scary and the sound is scary all the way. But when you played it a few times and learned the anamatronics, you don,t get scared when the are right up your face. cuz then you know what is going to happen and then you are ready for it. it,s a amazing game and it,s really fun.

Once you've finnshed night 3 you may feel a bit more confident and want to carry on trust me  i've played on it and i dont find it that scary but i'd recommend to not download this if you get easily scared but i thought it was fun but you are not able to walk your only able to look side to side and then lights on and of and open and close doors. There is one funny thing in that when you spawn there will be a picture of freddy and his frends if you click on freddys nose the will be a slight honk.p.s. keep watching  freddy it slows him down and foxey when he's out and you can just see his head and hook close the doorgood luck sleeping tonight  :-)

Oh also all the animatronic's except Foxy teleport, Foxy is the only one that you see physically run on camera once you see him coming out of the curtain of pirate cove immediately put down the camera and close the left door and hope he doesn't drain the power by hitting it. but the nights (levels) are quite long even if they go from 12 am (midnight) to 6 am. well worth the measley of $4.99 and I hope to get the sequel that is even harder and is priced at $7.99 what i mean by harder is there is no doors. still well worth it. real time for the nights are 8 to 9 minutes a night for pc and 4 to 5 minutes for mobile and tablet edition) which brings me to my next point there is no pause menu on either version and i have yet to try and play it at night because I need to get sleep and this game pretty much makes you not wanting to get any sleep at all, i wouldn't go as far as saying play with lots of people around just play it during the day. well recommended.

I only recommend getting this game if you can guarantee you will not be scared. Maybe try it on somebody else's laptop or whatever device they have first. Personally, I think this game is really scary, and it gives me nightmares, but I still really love to play it. You will get 5  nights, and then 2 bonus nights. On the 7th night, you can customise it; make it easier/harder. I would also recommend not putting any of them up to 20 unless you are really brave. I was so scared when my friend did that to me. - That's not over yet :(                                             Five nights at Freddy's 2 is now out, but I recommendtrying out number 1 first.

There are plenty of jumpscares and it's really scarry if you play it in the dark with headphones on, max volume. I,personally, play with the lights on. The four animatronics, Bonnie the bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate and Freddy Fazbear are basicly trying to kill you. As the phone guy puts it, they see you as an endoskeleton and will try to stuff you into a Freddy suit, with only your eyes and teeth remaining. If you can survive the enitre five nights, you get a paycheck and beat the game. There ARE optional extra nights, and the 20/20/20/20 challenge, but I personally have to get past night two. Watch out for  Bonnie, he's the one who will (most likely) kill you the most."

The animatronics are on the fritz or possibly possesed by dead kids and are trying to stuff you into an animatronic suit. Your job is to make it to 6 AM for 5 nights. This game only really depends on two types of horror: Slight Paranoia and Jumpscares. Every now and again the animatronics will try to pop in on you and scream in your face. If they get close, you can turn on the lights in your doors and they'll peek in. Honestly, Chica's peeking in animation is hilarious. You also have a limited amount of power. Everything you do will take your power away. Once you run out of power, you die by means of Freddy launching his eye into your face. You also get 2 special levels if you make it past night 5. I give Five Nights At Freddy's a 6.7/10. Enjoy!"

It's not so much the jumpscares that get you--generally you know they're coming before they happen--it's the tension you feel in trying to prevent the animatronics from getting into the office, and the sheer horror that befalls you when you realize it's already too late.Nothing hits home harder than the absolute helplessness you feel. You cannot move from the office and have only the doors as your defense, and if certain animatronics sneak into the office, they can disable the doors/lights. God help you if the power goes out.Would recommend."

The staying still point and click method is quite an interesting choice for the game, which I approve.Now, I instantly fell in love with the game when I saw it popping up around every corner, unless you're living under a rock its impossible to not know the games which are Five Night's at Freddy's.The hidden lore within the game is an amazing detail, how it ties both games together and yet still leaves room for your own theories is excellent.The game is easy on the first night but gets harder towards the end, you may have to look up a few tricks to get past a certain night. I had to do that for night six but even with that the feeling you get from beating each night is absolute joy.It took me about two hours to complete night 1-6, I have not tried the custom night in which you set the animatronics AI level. (The custom night is definitely a plus, your goal may even be to beat 20/20/20/20 mode, even if it seems impossible.)Over all I'd say this games worth a shot, unless you don't like games that rely on jump scares to create the ""terrifying"" atmosphere.TL;DR: I hope you're ready for Freddy."

Until I saw that, I honestly thought I had played for hours, and that is not because of boredom. This game is legitimately terrifying, enough that a short in-game night feels like it will never end. The lighting, ambient noise, and general atmosphere are paranoia fuel incarnate. The jumpscares are just the icing on the cake. It's short, but between the difficulty and scare factor, you'll most likely be on this for a while. I have played horror games before, both on Steam, and off, and out of all of them, FNaF is the only one that has left me literally shaking.I honestly don't understand why there is so much hate towards this game or this series. The fanbase got out of hand at some point, but that shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the game. It's not as if their comments or creations are in the game itself."

You watch the camera's and have doors so you can fend off the animatronics! It has extreme jumpscares, and is pretty good priced! Buy this game and play it, it is super fun!"
,Recommended,319510,33258599,Posted: 4 July,all,God of the Gays,"Honestly, I'm not quite sure why I bought this game. It's not that it's a bad game, it's the fact that I'm too scared to even play it that has me questioning why I bought it in the first place. Sure, playing it for my YouTube channel (that never really got off the ground and has been left in the dustbin until I can find proper time to make it of decent quality) SEEMED like a good idea at the time, but in practice, I found this game almost impossible to play. This game terrifies me into a state that's practically paralysis (which really isn't good when trying to use a mouse and keyboard), so this game accomplishes, and quite effectively, it's goal to be a horror game.The gameplay itself is rather original. I've never played a horror game where I was stuck in one place, and mostly powerless to do something. Sure, there's been games where you can't defend yourself, but I've never seen a game like that where I couldn't run away. Although the doors provide some means of defence, you can't use them forever due to the drain on limited power. Being forced to work within such tight parameters makes the game challenging and frightening. Also, you never quite know where the animatronics are going to go, especially during the later nights. Their chaotic movement makes you constantly worry that, perhaps the next time you check the cameras, one of the animatronics will be waiting for you when you put your monitor down. Suspence really shines in this game, not only in the previously mentioned scenario, but also when you run out of power and wait for Freddy to come and make a mess of things.A few people say that the jumpscares presented in the game are just a cheap tactic to make a weak horror game stronger (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist), but in this case, I will have to disagree. In my experience, jumpscares are only as good as the atmosphere that accompanies them. This game does a pretty excellent job of setting up atmosphere. The darkness obscures your view when you look through the cameras, and what you DO see is pretty frightening on its own. The restaurant honestly looks pretty rundown, which probably adds to the atmosphere as well. And, back when the game first came out, it had an air of mystery and unknown about it that made the game all the more frightening to me.The character design alone would make the game unsettling. Bonnie in particular gives me the creeps, though I can't really put my finger on why. Chica also makes some unsettling expressions in the game, but even when Chica ISN'T making unsettling expressions, the off-putting feeling remains. For whatever reason, Freddy didn't scare me much at first, but Freddy's sudden change from slightly not-menacing into aggressively menacing is startling in the later nights. Unfortunately, I have little to say on Foxy. The only thing I found scary was Foxy's tendency to suddenly attack.The story also adds a different kind of horror to the game. Animatronics on the fritz can be scary enough, but in this game, finding out WHY they are adds both horror and sadness to the game. Digging into the story is an adventure in itself.This game also carries a fair bit of nostalgia for me. When it first released, I quickly became very invested in the story, and I spent most of my time watching videos on the game. This game also really inspired me to make art as well, which was very helpful for my drawing skills. When it released, I was in the middle of a very difficult time during my life, and this game and series really gave me something interesting to focus on.There's few flaws I can attribute to this game, but there are certainly flaws. Gameplay can (and most likely WILL) get repetitive after playing the game fully through. The video camera mechanic takes a back seat the further you go along in the game, which is kind of sad considering a lot of the atmosphere is seen through these cameras, but this is less of a flaw and more of a personal irritation of mine. The randomness of the game can also be quite frustrating, and in later nights, Freddy is absolutely unforgiving. One mistake can end a run.Overall, I have to recommend this game."

Five nights at freddys you play as a security guard watching over a fun little pizzaria at night and you think you are just monotoring the cameras making sure the bad boys dont sneak in and steal ten pounds of pizza dough. OH HAVE WE HAVE BEEN FOOLED, you would expect a kids funhouse who would own full walking abilty animatronics to be shutdown at night? Many have but this pizzaria is diffrent, if they cant have a free roam mode they would get ''broken' so you got hired to watch over THEM. well you think if they enter your office they would give you a nice hug and be on their way but no no no, the would think you were one of them without a costume on, and the owner made a stupid rule that its against the rules to not have a costume on so off you go to the spare parts room and in you go to a freddy fazbear suit, bonny bunny suit, chica the chicken suit, or maybe even foxy the pirate fox suit and then you go straight to sleep and dont wake up beacuse the dream is so good (death) and nobody wants to disturb you.as i said before there are four animatronics that are in the game of cat and mouse. but there is also another character that wants to play, he is called golden freddy or yellow bear, basicly a yellow version of freddy, but only peeks in your office if you look at a picture of him outside one of your two doors you have in your cozy office. but he breaks the rules by comming in even if both doors are shut. moving on to bonnie and chica the two sneaky rascals witch enter your office only if you have your security camera pulled on your face, and you use the lights to see if there not standing there staring at you waiting to attack. Foxy: Foxy is quite diffrent from the others, he hides in a little cozy area called pirate cove and eventully runs over to your office to say a very loud hi, this gives you so little precios time to slam that door button down, and yes, you cant keep that door down cuz you have a limited amount of power and if it goes to -1 precent   your light bulb in your office explodes both doors slam open and you are unable to shut them shut and the only spec of light is the left side of your office, your light button is flickering showing the face of freddy using his little muzic box to make you wish you diddnt exist. and yes moving on to freddy: well freddy just walks around the pizzaria looking at all the cameras he can get to and rarely comes into your office and gives you a fright, not really much you can do to stop him, unless you have the right door shut when he is there.Thats all to say really, trollolol and tf2 is epic"

Fun to play on a TV with a small group in the dark—much more stressful to play alone, in the dark, with one's face near the monitor.

76561198087446247,Recommended,319510,12658228,"Posted: 27 October, 2014",all,TTwizzle64,"Five Nights at Freddy's is one of those rare occurences in the gaming industry where simplicity and mystery turn a title into one of the best games ever made. One could argue that jump-scares are cheap and lazy in scaring a gamer, but the way this game does jump-scares is remarkable. With the confusion and fear that lies in keeping the animatronics away from you, the game slowly builds a form of paranoia inside. The A.I. plays on that, too, with Bonnie & Chica constantly appearing and disappearing at your doors. Foxy adds to the stress by testing your frequency of watching cameras and Freddy makes it a nightmare as he makes a straight path to your door, never turning back. With these four animatronics, not to mention a hidden fifth one, out to murder you, the tension only rises with each night, leaving you fearing what is to come in the next night.The most notable element in this game is the unique concept and story. On paper, Five Nights at Freddy's sounds like a lame idea for an indie game, trying desperately to be scary. Spending the night at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque restaurant? And the animatronics are out to get you? At first, one could pass it up as a horrible CreepyPasta story. However, with the freaky animatronics' designs combined with the terrifying storyline, Five Nights at Freddy's is a story I'll never forget, especially after the amount of time I've spent reading up on theories. My Fright Meter hit maximum after watching Game Theory's Five Nights at Freddy's theory.Overall, this game deserves much praise. The unique storyline has made an impact on the Internet, leaving enough plot-holes to let fans speculate on what exactly happened at the fictional pizzeria. The simple gameplay is enough to strike fear into players, especially ones who are heavily invested. And at a price of $4.99? That is a very fair price and I look forward to Scott Cawthon's sequel coming in 2015."

I still enjoyed it being a Five Nights at Freddy's game though, just not as much as the first two.But looking forward to Five Nights At Freddy's 4 though."

You must survive five nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where the children's animatronic entertainment robot bears - at least I think that's what they are - come to life at night. If they get to you, YOU'LL BE STUFFED INTO A FREDDY FAZBEAR COSTUME FILLED WITH CROSSBEAMS AND SHARP OBJECTS MWAHAHA! You must watch the security cameras and make sure that you know where each of Freddy's friends are.The game wasn't coded very well and the interface isn't very attractive. It is permanently set at a low resolution. There are no options to change details like anti-aliasing, vertical sync, etc..Overall, it's a very simplistic yet enjoyable horror game and I totally recommend it especially at its low price of £3.99."

So after a while of watching videos on it, I decided to purchase it for myself. At first, I was WAYY too scared to play. The thing is, to get the true experience of how good this game is, you have to play it for yourself. This game can be challenging, and that's good. But by far the best thing about it is how unique it is to other modern horror games. You can't move, or run away from the Animatronics. Your stuck in one place, and that's the unique thing. (one of them anyways). You are just monitering the cameras, seeing where they will pop up next to attempt to scare you. And boy did it scare me lol. The atmosphere is great, the sounds are really good, and the concept is, like I said, unique. It does have jumpscares (which can't always be a bad thing), but they're only really if you lose the game. And theyre well put together, so the game doesnt rely on them. If you havent played this game yet, I definetely recommend it to anyone who loves horror, or just anyone who wants a well put together game with a change of pace from other horror games. Im still scared of this game, but thats the point, being scared, isnt it? And if you do decide to try out this game..hope your ready for freddy.10/10"

I'm a huge fan of horror that feels amateurishly authentic (found footage or surveillance paranormal activity) and the charm of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is really the simplistic 90's feel point and click gameplay, with the stakes rising slowly and the power draining quickly, leaving you vulnerable to the attacks of these robotic horrors stalking you from the halls of this childrens restaruant.

Thought it was cheesy at first until it got me with my first death.  The darn Purple bunny was my first to get me and i jumped a bit because i wasn't aware much on how to play.  But i guess they start at CAM 1A at top and then move from left to right and you just got to keep them in your sights and find them because sometimes they disable your cameras.  So mainly the object of the game is to conserve as much power as possible to get through the night which i think is 5am because i only got through one night unless they change the hours in further nights.  Only use your doors and blind spot lights i guess when they are getting near to keep them from getting you until morning.  I guess they will soon start to get smarter, faster, and more of them as you progress everynight.  This Freddy Fasbear Pizza place reminds me of a childhood pizza place my parent's use to take us as kids called FUN TIME PIZZA in Mcallen, Tx.  I'm not sure if they still exist anywhere in the world though any more but i guess there is still many more like it out there.  It's only $4.99 so it's deff worth checking out to give you, your friends, lil nephews, parents, and girlfriends or wife a scare.

In its entirety, Five Nights at Freddy's is pretty good. But because of the 12 year olds that haven't heard of four simple words, ""Resident Evil"" and ""Silent Hill"", the Five Nights at Freddy's game has turned from being a potentially brilliant series into nothing more than a mainstream fad. Once FNAF 4 comes, and give it a few months, and I guarantee this series will be banished into the abyss of obscurity. It happened to Amnesia, it happened to Slender. It's the hard truth of the mainstream gaming community.But I digress. When Five Nights at Freddy's does something well, it does something, reeeeallly well. It's not ""just jumpscares"". Heck, the only jumpscares that happens is when you die. What this game excels at is tension. The lack of movement and vision allows your paranoid imaginations to run free and plays you into the hands of the animatronics. The almost silent room, with the exception of the fan that's draining your energy like the AAA gaming developers drain my soul, is crippling, and really allows you to sink everything in, the fact that you only have one shot to keep Freddy, Foxy, Chica, and Bonnie away from you or your done for. Somehow, practically all of the elements of this game combine to somehow work, despite pre-rendered animations, simple gameplay, and stock children cheering sound effects.Is Five Nights at Freddy's talked about to death? Absolutely, but Scott's not to blame for that. I'm here to play what Scott has presented, not play what the fanboys have presented; and what Scott has presented is the first horror game to get to me in a long long long time, and that's not just a theory.8.5/10"

It's FULL or suprises, I won't tell you what happens unless you've watch too much PewDiePie or Markiplier~  I'll tell you what, My first impression of the game, was it was absolutely horrifying. I played with my volume off because the background noises were so.. so spooky. And even then, I nearly pooped my pants when Bonnie jumpscared me.FIRST NIGHT OPINIONIf you run out of power on your first night, that might happen. But, if you don't survive and Freddy jumps out at you, chances are you might need to practice a bit More.SECOND NIGHT OPINIONThis was so hard to beat.  Bonnie teleporting, Chica torturing your soul.. I quit the demo for a long, long time.THIRD NIGHT OPINIONHaha. Easiest night. Chica  was even more active than Bonnie. I even left the computer for a while to eat, and  nothing happened. But, then again it was near the last second when I was about to give up.FOURTH NIGHT OPINIONIs this night impossible? No. But it is very very very difficult. Hard. Annoying. Agitating. You can say all those things. I haven't even passed yet. You run out of power so quickly.FIFTH NIGHT OPINION FROM WATCHING MARKIPLIERLuck? That exsists. How do I know? The fifth NIGHT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. ;) Try for yourself, If you buy the game.RARE SCREENSYou usually start getting them on the second night. But on the third night, you can see many, same with the fourth, and probably the fifth night.**osla eht rehto owt"
,Recommended,319510,13773663,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Princess Ladasha,"First indie horror game I have ever played. I have to say it was as much enjoyable as it was terrifying. The constant fear of knowing that animitronics are coming to kill you causes you to check your cameras, which drains your power, so you stop checking your cameras, but then you hear something and check them again. This cycle continues until you are out of power at 5am hoping someone up there is looking down on you and gives you the miracle of getting to 6am without power!TL;DRDefinitely worth a play, especially if you're new to the horror genre."

The game is great with such simple gameplay and such panic-induced atmosphere - the simple humming from the protagonist and subtle noises the animatronics make when they move, and oh dear me, let's not forget the rabid run from Foxy, or the oh-so-flirty pose of Bonnie at your door, or Freddy's in-your-face ""whaddup foo"".

You play as an security officer on the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, you goal is very simple you just have to survive the night from 12am to 6am. This may sound easy but oh god it's not, the animatronic robots will try to hunt you and stuff you into a robotic costume. The gameplay involves watching the cameras, listening to the sounds and closing the doors to keep youself safe. This may sound easy but you have limited power, everything you do consumes power from watching the cameras to locking the doors and if you run out of power before you reach 6am, it's game over man, game overI do highly recommend this game because it has very new and original gameplay mechanics, as well generating the right fear and tension as you play it. I have never played a game that terrified me so much I refused to carry on playing it and they are very few games that do that to me. Also a sequel is coming out, I guess I will have to go back and I finish this game, let's hope that my heart can take it."

It has jump scares and that is the entire ploy of the game and that is it. Anything can surprise and scare you so that to me isn't horror. It does do an excellent job at feeling the angst, anxiety and atmosphere of the environment that sucks you in to that eventual wet yourself moment. Even though you will get frustrated with it and still jump at the scares you expect, you just cannot stop yourself to play because you want to say you conquered it. With the full price being $4.99, that is well worth it. But since you know Steam, waiting for an eventual sale makes it a must buy and really stupid if you don't."

,Recommended,319510,12730798,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Rexxx,"This game is amazing for two reasons.First is that the game was made in Clickteam/Multimedia Fusion, a program used to make apps and 2D games. However, this game is in 3D and also, unlike most games made in this program, is a horror game. It creatively uses GIFs to make the game in 3D.Second, the game uses animatronic animals rather than: ghosts; zombies; demons etc. This adds a layer of creepiness similar to that of clowns as they are intended to be fun and child-friendly, this is improved further in the upcoming sequel with new animatronic designs. Apparently, the creator was inspired by previous games he'd made after reviewers tore them apart saying the characters looked like animatronic animals.9/10 Did not dissapointP.S. To idiots saying the game has bad graphics, it is made in a mainly 2D game development system. Of course it's not going to be state of the art #SPERMAZINGFICHAIFORCODGUSTSPSFURXBAXWAN graphics...EDIT: Forgot to mention that the jumpscares are punishments for not paying attention rather than cheap scares to tell the lets players ""You scream now"" *Coughs*Pewdiepie*Coughs*"

76561198046041074,Recommended,319510,14456411,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,Gumball,"So FNAF it's a game about the Nigth guard of the Freddy's Fazbear Pizzaria, he's is contracted to work from 00:00 PM to 06:00 AM, looks like normal stuff but just on his first day, he is warned that the animatronic characters can walk during the nigth and if they ever manage to see him, they will think that he is an Endoskeleton without a suit, so as this is ""against the rules"" on the Pizzaria, they will try to stuff you inside of a suit, this suit being filled with robotic parts and wires, so it's very probably that this action will result in the guard's death.The story was simply enough and for me, at least the first time i played, was a very silly one, but amusing. But the developer, Scott Cawthon, added some easter eggs on the game, that revealed the real story behind the events of Freddy's Fazbear Pizza.I'm not going to stretch myself too much, if you're reading this you probably know the plot, but if you don't i suggest you to read the game's wiki before reading the rest of the analysis.So i'm going to start from what really got me, the story.The setting of the game was so original and creative, at some point it got me wondering ""why did nobody did this before?"". And the fact that it leaves much space for theories and mistery it's just perfect to me.But i still finding some problems on the plot, the story of the game can get really confusing because too many things are presented to you at the same time. In one call the phone guy talks about the Bite of '87, and then Golden Freddy appears, and then the poster's change in the hall, and then ""IT'S ME"" it's everywhere!It's really hard to concentrate when there's so much things happening at the same time!But if you're not looking for all the theories and stuff, the story by it's own it's good enough.Talking about graphics, i can't say too much. The ambient it's well made, the 3D models looks pretty good. But something that i really liked was the animatronics designs, they are all very unique and distinct. They make me remember old cartoon characters. But even they're appearance being charmy at one point of view, in another they can look very menacing, like in the Teaser for FNAF 2,the image with Freddy, or when all 3 animatronics appear on the trailer for FNAF 3. So, they have a balance betwen charming and creepy, that makes a perfect combination.So the Story is great, the character are awesome, but a game is meant to be played! So, how is the Gameplay?I sadly need to say that when it comes to gameplay the game really lacks...The game brings an very unique idea of being locked in one position and monitor cameras to make yourself safe from the monsters. This idea was great, as much people pointed out it resembles Nigth Trap for the Sega CD, but in this game you're supposed to trap the monsters, and on FNAF it's the opposite. So the gameplay can be fun, for a while, until it becomes kind of repetitive after the 3º nigth were freddy starts coming after you, and once you beat the game, you'll probably left it rotting or unistall it.But still, beating this gaming for me was really satisfying, it felt very good give Freddy the middle finger after i beated it!Also i have to mention that the game can get pretty unfair sometimes, there will be times where Bonnie will not move his♥♥♥♥♥from the door, draining all your power, and for for completly♥♥♥♥♥♥you off they can disable the doors,this means your dead, the door don't come back to work, and if you pull up the monitor they get you. I really hate this because it happens by random, and after that you only have two choices: Hope that Foxy don't come for you and don't look at the monitor, or simply suicide and start over, but it's can be very annoying if this happens at 05:00 am nigth 5!And now, finally, the ultimate question...Is the game really that scary?Well, i can totally say, the game is really scary, but maybe less than what the youtubers led us to think that was...The scary factor of the game comes from the pressure of being "" jump-scared"", you really don't want this to happen, but happens so fast, that at the end it wasn't so bad has it sounded. It's like holding an Ballon that is close to burst, the pressure of seeing the ballon getting bigger and bigger make it look that the explosion will be much stronger, but when it explodes it happens so fast, that even if you got scared, you just need a time to catch your breath, it's not something that won't allow you to sleep at nigth.The setting of the game is very creepy, the pizzaria looks seems morbid and gloomy, the sound effects also do a very good job, it really adds to the atmosphere.The game it's really really scary when you first play it, mostly by the fact that you don't really know what to expect and what to do. But after some time it get repetitive and predictable.I give this game 7 out of 10."

Taking a point-and-click mechanic to a game where you fight for your life against animatrons can be a lot scarier than you'd think, and that's to say nothing of the cruel and negative incentive of the oh-so shrill shrieking you get when you die... never gets old!Only thing is, I can't recommend it generally because it's not the kind of game you can play over and over and still get the same magic out of. It's a fantastic horror game, definitely revives what have since become ""cliche"" aspects, but the sequel is far better...Anyways, not for the faint of heart!

,Recommended,319510,12945714,"Posted: 14 November, 2014",all,Soko,"This game makes my heart beat fast and it reminds me of 'red light, green light.' The jump scares get numb fairly quickly but somehow they're kinda catchy. I like how much substance can be packed in a simplistic and closed setting. It's also fun to watch people let's play. Good thing the jump scares aren't the only way it tries to be scary. The scariness comes from paranoia and the sense of being in a long night with beasts loose.But there is one major caveat that produces a major source of artificial difficulty: I left the game minimized for a while, not even doing anything with it, and then when I came back to it, all my data was gone, and I was on night 4. Not only do you have to watch out for the animatronics, but you also have to watch out for your save data, make sure it doesn't disappear randomly. I was tempted to give it a thumbs down based on just that alone but it would be like giving Pokemon X and Y a 0% score just because of the Lumiose City glitch. I'm actually kinda torn but the fun memories seem to be winning."

The game almost perfectly appeals to people who grew up with places like chucky cheeses and people who are scared of anamatronics, but is also just generally scary. I'm not going to spoil the game for people who haven't played it yet, and actually it's best to just go in blind with this game, you are the night guard at a place called Freddy Fazbear's pizza, and the animatronics come to life at night and try to kill you. You have cameras, two doors, and two lights on each side of those doors. The game, although it has horror in much more places than just the aesthetics, does have a creepy feel to it. It's at night, the lights barely work, and the animatronics are often in very creepy positions, and of course when you die you get a jump-scare. The real horror however, is the way you play the game. The patterns of the animatronics are seemingly random, and you get the feeling of hopelessness as you play the game, trying to manage your power and the animatronics at the same time. You have to put time in and get good at the game if you want to beat it. Although the gameplay is very simple, and the cameras are a very ineffiecent tool to see where the animatronics are, this is just the first game, and it's not meant to have perfect gameplay. It's meant to be scary, which it does excellently. 8/10"

Since this is a horror game, that means mission accomplished.What makes the game work is that it's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" scenario.  You NEED to keep an eye on the security cameras or else 2 of the enemies will get you, but you also NEED to stop looking at the cameras and check the hallways right outside your doorways or else the other 2 will get you.  There's no way to do both at once; you're always vulnerable to something if you're not precise with your actions, and if a single robot animal gets into your room a single time, you're dead.The game does get slightly repetitive once you get a good pattern going, but in a way it adds to the atmosphere.  In-game the protagonist has to survive for 6 hours each night.  Imagine being stuck in a run-down restaurant for 6 hours a night, 5 nights a week, with killer robots out to get you, with no way to fight them off (You'd actually be fired for damaging the robots!), and limited power to keep them out of your one safe zone.  You don't have time to come up with a crazy involved plan for showing your boss the characters are dangerous, you need to do find the most efficient way possible of staying alive, as a single misstep means a quite literal game over.The scariest, most terrifying, or simply creepiest horror games are built upon atmosphere, and this game's got lots of it."

The jumpscares you eventually get used to sadly, but it's still funny to see one of these animatronics just screaming at you. DEFINITELY reccomended to horror lovers, and anyone who wants a quick game of fun click and point! P.S, the game is not made with 3d models, it is made with pictures.

Instead of being able to move where ever you please you are stuck in the chair of the security office at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. You rely on the camera system and the lights outside your doors to stay safe as the power very quickly dwindles down. The malfunctioning/haunted animatronic characters clearly have no regard for the Laws Of Robotics as they work their way to your office to find you and murder you mercilessly. I can really see why this game has gotten as big as it has in such a short time.

Five Night's at Freddys is about this security gaurd know as Mike Schmidt working at a family diner called Freddy Fazbear's pizza. This diner includes, food, fun, and the main attraction is a live animatronic band. The Robotic characters are Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the pirate Fox, and Freddy Fazbear himself. During the day hours, The restaurant is a place of joy, and fun. However, Mike Schmidt (you) are not on the day shift, Insted, you are working in the after hours. Your job is to make sure that nothing goes wrong after hours. Do not be alarmed, but the animatronic characters tend to wonder a bit a night. They are also very  odd during the night. Now for the Scary part, the animitronic characters have this glitch in their system. If they see you during they night, they will think of you as a naked endoskeleton without it's costume and will try to stuff you into a Freddy Fazebear suit. The suit contains all sorts of dangerous equipment that could tear you apart. It is also said that the animitronic charecters might be possessed by four children that were killed by a mysterious person, and dumped into each of the robotic suits. You are on the Night shift from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM. You have limited visability,limited power, and the only way to see where the animitronics are moving is by a camera. You must check the cameras, not to much on the down side or it will kill your power, and close the two doors in your office only when it is absolutely necessary. This game include flashing lights. loud noises, and a hole lot of jumpscares. So, are you ready for Freddy?"

SPOILERS: It's mostly due to the high pitched scream the animatronics have, and the fact that you almost never see them moving. Gameplay is basically sitting in one room and checking multiple security cameras. I \recommend playing this in the dark with good headphones and you should also avoid pizzerias that have animatronic puppets."

No really. Since the last year, i still think it's one of the worst ways to die in horror games. U can't move from your chair, get out or even use some gear of weapons. U need to watch all over this place. but who will watch your back? And don't tell me: ""The phone guy (dubbed by Scott Cawtone himself)""! Cause, i can't trust this guy enouth to make for me a candwich. But, i don't have a choice. There is a big story behind all of this. It's brilliant. But still, i wish that some day Scott will let the character to move from his chair and give him the ability to defent himself even if it will brake the concept of the all entire game. At least do it with more advanced graphic. The game is very good any way so i will understand if Scott doesn't want to change it. The story will be over soon. So if u like a good horror games, buy it! ""And... if you too afraid to play this game, i will understand"" (singing).P.S: The ""Toreador"" song from Carmen that Freddy sing 2 u when the power is off. Very classy. Now this track stuck in my head in a good way. I want this song in the last game. U know, for some nostalgia and if it will be the 2 minutes version it will be great. maybe little slower 4 some evil element."

However, if you suspend disbelief for a moment and allow yourself to be immersed into the atmosphere, this becomes a rather eerie experience. Additionally, the control scheme is refreshingly different than many other games of the genre.2. The animatronics aren't random. I suspect that those writing negative reviews based on that premise are simply too stupid to understand the patterns.3. Yes, this game is played a lot. Yes, Markiplier has a large fanbase. However, if you dislike a game because it made people popular, or if you genuinely dislike the fanbase, just don't watch the videos.This is an enjoyable game. If you feel the need to b!tch about this (or any) game (or their players), you really need to get out more, rather than diminishing the work and joy of others."

Or perhaps you are just trying to figure out what this game is about and the main objectives? Let me help you!ABOUT:Five Nights at Freddy's is an psychological indie horror game. It's not like Silent Hill or Heavy Rain in the psychological aspect, where every choice you make effects the game in some way. In fact, you don't have a choice but to sit in a room as a nighttime security guard for Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a restaurant where kids have a grand time! Pizza, songs, and animatronic animals such as Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate. Kids love them! And once the place closes up, it's up to you to watch over them. But why would you need to watch these animatronics that just stand there all night long. I'll give you a hint: they don't just stand there.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is rather simple! You sit in an office with only a limited power source. Probably for reasons that have to do with a few deaths that occurred there once. Your shift starts at twelve A.M. and ends at six A.M. You must survive for five nights (hence the name, Five Nights at Freddy's). You cannot move anything but your head left and right. Both to your left and your right are doors. For now, they are open, of course. There are two buttons on both sides: one to turn on a light and one to close the door. Of course, both of these things drain power, which you must conserve as much as possible. You also have a screen that shows you what various cameras in the building see. In order to access the camera, you must flick your mouse downwards, which could get annoying sometimes. I have had times where I am in deep danger and I turn my head to the left, but my mouse goes downwards on accident! But that's rather rare. If you look at the camera and go to the stage cam, you'll see the beloved-by-kids animatronics! You're main objective is to keep them out of your office.REVIEW:It's a very simple horror game with only mouse controls. That being said, it's very frightening. It's actually terrifying. It has amazing atmosphere and sounds. Sounds are a huge part in the game, so I would recommend using headphones (as much as you probably don't want to with a game like this). The game is extremely easy to hop into. The first night is very easy but gets more difficult with every night that passes. It keeps you on edge. The animatronics have a very creepy design to them. It's also extremely fun. It's worth the money, for sure. I would absolutely recommend Five Nights at Freddy's to any gamer who enjoys a scare (and a really good one at that).PROS:Very scaryAtmosphereControlsPlotAnimatronic's design and mechanicsVery funCONS:Why do I stick with this job?!Might be a bit boring a times for some (doubt it)THANKS:Thank you for reading my review! I hope it helped to inform you on everything! :)10/10"

I start to think everything is ok but its been awhile since I checked my cameras. I glance down at my camera and see there is no bunny. It takes me a second to process it and I pull up the camera a second time to confirm that the bunny is gone. Now I'm starting to hear things in the hallway and I start to press my light in small flickers trying to conserve power. I turn the light on and then the bunny is right there leaning in the room and I about have a heart attack as I reach and slam the door button down.  When 6 clock comes around and you still have enough battery to keep your door closed it will be such a relief.I made it to Night 3 on my first go but didnt press the door quickly enough and its really scarry if you dont :(

There is a secret night for extra cash and a night where you can set how fast the animotronics move not including Golden Freddy. Golden Freddy is a freddy suit which is of course golden , which was used for a Birthday at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, basicilly a special freddy to give out extra tokens to the kidssuit with blood. Golden Freddy spawns when the poster on the west hall right next to you. He only comes into your room and sits there until you wait there and does a simple scare with a groan. You can get rid of him by going on to your Cameras. Their are more animotronics like Bonnie The Bunny a purple bunny rabbit with long ears a red bow tie etc. Chica The Chicken,who has the most creepiest r a p e face you'll know what I mean when you play the game, a yellow chicken with a bib on saying 'let's eat'. Freddy being not active really until night 3 is the most scariest and super freaky when he moves as he as red glowing eyes. Foxy The Pirate Fox is a torn fox taller than freddy a hook as a hand a eyepatch and I beleive the story behind him is the bite of 87 he bit a girl and they were allowed to walk around the restaraunt until that day. I think thay got payback by ripping him up and that he went to Out Of Order in pirate cove behind the curtains. He now makes the perfect chance to run to your office as a better hiding place because of your doors but gives you a heart attack. Or he is torn up and they might think he is a endoskeleton and shove him inside a freddy suit which would be very uncomftorable for you and Foxy. BTW Freddy Fazbear Pixeria is a real place! But obviously the animotronics aren't real that would be crazy! Anyway this is a perfect game and quite cheap so definetly do download because it is AWESOME!"

Five Nights at Freddy's may get boring after a while, and you'll end up doing the same thing every time, but the game's interesting story, a unique premise, and a very likeable game creator, will keep you wanting to know more about it as it did me! I enjoyed this game for my first hour of gameplay, and then started playing just to find secrets! (Most of your time will probably be focused on that once you have seen gameplay online.) I would probably recommend this game OVER Fnaf 2, (That game was good to though) because this one is much easier, and if your new to the series, play this one first.Cons: 1.The Game will get repetetive immediatley.2.The Jumpscares will start to loose the actual scary-ness they had after a while.3. Cameras have no purpose, but be One of the Two only Features in this game.4. There are only Two Features in this game; (Playing with Doors, Looking at cameras.5.

,Recommended,319510,14826978,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,Atomic_DONUT,"I figured I'd write a review about the one who started it all since FnAF3 is out to the public. I personally just love this game, for many reasons. One, because of its concept: Here you are, some little night guard at a pizza place, right? Not too scary, just a bunch of old animatronics, some microwave pizza and a guy telling you everything is going to be fine... why would he do that, right? Prepare to have every childhood Chuck E. Cheese memory scarred forever with the eternal burning question, ""Are YOU ready for Freddy?"" As every heart-pounding, tension weighed second is filled with the horror and dread of a band of killer cursed animatronics with you as their pawn, limited power, a camera, and two blast doors with the worst power upkeep in history. But as if this were not bad enough, you've been hired for 5 nights of this maddening torture. ON MINIMUM WAGE? NOW WE'RE TALKING! But there's one more animatronic they don't want you to know about. He's alot like our idle, with a certain golden sheen... Which, again, raises the question:Are you ready... for Freddy? But, really, the aspect of this game might seem cheesy, for some people, mainly because the only real threat is mainly the expecting jump scares, which do get kind of cheesy after a while, but it really does have a frightening atmosphere and a nice back story which has been slowly uncovered in the last three games. All of this strange happening starts at the original Fred-bear's Family Diner, where we only have one animatronic: Fred-bear, or just Freddy. In some of the FnAF2 Mini-games, there is one that is believed to be depicted as the first restaurant, with Freddy giving out cake to the children. A child watches through the establishments sole window as the children are offered cake by their idol. But as it goes on, Freddy seems to grow helpless and slow, more and more unable to move; the children begin crying when they do not receive their cake, and just outside, a man pulls up towards the window. Freddy comes to a standstill and is forced to watch as the child outside the window is murdered by a stranger, and without hesitation, simply ups and leaves without consideration for his wretched deed. This, is what begins the mystery of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza."

And I believe this was the best one in all of them (Played Slender and Amnesia back then). I bought this game last Halloween on Daily Deal as I had a few bucks on me after the Halloween Sale that time. Was going to play it for the first time to celebrate Halloween. I have beaten this game this week and believe now is a good time to make this review...When you begin this game for the first time, it's important that you know what you're doing. I never saw any information on how to play once I started. I died twice in Night 1 and this night was supposed to be very easy and serves as an introductary night. But later on I've developed a strategy to make it through the later nights. I came up with a strategy which really helped me through Night 4, 5, and even the bonus Night 6. I've beaten Night 6 on my first try with this strategy. So whenever you're playing this game, it's best to come up with one or else you'll panic trying to save yourself from a jumpscare.This game was quite a thrill for me, one of the best indie games I've played of 2014. It has really good innovation for a horror game, how you check cameras in a Chuck E Cheese-esque facility with cartoon animatronics wanting to kill you. And the sounds and ambience during gameplay makes you paranoid and makes the jumpscares more intense. But with this strategy I came up with, and plenty of experience playing the game, this game has became less scary for me. You too will feel this game is less scary once you're used to it.Now that I've played this game long enough. I will start Five Nights at Freddy's 2 soon. 2 is waaay harder than 1. I recommend playing 1 first for a while before playing 2 so that you get a general idea of what to expect."

FNAF is a perfect mixture of creepy sound effects, jumpscares, disturbing images, and an all-around aura of ick that will leave both horror enthusiasts and n00bs satisfied. It has essentially no gore and I really appreciate that -- it won't leave your stomach feeling sick due to gross imagery.My only complaint about this game is that sometimes the jumpscares seemed almost cheap. I think it would benefit the game to give the player a little bit more movement -- perhaps 360* viewing -- because this would also provide a ""watch your back"" feel that would deepen the horror aspect.Despite that, I definitely recommend this game for people who like horror without the gore."

Five Nights at Freddy's is one of the MOST scariest games I have ever played.  I usually never scream when I play scary games or watch scary movies... This game makes me scream everytime i fail the night.  It might be from the way the game makes noises or how you're utterly helpless in a small room closing doors and checking the cameras, who knows. But with the startling fear I get waiting for them to jump, I have a tiny tickle of fun.  Each time I fail I want to try again and again.  Don't buy this game if you think you're not up for some fun scares but if you are, I'd like YOU to take my hand and face this challenge head on and conquer the fear of the dwellers of darkness! Send a message to Freddy that you won't quit!  This maybe the MOST scariest game I have ever played but it's also the most fun and you should try it. It's pretty cheap too."

No, you can't move, yes the whole scare factor is based on jumpscares, and yes, the gameplay can be a bit repetitive after a while, but the whole mystery of the full story of this game makes up for it. All of the easter eggs (like Golden Freddy) and their relation to the plot of this series of games are really well thought out and how Scott hasn't made many things verified as solid fact keeps you wanting to play this game, its prequel and (soon) sequel to learn more about it, and you just... end up getting sucked up into this great game.I recommend it, especially if you want clever and subtle story-telling."

At first I was skeptical about the game, and it interested me very little. Luckily that very day, I had a friend over and they said they liked the game, telling me of the main focus of the jumpscares. I myself enjoy jumpscares, so I gave it a whirl and watched the playthrough. Throughout the time I watched it, I jumped many times and screamed every so often when one of the animatronics popped up and screamed.Even though I was pretty shaken and jumpy after watching, I really enjoyed the game, even just watching someone else play it. This game peeked my interest really quickly, and I found myself looking up many other Youtubers play the game, I read of the rumors and lure behind the game's scenes (namely the missing children and possible haunting of the pizzeria) and I found myself hooked, which is rare for me to become so smitten to a game I just found out about.I love the strategy and planning you have to endure to ensure you'll get to the next nights. From checking your cameras, to closing the doors and checking lights, it takes a lot of focus and knowledge to make sure you stay safe and keep power.As for who I find the scariest, it would have to be Bonnie. Seeing Bonnie in my cameras gives me the chills. Then next would have to be Freddy. I don't find him scary, more of most threatening once he starts to roam the building, and eventually makes his way to your right door. Once he's there, I find it hard to keep composure and remember to close the door before checking cameras. I also find Chica scary once she pops up at your window. It's just unsettling for me. Foxy scares me, but I always check Pirate's cove BEFORE the hallway, just in time to close the door, and oddly I find Foxy easiest to avoid, so long as I keep my eye on Pirate's Cove.I know I made a long review, but I just wanted to share my starting knowledge of the game, my thoughts and love for it. I highly recommend this game to those who love jumpscares and creepy horror games."

The duck-thing wandered around the stage and kept glaring at the camera, which I suppose was supposed to be creepy. Let the rabbit stare at me through my left doorway for a while, then he just wandered off on his own. Heard the, ""OOHWWEEP!"" stupid Hollywood scary violin string noise that they do when there's supposed to be a jump scare, and it actually made me laugh at the Rabbit's face because it was so cliche'd, until I got bored of holding the light button down and he left on his own.Nothing but jump scares with mild tension. Not sure why the doors take up power. Or why the place runs on battery power at night. Seems like a lame excuse to create tension. Whoever wrote this seems to think that jumping out and screaming, ""Boo!"" is entertaining, and clearly has never heard of ambiance. Don't think this is my kind of game. I prefer a game that requires tactics and strategy. Being helpless isn't fun. Giant waste of money, and I got this on sale.Apparently there's supposed to be some obsession with the storyline, but what storyline? All I see so far is a clumsy attempt at ""Baby's First Game"" that someone got lucky with."

Even when the game has just started, the atmosphere of the store and the backstory laid out by the narrator leaves a constant feeling of helplessness-- not dissimilar to the feeling of weightlessness at the edge of the diving board. When you lose-- and you will lose within 15 minutes of starting up the game-- the scares adequately fulfil the tension left inside your now-hollow body.Oh, and everyone has pre-shift jitters, new-guy.

But I think the bigger issue is that the game is really just about micro-managing your battery in the most painful way possible.It also feels like there's an interesting world and story behind everything, but the problem is you don't actually interact with the story.  You're just fed (very small) portions of it in the background, but the game play is just hide from the monsters and that's it.  The why has no impact on your character, story, or decisions.  Among other things, this means I don't get invested in my character at all.If you're the type of person who likes to get scared, and gets scared by ambiance and jump-scares, than this is probably a good game for you (and yes, I realize that sentence makes me sound condenscending, but I actually mean it legitimately) but otherwise I'd probably avoid the hype."

However after a while it doesn't really stay scary. Especially when trying to do 20/20/20/20 mode or just dying a lot in general. The game can be stressful, but I still find it enjoyable. Even though for me the scare factor starts fading, it is still creepy as hell by all means. It has the perfect atmosphere and spine tingling sounds to keep you on your toes while seeing where every animatronic is. I'd say it's a 8.5/10."

Ok now errm i think that this is the scariest FNAF.Well because in FNAF 2 there's alot of things happening,music box,loads of animotronics,putting the mask on every 5 seconds and to me it is more scary when it's silent and there's animatronics creeping up on you.Now don't get me wrong,i love fnaf 2 and 1,but 1 is more scary.Also FNaF 3, i hope there's more animatronics because you could just stare at the new animatronic on cameras all night!"

A game that you can enjoy to play or watch as others play it. Great for all ages in my opinion, although not recommended for those easily prone to nightmares. It has a very cute little story behind it and I think that the whole game has been pretty well thought out.Pros: Great suspence, good graphics, easy to comprehend, not too short-but not too long either, game play different each time you play it, challenging. quick download, affordable, after downloading the game to your pc you no longer need the internet to play.Cons: Takes up your entire screen when in play mode, goal never changes (...stay alive), your character is stationed in a small confined office (would be nicer if you could move your character out of the office and explore... but that's not how they intended the game to be played), requires you to purchase it online to be able to have.Overal, I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to have a good laugh and maybe a little jump here and there added to their day."

It's nothing more than a jump scare when you die which is all it managed to make me do, jump. If you go into this game already creeped out by the visuals then you will be more affected by the minor lighting and the robots staring at the camera. The only other thing is power, as it goes down and gets closer to the end of your shift you might get more nervous. To me the most it did was make me jump at an unexpected death and make me laugh when my power was at 2% at 5 AM.I suppse it's not a bad game though, if you already fall for stuff like this then all the power to you. I would recommend the first Amnesia game over this, it didn't live up to the hype in my opinion and was kind of boring other than when I died unexpectedly."

You just sit in your security guard office. and your one and only way of knowing what's going on is with the monitors you can switch between. It's a suspenseful jumpscare game which only furthers your fear by making you pretty helpless to the things that want to terrorize you.Con:1: If your monitor's resolution is LOWER than 1280 x 720, BE WARNED, the game has NO option to change resolutions, not in properties, not in launch options, and not in the game. For many users, alt+enter will work and fix this problem by putting the game into windowed mode, however FOR SOME users, alt+enter WILL NOT work.FOR USERS WITH HIGHER RESOLUTION, they can simply change their resolution to 1280 x 720 for a temporary time to play. If they use a higher resolution, the game's edges will be cut off.So all-in-all, check if your monitor can support 1280 x 720 before you buy this game, otherwise key parts of the game you need to use will not be accessible."

It's characters, and learning their mechanics and just what they did to try and hunt you down, made for some fun gameplay and helped to expand the little amount of characters in this Freddy's world. The community is fun and vast, with theory's popping up all over the place, and debates over small things such as toes and bell chimes.

This game is now a sereies that I have fell in love with and is now one of my favorite games of all time believe it or not. Even though I haven't experienced all the jumpscares yet here is a list from the least scariest to the most scariest of all the jumpscares in the game but of course, the ones I experienced before. No.5 Foxy. This is the weakest really because what all the others do is that they are up in your face while foxy just peers through your door except for the fact that he runs down the hall which I heard scared many players. No.4 power outage scare. This is one of the two jumpscares that Freddy Fazbear has. While your power is all out, after a certain amount of time Freddy will come up to the door on your left and play a song based off something else I forget what its called but when he is done playing the song the rest of the lights go out then after a certain amount of time again will walk upto you then jumpscare you from the shadows. No.3 Freddy Fazbear (jumpscare 2). Now coming to the top 3, Freddy will do his laugh and if he can he will teleport into your office and kill you with an eyeless look and in a more crooked position. No.2 chica. Now we are getting closer and I bet some of you know who it will be anyway, back to chicas jumpscare. This chickens got umph in her scare, she like flys at you doing the animatronic scream for only the first four characters in the game because I know Golden Freddys is more of a roar. (Heh Rhyme). Finally, No.1... BONNIE! Bonnies is really the scariest animatronic character and the proof is that Scott Cawthon the creator of this indie-horror smash hit has walking nightmares of this guy. Bonnies jumpscare is real scary one he is up in your face and second of all his eyes are staring right at you which makes this creepy scare be at the top of this list. Now this game is fun and scary so if you hate this game get lost! Haha I'm just kidding do whatever you want! (: This errie camera and click game deserves a 10/10 and a platinum medal. Scotty my boy you just earned a like from me.(:"

It is a challenging strategy in the guise of a horror game.  Once the ""Creepy"" factor wears off, it still has a lot to offer in the way of strategy.  It runs based on random events, so at times this game will seem to cheat, but that is just the way it goes with random generating code.  It can be easy to rage at, so patience is required for this game, or a need to rage at something.  :)  I hope this helps people out, and hope you enjoy the game."

This game is filled to the brim with psychological torment, and an ominous atmosphere that's gonna hit you like a train and throw you in the deep end of the pool. So, if that sounds like a cracking good-time then, please download this game now! You have been warned..."

There is also a easter egg in the game. Golden Freddy. The animatronics there are energized by night, for they had been standing still all day. So they tend to wander a little. Then after hours, they no longer see you as a person. They will see you as a metal endo skeleton (the skeleton of the animatronics). Then they try to stuff you in a Freddy Fazbear suit, (which is too small for a man) instantly shoving your eyes out the front, killing you. The animatronics are friendly singers by the day, and vicous hunters, with a dark shadowy secret by night."

Basically you're in a room with cameras and doors with lights to press if your enemies are outside the door beacuse you won't be able to see them very well in the darkness which will be a problem then... Your enemies by the way are 4 animatronic characters that will get more active the more progress you make on your nights... the first one is a bunny called: Bonnie. The second one is a chicken called: Chica... and the third one is a bear named Freddy (which is the main antagonist in the game) and the fourth one is a fox called: Foxy. they are going to try to kill you when they get a great chance and you have to stop these chances and survive through the nights... but be aware of the power you have to left side in the bottom corner... if it runs out you will die... possibly... or maybe if you're lucky you can actually make it to the next night... oh i forgot to mention: you have to work your shifts from 12 am to 6 am in the game... and the only help you get is from a guy on the phone, cameras and the doors that can be closed to stop them from coming in... sometimes you can't close the doors that means that you're doomed... because one of them is in your room and will kill you if you put up and then down the camera... You have to watch every one of them on the camera to make sure they don't move so often... but more necessary... only check on Freddy and Foxy... beacause those two are the actual problems in this game... because they can kill you very easily if you don't check on them too often... but you need to be aware of the other two too: Bonnie and Chica... but Bonnie is more active than Chica is... so you don't need to check on Chica too much... but then there are the other two... or actually THE THREE problems: Bonnie, Freddy and Foxy that you need to guard (you can hear Bonnie and Chica step on the floor outside the room sometimes that means that they might or might not be very close to you) ... I highly recommend this game for those who wants to get their socks scared off >:) If you don't find animals scary... Five Nights at Freddy's will prove what kind of hell animals can be...PS: there is a fifth animal called: Golden Freddy... and he can be found in your office if you look on the cameras on a poster in one room too much... and if you stare on him too much he will crash your game and end the attempt you're doing in this game... so get rid of him by going back to the cameras, because then he'll disappear..."

I orginallythought that you spent 5 nights at Freddy's home. After I starting watching horror movies, I found that none scared me. Not Candyman, not Halloween 1 and 2, not the crappy Halloween remake. I realized that I wasn't easy to scare, so I started watching videos and became intrigued with the game and decided to purchase it. At the time, this was the only ""horror"" thing that had scared me. This game is accuesed of being JUMPSCAREs: The Game, and first off, the atmosphere is unnerving and really gets you worked up, and 2nd, there is nothing about the 6 jumpscares that are in the game and they do a good job of scaring you. People say the game is to simple, and to an extent it is simple, all you use is the mouse, but you have to watch foxy, save power, close the doors after seeing them with you lights, and keep an eye on Freddy, making it, in reality, quite complex. The game is very hard to complete and I took an hour to beat Night 5, but it is extremly rewarding and satisfying when you hear the 6am chime! The back story is extremly intresting if you take the time to look at it. Five Nights at Freddy's is a very fun and addicting game and I'd reccomend this game to ANYONE who is a fan of horror, point and click, or strategy games. I'd give it a 9.5/10. I am heavly anticipating the 3rd installment!"

One thing I must mention ""similar to Markiplier (Note: I was watching Markiplier before FNaF)"" I hate Animatronics, aswell as Creepy a** Dolls and Mannequins and etc, but mostly Animatronics. I Always and I mean ALWAYS tried to stay away from them anywere I went (Same thing goes to people at costumes) everytime one came up to me I almost have heart attacks. So when I heard that some guy made a horror game about Animatronics my ALL TIME AND FOREVER Fear, I was of course like ""WELL THAT'S JUST A HOOT!"" and (of course) bought the game for a whole total of 4.99$ plus tax.The game's story is swell (keep me tuning in to Game Theory every once in a while) but I don't think people needed to put in as MUCH depth as the *ahem* ""Community"" did. I mean seriously... what? I forget at stupid stuff they said to make it sound like that ""Oh it was Chica who did it"" or such nonsence that they said about ""Who did this?"" or ""Who did what?"" bull honkey (when are they gonna make that darn movie?!).Gameplay is the ""Just look up some gameplay of it"" part of this game, And with that I can not disagree. This is H.A.R.D, and then theres the deaths that are just CHEAP jumpscares that you can buy at the gas station for .50c plus a stick of repetitive gum. The main gameplay is you look at the camera and close the doors when you see the soulless zombot staring at you with their open gaping mouths. The biggest fear factor is where you see foxy running right down the hallway and you have 1% battery left now thats preeeeetty spooky I mean Amnesia got nothing on that front. The easter eggs are nice I mean they help explain the plot with out needing "" he has sharper teeth so that means he did it"". Overall I'd say watch someone else play it.I'd say overall just watch someone else play it. Unlike a game like UNDERTALE where the main story is not cryptic and the game is fun to play to get the story. This is boring to play so you don't want to play through the game to know the plot, you'd rather just watch someone else play, so  I have to rate this 4/10. Story is good, game is not."

I downloaded the game, and continued on to beat all 5 nights. Upon completion of the game though, the game pops a ""6th Night"" on the main menu screen. After that there is a custom night where if you set all animatronic levels to 20/20/20/20, the game will reward you with the third and final star that you have received upon completing the first five nights, and the 6th night respectively. I however I simply can't beat the 6th night. Now to the actual game, Five Nights at Freddys puts you in the shoes of Mike Schmidt, the new night watchman for Freddy Fazbears Pizza. You are taught how to play the game by the ""phone guy"" who will leave you voice messages at the beginning of every night. (Fun Fact, the phone guy is voiced by the game's creator, Scott Cawthon). The game centers around checking the cameras to make sure the 4 animatronic's stay put. Of course they won't, it is then up to you to check the lights around your doors, and when one of the animatronics decides to stop in and say hello, it is your job to close the door. While it may not sound frightening or scary, once you start playing, the game is most likely the most tensest (most tensest :/) game you will ever play. Upon finishing Night 3 though, the game becomes repetative, and you're just going to finish it because you wan't to.(WE ALL MUST HAVE THE WONDERFUL STARS!:D) There is a main story though that is  told through subtle easter eggs that Scott has thrown in around the game. Once you unravel the overall narrative, the game becomes even more terrififying.VERDICT: 7/10"

So basically take what I say about this game as the opinion of  someone easily scared, if you're a veteran horror gamer, you might view things differently.Five Nights at Freddy's strengths come from the atmosphere it is able to build. The game's ability to work as a horror game relies heavily on being able to build tension through it's sound design, game mechanics, and the design of the locations within the game. For me, it works. The mechanics are simple, but cause the player to focus on multiple things at once, it can become overwhelming for a new player, and coupled with the creepy atmosphere and sound design, causes a great horror tension throughout.However, once you've gotten the hang of the game, it does lose a bit of its edge. Once you have a good understanding of the mechanics, the level of panic decreases, which makes the game, by its very nature, less scary. The atmosphere is great because it builds to the jumpscares, which makes it better than a game that relies only on jumpscares, but like any game with jumpscares, they can also get a bit old, which also makes the game less scary.This doesn't really matter if you're looking to get more replayability out of the game, as the custom night allows you to get a lot of mileage out of the game just from challenging your skills, which can still be fun even if the game has become less scary to you.Personally, I recommend playing it for the atmosphere alone, it's a wonderful little game that's good for a few days of fun, well worth the price, and (as you're probably aware) has spawned an insane amount of fanfare and a huge community."

,Recommended,319510,22348603,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Razzle Joestar,"This is a game that you either love or hate, and that's kinda what I've gathered from peoples' reactions to it.The general flow of things is you are security guard Mike Schimdt, who gets a job working for the now run-down and defunct ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"". You're informed by a fellow on the phone that the animatronics try to get into your office, and if they do they'll think you're an endoskeleton without its suit on, and stuff you into an animatronic suit full of metal compartments that will skewer and crush you to death. So how do you do this? By keeping track of the animatronics via cameras, of course! You also have doors you can shut to keep them out, as well as lights on each side that will let you light up a blind spot in the cameras. The only catch? You have limited power, and must last from 12am - 6am. Run out of power, and Freddy Fazbear himself will come for you.Each animatronic also has their own behavior that you have to counter or keep a look out for in some way. Bonnie, at least for me, tends to be the more aggressive one, and has a knack for getting around rooms quickly. Chica will sometimes stop in the kitchen to make noise to distract you, and also attacks often at times. Foxy must be kept watch of from the Pirate's Cove Camera so you can see when he'll strike but watch too much and he'll come out faster; watch too little and you'll miss his attack and find him screaming at you. Fazbear himself is excellent at hiding himself, and unless he's kept close tabs on will come for you later in the week. And then there's that golden fellow...The game, I find, is very tense which lends itself a lot to the horror. True, the jumpscares work when you're caught off guard and don't know when they're coming, but most of the time playing I feel very much at the edge of my seat. Though I must mention that it does feel like it's part luck based and part skill based. You could be doing things all right, but because of how often Bonnie and Foxy attacked you could be down to 50% by 2am and really not looking like you're going to survive. Or get stuck in the worst scenario where Bonnie and Chica BOTH are waiting outside, which means your doors should be locked, and it's later in the week when Foxy and Freddy need to be checked constantly. But oh man, when you hear that 6am jingle it is one of the best sounds ever.So who would like this? Well if you're a furry you might dig it, since Freddy and Friends are all dolled up like anthro animals. If you like the idea of a scary Chuck E. Cheese it'll work too. Those who take more than a derelict setting and creepy robots to get a scare out of might not find the game that scary, if frightening at all. And those who don't jump at jump scares will probably find losing to be annoying more than frightening. I'd give it an honest reccomend though."

Also, when I first watched Markiplier's videos related to  the FNAF quadrology, the jumpscares made jump back when expecting jumpscares per new game, but nowadays,  I just got used to them. Should I recommend readers like you to buy the game or any of it's sequels or spinoffs? Well, it depends on your opinion due to how much hate FNAF's fanbase has gotten."

The 5 animatronics (if you count Golden Freddy) that hunt you down are creepy enough. But when they jumpscare you, you will fall off your chair. ive beaten all the way through night 6 and cant beat 4/20 mode. Im still trying though. The mechanics are great I must add. If you are a fan of horror games, you MUST check this game out. Also check out the 2nd 3rd and 4th game, those are great too. And dont forget about the most recent addition to the series, Sister Location!!"
