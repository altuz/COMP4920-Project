Graphics are minimal but stylish and functional, sound is electronic and appropriate and the gameplay is simply fun. By finetuning mouse-speed it's possible to steer in the collider by making fine and controlled movements, which made me almost feel like being in that mad tube. The sensation of speed is cleverly reached, so mission accomplished.Just one - to me serious - flaw: the achievements are completely broken. Many people have already complained about this on the Community Forum, but up till now no solution has been offered yet. Some may get them, so may not. Weird.Edited: Thanks to the efforts of some players, a fix for the achievements has been found. Look at the discussion page, there is a thread called ""Achievements"", and the fix is being discussed there. It involves downloading a file from Microsoft, but it's nothing too complicated. The developers should have fixed this a long time ago, so I won't up my score for this.Overall score: 7/10"

MPH? KPH? Scoville units?), there's just nothing else to do or any reason to keep playing it.I'd say the replay value is abysmal but it's actually absent.There's literally like a dozen (or maybe less?) of obstacles that pop up in front of you every now and then. I mean, I'm sorry, I meant to say that this game is ""procedurally generated"".The only other thing that's supposed to add an edge to the gameplay is the coins, which are pointless. You can only use them to buy continues, and since you can get the ""perfect/clean"" playthrough achievements in 30 minutes anyway, you don't really need the coins and they're merely a distraction.Verdict:Possibly the most forgettable game I've ever played on Steam.But, for those of you who need to bump up that 100% achievements count, sure why not, go nuts."

It's a fast paced arcade type of game that takes place inside a particle accelerator and you will have to go through obstacles to pass the test.I'm not going to go into many details, but The Collider is a fast paced game, and I mean a very fast paced game. The levels will progressively get harder and you will accelerate faster and faster towards the obstacles, giving you less time to maneuver them and will challenge your reflex skills.The controls are very simple, you just use your mouse to move the particle around and avoid the obstacles. It also has some controller support so that is a plus.The achievements can be easy to get, you'll most likely get them all within an hour or so. The leaderboard is also a very nice feature to have, you can try to beat your friends' score and it gives you a purpose to keep going further than usual. The music is really decent as you play it, I like it. :)And let's not forget about the trading cards. ;)All in all, it is enjoyable and yet, challenging at the same time. You won't get very far at first, but you know what they say: ""Practice makes perfect.""Should you buy this game?I'd say you should. If you are looking for a challenge or some relaxing fun then yes, you should. It's worth the small price. Or you can just wait for a sale to happen if that's your style.7.5/10"

Although I take this as a mistake, I will not be to critical as this could of been a design choice, as having all this on your screen may be slightly distracting game-play wise.I was also slightly dissappointed with the introduction, as I was really hoping to be able to traverse through different boosters, as this was the highlight of my particle accelerating fantasies. I was also very dissapointed with the lack of ending cutscenes, as I am still very curious as to what happens to the packet you are in control of. as there is no other protons to be able to collide with, I lost loads of fantasy filled nights thinking over the results of this specific collider. I was expecting there to be a cutscene at the end where you finally collide with another proton to cause many new particles or atoms to fling out so I could record the results. But maybe there will be a DLC, or even better, a sequel to the game which might show this.Overall, I found this collider simulator very fun to play, although not very realistic, I had a great time achieving the fantasies I've always had."

I quoted this already, in other review, but I must repeat that sentence: ""It is not possible to see of any psychic experience from common physical elements like movement and masses"" (E.Mach, Erkenntnis und Irrtum. p.12). Again, I think that Mach was not right in his philosophy, while being a genius in physics.All this little game, Collider, is about speed. You're accelerating, then accelerating further, and even faster... until finally you meet some obstruction on the way, and game begins anew. And you know what? It appears that I'm afraid of speed! I wasn't so scared while playing Amnesia or strolling through the 100-meter precipice in real life! I can drive my Skoda up to 160 km/h (100 mph for you, Imperials) quite easily, but I was frightened big time while going through that Collider. Certainly, I'm not of Midi-chlorian symbionts, and don't deserve to flight to the Death Star.Still, I was able to beat this game in one hour for the gold, with all achievements unlocked. And after another hour of idling I got 3 steam cards, each worth quite alot.So I definitely recommend this game! For one, you can test yourself with the speed, to know your limits, and so on. Second, you getting steam cards which costs almost as much as this game without any discount. That means, if you buy The Collider on sale, or via bundle, you'll even get a profit! And, for third, if you not a victim of tachophobia, you'll get a nice easy full-complete game.My mark 7/10. Quick game, nice atmosphere of pure speed. Become the wave!"

A simple concept, to be sure, so how does the game ultimately fare?There is little to say about The Collider, as it isn't so much a typical game, as it is a mild distraction to stave off boredom. Basically, the aim of the game is to thread a white dot, representing the cursor of the mouse, through circular panels that have small openings, some with coins, and some without. Crash and it is a loss of life; crash enough times and it's Game Over. It is possible to continue from crashing via spending the coins that are collected.That's really all there is to it.The main thing to keep the game going is the incremental increases in speed. At first it is pedestrian, but later on, the game whizzes along at such a speed that any form of blinking will result in a crash and Game Over.Essentially, anyone with experience in staring contests and with good reflexes should be able to have plenty of fun with the game. That's really all there is to it, though.Colourful and joyous, there's not really any graphics to speak of, but the courses are a wonderful kaleidoscope of colours. The soundtrack is rather basic with a whooshing sound as the thread goes through the needles.The Collider is a solid game that sets out what it wants to do: get the player jumping through hoops at ridiculous speeds. That is all it offers, though; there isn't enough here to justify a score higher than 5/10."

At first, I didn't think much since most coupons are for games that are of poor quality. When I saw the generous 90%, though, i investigated. Thank goodness I did! The 30 cents I put on this game have been the most satisfying 30 cents in my life. Heck, If I knew this game existed I would have paid full price for it. It is a clever game, resembling one of those old arcade games. The only difference is, you don't have to pay to play again. Its 3 dollers flat, and you can go on and on. No in game purchases to give you boosts, the only boosts you get are the ones you earn in the game. The controls are utterly easy to learn, the senstivity slider is a good implimcation. I also like the leaderboard, because it gives you a goal to set a distance. I love the music, and the graphics though simple make the game pleasant to look at. There are no bugs or concerns. Its a perfect 30 cents spent for me. If your buying this, and you like time killing games that trap you in a world of flying between holes at light speed, then 3 bucks would also be worth it.FInal statement: A clever, and suprisingly visually and mentally pleasing game.

You basically have to pass through obstacles without crashing while constantly increasing speed at a fixed rate. It's quite casual in the sense that you don't have to finish speed 100 to 1300 in one sitting. You can readjust the starting speed whenever you unlock a new one (which makes for quick and painless achievements). My only complaint with the game is that I somehow lost progress after reaching 1200. I tried to record the last stretch on Fraps and I'm not sure what happened during that time to trigger it. Thankfully, you can easily re-climb back to 1300 by using extra lives that cost coins. For all of you achievement hunters, don't use extra lives if you're trying to get the no-crash achievements. Whenever you crash, just go back to main menu and replay at the desired speed.4/5. Very affordable and I definitely recommend it."

Spooky.If you played Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc and partook in the Missile Command minigame, this should feel familiar to you. You're essentially guiding a camera through a series of conveniently placed rotating discs with holes in them. The holes differ in size and shape, which I find to be challenging yet rewarding. As time progresses, the speed at which you're zooming by increases exponentially with each interval (every time the counter reaches 100, to be exact). If you're appreciative of pretty colors, you're in for quite the treat here -- there are alotof them.The soundtrack in the game is an upbeat electronic motivator. It makes the entire experience a bit more exciting, though it does get old as you continue playing. Hearing the same song over and over again typically doesn't bode well if it doesn't resonate with its listener, surprisingly enough. Still, though -- it's a tune I certainly wanted to dance to at one point.If you're looking for a euphoric graphical experience, you've come to the wrong place. You can see for yourself in the screenshots provided on the game's store page.The only indication that you're finished with the game would have to be the achievements. I'm not too keen on my champion status (the game includes a leaderboard), and as such, the game is finished for me once I've acquired all of the achievements available for me to earn.The only issue I've found within the game is that at a certain point, your crosshair is simply too large. I often found myself struggling to see where the hole was because of it. It's easily remedied by proper peripheral vision, though.Definitely worth the price.

The collider isn't very original, essentially a simplified 'Race The Sun', or perhaps 'AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' ... it isn't really that well done ...not many options, variety, or backing music but it works. The game is simply coded to consist of a narrow light tunnel which is constructed to give the impression of motion, with occasional twists and turns, obstacles are introduced which consist of disks with holes of varying shape and size blocking said tunnel, occasionally rotate through which you have to navigate. It has 13 levels which once beaten can be used as a starting point to continue in your efforts to complete the game. These save points make it easier to beat and greatly simplifies the pursuit of the 'perfect game'.  Its all about not blinking, turning up the mouse sensitivity, drinking coffee and getting those reflexes sharpened.... if you're like me and really really _REALLY_ old, its going to be really hard....and you will be writing reviews just to get a break! But if you're not out of elementary school you should be done in an hour. Don't think about it, buy this game, don't even waste time looking for a coupon on the forums... buy it now, play it now. You will enjoy."

It's cheap, starts off slow but gets going and has pleasent music paired with pretty colors. Gameplay is simple: get through the holes without crashing. There is a weekly tournament held for retry coins that you can also earn in-game. It's not Pay2Win. I've never played a game quite like this and I must say it's nice to take a break from shooters, RTS and open world sandbox style games. Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two.With that said, why do I not recommend The Collider? Well at the risk of sounding like a broken record: ""Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two."" There is no replay value whatsoever. The highest speed you can start at is 1300 even if you get up to 1400 speed. After you reach your peak there isn't really a good reason to keep playing. There are no ""levels"" in the traditional sense. The color of the track changes as the speed increases but thats it. There are no characters, no story, no other game modes to play - NOTHING. You could challenge yourself to get all the Achievements but, they do not unlock. AT ALL. EVER! I've seen other people have this problem since at least November of 2014 and people still are having this problem now in April of 2015. I'd say any chance of a fix is long gone by now. I would only suggest buying this game if you have a coupon for it as a way to increase your steam rank. Otherwise it's not even worth the $2.99 asking price.EXTRA COMMENTS: I have no clue how fast we are going. 1300 MPH? 1300 KPH? 1300 Light-years per hour? In my personal opinion I'd rather spend $2.99 on a pack of gum. I'd get more use out of the gum than this game. Thank goodness for that 90% off coupon, only cost me 30 cents."

It's along the same lines asSuper Hexagonin that it's addictive and high-energy, but is basically a flash game.The objective here is to guide a small dot in the center of your monitor through an infinitely long tube comprised of screens with holes in it; you hit a screen, you die. The ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible. If you can guess, the game is rather punishing: expect to die a lot and make very little progress.The achievements are very wonky and unlock all at once after you quit the game. It took me all of 19 minutes of gameplay to get them all without trying--so there's that.In conclusion, other than demanding intense focus and quick reflexes, this game doesn't offer a lot of playtime.

(not saying there aren't people who like to just add achievements to their steam list)-after the first 2 to 4 minutes, you've seen the entire game, no reason to replay it after getting all the cards, even other mobile endless runners have more content than this, and for free.-cards take far too long to come out for what the game really is, for example.i felt like i was done with the game after 20 or 30 minutes of play...and i was, in fact the only reason i have 2 hours+ of play is because that's what it took me to get all of my card drops so in reality, i only played half an hour, even if i were to replay i don't think i'd play over an hour of this game before uninstalling.ultimately having steam trading cards as one of the biggest reasons to get a game is still objectively bad game design and marketing. want proof? the only reason i realised i had this game on my library was because i was browsing my uninstalled games list. after the cards drop, there's no reason to come back, you are done."

Besides, it can help you waste some useless time, if you have any to spare.However, the music is not that great, only 1 soundtrack looping over and over again. The most annoying thing is how fast things end, at least in my case. I spend less than a minute before having to start from the beginning (or alternatively start at a speed I reached before), which makes for even less time playing.All in all, it's not bad for killing time, but you may get frustrated at how incompetent you are dodging obstacles at insanely increasing speeds."

Appropriately called 'an arcade game', you aim at the holes on spinning disks with your mouse-pointer while you go progessively faster and faster. For every 100 mph faster, the discs and background change color. Sometimes the disks spin around more than other times, adding extra challenge. There is electronic music that adds to the feel overall. Sometimes you'll find yourself laughing at how good you're doing, or the way the different colors add to the thrillride here, and it is fun, and even spellbinding. It's especially good for a few minutes at a time, and I also find it fun in-between games on days we play a few games on Steam, and I also found it gets you prepared for better focus in other games on those days...which is a bonus, really. If you're looking at this game and thinking about getting it, then by all means, go for it. The appeal stays over time, too."
