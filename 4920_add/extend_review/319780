It cannot be termed as airport simulator.  If the game is like creation of airport, runways, accepting contracts for various airline co's to land their flights, fuel contracts, repairing, managing time schedules of different flights departures in consideration to arrivals, passanger lounges, creating waiting area and all the things that are related to airport, then it can be called as airport sumulator game.  In this game player is required to do same action again and again and that irritates.  Its a waster of money."

Just to let you know that I don't mind menial task simulators. Keep that in mind when you read the rest of the review.I caved and bought this game. Not sure if it was a good idea or not. Leaning more to not... It's an amusing game for a little while, but becomes extremely repetitive.This game has virtually no challenge or consequence to it what so ever:- The objective times are stupidly generous. If you can't finish the objective with 2/3 - 1/2 of the allotted time left, then you are doing something very wrong.- There are virtually no penalties. You can drive a car into a planes engine at 100mph with no consequence. You can ignore the paths and drive anywhere you want with no penalty. (I cut a snow blower in front of a taxi-ing plane)- You can leave your vehicle anywhere, even behind the wheels of the plane.- Clearing snow is just silly. You can literally just go to the area, start the engine and do doughnuts.Physics is bad:- The Lead car randomly slides sideways at low speed.- If you jack-knife something with a trailer while reversing, the trailers just slide with no penalty to speed.I managed to finish career mode in under 4hrs.  This game is great if you have a couple mins to kill but any sustained play gets tedious.If you are interested in this game, wait till it's $5 or less."

Nice way to take a look how ground jobs is handeled. Hope that gameteam is adding some point some terminal building and free hands to make your own airport etc.
,Not Recommended,319780,17652433,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,RolanDecoy,"Okay, so I had high hopes given the great visuals and soundtrack of the first, even if it could use more in the simulating department...this was not what I was talking about. But then again, after writing this review for the first time, I found out that a completely different developer created this...go figure...The graphics are great, technologically speaking, but it is way off; It gives a disco atmosphere to the game that simply is out of place. For the soundtrack a disco theme was chosen as well, and even though it doesn't sound half bad it still is way of.The game mechanics themselves remind me of those Facebook Flash games or mobile apps; It involves simple tasks that just need to be done quickly. That in itself is not so bad, but for the price of $15 or so I'd expect a lot more. The developers seem to have no idea what the difference between center of mass and center of rotation is, not to mention how a vehicle handles or ac- / deceleration works don't really help either. Expect controls to be fully registered by the game, but react late, accumulating reactions and spitting them in your face whenever the engine feels like it.Airplanes seem to fall out of the sky, land perfectly safe, go from 150km/h to 10km/h within 10 meters (visual judgement, but I hope you can understand this looks TERRIBLE)... There are missions that involve guiding an airplane to its gate by driving a car in front of it. Although I can understand why, I cannot wrap my head around the fact that the mission is more about driving through checkpoints as fast as you can and not about actually guiding the airplane to its gate... The snow cleaning is half-decent, in that, as a Farming Simulator player I am accustomed to those kind of drive-over-messy-area-with-device-turned-on-until-counter-reaches-zero missions, but still...Some things I enjoyed were the missions where an airplane needed to be refueled or recharged using a fuel-truck or mobile generator, where you actually need to plug stuff in, but these missions are cut off once the plane is fueled / charged and you don't get to clean up behind you.This brings me to another point, nothing you do actually matters. It's just grinding missions for cash (for upgrading equipment so it runs faster) and experience (for unlocking new equipment). There is no AI you can employ so you can handle more airplanes at the same time, even though the airport has 16 (as far as I could see) gates, and you have no say in what airplane goes where, because you have no control over the assets at said gate.Conclusion, I'd like the developers of 2014 to be able to continue on the Airport Simulator series, as they apparently know a lot more about what they're doing...NOTE: As stated in the first paragraph, I found out this was by a completely different developer than the 2014 version, and even though I adjusted this review there may still be some references to that game or comparisons that I overlooked. Take it as a sign that those developers have a lot more going for them than these clowns..."

The begining is dead easy until u come to snow clearer, it is very hard to control and clear the snow. then this pushback it is impossible. Update is required urgently."

Moving snow from the same spot almost everytime and marshling aircraft from the same spot almost everytime.  Only buy this game when it's on sale as it is not worth the full price they are asking.

You cant have helpers, you only do one thing to a plane and it calls it a day. DO NOT BUY!"

Although its not exactly how an airport functions, it does have the basics. However, most of the time, when working there, the problems are not what happens outside but inside. The game does not show any people and thre doesn't seem to be much of point playing beyond the 5th section. Once you unlocked the bus and the ranp and the plow, you're pretty much done with the game. You've seen it all. I only played for a few hours, and it felt nothing like the airport. So it is a poor simulator."
