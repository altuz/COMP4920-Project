,Recommended,319830,13490808,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Ottomic,"--REVIEW UPDATED AS OF 07/07/15--(click the ""recommended"" to see the screenshot thumbnails)Do you like arcade flight simulators? Think back to the great games in the genre: Ace Combat, Crimson Skies, Fury 3, Lylat Wars, YAGER; what would you like in a game like that?Do you want pretty? Pretty you'll have. While explosions don't have the best effects by far and environment textures could use some work, AX:EL is one of the prettiest flight games out there in light, colors and environment. The camera and the moving planes give also a great sense of action alongside with non-annoying but very nice touches like lens flares, glows, refraction and lots of tiny details like some destructible structures, flora and waves.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=478227199http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=461741816http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364959399Do you want campaign? The ""Mercenary missions"" mode currently offers 10 missions that need to be unlocked progressively, with objectives varying from destroying squadrons, running search and rescue operations, transporting sensitive cargo through storms, and fighting huge boss-like enemies. While the number might seem a bit small, they are highly replayable, fairly long, include their selection of music (also composed by the author, really nice music, too.) and feature no lives, meaning you'll have to do them on one try, which adds to the difficulty but doesn't make them especially frustrating.Do you just want to shoot stuff down? The Arena mode features deathmatch and team deathmatch, both with customizable bots. It also has multiplayer support, but only ip-to-ip or LAN modes. AI can get pretty intense on the higher levels.Do you want customization? Every kill in either game mode, Arena or Mercenary, or Mercenary Mission completion, will earn you MsM. You can use that MsM to purchase a variety of body, weapon, wing or tail modules, with specific bonuses to each one.Do you want spectacle? Not only AX:EL's visuals will keep you engaged, the planes control really nicely, and the combat soon gets close and personal, with planes struggling to shake missiles while avoiding explosions and pulling insane-G maneuvers. It would be safe to say it's a game one will want to come to time and time again.Did I mention the planes can go underwater at any time? And that once there they switch to an underwater configuration? And that there's underwater missions, as well? And that there's sonic booms, working in-cockpit first person view and different atmospheric densities?Now, while still weak at the finer points of the game and control (I feel like the weapon system should be more fleshed out and general presentation is still a bit lacking), if what you want is to fly planes and shoot stuff up, I couldn't recommend a better game to do so with. Easily over War Thunder if you don't mind the limited multiplayer, and easily over Ace Combat Assault Horizon, period.8/10. Not perfect, really *really* friggin' good. For a studio made game. For a one-man project such as this one, it's outstanding.GAMEPLAY VIDEO:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbXAmqgsazA&feature=youtu.be"

The game is promising, and plays somewhat like War Thunder with smoother mouse controls.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFlApz3hXdsOld review:Well I tried and failed to play the first mission multiple times. Some horrific optimisation issues broke the framerate and it sat like a fat dog stubbornly at 1FPS. I want to love it, but it seems I can't even play it yet. My system specs can run Crysis 14 at 12k.I suggest not buying Early Access games if you want them to work instantly.I even made a video about it because I'm that salty.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH-5-Ji-Gx8"
,Recommended,319830,30738510,Posted: 25 March,all,Hræð,"I've been playing this game for a few days at this point, and here's my first impression after finishing the main campaign (with the alt. ending).PROS:-Game adjusts to your movement style-Controls are easy to change-Extreme customizability (main wings, tail wings, guns, body, and skins for each of those)-Decent framerate (with more than 4GB memory)-Aerial AND underwater fightin?! AT THE SAME TIME?!-Decent plot for single player-Option for Single player and multiplayer (although I haven't tried multi yet)-You can replay missions any number of times-The developer is very kind and has quickly replied to (at least my) concerns (bugs and the like), and is generally a very nice person in my experience.-The game is pretty challenging, which is good because that means that it takes that much longer for you to finish teh campaignCONS:-It can take a bit for the game to adjust to your style-If you're dealing with a lot of enemies, your FPS can drop from a relatively smooth 30-45FPS to 7-15FPS-Some of the ships are quite expensive (they're worth it tho)-The main campaignisa little bit on the short sideRATING: a solid 8.5/10. Very good game, with support easily within 24hrs (dev contacted me within like 5 or 6 hrs). Controls are easy to learn, the fighting style is fast-paced and will leave you on the edge of your seat with your butt clenched tighter than it's ever been clenched before (trust me, your mom said so ;) )."

Because yes, I totally know how a real spaceship who can go underwater drives. The customisation is great and the graphics are beautiful. They may be less beautiful under the sea, even if a certain singing crab called Sebastian could disagree on that point.The solo mode at the moment is really satisfying, I still didn't tried the online multiplayer but I already have a lot of fun.If you want to craft your own personnal amphibious Starfighter and pilot it in an awesome world, take this game."
,Recommended,319830,19286763,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Matt,"Absolutely great game; has a LOT of potential to become even better.Pros:Great combat flight model, theres no flight assist here.Graphics are amazing for a guy doing this on his own, don't get me wrong it's no AAA graphics on a multimillion pound engine but you'll struggle to complain about them.Missions are challenging but there's moments of ""oooooh i get it!"" when you realise what you need to do, and whether you need to turn and fight or just run.Fast paced combat(Jump in an Arena match, 32 bots and a high score threshhold, you'll see what i mean).Potential Potential Potential, the dude developing this game seems very active and i've had a few conversations with him about improvements/bugs, his head's in the game.Cons:The menus are basic, but not hard to navigate, the light blue/cyan can be overpowering; needs a polish?A few bugs/glitches but any i've raised have been fixed.Few things missing that make flight combat easier; enemy direction pointers on the hud, if you get outturned it's difficult to find the enemy again as the combat is very fast pacedYOU HAVE CRASHED, you'll see what i mean :PFor the price of this game it's great, it's one of those games you can dive in for an hour/2 hour and just blitz, save your progress and jump off, rinse, repeat. There's things that could be better, and new things that could be implemented, though as of writing this i've already put a fair few hours into it and i've enjoyed it a massive amount.Get involved, it wont dissapoint you."

,Recommended,319830,14831333,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,Stalker1o2,I'm giving this a Postive review because its awesome in a way of the Idea of the game its Different I like the fighting style in it.The only issure I have is I have a hard time seeing in it even with the settings maxed this may because of my system but no reason for a negative review for something that could be my system in general.Keep Up the great Work!
76561198009234364,Recommended,319830,30605342,Posted: 18 March,all,hijackyl,"at 1st there were major issues with very erratic gamepad sticks, but was ok with a mouse, however the dev fixed this in 24hrs with a very smooth test patch, [edit 5-17] - however the issue still occurs occasionally, but not as game breaking as before.Physics - the serene boost/glide flight style with airy sound effects make this feel like a starfighter 3000 [ps1] sequel to me, which is the best flight game i ever played.Gameplay - varied, challenging missions like underwater caves and above ground canyons, with a mix of air/ground targets.GFX - has some pretty basic [even ugly at times] ground texturing, but the water, sky and seaweed is ok. explosions are satisfying.SFX - love the eerie atmospheric sound [with music off] while underwater"

The looks of the enviroment are awesome and the fighters (usually) fly pretty well. I honestly wish there was more options to customize your fighters, more than just a wing/tail changes for the creatable fighters, and more maps"
76561198082440113,Not Recommended,319830,25060777,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,D-Glad,"This game sounds awesome; something like a more customizable Ace Combat. At least, that's what I imagined. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really deliver on that. I really enjoy flight sim games, but this one was pretty frustrating in that regard; there were times when I would spawn into a match dead, because I became targeted before I had the controls, the enemies do high amounts of damage that is largely unavoidable, and the controls are clunky and sluggish. As for the customization, you can only pick from about a dozen aircraft, with different options for tails, wings, and weapons, and that's it. The weapons and customizations are identical for all vehicles (except for the few that can't be customized at all), so they can all only look slightly different, and fly slightly different, and play slightly different. I was so excited by the idea of this game, but it has done nothing but disappoint me."

(The guy behind this game is just working alone in all areas: artistic, creative and engineering stuff as well.)A good example of how make a fun 3D airplane shooting game for PC.Great job!"

FLight is pretty difficult when you can't even fly its easyer to stall in the air and just rotate and fire than actually fly the air/water craft.
