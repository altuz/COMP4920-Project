It's short though: we beat it with full credit in a few hours (whatever my play time is). I bought it in a bundle on sale and would say grab it under the same conditions.Most of the achievements are gained just through playing, and I managed 100% completion without my difficulty. Doubt there is much replayability here."
,Not Recommended,319850,31048442,Posted: 9 April,all,Rammix RL_chat_off,"I liked the gameplay, mostly. This game is okay to spend some time, like an average puzzle game.But I'm posting a negative review because of these points:1) no steam cloud support: it's a light game resourcewise, but you can't comfortably move your saves from one pc to another or to a laptop;2) when you delete this game, the savefiles stored in the unity3d folder stay there as they should, but the game doesn't recognize them if you reinstall it, your saves are just gone for it (maybe there is a workaround to force the game to read them, but a simple puzzle is not worth any such effort);3) devs completely ignore steam forums."

Actually i did have almost as much fun; but, i finished the whole thing in 3 hours, without looking at online solutions.Pros:-Somewhat reliable physics, they are not too random.-protect your allies and destroy your enemies modes are fun.-Funny themes, art and music, story is a plus(original has no story) even if it is VERY simplistic.Cons:-Game doesnt care about selected language even after switching back and forth.-MUCH too easy!-Can't build slope decks at all.-No real replayability.-Not enough stages, could use 2 or 3 times more for a real experience.-VERY pricy for such a short gametime(cost me more than 3$ an hour).All in all, fun game, reliable and well made but NOT at all worth it's regular price.Buy this game if you are a bridge builder fan, but only if its priced around 3$.I Cannot recommend this game at this price, even at 50% it's too pricy.Would not spend 11$ again 5/10"

Albeit I have only finished Chapter 1 I find it quite easy to make a bridge to pass the level, but it is challenging to build a bridge that is under the target budget.The downside is the soundtrack and the sound effects, which could be better and have volume control other than just on/off."

,Not Recommended,319850,21665016,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Armesis,"This may seem like a fun game with many ways to complete a level, but the truth is that creativity is very much limited. The placement of support joints is very restricted and many times, joints/lashings will refuse to connect to each other, forcing the player to abandon logic and basically build the bridge the way the game intended it to be built. Overall this game ends up frustrating because it takes away our freedom to build creatively, and forces us to use the same designs to succeed. Only buy this at 90% off."

76561198022266051,Recommended,319850,17466781,"Posted: 9 August, 2015",all,OakenPants,"""Bridge Constructor: Medieval""is a great little ""bridge builder"" game, and a little more polished than the preceding""Bridge Constructor""game and also adds a few little twists.In addition to the traditional levels where you simply build a bridge across the gap, there are new challenges where you are to reinforce an existing bridge to make it withstand boulders slamming against it, and also to add a cover to the bridge to protect the crossers.  Other new challenges have you build a bridge that is designed to collapse under the weight of the advancing enemy army.  If your bridge collapses too soon, they turn around -- collapse too late, and some of the army still makes it across.  It was a nice challenge to get it collapse at ""just"" the write time!I also like how the ""Crown"" challenges were implemented in the game of reaching the advanced goal, such as building the bridge under even lower cost, or destroying the entire advancing army and not just a smaller number of them.I set out to achieve all the Crowns from the beginning and it took me close to7 hours to achieve 100% of the achievements per Steam.All in all, a better bridge builder than its""Bridge Constructor""predecessor and certainly worthwhile if you like the genre.  8 out 10."

76561198005804164,Not Recommended,319850,16116537,"Posted: 1 June, 2015",all,Pastulio,"Just not fun. You don't really get to build any crazy or wildly designed bridges, while at the same time, you are hamstrung by resources even when you are trying to build a simple and practical bridge. I get that it is a puzzle game but it would have been more fun if it was about finding a way to surpass an obstacle, rather than figure out how the developers want me to construct the bridge using the fewest and cheapest materials.Pros - RUNS GREAT!Cons -  No creative solutions to levelsVerdict - I don't recommend it. It's probably no the game you think/hope it is."

Kept running the levels and the bridges kept on tumbling down for no logical reason and after ~10 tries (without altering the bridge at all) the bridge did withstand the level as it should have.But I suppose if youre not like me and get annoyed in games like these by random occurances you just might enjoy this game."
,Not Recommended,319850,19988120,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Pigbull320,"Not the greatest game in the world, you only have road, steel, wood, roof, and string.You cant angle road so it's always flat.Theres not that many levels, you can beat it in three or five hours.(my play record i high because i fell asleep while playing)."
,Recommended,319850,13927174,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,.ĐĿ. Cрезена,"Its another bridge constructor this time with trebuchets (incoming only sadly). I think I might have liked the original better because it allowed for sloped bridges which was fun and added some extra challenge I thought. This one tries to make up for it with new modes and has a better (or really at all) story as you take on the role of the royal architect during an attack on the kingdom. You have to build 3 different kinds of bridges, regular bridges, roofed bridges that can withstand flying boulders, and booby trap bridges designed to collapse but not until all the enemies are on them.My biggest gripe though is the inconsistency in the physics. Some designs will work one time and fail another with the exact same design. Sometimes a unit will make it across a bridge thats startign to crumble, other times it wont. Sometimes a bridge will collapse and sometimes it wont. I noticed that if i scroll between my virtual desktops causing CPU load to climb it seems to make the physics run in a more shallow iteration, its possible this could be advantageous to someone stuck on a challenge I guess but it was just kind of annoying to have a design fail then spend 15 minutes messing around changing it only to find that the original was actually perfectly functional and I had an unlucky run the first time."
,Recommended,319850,13280924,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,retakrew7,Why is this awesome? Because you have mission where you build the bridges as traps and your goal is to let the bridge collapse beneath the enemies' feet at the right moment.10/10 would build unstable bridges again.

,Recommended,319850,14180770,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,SnugSnug,"Would recommend for anyone who likes to work their way through a series of fixed challenge puzzles in a casual environment.Simplistic design but easy to use interface and varied challange. Music and graphics while not particularly important to this genre are pleasant enough and the cameo dialogues between scenarios are amusing enough even if irrelevant.Game features several different puzzle types and these vary in challange over the course of the campaign... missions are sequential and require unlocking by beating previous challange.Steam acheivements and graded success offers additional challange.Gameplay wise each scenario is a fixed puzzle but with more than one working solution. Design and simulation are seperated with no time limits or punishment for failure allowing one to watch and tweak their design and the visual stress mechanics allows one to easily see where the forces are being applied and which areas of the design are failing/strong.Each scenario remembers the last design used, has a limited number of design saves and an easy reset for clearing the screen quickly if starting again from scratch. The first few missions/scenarios serve as a tutorial but don't reveal all of the tips n tricks."

Theres not too much innovation going on here.)"
