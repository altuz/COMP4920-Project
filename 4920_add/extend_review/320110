,Recommended,320110,11903709,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,Andre,"All aboard! Bought this for my 4 year old. He had a great time, we'll play more I'm sure.You build train tracks, put down buildings, rocks, trees, people, and more. Lots of objects to choose from so you can be creative. The building controls are dead simple. Just a few menus that let you place objects, change their size and rotation, change the weather, all basic stuff that works well.Then you choose a train and drive it around the track. When the train hits anything it explodes, so there is lots of fun to be had creating some big destruction. The train controls are almost nonexistent - just pick your train and it starts to move, all you can do is change the speed. But that’s enough, it’s not as much of a game as it is a playset.You can download tracks that others have made, and that’s a good way to get into some instant action. You can share your tracks too.The visuals are nice. Bright and colourful, music and sound aren’t annoying. All in all a nice package. For $3, totally worth it if you have a kiddo who likes trains."

,Recommended,320110,13729280,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Happy,Train Town is a nice experience. The game is very colorful and has fair graphics. It's not as much space as I was hoping for to build a world but it is enough to build a small city. You can blow the trains up once you get bored of watching them. The music is personally my favorite part. It is very cheerful and uplifting.

Whatever your expectation, you really won't get anything from it.It's like a baby simulation that doesnt really have any physical rules.   There's really nothing to the game but an open (tiny) sandbox and an ability to lay a track and scenery items.  The problem is there's no real logic to any of this, it's just about randomly plopping junk onto a small screen, and then .... watching in boredom.I have three sons, aged almost 2, 3.5 and 5.5 .. and they all were bored to tears by this non-game.It was clearly a dodgy little iPhone game, and they thought ""maybe we can make some $$$ launching this on Steam"".  When porting for the PC, the developer didn't even bother to update basic text .. the controls all say ""touch this"", or ""swipe your finger to the left"".I wouldn't ordinarily write a review unless a game were truly superb or utterly utterly crap..... save your money, if you want a nice learning train game for kids you can get Sid Meiers RAILROADS, or a bunch of simulators out there, some real world, some kiddy oriented.But this game is awful, a total fraud, ripoff, DO NOT BUY."

There is no object to the game other than building a little city and seeing what happens, there are lots of vehicles and people they can add to the trains and other objects.This is obviosuly a port of a tablet game and I wish some of the controls took better advantage of desktop screen (there are a lot of scrolling menus that could be bigger for less scrolling) and I wish the advanced controls to rotate objects weren't so klunky but overall the title is worth the money."

Sometimes portions of the track loops back on itself or disappears on himFour year old thinks camera movement is backwards (He has other games you drag the way you would want to go), would be nice to have option of changing this.Placing road is difficult for us, not sure how it is supposed to work.No additional game modes other than free play.  I'd make a game mode where the kids can collect coins by having the train pass over them - they would have to build the track out to that spot. You could then expand with the whole idea of levels and accomplishments. Or instead of coins you could do letters and have them spell words, educational is nice. I understand that to keep a product this price you can only expect so much and I don't usually spend much for kid games.Other ThoughtsMy son has spent the most time running the train over the characters to make them splat, he finds this amusing."

I build the tracks with my nephew and he likes to crash the trains. big fun! there are diffent types of trains to pick from. theres steam trains to rocket trains. its not one i would play but its a blast to play with a child to see them laugh.
,Recommended,320110,13491137,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Spizy Chicken,"My 4 year old son loves this game! A fun train sandbox game for Kids! I'd say ages 4 to 7, but even as a parent I have fun tinkering around with it.Catchy music, fun sandbox style. There are multiple train styles from Steam to Sesiel to super fast rocket trains.You can run trains on pre-made tracks, or build your own from scratch! It's super easy to move the tracks around and make your own layout. You can add buildings, trees, and objects too.YES, you can also CRASH your trains too!"

,Not Recommended,320110,32326154,Posted: 10 June,all,Brimstone,"Poor controls, and pre-made maps will not download. Basically just a bunch of pre-made track pieces on a map builder.All trains start in the same point as well, poor help/advice.Ported from Android, no refinement, refers to tapping.No purpose, no game modes it seems.Waste of money, do not buy."
,Not Recommended,320110,34115877,Posted: 8 August,all,weregamer,"Really disappointing. There are no switches, bridges, tunnels, stations. You can put many curves in your single closed loop of track if you are very very patient, but that's it.I had hoped that my preschooler could be more actively in control of this than when we play Sid Meier's Railroads together, but I'm not even going to show it to him because he'd find it so boring."
