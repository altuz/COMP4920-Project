,Recommended,320140,17362520,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,Producer-san,"Tokyo Drift? Initial D? VDrift? If anything of this appeals to you, this might too.In any case, this game's remarkable. It's challenging, exciting and unforgiving. But let me tell you, it's just as satisfying once you get a feel for it.You start out in a minimalistic world, sitting in the infamous Toyota Trueno AE86. Your destiny? Drift. A brief tutorial follows, which will probably result in you crashing into walls a lot, but that's fine, as nothing else really is needed to understand how this game works! The game then releases you into a free-roaming environment with a few missions you have to do to unlock more stages. You can then also select stages, cars and tracks once in Free-roam mode, a bit like in NFS or other racing titles.As you get more familiar with the controls, the stages get more exciting and challenging/longer. They also come in several formats: Lap-based drift-tracks, Driftkhana, which is a highscore time-attack inside an arena, or mountain sprint tracks. The goal is always the same, drift gracefully, score points, interact with objects such as poles to drift past or boxes to shatter, add that up to the final score and remain away from hitting walls or losing your combo. Sounds easier than it is, trust me, the Japanese themed tracks and names will kick into your curb at first.That said, car handling is the key, each car has their own way of handling, so finding what suits you most will be the way to go. Ontop of that, drifting's the deal, so going fast won't always be the key to success either. Manual or automatic shifting? How high should be the turning sensitivity? Well, all these factors will help you optimize your driving style, making it possible to reach up to be the drift king.I personally had, and will have a blast with this title in the future. It's been a while since I found an appealing drifting/racing experience and I can safely say this game has done it right. Now go... Go... and be the next Drift-King."

,Recommended,320140,17299909,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,PcmciaKai,"Let me try to describe how I feel about this game. In fact, let me swoon over it, let me drool all over my keyboard. This game feels absolutely perfect. Surely it is not a perfect game as there should/could be still some content added like maybe a simple map designing tool (with workshop support?). This game actually looks very simple, the surface is white and each of your tyres leaves skidmarks to see how smoothly each of your four wheels cleared a corner. Important things are coloured red.I am not cutting to the chase, but the feeling of ""Absolute Drift"" is just great. this game lets you peacefully control a car sliding around a menu-like open map with objectives to do and areas to unlock. There are special tracks for each gamemode which can be entered. The atmosphere is well-rounded with an electronic soundtrack, subtle tyre squealing and rich car sounds.I like to drive the car of my family in real life and I got experience with racing games like ""Live For Speed"", ""SHIFT 2 Unleashed"" or ""BeamNG.drive"". So before I tried this game I already had some drifting experience (using a steering wheel), which most likely helped me get into this game quickly.If you are not sure, whether you like the game mechanics, you can check for a demo on indieDB, though it is by far not as developed as the final game.So should you buy this game and support the developers? Definitely, yes!Well, given that you are into going sideways, but if you are looking at this, you probably are."
,Recommended,320140,22920659,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Dark Swordsman,"So, here it is. My review.At time of posting, I have all the achievements and have 50 hours in the game.First of all, just a general comment: I love this game. It has a great, smooth game engine and the controls are fairly easy to me. It wasn't too hard to pick up, and learning some drifiting from Assetto Corsa and driving my Miata IRL, I can say that the physics are very realistic and it's easy to apply those skills into this game.Here's a list for the TL:DR, and it's at the top (you're welcome):Pros:- Smooth Game Engine- Difficulty Settings are Spot On- Controls on Every Difficultly Setting are Great- Music is Great (Especially C41; sorry Nyte, your music is still great, lol)- Colors are Great- Online Leaderboards- Fairly wide selection of Maps- Driftkhana, Drift Tracks, and Mtn Drift settings are awesome to choose from- Game is Updated at a Good Pace- Game as a Whole was Tailored for a Wide audience- Wide Range of Adjustable Graphics Settings to Fit your Performance Needs- Different cars fit different people, but aren't too unbalanced in terms of full capabilites.- Free-Roam. Yesssssss...- Less than 500 MB (currently)- Very Fair and Rewarding Point system that pushes you to try harderCons:- Non-customizable Controls (Steam Controller's Reprogramming Defeats this Con)- No-multiplayer, yet (for reasons)Otherwise, this game is perfect in my opinion.Okay, now the novel:Personal CommentsI have owned this game since August 2015 and have really been off and on with it. I can tell you that once I got a Steam Controller, everything changed, and I loved how the game played with it. Honestly, I couldn't play it on anything but the highest difficulty.PhysicsThe physics are phenomenal. I don't think I have ever played such an arcad-ey styled game with such realistic physics. It totally replicates real life (or damn near it) and the developer did such a great job with it. From what I have seen, there are no current bugs in the game's physics and I see no reason for the physics to be modified at all.GraphicsThe graphics are great aswell. I think that the color theme is perfect for the (not so much) ""JDM/Dorifto"" and (but more) Japan feel. It is a little brutal on the eyes when you're in a dark room or are very tired, but otherwise, it is very fun and keeps you alert. I really enjoy how the tire marks work. They really help when you are drifitng if you need to see if you're angle is going too far (genenrally more than 90º), and they look cool. The graphics, in general, may seem a little bland at times, but it really keeps you focused on what you're doing. Plus, this game isn't really about looks, it's more about the gameplay.Gameplay/ControlsAny kind of controller (I use a Steam Controller) is nearly a must. Keyboard is simply not enough to fully enjoy and get good at this game, but it is still playable. It really sucks that you can't change the controls in game, but the Steam Remapping or something like motioninjoy could help with that.The actual controlling on all difficulties is great and accurate to their names. The hardest difficulty feels butter smooth and is what I use all the time. If you take your time, you can really learn the game and get good with a car that fits you. I personally work well with ""The Original,"" but who knows what you might be great with. Also, there is always a mixture of challenging yourself, the music, and the map you're on that can give you different moods within the game.This game is also very fun and easy to get back into and keep with. I think that in general, it may get boring after you completely master (rank 1) all of the maps and finish the campaign, but it would take a long time (probably no less than 150 hours) before you get to that point. At least for me, the game pushes me to try harder and be the best at any map I try. I am currently, as of this review, number 4 on Mt. Nikko with about 300,000 points to go to number 1. It's taken me about 15 hours to get to that point and I don't plan on stopping until I am at number 1.Last WordsThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I don't even think curse words can explain how awesome this game is. I think that the game has come a very long way in the past 9 months and I think that it has amazing potential.funselektorlabsdeserves a lot of credit for the creation of this game. I can't wait to see how this game evolves because it would be a shame if it were to stop where it is. However, it wouldn't be horrible because the game is already amazing as-is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Points SystemThe point system is very fair and I think I have it figured out, in general. Here's my thoughts:- Depending on drifting direction, a sideways-sliding score is given, and it's when the most rear wheel in a drift (if you're going right, it's the rear right) is farther out than the forward wheel (if you're drifting around a right corner, it's your left front, and vice-versa):- This is the general ""drifitng score.""- The wider the angle up to a 90º drift is more points- You get a multiplier based upon how long you have been drifing ""continuously""- If you're going too slow, the points stop adding- If you go over 90º, the points stop adding- If you hit anything, except bonuses, your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- If you stop drifing for too long (I think about 5 seconds), your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- Extra points are given when you go around a bonus pole:- The closer you are, the more points you get- The faster you are going, the more points you get- If you're too far away or ""aren't drifitng"" near one, it doesn't count- If you hit one, it doesn't count, but doesn't get rid of your score or multiplier- Extra points are given when you hit a red block:- If you hit it you get points- If you don't hit it, you get no points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- Extra points are given when you go around a donut circle (driftkhana only):- If you finish the donut indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- If you hit it, you get no points- Extra points are given when you spin in a ""spin-zone"" (driftkhana only):- If you finish the spinning indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- There's really no downside to these...- Points are inceased exponentially (I don't know how much the curve is) if you stack bonuses in one ""continuous"" drift:- If you keep getting bonuses, they'll exponentially increase- If your current score is reset, so does your bonus stack"

,Recommended,320140,32075778,Posted: 30 May,all,『K I N G   C R I M S O N』,"tl;dr Absolute Drift is a lovely little game.Controls are smooth enough to be played on any type of controller (All of my personal bests are on a keyboard, which is normally impossible to use for car games).The points system works pretty well, although I find it has trouble if you're sliding without countersteer and/or sliding with a sharp angle.  It can also be hard to maintain a combo if you stop drifting and start drifting shortly after.Decent car selection.  Not too many, not too few.  The cars all have a unique feel to them, and I often find myself switching cars to better take on a course.The maps are nice.  The simplistic art style helps you really get into the zone without a bunch of distractions.  Some spots with bad clipping here and there, but you get used to them.Admittedly, you lose interest after a while.  After beating the campaign and getting Top 8 on all of the midnight tracks, I don't have much motivation to play now.  I come on every now and then to make sure I'm still in Top 8 and try my hand at some of the mountain courses, but that's about it.  However, that doesn't at all lessen the amount of fun and joy I felt playing this game and really trying to push myself.Overall 9/10, great game, would inertia dorifto again"

,Recommended,320140,17598420,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,Panther,"Absolute Drift is butter on toast.. Smooth afDriving is similar to the early top down GTA games, in that the camera doesn't sit behind the car so steering becomes inverted at times. The cars themselves, handle as if fine tuned to float like sand bags on an ice rink.It's a little like the 'Skate' games in that you'll be finding areas of the free roam map and then sessioning that area, only instead of a curb or a rail it's a docking crane and a lamp post.The ""5 Worlds"" are pretty big, each with a couple dozen drifting challanges (tricks highlighted in red) that need to be completed for the bridge to the next zone to drop. Once all zones are connected they form a rather epic playground, diverse and beautifuly crafted. There is no loading between zones so free roam is exactly that.The ""Events""  are Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting (foremost being a timed freestyle session, the others being un-timed single/3 lap trials respectively). All masterfully crafted, resonating a 'hitman GO' kind of ambience.There are another two dozen of these, and I found everyone of them enjoyable.The Events, were rather challanging while the free roam challanges known as ""Missions"", were far too forgiving. You could half complete a spin twice and it would register as succesfull, for example.The Soundtrack is exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. I'm not being facetious, growing up in an era where albums sold for £15/$25 I would have happily dropped a tenner on this score. The music is perfect, sliding through a ceramic China town to C41 - On my way, everything just comes together.Worth noting that while the game isn't in a pre release state the devs are still actively pushing out content and patches, the creator has said this game was a labor of love, and it shows.9/10Could use more content and maybe a way to save and share footage. But what is there is a masterpiece in top down drifting and game design."

,Recommended,320140,17342252,"Posted: 1 August, 2015",all,Tacroy,"This is an excellent, laid back game about drifting through life with a chill soundtrack in the background and some really interesting physics-based gameplay in the foreground.Keep in mind that mastering control of your car through a drift is the primary gameplay loop here, so if you simply can't stand ice levels this is probably not the game for you.If you can get past that, though, there's a beautiful open-ish world (segmented off by challenges) with a wealth of things to drift around, through, in and over - as well as special levels that challenge you to drift through a course, or score as high as possible in an arena with a time limit. There's even a lighthouse named Donut!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493072488At this point, the game's even taken its special anti-nausea edibles - so if you were put off by the camera in older Let's Plays (particularly during spins), give it another shot.One thing Iwouldlike to see is a bit more interactivity throughout the open world - sure, there's challenges you can accomplish and ramps you can jump off of and stacks of blocks you can knock down, but there's not much you can do to change the layout of the levels; it would be neat if you could (for instance) trigger a crane to raise a wall by doing a donut around a lever, or create a ramp by knocking over some of its supports.

If you've ever played any top-down racers or classic grand theft auto, you'll understand the controls immediately, and they feel good.Now, the point of this game is stressed explicitly several times, it's not about speed. It's aboutcontrol.Your performance is scored by how well you can control your drift down a straight away and through turns. The concepts and controls are very simple, and the early levels are very welcoming to new players. That being said, the skill ceiling is actually quite high. This is definitely a game of skill. If challenge doesn't interest you, or if you've been beating your head againt the wall on a difficult course, there is a free mode that lets you loose in a sandbox with ramps and obstacles to play with. This is the section that I liken to playing with hot wheels on the kitchen floor (it's exactly as fun as it sounds).I would say this game definitely has an appeal to people that enjoy high-skill game play that has a rapid loop of retrying until you get it perfect (ex: Trials, Hotline Miami, OlliOlli, Dark Souls)I just compared playing with Hot Wheels cars on the kitchen floor to Dark Souls....."

I call it simple but the mastery of the drift in this game can be difficult to attain, but once it clicks, it's almost a zen state with the great trance sort of electronic score.  The music is great, and it really adds to the atmosphere.  This is one of those games you can play for 15 mins, or hours. (Sometimes the shorter sessions are due to frustration lol :-P on those days when you just can't make the drift work, and there will be those days unless you really do master it).

Previous experience with racing titles and real life knowledge of how drifting should work will definitively help to get over the first approach to the controls.Don't even bother using a keyboard, this game is best played with a controller that has analog input for the throttle control, a xbox 360 controller is just fine.In addition, I strongly suggest to try the manual transmission and disabling the assisted steering in order to have more direct control to the car.Thematically the game is full of reference from the iconic ""Initial D"" manga to the Japanese drifting car culture in general.Overall the game aesthetic is minimalistic and beautiful with an awesome soundtrack to complete the well polished package.The only complain I have is the ""white buildings on white roads"" which can cause confusion, but admittedly I'm playing on an awful monitor so your experience may vary.I strongly suggest this title to every car enthusiast.

It seems like it may be quality over quantity however, as I've heard a few repeats that I've noticed in a single 2 hour or so session.- The free roam level select world is a great idea, allows you to practice the handling freely and get back into it every session.- Appears to be plenty of content with 5 worlds, each one having quite a lot of levels in each world, plus the game is heavilly focused on replaying levels and getting better scores and better times, self improvement.- Great visual aesthetic, easy to tell what everything is, and it's incredibly nice to look at.CONS- Like I mentioned, I've noticed a few repeating songs on the soundtrack, but I don't really care about this, there's enough that it isn't repetitive.- Besides super minor things, I honestly can't think of any other big 'cons' or gripes I had with the game, which is good to hear I'd imagine.SUMMARYIt's an incredibly enjoyable game with a ton of replayable content, to speak to this point, there's a guy on the steam reviews who has 417 hours in this game, jesus.If you're interested in a game like this, I can't really think of any competition, this game is great, if you're even moderately interested I'd say give it a go, it's only $12.ABSOLUTE DRIFT = BUY95/100"

If its too difficult there are options to make your experience more user friendly such as steer assist and automatic gearing. I love the way this game is layed out, there is no pressure to perform well and the rewards from good driving are rewarding enough. There are leaderboards if you want to get serious. The overall feel and look of the game is just nice to experience. So far I have had no problems or negative thoughts on it however i would like to see an infinite mode where there are no boundaries.

Once you get good at the game you feel like onecooldude. >8-)*EDIT* Beta update has fixed issues such as losing combos from jumps and it's now easier to keep your combo in general. Also its added a clutch and restart button :ok_hand: I finished the game (100% Acheivement) using Automatic and Medium difficulty. However you'll get the most out of this game using Manual gearing and Hard difficulty which allows much more control, though I don't recommend using these settings untill you get the basics down. Some basic understanding about how cars work and also drifting definetely helps but is not essential. There is an excellent guide on the community forums which helped me out going into manual gearing. I went from bad scores to consistantly getting top 1% thanks to the guides and a lot of practice. A lot of the replayability is going for personal bests. Though it is a bit frustrating at times seeing the top 8 scores are usually 2x my best at the least. Also driftkana is a lot of fun but the best scores are just exploiting the best area to do one big continuous donut which isnt the games highpoint (but still heaps of fun :p).Controller is recommended but honestly not needed.

I probably fell down in rank since then :D)I can't really judge the content (see above, only played the 1st track), but I can see me playing this a lot. Good points :- simple and very nice art style- driving feels good with keyboard (tried briefly with controller : not for me :p), with the right amount of difficulty to master- achievements, trading cards, leaderboards- rightly priced imhoOnly problems I've seen so far : twice, at the start of a run, the sound disappeared, or rather became muffled, making it a bit tough to ride (when you can't hear your engine). It came back to normal at the next run. Also, from time to time, there's a bit of stuttering. Not very frequent, but it can really mess up a good run if it happens at the wrong time.In conclusion, highly enjoyable and definitely recommended, if the idea somewhat appeals to you. Great job !"

What the game is about is in the title. You drift, not much else. The game has two main parts, the overworld and the events. The overworld more or less acts as a tutorial in addition to the actual tutorials. The events are various tracks that you can play infinitely, with leaderboards and ghosts to compare yourself to others around the world. This is the meat of the game. You may spend several hours trying to perfect one track, but when you finally get that perfect run and end up in the top 1% of players, there are few games that can evoke that kind of emotion.Also, start with manual transmission, trust me."

Nice minimalistic aesthetic, relatively simple idea, good game to play when you just want to relax, I thought.Now, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong here, but the game never at any point actually teaches you how to drift. I've tried watching a few youtube videos of other people doing it, and it always just seems to work. I guess I'm just not a natural at it. Tha's fine, but I'd like to be taught how to improve.There are these levels labelled as ""tutorials"", but they are anything but. The initial ""drifting tutorial"" puts you on a circular track and says ""drift in a circle"". It doesn't actually tell me *how*. The tutorial for doing  donuts says ""do donuts"". The only actually useful pieces of information regarding how to drift are the quick pieces of text that appear during loading screens. Other than this, the game doesn't actually tell you how you are meant to play it.Like I said I really liked the look of this game, and really want to enjoy it.

How does it work out as together? Not very well.The game seems very easy-to-pickup, but it really isn't- you have to focus so much, the difficulty is as bad as simulator that requires actual good controller. Also, I felt that this game is incredibly slow paced. Maybe because of how much the camera zoomed out. So wiggled some setting, I also changed difficuly to easy (shamefully) and I felt no difference from Hard difficulty. Well there are no CPUs in this game, why does this difficulty thing exist for? Scoring??Graphic is sub-par, it is the modern ""low-poly"" style with very minimallistic color with very little environment. I've seen it enough of this, nothing really to praise for.Music selection is great. I liked every bit of it, and it kind of connects as if there is DJ in background.The control is the same as arcade style but asks you to play like simulator.The worst part for me was the price tag. I mean, does it really worth $12? I can find numerous alternatives that may cost bit more but worth lot more than this.I tried to like it, yes, I needed to play for at least a hour to make a fair review but 20 minutes was enough torture for me. It was too challenging and really wasn't that entertaining. Some flash game plays better, and it is free.If you play a lot of racing simulation, you might like this, but why pay for limited simulator when you might already have fully-controllable simulation game? That's the confusing part.In my honesty, I don't feel like picking this up again after this review... sorry."

Great presentation and audio mean that it's a pleasure to sit there for an hour or two, plugging away at the High Score on the Driftkhana boards. Take it from me, at the time of the review, I'm ranked anywhere from 2nd to 6th on all of them.The cars handle nicely, and feel like they have a lot of weight to them. The drifting requires you to think ahead about where you want to end up, and requires minute adjustments as you fly around a corner in order to not crash. It requires a little bit of practice, and top down view can occasionally be disorienting, but overall the game controls well and it feels good. It feels good to slide around a corner at high speed, and consistently nail drifts in order to build up a multiplier and score high points. The games core mechanics are incredibly solid.The Mirror's Edge style visuals are also a nice touch, and give a lot of flair and personality to the game. The music makes for good background noise, and there are a couple of pretty good tracks that I actually find myself enjoying a lot.Really, my only complaint is the lack of custom maps. This sort of leaderboard-focused game seems designed to come with a map editor."

The game has a nice art style were the map and track are white with a few brightly colored buildings to mix things up and your car is the paintbrush. The game is nicely optimized and I can definitly see someone playing this on an unplugged laptop (Provided you have and controller). The game is just soo fun i can't stress this enough. The game is easy too get into but hard to masterand you willl spend hours trying to get to the top of the leaderboard.  The physics of this game are awesome and you cant just go full throttle into a bend and expect not to spin out this isnt need for speed but this just emphasizes the fact the this game needs wheel support i think i would be much nicer if it did. The game also has a sense of humor in the way it presents itself and its tutorials and the names of the cars, and since it doesnt take itself too seriously and you can just fun with it.So if like turbo whistle and slithering around a bend like your in Tokyo drift this is the game for you."

The top down perspective allows me to see what is really going on.A mix of challenges and smaller tasks to complete keep the game fun but also extremely challenging.The physics work so well for drifting. The cars don't turn well enough to complete the courses comfortably with grip driving. You'll start drifting naturally, though maybe poorly. It's so easy to at least get started. The difficult part is getting the right speed and angles.This game is tough. It isn't perfectionist, but you still need to slave away at it to get better. Each course has different transitions between drifts, tight and loose turns, and ways to score bonus points. You'll ace one track and then have to learn the next one almost from the ground up.The Mirror's Edge aesthetic, smooth movement, music, and simple presentation all make for a beautifully designed game.

However on the flip side, the game has a great visual style, good soundtrack (depends on what music you like), a nice feel to the car (rather easy to enter drift and hard to leave) and finally what extends the life of this game which are the events you can enter which are pretty much drift tracks. Unless you have a drive to finish high on the leaderboards or master a track, this mode won't offer much to you.So in all, perhaps the posetives justify the price tag.

Rather than a case of easy to learn hard to master, this slightly fiddly, really quite accurate, drift simulator is tricky throughout.  As someone who sends a fair bit of time sideways in real life, I'd say these guys have made a really good job of capturing that feeling of desperately trying to maintain angle in order to snap the rear back the other way and transition into another drift.The game relies heavily on the desire to achieve that perfect run of 3 laps of well timed transition and big fast sweeping drifts.  Great until you actually manage said run, and then you're left feeling a bit lost as you're unlikely to ever best it, by much at least.A great toy, but requires something a little more in terms of aims/objectives/direction to make it into a truly great game.

,Recommended,320140,17652126,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,HokiHoshi,"What a fantastic game.  I'll admit, when I first saw this I was worried it would feel too dumbed down, more like a mobile game than a full PC game, I thought that it would perhaps be a bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of drift culture...but I have never been so wrong.Absolute Drift does everything right for me, it has an amazing soundtrack which is suited perfectly to the atmosphere of the game, the driving feels intuitive and incredibly rewarding (I drift competitively in real life and the handling felt right at home for me), and the drift culture references are everywhere from the ""missile"" S13 with #NFG engraved on the bottom to the little chime it plays when you unlock a new world.  Fans of drifting will find a special place in their heart for this game, but it's something everyone can enjoy.Some things worth noting...Game OverviewThere is a thin storyline and tutorial to get you started, then you're pushed out into the open world.  You start in a replica of the iconic AE86 in an airfield.  As you complete ""missions"" in the world, you unlock more zones which give you access to big new areas to play around and hone your skills in while also unlocking new cars, missions and ""events"" (which are sorted into driftkhana, tracks, or mountain passes).  Overall the game's ""story"" should take about 2-3 hours to finish, but the game is far from over at that point.Controls/HandlingFrom the videos it looked like the control scheme might be a bit hard to grasp but I was able to pick it up pretty quickly with an xbox controller, and after an hour or two of play I felt like I had pretty good control over my car.  The use of steering input, gas, brake and handbrake all come together and really start to feel intuitive after only a short time playing.  After 5+ hours I felt like I had mastered the art of drifting, and then I realized there was a manual transmission option, and my steering assist was on.  Turn these to manual/off and you'll be in for a whole new challenge.  The cars all feel different and each have their own strengths and weaknesses in certain areas of the game making them all relevant, there is no ""best car"".  All in all, the game is easy to grasp but hard to master which in my opinion is the perfect formula.(I'd strongly recommend using a controller for the game.)Game Length and ""Value""I purchased the game for $12.00 and feel like I have definitely gotten my money's worth.  Although the main ""story"" of the game may only take 2-3 hours, the replay value is incredibly high.  There are ~25 ranked courses that you can get to from the open world or just hop into from the main menu and this is where most of the ""endgame"" lies.  You are scored based on speed, angle, proximity to cones and ability to keep a good line without hitting walls or slowing down too much.  Your highest score for each course gives you your leaderboard ranking and percentile within the playerbase.  Repeating a course multiple times in a row just to climb a few spots in the leaderboards is very addicting, you've been warned.  The open world is another place where the game really extends it's value, once you've unlocked all 6 zones you'll see just how massive and varied the world is - free for you to create your own tracks.  The fantastic soundtrack and rewarding car handling really let's you just zone out and drift around for hours without feeling bored.Problems with the game / Things I'd like to seeNo game is perfect, this is no exception.  After a while I've noticed a few minor audio and visual bugs, noticeable but nothing gamebreaking at all.  The unique art style definitely fits the feel of the game, however I do feel like more color wouldn't be a bad thing.  The art style doesn't really take anything away from the game, but it doesn't add much either.  I'd like to see more colors, assets and effects, something to please the eyes while I mindlessly drift about the open world, bobbing my head to the beat.  Multiplayer sadly doesn't make an appearance here and I'd really like it.  Being able to tandem drift in mountain passes with a few of my friends would bring the experience to a whole new level.  The ability to set up your own courses in the open world, or even perhaps build your own with a level design tool would also be a huge addition here.If a sequel is in the works (which I hope for more than anything) I'd really like to see a more fleshed out environment with colors, lighting, etc etc.  Multiplayer and a track builder of some sort would be a big plus, but the only other thing I'd really like to see is MORE!  More cars, more customization, more open world, longer tracks, etc.This game is easy to learn and hard to master.  The driving formula is just right and pulling off a hard drift just feels good.  There are a few minor bugs and the art style doesn't give your eyes much to look at but the sheer amount of content and enjoyment you get for the price tag is hard to beat."

76561197998099312,Recommended,320140,32770521,Posted: 25 June,all,inter2fold,"6/10Summary: addictive, arcade-style in 3D, clean environment, minimalistic interface, can be relaxing. Lot of good points but I also have some bones to pick.AUDIO~ PRO: I spend 99.99% of my time in games with music turned off. Turning off music is the first thing I do the instant any game gives me access to its Settings menu. Absolute Drift (AD henceforth) is an exception. The only other game in recent memory (and by recent I mean the past two decades) where I have tolerated having game music playing for more than a half hour at a stretch is Gunpoint. The soundtrack in AD is kind of repetitive, not many songs to choose from, but they are randomized and if you don't like the current one you can skip ahead to another track without letting your hand off the ""steering wheel"". Genre is Chill Electro with a side of downtempo DNB so if that's your dish then I'd recommend getting this game for the music if nothing else.~ CON: Game's sound effects are annoying and distracting. I finally muted them completely. AD goes out of its way to put the player in a Zen state of mind, then it ruins that experience with auditory distractions all the while you're trying to learn how to drive, like bass-notes that push through my headphones every time I hit one of the red bonus block fragments which have a despawn timer that operates on a geologic timescale.CONTROLS~ PRO: Supports keyboard, Xbox & PS4 controllers. KB can be used simultaneously with a controller (not that you'd want to). Multiple schemes/layouts for the controllers but these include only minor variations.~ CON: KB ctrls cannot be remapped. If you're like me and still have a keyboard from the Stone Age that plugs into a PS/2 port, this game might be seriously frustrating to play since PS/2 only allows two simultaneous signals yet AD necessitates that you be managing three inputs concurrently for smooth execution of many maneuvers. USB KB's may work better. I finally plugged in my Windows Xbox controller and now I'm blissfully relearning how to drive.~ SHRUG: The camera is locked. I have no consistent point of reference to my car. I have to keep shifting my perspective, both visually and mentally, as my car traverses through each consecutive 90 degrees of orientation onscreen. This presents an undesirable and artificial challenge to learning to drift in AD.PROGRESSIONThe game has two modes of driving accessible from the main menu: Free-Roam and Events. Free-Roam is a sequence of ""worlds"" like Mario worlds.~ PRO: Progress through the Free-Roam is automatically saved and any time you return to Free-Roam your car is automatically placed at the starting point of that world. Events includes everything you've driven past so far in Free-Roam, including Tutorials, so you can return to practice and perfect any event you please at any time.~ CON: ""Free Roam"" is nothing of the sort. It is a false moniker for what would be called ""Campaign"" in an RTS or ""New Story"" in an RPG. There is no way to learn how to drive in this game other than blundering your way through the worlds with their myriad obstacles and ceaseless demands. Growing tired of a world and want to move on? Too bad! You must complete nearly 100% of the hand-holding immersion-breaking paint-by-numbers content in any given world before the next world becomes unlocked to you. Just like Mario, you will probably have some worlds you like and some you don't. I had just about lost my patience with World 4 (narrow and twisty) and was considering uninstalling the game when I finally came to World 5 and found more open expanses and a couple of nice zig-zaggy canyons in which I could get a feel for how to throw my car's weight around.FEATURES ACCESS~ Map: There isn't one. Nope. Notta. Nuthin'. Wondering what missions (tasks) you've missed? Keep driving until you find them. Forgot where that sweet drift spot or kickass jump was? Keep driving until you relocate it. The lack of a map adds gruelling minutes and mounting frustrations to an otherwise peaceful cruise through the park. Sure, a map is not necessary and players who are familiar with the worlds won't feel they need one, but it would have been a nice feature for a new player.~ Backtrack through worlds: If you want to revisit an old world, there are only two ways to do it: reset your campaign progress, or turn around and drive back through the intervening worlds between where you are and where you want to be. This game's replayability could have benefitted *GREATLY* from having a jump-to-world option at the main menu. As both a Pro & Con, there are only 5 worlds, so your backtrack drive won't take you very long.~ Play/Practice area: Want a free open space (a true free roam) in which to play and learn how to handle your car and the controls? Too bad! The only place to do this is in the first ""room"" of Free-Roam and that is a very small room indeed. I was (and still am) hoping for a totally free practice area with maybe a grid overlay and few or no terrain features wherein I could not only practice but also enjoy just doing endless drifts without concern for obstructions, much like the Stunt track in N64's Rush 2 (1998).INSTRUCTION/LEARNING CURVE~ New Cars: Each time you complete a Free-Roam world the game rewards you with a new car. Sounds great. But there are no onscreen statistics to tell you how the cars differ from each other. Only way to know is to take them out for a test drive at which time you discover the differences are subtle, ie. borderline non-existent.~ Time limits: Most events have a time limit even if it is not overtly displayed. Just when you are starting to get the hang of something, time runs out and you have to restart the event. Time limit does make sense in a scenario where you are trying to accumulate points as quickly as possible but most events focus on mechanics of driving which is irrelevant to time. Learning these mechanics is hindered by having your practice session interrupted about every 60 seconds or so.~ The Donut: My biggest pet peeve is the Donut. The main developer for this game lives in Canada. Don't know what ""donut"" means north of the border but, in the USA, a donut is a ring of burnt rubber lain on the ground in concentric rings about a fixed point. In AD, a Donut consists of little more than maintaining white smoke from your car's tires without losing momentum as you casually pass by, drift alongside of, reverse past, or even spin in place adjacent to (not around) the objective location. There I was floundering for minutes at a time trying to do a perfect 360 concentric drift around every Donut objective I came across while the game refused to budge my %. Why? Because I would surrender my momentum, come to a halt next to the objective, and try maneuvering into a better drift circle with a handbrake start. The solution? Drive away and come back to try again in the sloppiest, most haphazard, most non-donut-looking driveby drift I've ever been ashamed to do. No explanation, no mercy, total aggravation.~ Event Finish screens: The game has a plethora of patronizing critique messages to slam your confidence every time you exit a drift stage. My least favorite is, ""Remember it's not about speed...""  YES IT IS!  Yes, holding a drift does not require continuous application of the throttle, but *starting* a drift most certainly does! Just who exactly do you think your target audience for this game is?! Any person who enjoys racing, has a driving license, and has taken a core curriculum Physics class -- or, as a substitute for those three, has watched any single season of the sacred ""Initial D"" -- already has an abundant comprehension of the concept of momentum. You can't start a drift without momentum, and gathering momentum requires speed. STOP TRYING TO TELL ME OTHERWISE YOU CONDESCENDING MONSTER!!!   *breathe... breathe...*Glad I bought this game!

,Not Recommended,320140,19907865,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,I can't believe I'm not butter,"A fun little game with a GREAT soundtrack and a cool minimalist style.The free-roam mode (the ""story""-like mode) is about 90 minutes of play depending on how much you suck. Could probably be speedrun much faster. There's a bunch of drift and driftkhana tracks each with their own leaderboards, so the competitive leaderboard types of players will probably get much more than 90 minutes out of this game. The drift mechanics seem mildly accurate, for a really low-grip world.Unfortunately the goal detection is kinda dodgy. Where you have to do donuts around an object, you actually just have to be drifting a certain angle, not even in the correct direction, within some radius of the object. You'll accidentally half-complete some objectives driving past it. Drifts to complete objectives don't have to be successful, you can slide past, tick off an objective, and then slam into the wall (the exception to this is that actually hitting clipping points doesn't give points, and donking donut objects sometimes resets them). The result of all this is that you can basically fumble your way through the whole game (you do gotta git gud for the leaderboard modes though).Also there's a difficulty setting that seems to do nothing. I don't even know.All up - it's a fun little toy, but it's not really a complete product."

Easy to start, but hard to master.  Love how the base drops out of the music when you're airborn, and then comes back when you're on your wheels (makes the jump feel more epic).Only one real complaint.  For some reason there is a lag between the inputs on the controller and the game in general (even in the menus).  Don't know if it's just my machine, or not.  However, it makes it very difficult to be very precise because you alway have to lead a lot earlier with inputs.  If you get the input wrong you won't be able to correct until it's too late."

,Recommended,320140,17332577,"Posted: 1 August, 2015",all,Surtsey,"Absolute Drift has a place in any gamer's library.This game is a ""score attack"" game in which you drift your car for points. You'll drift your car around curves and turns—at the speed you're comfortable with without losing control of the car—and chain together those drifts to increase both the base score and the multiplier. There are also many objects in the game world that you'll drift around (360 degrees), or brush up against (fly-by posts), or slam (break cubes), to increase your score during a drift.When you're at risk of losing the multiplier, and close to banking those points but having to start another streak, your running score total will shake and rumble to let you know you should quickly initiate another drift.The game was made primarily by one person, so his vision for the game comes across in a cohesive manner. That is, all of the design decisions and gameplay mechanics feel natural and were implemented with the utmost care. This developer is responsive and kind. I've seen him aid people on the forums and help fix bugs they've encountered (the game is virtually bug-free, but there will always be edge cases). He even helped me one-on-one with a bug I was encountering.Possible negatives(these don't personally affect me)- The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a positive.)- Wheels are nottechnicallysupported, although Xbox and PS4 controllers are natively supported.Definite positives+ The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a possible negative.)+ Six cars that all sound, look, and respond differently (you will encounter/unlock).+ Tutorials are built into your game's progression.+ If you hit a wall, you still keep your points! You'll have to begin another point streak though!+ Free-roaming mode with nooks and crannies, hidden stars (look like X's), and stunts.+ Car paint can be changed plus some decals applied.+ Down-tempo electronica soundtrack (3 hours).+ Field-of-view (FOV) is adjustable.+ Steering sensitivity, transmission type, and steering assist are customizable.+ Gorgeous art design.

I haven't tried it with a keyboard/mouse yet because of some warnings I've come across, so I cannot personally recommend a controller over a keyboard and mouse. I love the concept, infact, I love the game! The missions in Free Play are fun to do and fun to look for. The drift tracks and tutorials are setup very nicely. Even the games soundtrack is nice, some chill electro EDM music. All around the game is great.However... I can't seem to grasp the drifting mechanic. One moment I'm understeering, the next I'm spinning out of control with nothing but a wall to stop me. I'm glad crashing in this game doesn't result in failure, otherwise I would've stopped within 20 minutes. I feel like this game isn't something I'll be hooked on forever though, sadly. This is only due to the fact that I'm much more interested in other genres. Anyways, don't buy this game looking for easy drifting is all I'm saying. It's challenging, yet fun!EDIT: I've gotten about 80 minutes into the game and I've made it to the beginning of World 5. The game has a great variety of cars and customization. More than you would think it would have! I am getting the hang of the drifting and other tricks and it is now a much easier game; and it got more fun than before.Understanding the mechanics is quite strange... it's like I'm understeering and oversteering at the same time. If you're trying to go for a long drift, don't go too hard on the gas, you will spin out very quickly. Always use the handbrake unless you're going to fast to a wall, then you should hard brake.Anyways; this was the greatest $11 I've ever spent!EDIT: I've got around 140 minutes into the game and I finished it. Not much replayability in my opinion. Just the same tracks and free roam courses you played in the story mode, which is quite dull if you ask me. I'm not saying I expect a huge story, but 2 hours of content? Really? Still an awfully fun game and I spend more money on things that last for 10 minutes, so I'm not complaining."

There's your clichés.Pros: Drifting (of course) plus you can quickly play a game or two or enjoy hours of frustrating sliding while honing your driving/score to perfection. Simplistic graphics work, it kinda reminds me of Mirrors Edge. I'm not sure but I think there's a little difference between vehicles. Quite alike but for a game like this, different enough.Cons: Too few achievements: you need something more to draw you back day after day. Countdown before the race starts. Great idea, but it's very fast paced game and you end up restarting the race quite a few times when you're trying to beat your friends score. Three seconds is a long wait, too long. Should be: click restart, BOOM! GO! Also you should be able to change car without having to quit the race.Other than that, I enjoyed this very much, thank you!"

,Recommended,320140,28571041,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Szarps;,"The game is actually good, but at some degree due to some minor details (nothing game breaking) feels unpolished. The first things that come to my mind is that if I press retry and hold the gas, the car will start on reverse, the stuns on the world dont reset if at some point you stop doing them or fail at them while performing them and something really annoying is that the rpm of the car are shared along all the gearbox, meaning that if you listen the engine like at 5000, even if you gear up the engine will still remain at that pont, and personally for someone who spent a lot of time on sims and many racing games  its really annoying and unpleasant to hear. Also this may sound tribial but it maded a bit more hard for me to adapt to the already hard learning curve because of this.Now, as said before, the game has some flaws and its not perfect, but while the mechanics are a bit hard you can still work around them and perform everything they ask you for, once you reach enough practice. You may have doubts on the first 2 hours if it's worth your money but believe me it does, and perhaps you will realize it around that time or a bit down the road (depending on how fast you adapt to said mechanics).EDIT: All right i wanted to add one last detail, as you may have read on others reviews the game has this kind of ambience of relax and nice music which is good, not going to deny that. Now the interesting detail, the game has 6 vehicles (only 4 of them are cars) and here is where IMHO the developers kinda screw it up. All vehicles have different handling, more so, most of them are quite hard to steer the wheel and overall get them to drift and behave the way you want them to behave. However the only car which feels good at all levels is the 86 (the original), this creates a big problem in many ways, first this game is base on global leaderboard so there are better choices than other so you need to adapt (META) and making every car handle different limits the actual aestethic choice of the players. Most of my time were using the supra (the super) and I had a hard time drifting even after various hours, so for some reason I thought of picking the 86 to screw around a bit and OMG suddenly I was the god of the burn rubber.Bottomline: get this only on discount until this things get patched up.... or something.

(If you didn't notice)I am not very good at drifting currently but will hopefully get better and become a drifting master and meet that giant drifting Buddha thing again and have a good conversation with him :).And also drink lots of sake(I'm not 18/21 yet but hey) to help me drift too.Anyway everyone, gl hf and drift a lot and drink sake!!! (If you are old enough :p)Edit: This game is really awesome, I like going throughout the map and drifting a lot in the free roam aspect, I even reset the game to free roam and do the missions again- it's really good and relaxing!:) The music is awesome and I like the original car: the '86 I think it's a reference to the Initial D anime. I also met Budda guy at the end of world 6 the journey(journies) was(were) amazing!"

REALLY GOOD.I would recomend this game to all drift fans. Yes, the game doesn't handle like a real car but you will still have a fun time getting sideways in 1 of 6 cars. I especially like the classical AE86 or ""The Original"" as it is called in game but the Hoonivan is also real fun.Things that I would like them to add:- Multiplayer- Map creator/editor(Review done on 04/05/2017)"

,Recommended,320140,34322975,Posted: 18 August,all,xl007xl,"Absolulty amazing. To anyone who complains about the ""hard"" handling: Thats what makes the game fun. It gives you all the options of improving and climbing up the highscores without ever becoming boring, even thoug there are not too many tracks. The only critizism I have: The scoring system could be more transparent and more sophisticated for gymkhana mode. You easily get highscores just by drifting in a circle all the time."

I first got interested in this games because AR12 played it and it looked awesome. Getting into the game I could not get used to the driving physics! It felt like the car was so loose from the ground and loose from my controller. I just did not like the driving at all. This is so disappointing because it has such a great open world with tons of things to do. I do not play the game but i think that it is still a great game because of the expansive world."
