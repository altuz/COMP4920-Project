The gameplay is pretty fun, though, and if you are into Diablo-esque RPGs you may want to give it a try.To those who are worried if Darkstone will run on their modern systems, it works perfectly on my Windows 7 without any readily apparent bugs or visual glitches. Though naturally, I can’t vouch it will work for everyone, but steps to make this game work on modern systems were obviously taken (my old CD version stopped working ages ago)."

Seeing it here on steam actually made me excited since I hadn't played in FOREVER. Today is my second day with it and I'm already feeling the nostalgia, heh.Anyway, you play as 1 or 2 of 8 possible characters from 4 basic classes off to fight a necromancer (supposedly) who can change into a dragon, but you must acquire 7 crystals in order to make a powerful orb to help stop him first. This is where I find I love the game the most. Each crystal has around 3 or 4 possible quests randomly picked for it, so that's between 20-30 different combinations of quests you could have. Dungeons are randomly generated, so are monsters, loot, yadda yadda yadda, been there before. Yes, graphics are seriously outdated, but graphics don't make a game bad or good necessarily unless they're so abysmal you can't tell what you're looking at. The only problem I notice so far is that occasionally during dialogue, it tends to skip a little, but you can always check the ""Previous Dialogue"" tab to see what someone had said if you're playing without the subtitles.All in all, this is a favorite of mine from childhood, one I recommend to people who like simpler RPGs that simply puts you as a hero out to fight an evil dragon/wizard/thing :P Doesn't need to be any more complex than THAT!"

It was one of the few games me and my friends would play together and I loved it.   Once I saw it on steam (and it was so cheap) I had to take a trip on the nostalgia train and play it again.  Only problem is, my graphics card and the game do not mesh well together...missing textures abound.   The trees that act as a border around the maps are just black shadow squares, my character's face is missing and NPCs are invisible unless they are in town (sometimes)   I went down to the first level of the dungeon and discovered my character as well as all the enemies and doors and items that dropped were invisible save for their shadows.I still recommend this game if you like dungeon crawlers, I loved it back then and I still do now...I just have to fix this graphical issue so I can enjoy the game to the fullest.Edit: When I wrote the review I hadn't googled the -sortbyz fix (and wasn't aware of where to put it) but after google and Norpal commenting on it, the game runs much much better.  Now I can enjoy the game again."

The graphics are dated, but in a sort of endearing way, and have aged rather gracefully thanks to the cartoony style. In contrast to Diablo's grimdark oppressiveness the overall atmosphere in Darkstone is much more light-hearted and carefree, incredibly campy storyline (which the game never forces down your throat) and all.In summary, Darkstone is an old hidden gem of a game that's still fun and fluently playable to this day, 15 years later. A great little ARPG for when you just want to bash some goblins and take their shiny things without having to worry about... well, much of anything, really."

(like torchlight or vanboringhelsing)the gameplay is entertaining, with a huge emphasis on micro, character progress rewarding, and the dark forests of Uma have such a character with an awesome atmosphere; it's just addicting.the style of diablo clone can be compared to modern torchlight, but honestly, with torchlight i just got bored after 5 hours of uninteresting dungeon crawling; while with darkstone i had serious problems turning the game off. each of the quests are interestingly unique and the automatic level generation not too exaggerated to be impersonal.  the game can be also replayed multiple times, as the main quests get randomly selected from a bigger set of all possible quests with different puzzles and areas that the game has to offer (yes, main quests, not just the side quests). also there are a couple of classes to play withskimming through the existing negative reviews i see a lot of people complain that the game is old, graphics ugly and they are unable to rebind keys or set advanced options. yes, it's an old game, i thought people could tell from the screenshots. this was made in 1999, what do you expect? mass effect 3 graphics? xbox controller support? jesus christ, these newf'agsof course, if you're a generic shallow call of duty fan this is definitely not for you. this is for people who are looking for actual gameplay in the games. and those who enjoy action rpgs, obviously.the only negative point for me is that i've wasted half of my winter holidays with it.definitely buy this game"

Was super disappointed when I couldn't launch the game AT ALL even with some of the fixes listed here on steam.== The only thing I had to change in the launch options was add ""-32bit"" ==I personally added ""-nointro"" as well, but that was just to skip the opening video.They seem to have updated the game since I last played, adding a combat training area, a town guide, and voiceovers! Then again, I could've just forgotten about these features considering I haven't played this game in over a decade.The PC controls are a little.... odd... but the gameplay works just fine with the point and click mechanics.This isn't your typical WASD game. I find myself resting my left hand on right shift and arrow keys for combat toggle and camera controls while my right hand pilots the mouse for movement, targeting, and clicking the on screen buttons for inventory, map, etc.Having a configurable gaming mouse helps as well as I can assign the numbers on the side to F1-F8 for quick item use on both characters.Which reminds me of one last thing I really love about the updates! Party system! I remember only being able to play as one character at a time, but now you can have two characters in play! One you control and the other following behind (which can be toggled off for solo exploration). Combat for the follower can be set to automatic or manual, and you can switch between who you're actively playing as at any time.I don't know anything about co-op, but local co-op is something that seems to have been added as well.Overall I still love the game, though if you don't have that nostalgic attachment from your childhood the game may be a bit outdated."

Before I get into what the game offers, do keep in mind that it came out in 1999 (Windows), so the graphics and capabilities aren't going to have all the bells and whistles of modern games. If you are into games in the same genre as Diablo, this will be right up your alley. I will update this as I get further into the game.Want to play a caster who can become a werewolf? Want to play a thief, identify items yourself, and make bank? This game has a bunch of neat ideas that may interest you. While not exactly new, these ideas work rather well. It works relatively well on Win10, but the game shows its age. The lack of a clear story besides ""Kill main bad guy"" may be a dealbreaker for some, but it can give some fairly decent creative license.The dungeons and side quests aren't 100% the same for each playthrough. There are multiple dungeons and sidequests that are possible, with the game selecting from the quest pool at random from the start of a new adventure/playthrough. Without spoiling much, the playable character ages as time passes, discouraging dawdling, but an item to shave off a few ""years"" can be obtained later on in the game. Instead of having one dungeon per area like in the Playstation port, each area has 2. The game allows some class customization in the builds, like a battle mage, but each class has a specific strength and weakness. Of the four classes (warrior, mage, thief, and monk), I recommend going with either the mage or thief class, since both start with some form of ranged combat.Townsfolk will randomly give you sidequests if you talk with them. The quests/dungeons are pretty interesting with minor puzzlesolving, a fair bit of hack n' slashing, and periodically grabbing some treasure for a monetary reward from some sidequest. The town has what you will need, being the smith, inn/food shop, magical item vendor, somebody to identify items/remove curses, a tradeskill teacher/vendor, a bank, and a skippable ""tutorial"" area. The skills can immediately benefit you, with skills like repairing armor, identifying items, or getting better deals at vendors. I highly recommend getting skills when you can, with higher tiers of the skill(s) being unlocked as you level your character.In short: pretty good game, all things considered. While not aging like fine wine, it still has its merits. Pick it up when it is on sale, and give it a try."

By then, I didn't know enough English to comprehend the game's mechanics. I had heard from my elder brother that it was ""even possible to cast magic in this game"". Wow! I mean it could be the first time I heard about magic. I was amazed at the idea. The copy I owned was a demo version, so I digged into the game for hours and hours to be able to cast one single magic, to no avail of course. Maybe it was that the game was a demo version or that I just couldn't find out how to cast magic due to my lack of communication skills or lack of intelligence. But I was having fun cutting through unspeakable monsters, animated skeletons, greeting dead Ricken's soul whilst trying to find a way to cast magic. God! Those were the days..Anyways about the REVIEW: The game isn't just a cheap copy of Diablo. It does have its unique features and mechanics and it does have its own spirit. For example; in the town centre you can pay a few pennies to Audren and Krym and listen to the game's soundtrack and feel the late 90s nostalgia touch your hair like an Aegean breeze. If you're a true RPG player you'll just feel at home with this game as it contains the core RPG elements: a wide range of skills and spells as well as multiple playstyles for each class. Only problem you might have in the game would be the interface and controlling as it doesn't have an in-game option to rebind your hotkeys and no hotkey for some basic mechanics like auto-grabbing an item from the ground. But you can always rebind your keys using the ""keyboard"" notepad file inside ""config"" folder within the game's installation directory. Overall the game is worth its 1 dollar price. So if you're willing to experience an old school RPG of good quality I strongly recommend Darkstone."

It's boring, bland, and generally uninteresting. I never even knew there was a PC version until I saw it on Steam yesterday, and I immediately grabbed it. While it seems like the PC version has some benefits over the PSX version, regrettably Darkstone doesn't appear to function completely on modern systems. Overworld boundaries comprised of trees just show as black, empty areas, so even if I could get past the really bad graphics and the inability to adjust th resolution to actually make everything fit on my 16x9 screen, it would still be unplayable because of these graphical artifacts that generally take up 25-50% of the screen.You're correctly seeing that I played this game only for 7 minutes. That's all it took for me to know beyond any doubt that there is no way I can make myself play this, which is a shame because I would like to revisit it and see what the PC version brought to the table.Honestly, though, even if it didn't have these unplayably bad artifacts, the graphics themselves are so bad that I don't think I could do it. I'm not normally one to harp on about bad graphics--hell, I just recently played through Ultima III and Ultima IV on DOSBox. But this... It's too muddy, and too polygonal, with polygonal counts being noticeably low. It just looks bad.So I think I'm gonna have to keep Darkstone as just a fond memory--something I played a lot, and reasonably enjoyed especially for its low price, on PSX as a teenager. I would suggest everyone else do the same. Don't attempt to revisit this one. Let your memories live on. I've requested a refund since, as I said, there's no way in hell I could stomach this for more than a few minutes--and I recently played a 1983 game built with what basically were stick figures with two frames of animation each, so...

Altogether, knowing that it was going to be sloppy, overpriced, and unsatisfying in the long run, I would have just went to mcdonald's and gotten a bigmac."

There are no resolution options so everything was way too big on my 27"" monitor. This is like playing an unpolished Diablo 1.Honestly, I remember liking this game back in the day, but it is just painful now. If you KNOW you will like this for nostalgia, get it on sale. Otherwise, my recommendation is avoid for everyone else."

But between the below-mediocre gameplay that couldn't even rip off Gauntlet properly, an attempt at a storyline filled with nothing but the most generic fantasy cliche's you could think of, and being forced to sit through a 5 minute tutorial about all the things in the game you could care less about, it drained me of any interest I had when I started.  Do not buy this game.  Remove it from your wish list.  Get a refund if you still can."

I don't ask for much but just for little things.Wanted to buy this game out of my memories, but better I should not done this.For now I stated the negative review, and a change my mind at time the publisher will thing about adjusting game to running smooth on PC what builds on new hardware."

Windows 7 goes black on intro (after picking characters), and windows 8 has many graphical issues including invisible characters once you make it to the dungeon.I'm not interested in ""fixing"" this myself (it says it works on windows 7 and 8), i'm no technition, and nobody is going to pay me $25 and hour to do such work on a game i just bought. So guess I'll  look forward to a working patch so that i can play this gem from my past, and change my thumbs down review."

Its not even comparable to this one. This has a well balanced loot system and leveling isnt as important as strategy and taking your time. I think this is a classic and should be purchased immediatley. 4.99 $ is obsurd for how much gameplay time this provides.

I recommended it to friends that use to roll with me back in the days. First time player: look up some gameplay videos before you buy it. I don't expect a patch any time soon but the game new some polishing or adjusments to new hardware/software becouse there are some issues that i've never seen before like lag, dark spots on textures and thing like that."

This was a grate game and a tarific story to play through but please provide small demo of games just to see the compatibility. I know this game has a demo because i played it when it was released. I will miss it a lot in my collection.
