Man was it a disappointment.In a nutshell - this is a straight up port of the iPad/Andriod version of the game with little to no thought around compatibility or running state (visual/audio options).It has been a waste of money, if you have to have it i highly suggest waiting for the steam sales to see if it appears."

Unchangable windowed resolution and a blurry, unreadable full-screen resolution are only made worse by recently introduced bugs in the patch (just in time for the holidays!).One top of that, this version is already out of date, within a week of coming out, as a new expansion set has been release for the iOS/Mobile versions that we've yet to get.Until the developement team gets it together, skip the port."
,Recommended,320430,15471881,"Posted: 20 April, 2015",all,Dramikar,"I was very hesitant to purchase this due to the number of poor reviews. The handful of mediocre reviews plus the idea of playing without dealing with the card layout pushed me into buying. I was very surprised by how well it played after reading the reviews. I've played the physical game, but not the mobile versions. All in all, I've had no crashes and no difficulties with the interface after a few experimentations.The tutorial teaches the game, but it does not do the greatest in illustrating how to interact with the game. One example is when choosing which construct to banish, it's unclear if the chosen card kept or banished. Some times the card can be dragged to the discard pile (or draw pile if that mechanic is appropriate). For the complaints about card readability, right-clicking on the card will present it front and center. Left-clicking will return to normal play. For the issue of menus not retracting (ie. opponent menu and ""discard from hand"" menu), left-clicking on an open space on the menu or the discard pile, respectively, will return to normal play. Worst case, ESCape to the menu and select the ""return arrow"" at the bottom left.The game does not go full screen, but it does play at a decent resolution. For me, it's far from a deal breaker. The main improvement I could recommend is adding a more robust tutorial to cover the interface. The best part is, it's a minor technical limitation that can be overcome after a few matches."

That being said, there could be some improvements.- Allow Honor Pool to be set to any number locally or online:If the parties that join the multiplayer game agree to the terms, then what does it matter?- Allow the game to be run windowed on older cards:I have a dedicated card and I cannot run this windowed with my resolution at 1366 x 768.- Add an indicator for player online AND in a game:I have multiple online games with the same player. When I am looking in my Game List, I can't tell which game he is currently playing. An indicator would be nice to quickly jump to that game.I'm sure I'll think of more later, but I'm pretty happy so far. Just look at the hours I've logged on Steam alone. Cheers."

It's one of best deckbuilding games out there!  Which is why it pains me to give a negative review about the PC version.  Unfortunately, this is a port that just shouldn't have been made.  I have had a long negative history with stoneblade, so I winced when I saw they were behind this atrocity of a port.Just be warned if you are considering a purchase: The game crashes A LOT! Mine does so 1/3 games.  To the point where I questioned my PC, but after reading that everyone is having the same issue, it was pretty clear.  Stoneblade is notorious for ignoring their customer base, so it is highly unlikely we will ever see a hotfix or update to the game to correct the issues.  The game does save where you are in a game if it does match, but unfortunately, every time you log back in and pick up where you leave off, it crashes again.  The port is just, unfortunately, BROKEN.The port COULD HAVE been great, but sadly, it is very far from.  I strongly recommend to fans of the game to save your money until a fix or update is released.  It will save you a LOT of frustration."

I know friends who have the app, and I've been waiting for the PC version for a while now. I have to say, I don't understand the amount of negative comments. The game works just like the card game, and I never experienced any lag or shutdowns, or a lot of anything that puts me off of this game. I will say that the clicking needs to be more precise in the play area, for cards like ""Copy a hero's effect that you played this turn."" Long combo turns and energy shards tend to build up, and I've selected a card I didn't want to a few times now. Right-clicking first is really the only way to combat this, to make sure the card selected is the one you want. Other than that, I haven't found any other issues with this game.Edit: I forgot about one more thing, but it's not a huge deal for me. I would like volume controls for the BGM and sound effects. They're fairly loud, so I tend to play with both off."

Magic the Gathering, Dominion, Cards Against Humanity, etc.  If it has cards, I generally love it.  This game is no exception, and stands out in a couple ways over similair card based games that you can get on the PC.  Compared to, oh say Magic the Gathering, the file size and resources required to run this game are miniscule.   I often have my 12 gigs of ram stretched pretty thin, but never once has the game caused an issue with anything else running or been too much of a burden on system resources.The complaints I've seen in the reviews are generally either:1) This game was free on iOS and Android.2) It won't expand up to a trillion DPI resolution.3) There are bugs and its a bad port.In rebuttal, let me give you some background.  This game was originally created as a physical board game by one guy.  By ONE SINGLE GUY!  He designed the system, he did all the art, he did everything and poured his heart and soul into the game and it shows (though personally the style of art while unique is not my favorite).  He continued the game by releasing several expansions, also pretty much all done by himself. Later on he gets some more help and releases higher quality parts and eventually gets a deal for a digital version.   I'm so impressed that I would almost just donate money to the guy because I feel like I'm stealing this game at $10.Second, I have a 1080p 32 inch monitor that I play on, and the window takes up a goodly portion of the screen, though not the entire thing.  Its easily readable, easily playable, especially since you can (with sometimes minor difficulty) zoom in closer on cards, and oh, the most important information is generally keyed to easily distinguished graphics. The game is supposed to be simple, compact and not a resource hog like any of a number of other games, and it doesn't interfere with fullscreen crap that i switch to in the middle of playing sometimes, it doesn't fight with online movie hosts because of fullscreeninc competition, etc.And on the matter of bugs.  I've played 425 hours at the time of writing this review.  I've noticed one or two minor nuisances while playing, such as overlapping fields of control that are sometimes hard to differentiate, but no real makor bugs.  Maybe when it was first released, but certainly not now.  I will say that it sometimes takes a bit of finesse to properly control what you're doing from on occasion, and once or twice I misplayed because of a bad click or poor zone control.  But those aren't really bugs, they're nuisances and easily overlooked because the rest of the game is amazing.Plus all the expansions and promos and new content released once in a while are utterly free, there are no in game micro transactions, or any other crap to deal with, just a real solid card game for cheap.  If you like card games and have more patience than a three year old, just get it.  If you aren't sure if you like card games and are easily frustrated or addicted to cutting edge graphics, might not be your first choice, but you could do worse."

The Android version isn't quite as smooth but it's still a great game.This PC port is total pants. I simply don't have the words for how sluggish, ugly, glitchy and slow it is. How could a company like Playdek that has made quality game after quality game on iOS actually release this steaming pile? I am appalled. The game runs at about 5FPS and is low rez and ugly. Sad.

It's a fun strategic drafting/deck-building game that rewards well-thought out strategies which change from game to game.This game is terrible.  It is a buggy hot mess.  Other reviews have stated that this is a warmed over version of the buggy app and that would explain a lot... but not why Playdek has decided to drop this pile on us just in time for the holidays!Here's some constructive criticism:Resolution.  The game won't expand to fit my screen and I find myself straining to see different cards.  Come on guys.  This is just terrible.  What PC game doesn't have a full screen mode?  And one where I might be able to actually read the cards without having to zoom them.  This convinces me that I spent $10 on a half-finished mobile phone app instead of an actual game.Controls.  Counter-intuitive and and mostly terrible.   I find myself clicking on and buying cards I really didn't want to buy and banishing stuff I would have liked to keep.Lots of random bugs.  First time I've had to pay for an open alpha test of a game.  Any chance playdek actually tried fixing these before dropping this directly onto our faces?  For their sakes, I hope they didn't because its just terrible.Online games.  Wow.  Ok... where to begin.  You can't talk to people, it's hard to get games together and everyone seems intent on watching cat videos instead of playing the game.  How hard is it to make a customizable timer?  10 minutes is too few, 30 minutes is perhaps too long for people afking... 15-20 minute timers sound ideal, unless you're Playdek.  I guess the care-o-meter just ran too low at the end of development time and we get stuck alpha testing a mobile app on our PCs.It's a deeply frustrating experience, which is sad because the underlying game is really fun and has so much potential.TLDR: Avoid this unless you really like squinting at your computer and testing for glitches."

But I thought it would be even better on PC because it's sometimes difficult to read the cards on my phone.So I purchased this on steam and loaded it up.  It popped up in a little box in the middle of my screen and I thought that was just the publisher logo or something showing while it loaded.  Then I realized that was the game.  I figured I just needed to go in and tell the game I'm not using a 15"" CRT monitor from the 90s.  I went into the settings and discovered the game doesn't actually support widescreen monitors or a resolution above what I can only assume to be 1024x768 (at best).  How are we in the year 2016 and we still have developers publishing games that don't support high resolutions and widescreen formats?After about 8 minutes of trying to play this at its native resolution I closed the game, hopped on Steam, and submitted my refund request.Please don't support garbage developers like this.  This has been on Steam since 2014 it looks like and this issue still hasn't been resolved which tells me the company doesn't give a crap about supporting their product.

Can even remove the core set from selection, allowing for specific formats of play.Cons:- Certain cards are bugged. Mostly cards that allow the player to spend a different currency for Dreamcards lock the game out. Requires starting a new game, rendering that game dead by bug. Happened to me twice out of 30 games and only with the cards that allow to use mixed currencies for Dreamcards, so it's isolated, but still a problem to avoid.- Certain overlays like the Dreamcards and selecting from the Void or Play Field require using right click to confirm what you want, otherwise you will accidently select cards that you don't want.- Requires a Playdek account to play online, so online play will be limited based on how long Playdek allows a server to functionOverall: The Cons are very severe and I would instantly recommend this game to everyone if they didn't exist.

If you know what that is, you probably already know if you want it or not.If you don't, it's a game about building a deck by acquiring heroes and artifacts to fighting monsters to compete with other would-be heroes in a popularity contest of the gods.  Or something.  It's Magic: the Gathering meeds Dominion.  It's fun.There are quirks in the interface.  You will probably accidentally banish the wrong card at least once while trying to quickly click through a turn.  Many times trying to view a larger version of a card instead enlarges a card below it.  The animations are outrageously jerky for simple 2d animation.  The options screen is pretty lacking - volume is off or on.  Cultist screams, on or off.  Opponents are... easy or hard?  The manual gives you just enough information to understand the game mechanics, and no more.Minor interface issues aside, it's fun, it plays faster with no shuffling required, and it comes with 5 expansions.

The pc Ascension experience would be recommended to purveyors of Magic: The Gathering or other card games, and that seems obvious, but my recommendation is also based on how similarly misrepresentative and glitchy Magic Online is of the game proper.

Example is when you have a card you purchase from center row that you can put in hand/desk it freezes.When something triggers an event, it is not always clear what you are supposed to do. Example, if you have to destroy all constructs but one, do you select the one you keep or destroy? This is not consistent throughout the game.I am also concerned that Playdeck is very focused on mobile and might not keep the PC version up-to-date, but only time will tell if that is true. Despite those cons, I really do enjoy the game and hope that they release the new expansion for it and keep updating and improving the game.tl;drGood game if you like Ascension and want to play some more or learn the game, but it does have some issues."

I have been playing the board game (physical copy) for about 4 years and I am pretty obsessed with it. I own every physical standalone and expansion and and I also have them all on android as well.I usually ALWAYS read reviews for PC games but seeing what the makers of Ascension have done with the physical games and playdek with the mobile platform I did not hesitate...the moment I heard that it came out I went to steam and purchased it no questions asked. That being said, what Playdek has released for PC is complete garbage. There is literally no other way to describe it.What I expected: Full screen resolution, crisp graphics, high resolution card art, smooth animation transitions. I was so excited to fire up the game and play it on my 27"" monitor with my friends...What I got: Garbage. The game was obviously ported from mobile app to PC which is like porting an original NES game to  PS4 retaining its 16bit gfx. Its literally a square box that takes up 1/8th of my screen, if you toggle ""full screen"" you just laugh because it ""stretches"" the resolution into a bigger square and makes it look like the game was designed in Microsoft Paint. You can barely read the cards...and the animation of the cards moving around, going into play, discarding etc. is horrendous. Its sooooo choppy and laggy it is obnoxious. Explain to me how a game runs this choppy on an Intel i7 with 16gb of ram, and a top notch Nvidia card...Oh...and its installed on an SSD...YOU CANT EXPLAIN IT...it just points purely to HORRIBLE design.Let's talk about the kickstarter for a moment. My best friend pledged a stupid amount of money for Ascension Online...to the point of him *someday* receiving the entire physical edition in a carved wooden box and every card a foil edition. Well since then they tried to cheapen up the carved wooden box and oh...its been like 2+ years and he still has nothing...then THIS IS WHAT THEY RELEASE?? They made it sound like Playdek was out and they were working with a newer company to release this amazing online version of the platform that was going to blow everyone away...NOT A MOBILE TO PC PORT!How can they make a game like Solforge and then put this crap out. Playdek if you are going to continue to make crap like this then just say so. Take a look at HEX, take a look at Hearthstone...this is what people EXPECT out of an online card game and honestly in the Kickstarter Stoneblade made it sound like it was going to be comparable to the aformentioned games.This is a joke. This is not a PC game, this is an insult. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until IF and WHEN they actually put out a respectable product."

If you like deckbuilders, stop reading, you'll love this. *Buy now*.It has online multiplayer (edit: though the netcode is kinda meh sometimes, I've since lost at least one match to a forfeit because of it) and SP is awesome. The PC version includes most of the IAP/expansions from the iOS version.iOS version is better. Buy that first, but if you don't have iOS device, this is pretty good.-----Everyone else - so what's a deckbuilder game? It's a card game kind of like that ""Magic: the Gathering"" collectible card game if you remember that, except it's not as complicated and there's no need to buy packs of cards and collect them all or whatever. I've never played a game like this, and after the tutorial and a game or two I understood it. To this day, I have not the foggiest what my friend who used to go to Magic tournaments or my cousin with the Yu-gi-oh was doing.All the cards come in the same game package, so both players (or up to 4 if you're using some of the expansions) have an equal chance to make a good deck and play each other. Each game is about 15 minutes. Lots of fun solo or with other players!Cons: As some reviews have noted, the resolution is fixed. This is pretty common on iOS ports. It doesn't particularly bother me, because I usually play these kind of games windowed while checking my e-mail and browsing reddit and such, but it does bother some people, so FYI. The stability is not as good as the iOS version, but it's still pretty good. Netcode is nowhere near as good as iOS version.*Buy now* (esp while on-sale).-----FYI, each game ""expansion"" (all of the ones released as IAP on iOS are included on steam) is released in ""blocks"" composed of 2 sets a piece (one large set and its expansion set), so this is really multiple games or game variants, not just one. It's more fun playing that way than with ""all cards"" on, though some people do that.For reference the blocks are as follows:Block 1 - Godslayer (the main game) + Return of the FallenBlock 2 - Storm of Souls + Immortal HeroesBlock 3 - Rise of Vigil + Darkness Unleashed----Block 4 - Realms Unraveled + Dawn of ChampionsBlock 4 is a little different because the ""expansion"" has as many cards as the main game nowP.S.

There are problems, though, and I'll get into that in the list of ""Cons""  in this review.Pros:Grahics are decent, but not great. But this IS an iOS port we're talking about.AI is relatively smart and has the knowledge to block you from getting a good card.Expansions and promo packs are free for this version, while expansions costs $4 US and Promo Packs are $2 in the Apple App Store or Google Play.Somewhat intuitive user interface, but with caveats as I'll explain later.Cons:As iOS is still only 4:3 ratio, so is this game. Luckily, I have a monitor that allows for the resolution being unstretched. Even so, it wouldn't be TOO much trouble to port some of the Android benefits over, would it?As in both the iOS and Android versions: the longer the game, the more likely that an AI player will take for-freraking-ever to play a single card. Dudes...you've had two years to fix this on ALL PLATFORMS, yet it looks like you're spending most of your time on a VR version. VR is NOT a priority when you have people complaining over multiple platforms for several years on this problem. FIX IT!!!The UI IS intuitive, but the one thing that was in both iOS and Android versions that was left out here was using Construct and Trophy Monster abilities without having to open the bloody area to do so. If the card I want is visible in that area without opening it, I shouldn't have to open the area to use it.Even with all that, I would still recommend this. Even though it's not free, all expansion update have been free thus far. This is opposite to the mobile versions where the base game is free, but costs money to have all the expansions and promo packs. Even with its flaws, it's still decent enogh for me to keep."

,Recommended,320430,13860535,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,Doctor Teo,"A game reminiscent of deck-building games such as Dominion with a little bit of Magic.The premisce is pretty simple: you have a deck with money and heroes. Using money, you buy more money or heroes and shuffle them back into your deck; when your deck runs out, you reshuffle it and draw from your new deck, hoping to utilize the new cards you've added in to earn victory points. Hero cards are the 'action' cards with special effects, with a good slew of heroes adding attack power which lets you defeat monster cards with their own slew of special effects as well as adding victory points of their own. The goal is to strike the right balance of money and heroes (and constructs) so that you can score victory points as fast as possible.Though the idea is simple enough, the execution is a bit tougher. There are hundreds of cards across about a dozen 'expansions' and trying to learn them all requires quite the learning curve. You do not have to play with all the expansions at once, and you are able to limit how many are in play at once - some would argue this makes the game better, as expansions have cards that work with each other within expansions, but not always out of expansions. Fortunately, you can zoom in on cards to read their effects as well as being able to use offline practice to warm up.This is actually a pretty in-depth and strong game, so readers may be wondering why the overall review is so mixed, and it isn't hard to see why. The game is plagued by a few bugs, including one that occurs whenever a card gives you one of two options; the card will instead freeze, and leave you unable to select it until you quit and come back.The interface is also a bit questionable. A card will sometimes request an action from you, but it will be unclear what that action is (unless you know the card). Card text is very small, making things hard to check without zooming in. There are a lot of functions, including checking through discard piles and opponent's face-up constructs, but you'd never guess the options were there by the way the game is laid out.Lastly, there is no fullscreen button. This is a detriment, as it would solve the problem of text being too small, and overall make the game easier to focus on.However, while the game makes faults in terms of its UI and has a few bugs, the game itself is interesting and stands strong. It's not as personal as playing in real life where you can check what cards an opponent has or ask questions (no chat system), but having auto-shuffles and quick play are good advantages of playing an E-card game. In fact, for all the UI's faults, there are virtually no loading times of ANY kind, allowing one to jump from game to game with incredible ease.Lesser games have gotten paned for sloppy presentation, but the gameplay of Ascension is strong enough that I can recommend this game. However, it is best to play with a friend: card games, even online, are hardly fun alone."

There are still other less gamebreaking bugs that have not been fixed.I absolutely love the tabletop game (at least most sets), but long ignored this port due to the poor reviews.That said, the port isn't the best.  It's obviously a mobile port, with a locked resolution, controls that are very much geared toward touchscreen control, and a limited screen size that makes some things difficult to use (constructs especially).The locked resolution is OK for my 1920 screen, but would be absolutely terrible for anyone with a really wide screen.What's nice is that this Steam port contains all of the physical sets except the newest one, War of Shadows, at the time of this review; along with many of the promo cards.  As sets have been released in the past, they have been added free of charge (though whether that continues with the newest set, I'm not sure).As for the (offline/single-player) game itself, the AI is not too bad, and it has difficulty levels so you can still challenge yourself up to a point.  It's a good way to spend a bit of time and get my ""fix"" when I can't play the physical game.Online play I find rather frustrating.  It's sometimes very hard to find an active game, and when you do, the opponent pages out of their mobile app and you sit in queue for quite some time.  Also note you need a PlayDeck account to play online, it doesn't authenticate through Steam.There are, however, some pretty significant bugs with this version.  The most visible one is with the card Snake Shaman from Storm of Souls.  The client will crash whenever that card shows up, and you have to abandon that game.Overall, I'm happy wiith my on-sale purchase, but I'd think carefully about the issues before recommending it.

There is a new VR version of this game. VR's developer claims no association but it does leave one to wonder.Other than the above issues I've played through two games and found no other glitches. Gameplay and presentation felt very polished.I waited and paid the equivalent of $5 USD during a Christmas sale; I recommend anyone else interested to do the same.

,Recommended,320430,13566530,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,Jon Irenicus,"If you are a fan of deckbuilding games, then Ascension may very well be a good game to recommend for you.  It is based off the popular (real) card game and translates well into the digital world.  The object of the game is basically to acquire powerful cards to help you gather points(called honor in this game) and get rid of your weak starting cards at the same time.I can at the present time recommend this game for anyone interested in these types of games as the developer has slowely delivered extra free content and fixed bugs and other issues.  I wish there was more support and contact between the developer and fanbase but it can't all be perfect.Pros:- Based on a great board game and some matches can be fun to play- Decent multiplayer system that allowslets you play a game against other people at your leisure (you can set timer for quick games that last minutes or others that last days) and it also allows you to play multiple games at once.- Developer has delivered expansions for the game 6 months after release as well as fixed some very game breaking bugs.Cons:- AI is not very good at all.  AI can be very one dimensional at times and is not very good at building a good deck- No options to set resolutions and other things.  The options menu is very basic- No volume options.  You either have music or sounds effects off or on.  I like to play with Sound Effects on but since there is no volume slider I can't play music over the game.- I mentioned the multiplayer system is very nice, but the layout is very clunky.  Wish it was easier to switch between games and play other games.  Maybe some sort of sound bit, or notification on bottom of screen when opponent in other only game has taken a turn.  Currently that is all guesswork.- Lack of updates.  Although I praised their ability to roll out free new content and fix the worst of the bugs there are still many other bugs that have not been addressed.  A few of the achievements have been broken since Day 1.- LAG during AI turns.  Sometimes when the AI has its turn it slows down for no discernable reason and it can take the AI very long to complete its turn.  This problem has been ongoing since release and there has been nothing done to address the issue.EDITED Feb 25th 2015: The game has now been out for 2+ months and there has been very little communication with the developers about the future of this game.  There are posts asking on the forum whether the title has been abandoned.  There was an update released in January about 1 month after release that fixed a few issues, but also created just as many new ones.  The developers are only now asking for feedback after 1 month of this update to fix issues.  I do believe all these issues will eventually be ironed out but it will probably take another 4-6 months.EDITED Jun 25th 2015:  The game has now been out for 6+ months.  There have been a few updates to the game since my last update as well as the addition of a free new expansion.  I've changed my review from negative to positive even though there are still issues that have not been addressed since release."

Ascension is a deck-builder game: you start with a weak deck of cards and buy cards from a central pool to improve it AS YOU PLAY IT. It's not strategic like Dominion (the grand-daddy of deck-builders), it's the other end of scale. Since you cannot predict which cards will be available for purchase, the game is 100% tactical: you must constantly adapt to the ever-changing game state.The art-work is an acquired taste, and this version is ""playable"" at best*, but don't let that put you off, the underlying game itself is so very good that such quibbles become meaningless, to me at least. Since you get the first 7 expansions bundled with the base game, the value for money here is astounding. Buying the physical version of all that would cost well over 100 bucks. [Though since the Android version is apparently free, I guess THAT is even better value for money!]If you like Ascension, GET THIS NOW. If you have never played it and the bug bites you when you try it, the ridiculously low asking price is going to deliver dozens upon dozens of hours of solid deck-builder gameplay. This game is extremely addictive. For that reason, I give it 9/10 despite the minor short-comings of the implementation.* unlike others I am happy playing this full-screen (stretched); everything looks fine to me and the cards are readable. The interfaace has a few glitches that are merely inconvenient and in no-way game-breaking."

There are no options to change resolution, except for a 'fullscreen' option that simply stretches the small window image to the size of your screen, leaving it distorted. The game is arguably playable, but not having such basics as a genuine fullscreen option make the game sadly limited. Worse, this was reported immediately on release of the game, and acknowledged by the support representative on Steam, but there has been no apparent movement on fixing it.The developers occasionally pop up on the forums here to apologize and say that they're working on it, but the resolution issue was clear from the first release, and it has been a year since the last apology. Along with various other reported bugs, it's clear that there is very little ongoing work on the PC version from the developers.As a side note, this showed up in my Linux version of Steam as available for download, but isn't."

If you're unsure, I reccomend you try the free version of the iOS app. The game is great, and doesn't rely on you spending money to upgrade your deck like many other non-traditional card games: one purchase and that's it, you have everything you need to play the game. This also means that the game is completely fair and balanced from player to player, as everyone shares a game deck. Only critique, and it is a small one, is that often you will start the game with the &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥hand"" in which one of your Apprentices is replaced with a Militia, giving you less purchasing power to build your deck, and a useless +1 Power which cannot be used for anything. Getting this also means that you will get this same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand next time, as there is still another Miltia waiting in your deck. This can really slow down the start of the game, which can suck pretty bad. Just to avoid handing out 10s willy-nilly I'll give this game a 9.5/10 because it COULD be better, despite the fact that I am 100% content with it."
