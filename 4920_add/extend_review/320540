The graphics although nothing spectacular are collourful and refreshing for gaming in our times as racing games have switched for the realistic approach of more recent times and whilst this is good it also means we lose cool and charming little games like this.There's enough weapons to keep the gameplay mixed and you can upgrade your karts such as power and acceleration.It also comes woth full controller support and a multiplayer component which is nice.Overall my only negative criticism is that there aren't enough tracks but I feel the devs could easily add more if the community asked for them,All in all this game is fun especially for the price tag and you'll get a few hours gameplay from it. But if you like OAP's, Supercharged scooters and uzi's then give it a try,Ill add in a video from my YouTube playthrough so you can see the game in action.Overall score 7/10https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4N9X0Yho6E"

This game plays like road rash 64 crossed with mario cart 64, with a dash of flatout 2 added in. Only real downside is that it's kinda easy, beat the game in one try. Still, it has funny animations, funny concept and is good for a few hours."

You may like it, you may not.But I can't say I recommend this game. That's not to say it's bad. It is fun and slightly funny, but ultimately not very interesting. Other than a few funky aspects of the games physics (Getting stuck on objects or crashing you car randomly), its pretty smooth and balanced. The game is very short and offers a very basic couch co-op racer. Other than that there's nothing really to add.It acts as a place-holder for a Mario Kart style racer, and while it's fun for a little bit, I never found myself wanting to play it again after I beat the story mode (after little over an hour).If you don't own a game like this, this game will be good for you. But for those who have played other similar racers, it's not that interesting."

Each character have different ""powers"", but the difference between each one is very small, that seems only visual.The controls could be better, are simple (but sometimes sounds a little stiff), gameplay is simple, fun and addictive. During the game, you have the challenge of improving your vehicle with very funny visual upgrades. It has a lot of playable mods from single to multiplayer, which allows a wide range of choice. Open-world explore is a good and interesting mode to play. However, the multiplayer seems be nonexistent. Short game but very fun. While I played, I had a lot of fun.A note for the tutorial, simple and useful. New players will not have problems to start playing. At last, I don't understand the negative reviews that I read on the game page on Steam about this game. Seriously.Recommended game to buy on sale (as I did).Positive points. (+)Original and super fun concept.Useful tutorial.Fun gameplay.Controls could be better, but they're decent and nice to play.Pretty decent variety of weapons, upgrades and playable mods.Quite good for playing in family/with friends.Really interesting graphic models and textures, reminding cartoon.Negative points.

This game is quirky, crazy, competitive and all round a good laugh.The scooters handle quite well, the weapons in game are pretty fun and the circuits are full of tight turns, obstacles and zombies roaming the street! Sure it has aspects that could be improved such as acceleration up hills (its lags a little bit) and maybe pictures of the characters in races to see who is in what positions etc. However for an early access game it is damn good.

But hey now days you can get a sweet little buggy to drive you round. And when death comes for you you can deck out that buggy with weapons and say your not coming for me I'm coming for you. This is a fun little game but its nothing new just your standard cart racing game but with senior citizens. The levels are well designed and theres lots of upgrades. You can play on line and even free roam , so it has more features than your average cart game. I had fun playing it and its one of those games that offers a challenge and rewards."

It's really fun, even there is need for some costumization.When you upgrade your stuff, you can have more weapons etc. You can also upgrade your cart and the colour. It's not that much, but it's okay since you see this game in Early Access.What needs to be fixed:- Hills / speed (It feels that you stop, when you drive)- Sound settings (It's 100% loud and almost destroyed my headphones) You have to change it in windows.- The driving seems OK. I'm not the one who plays car-games so much, but it feels too lose. When you drive, it's okay and no delay, but turning is hard.- You fall off too easy (If you drive into few things)- They should add voice acting for cutscenes (in the beginning) It will feel more alive.- The game crashed first time for me, that it could't find a resolution? So it gave me this message box that it didn't support anything. A restart  & verfy files fixed it.- MORE WEAPONS PLEASE! :D- You should be able to shoot bagwards, when you have a weapon.- It would be great if you could change clothes, skins, etc.Overall for those things, i find it funny. I can't way to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of my friends. also note, that they are working on splitscreen and different stuff.

,Not Recommended,320540,19537790,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Shaolu,"This game has a cute concept with fairly decent graphics, and it can provide a few hours of *some*enjoyment, but...- Something about trying to steer on the existing track design is strangely more difficult than it seems like it should be. You're racing mobility scooters on public streets and yet it's challenging to not run into a wall while taking a corner. I probably end up doing this at least once in every race, and for my 66 year old mother (who was drawn to the concept and I thought might be ideal) it's completely constant. Using a gamepad with thumb sticks helps a bit, but I feel like even with a full blown steering wheel the winding tracks would still prove too difficult.- The problem with the above is exacerbated by AI bots that are *incredibly* effective. Even on the lowest difficulty level, it's hard not to get constantly hit by something, and there's no real shielding in the game. If you're lucky, when you notice you're being targeted with rockets or guns and you happen to pick up the defibrillator (a good example of the admittedly clever charm in this game), then you can disable the weapons of the bots immediately around you. However, that won't help if someone sneaks up and whacks you with a cane. It's also possible to lay down some oil slicks, but the bots always seem to successfully navigate around them.- It gets to a point where if you haven't upgraded your vehicle in just the right way, by the time you get to the last few tracks, it's virtually impossible to advance. I think I put too much into my transmission and/or weapons rather than upgrading my engine enough, and accordingly I simply couldn't go fast enough to even keep up with the other bots--even if I successfully managed to never hit any walls or get damaged by bots.- It's for the above reasons that I never successfully finished the single player campaign and the game proved so incredibly *frustrating* that I just gave up on the whole thing.Honestly, Super Tux Kart has far better gameplay and features on virtually every level--and that game is completely free and open source. The only thing Coffin Dodgers has that STK lacks is online multiplayer (as opposed to just local split screen). However, since the base game was this irritating I lost interest. I played a few matches online, but the issues persisted, and the only way I could imagine it being halfway enjoyable is if I played without any bots, and last I checked there weren't a lot of servers setup this way anyways.Meanwhile STK features...- Drifting support where you can gain speed while skidding around corners- Wider more open tracks that are easier to navigate and far more enjoyable to play with more diverse settings and interesting elements- Weapon and defense upgrades that are more well balanced- A broader difficulty scale which facilitates AI that won't completely murder you when you're just trying to play through a casual kart racing game- It even has better graphicsAll things considered, while the game's concept has some initial charm, I can't recommend it with the current state of its gameplay, especially when there's better cheaper options available. Rather than spending $11 on this game, you'd be better off taking that money and donating it to Super Tux Kart (you'll get a bonus level or two that way too).http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/"

The game play leaves a lot to be desired however. Most of the maps have insanely sharp turns and there is no upgrade to improve steering. You either spend the game hitting walls and betting bounced backwards or ride your brake, which is not an effective racing strategy. Especially since brake is also reverse. If you try to brake too hard you (for more than 1 second) you will go into reverse. The AI weapons seem to be able to track while yours can only fire in a straight line. I have gone around other racers and obsticals and still been hit. Decent enough game, though I personally would recommend buying this one on sale rather than paying full price for it"

Well it tries but naaah it's not..Negative PointsAI- Horribly unfair. The AI is totally unbalanced and unfair. After a few races the ""dead"" AI got a clear unfair advantage (better top speed, better acceleration).- There is also some kind of ""one way rubber banding"" effect for the AI so they will catch up every time, no matter how good/fast you drive. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!- AI often ignores each other and just wait for you to shoot their weapons on you. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!- Winning is a matter of luck. You dominated the whole race? How about a few rockets from a bot, how just caught you up with light speed, so you lose the race on the last 10 meters?Weapons- Unbalanced. Too many aimbot weapons, poor possibilities for defense.- Only a few different weapons.Controls- Bad and broken. If you brake you will instantly stand still or even drive backwards which sucks if you want to drive/drift around curves.- Key assignment works badly. Double assignment all time..- Controlling/driving just feels not good.Multiplayer- Dead. If you find 1-2 players it will lags or the connection will be interrupted.

Coffin Dodgers gets the most important aspects of the genre right: good controls, appealing graphics, a decent variety of pickups strewn throughout each track, and a garage to upgrade your kart. It also has a morbid sense of humor that hits all the right notes.As with any kart racing game, winning is a combination of skill and luck. Yes, there will be times when you're in first place, five feet from winning the race, and you get scattered to the wind by an opposing racer's rocket. The result? Sixth place. If that bothers you, you probably shouldn't be playing a kart racing game in the first place. It's just part of the genre.Overall, I thought the skill vs luck aspect of the racing to be well balanced. If I raced well, I usually had a chance to win and generally finished in the top three. If I finished toward the bottom of the leaderboard, I usually felt I made too many mistakes.I do have some minor quibbles with Coffin Dodgers however. Projectile weapons can't be fired backwards. If you get a rocket or a machine gun while in first place, it's basically useless. The ability to fire backwards, even if doing so would give you less chance of a direct hit, would be a welcome addition.Another minor disappointment is that there doesn't seem to be any shortcuts or alternative routes on the tracks, at least not that I found. Also, while you can choose from seven different characters to race as, they don't seem to have unique attributes that make racing with one character a different experience than racing as another.Despite these issues, I enjoyed my time with Coffin Dodgers. I beat the game in about three hours, and I definitely wasn't rushing. I replayed many of the tracks several times, not because I needed to improve my standing, but because I enjoyed the track and wanted to race it again before moving on.Is Coffin Dodgers the best kart racer on Steam? Nope. That woud be Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed. If you want the second best, get F1 Race Stars. But as a kart racing fan, I consider Coffin Dodgers to be a solid addition to my library.Coffin Dodgers is easy to recommend to kart racing fans, especially if it's on sale."

Sure, more tracks, but I bought it mainly for multiplayer, and all you can do there is single race or ""explore"", which lets you drive the area with no other opponents. All you do is drive around and once in a while shoot the other player, which doesn't change the score or anything.Plus, the music gets annoying after 10 minutes, play the demo and imagne hearing that in a loop."

The controls are simple, gameplay is simple, fun and addictive.  The only downside is there is no volume control in-game."

,Not Recommended,320540,26567824,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,t.tv/TehFreakPlays,The physics are horrible and its very easy to get caught on fenceposts that arent sticking out or things that arent things.  Cant find a handbrake key on they keyboard - its a fun multiplayer game if you have a network of friends but there are no randoms playing and its enjoyable for all the wrong reasons.  Feels as though devs have abandoned the thing.
