,Not Recommended,320630,16057192,"Posted: 29 May, 2015",all,ToastKat,"tl;dr:  Equally frustrating and boring. Do not play.It is neither healthy nor wise for your player, when playing your game, to at any point think, ""Oh dear god there's more."" Nor is it healthy or wise for your player, when still in the middle of playing said game, takes time out of their gameplay to begin writing a very scathing review of said game. In ""Season Match"", the player is at the mercy of a physics engine so wonky, even Gordon Freeman wouldn't be able to make as see-saw out of it. Too many levels depend on the player being able to navigate a herd of gems through a narrow passage, and this is practically impossible between the unpredictable falling patterns of said gems and the unreliable rng creating more gems in an order that throws all strategy out the window. I was able to beat several levels just by furiously clicking around, as the gameplay is artificially lengthened by arbitrary goals of clearing X number of gems. The powerups are useless. The game doesn't even take the time to explain what they do and you can only refill your powerups on certain levels. Just used the magic wand? Too bad! This level only refills the dagger you never use. But wait! There's also gold you can collect and purchase refills for your powerups. Again, the game never tells you that you can do this, and I only found out through a session of random clicking when I was bored. And speaking of never telling you anything, there is no story. The game will make you believe there is, but three frames of animation, character stills, and four paragraphs of text do not a story make. As I crawl closer to the end of the game, all I can think of is that this is babby's first programming. It feels so cheaply made and thrown out onto the market as quickly as possible without any consideration of whether or not it's ""good"". The only silver lining I can find is that it'll make my achievement stats go up. Woo."

The game throws in power ups and obstacles for you to over come to add a challenge. The game allows you to play in a causal mode which is has no timer or a more challenging more where each level is timed, I played the game on the casual mode because I just wanted to relax, yet I still found myself really hyped up to get to the next level. The levels may begin to all seem the same after a while but they are not, however I do recommend playing in small bursts to avoid it getting repetitive, especially if you play on casual mode.The game play is very solid and simple to grasp. The story is weak but you're probably not playing it for that. The Snow Queen, not Elsa, broke her favorite mirror so has brought eternal winter upon the land. You have to help the other seasons find the pieces and make the Snow Queen happy again. That's it. Simple but I was curious to meet the queen herself.If you like casual games then you'll enjoy this one. Yes, there are a lot of games like this out there but again I enjoyed the artwork a lot. Plus the all female cast was a selling point as well. Such lovely seasons! The game also offers trading cards to collect and create badges with which really boosts the appeal of this title as well the achievements.For more recommendations and reviews on our favorite up and coming quality games followLot's O Giveaway'sgroup curationshere!"
,Not Recommended,320630,12885222,"Posted: 11 November, 2014",all,baja gaijin,"This is technically a ""match-3"" title, but it's of the vein where you need to click 3+ connected pieces of a type to destroy them all, not ""three in a row = destroyed"".  The problem is... well, this is the beginning of a series. And like any first game in one of these casual titles, it's rough in a lot of ways. (See: Bejeweled, 7 Wonders, etc.)Specifically, the biggest problem comes in how powerups and board-shapes work*. This title does not have the ""there will always be a viable move"" code of a Bejeweled 2+, or the constantly-refilling powerups of a 7 Wonders. Your powerups straight up only recharge when you break adjacent icons of that powerup. and it takes... 5? 6? per powerup to recharge it. But they only appear on certain levels! So if you use a powerup, you're placing a bet you won't need it at all until the next board that has that icon on it. They don't appear on all stages.The board shapes, on the other hand, come down to this: when new pieces fall in, they only fall from the ""top"" of the screen on most boards. (Some really strangely shaped ones break this rule.)  BUT. It's not a permanent ""refill the board, if a piece breaks, you get new ones"" thing like most other titles. If there's debris in the way, or you didn't destroy a piece with a clear ""path"" to the top of the screen, nothing new falls. This, combined with the ""no guaranteed matches"" I mentioned above, means you WILL have to restart some levels if the RNG doesn't play nice. It can make unwinnable, unalterable states.I bought all three games in the series at once, and am moving onto SM2 after writing this. I hope that the game was improved between sequels. This one has aged terribly, make it a last resort.* I am playing on ""Hard"" out of two difficulties, Easy and Hard. If this is different on Easy, please, use that mode instead."
,Recommended,320630,13935873,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,theotherwinchester,"The game has very minimal plot to it, but you should expect that when it comes to this kind of game. Some plot is better than no plot, I suppose, so I'm not really going to focus on that. The game is really simple, all you have to do is find groups of three or more gems and click on one of the gems to destroy the whole group, which is the goal. Different levels have different special mechanics to them, like the shamrock destroying all of the gems in the level, allowing all new gems to fall, the ice wand looking thing destroys all the gems of a certain color, I'm pretty sure, I never really caught on to what it did, to be honest. there's the fire torch thing, which burns I think, 4 gems, putting 4 news one in their place, and lastly, the dagger, which destroys a whole row of gems diagonally. The game is entertaining enough, at least the main campaign one, but once it got down to trying to get that final achievement for finishing the Arcade, playing the game became an excercise in tedium. It uses the same level layouts, the same gems, the same mechanics... it just gets boring and repetitious. But man, I was not going to let an easy 100% game slip through my grasps because I was bored. I stuck it through and finished it and it only took me 9 and a half hours! Oh dear god. On second thought, I don't think the 1 percent increase on my overall achievement percentage was worth the repetetive stress injury...Buy it on sale and play it in your spare time when you're really bored and have nothing better to do, and easily get a 100% game just by playing it every once in a blue moon, super casually. Don't marathon it like I did, and you might actually enjoy it. It's not a bad game, it's just not a game that should be marathoned."

However, if you're looking for a simple, casual, and relaxing game of match then this fits the bill perfectly.  The price is right, especially if you can find this on sale.  The achievements are simple to get, though the arcade mode portion takes quite a grind to get to.  Overall, not a bad indie game that is worth your while."
,Not Recommended,320630,15972237,"Posted: 23 May, 2015",all,rocketsurgeon,"So, this is another casual gem-matching game, and the basic mechanics of the game are perfectly fine. Nothing spectacular or innovative about it, but reasonably competent. If this was it, and it didn't have its game breaking bugs (see below), I'd have given the game a thumbs up. Not a very enthusiastic thumbs up, but still a thumbs up.What ruins things for me with the game are two things. First of all, bugs. Or rather,abug. On multiple occasions, when just having finishing a level, and in fact while theLevel complete!message is dropping down from the top of the game, it just stops. It's not frozen, per se, because the animations of gems etc keep running happily, but the message stops in the middle of falling, and then nothing more happens. Fine, you say - I accidentally hit the pause key or something - and the first time around, this is what I thought, too. Except, the keyboard was nowhere near me at the time. And nothing I could think of to do would make the game resume. Eventually, I ended up having to kill it.Sure, I can re-start the game, redo the level and be on my way, but it's annoying. When it happens again, and again, and again, it goes beyond annoying, however.The second thing that ruins thing for me is... the story. Now, a game like this doesn't really need a story. It's abstract enough that trying to fit the game play into a narrative is going to be contrived, at best, but I have to agree that one or two similar games have managed to integrate a story of sorts in ways that not only doesn't detract from the game, but actually add to it in a small way.This, however, is not one of them. While it is possible, and not too time and click-consuming to get past the story elements, they feel decidedly""glued on""and redundant, and as you advance through levels, more and more of an annoyance. Then, at some point, they just stop, as if the developers, too, figured that they added nothing and just were something people would click past without caring about. A speed bump, if you will. After this, the story makes intermittent returns, but those just serve to underline how redundant and detached from the actual game the story really is.So, in conclusion - the actual core game is OK, but seeing as how there are tons of similar games out there that both implement the core game better (and without game breaking bugs), as well as provide a better context for the game, there really is no compelling reason to bother with this one."
,Not Recommended,320630,21484910,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Lestrade 尚,"Gosh, what a bad game...If anybody needs proof that a match-3 puzzle game isn't the kind of thing where you can afford to be a lazy programmer, then here it is.PROS:- None. Quite rare for me, as I'm easy to please when it comes to gaming.CONS:- The gameplay is a mix between 'Clickomania' (a very old match-3 game, and certainly not the most exciting kind) and 'modern' match-3's with powerups and other silly things. But Clickomania's main interest was based on whether you could remove all of the tiles from a board without any lockups. You know, an actual puzzle... There's no such thing here, and lockups most likely happen at the beginning of a stage when very few blocks are available to click on. Then the level just reshuffles, very slowly. And it's not even our fault...- Sometimes when a level ends, nothing happens. You actually have to click the Menu button, then Resume, for the game to find its way again. And if it shows you an achievement, then you have to do it twice.- Story is ridiculous. It's only told through a simple block of text at the beginning of each season (series of levels). I didn't get any story panel for Autumn, which is either a solid bug, or even more laziness on their side.- The first season is mostly dedicated to tutorials, but you get rainbow blocks in a few levels before they're properly introduced.- Clicks don't always register. A mortal sin for a match-3. In fact, there is no feeling of pleasure when you click stuff.- The music is bland and generic, the graphics are passable in general but blocks themselves vary from okay to very ugly. And since you'll be spending most of your time watching them, hmm...- Power-ups are incorrectly explained. Seriously, did the game bug and forget to tell me something?- Some levels are hard and annoying (requiring you to wait for animations to complete so you can actually reach a single tile), and are followed by a very easy level. Where's the difficulty curve?- Levels require you to click a certain amount of blocks of every color, but they also ask you to finish something that wasn't explained everywhere and that was expressed in percentage values... Okay... Except you have to get that value to zero, rather than 100. At that point, the game designer may very well be a misunderstood genius.- When you complete a level, the game says it was level '2-1' (first episode, season 2) when the bottom of the screen gives you a sequential number (16). Quality check, anyone?!- Level time limits are so short (even in relaxed mode, where running out of time doesn't end the level), that you can't help but think that they expect you to click mindlessly everywhere.- Animations are so slow that you not only click mindlessly, you click *randomly* because you don't know in advance how many blocks will be removed by clicking them.I just couldn't get myself to complete the quest mode. In fact, I'd be ashamed to finish it, because it would mean I got some pleasure out of it. Definitely not worth the $0.8 I paid for it."

There are many more better match 3 games out there especally since this one doesn't even really have matching its more just spot 3+ and click it. Infact on most of the game you can just randomly click all over the screen and beat the level really fast. I bought this game for my Aunt, she enjoyed it aswell but found herself randomly clicking as well. I own all three games I must say they do get progressively better storywise. In Season match 2+3 the minigames do break up the game a bit so its not just the same thing over and over again, at somepoints the minigames proved more fun than the actual game.All in all it is a simple casual game, I'd recommend it only if that is what you are looking for. If you wanted better gameplayed I'd say get season match 3 it being the best of the lot that I played but the characters are recurring through the franchise so if you enjoy these type of games getting all three for the story wouldn't be too absurd even if they are short and the plot isn't too thick. lol"

The recent trend of indie games tripping all over themselves, trying to prove how retro-hardcore they are as a selling point is leaving me increasingly irate. The amount of time allotted for completion of levels in Action mode implies that the designer wanted most of the levels to be spam-clicked rather than thought out. And that's fine too.There are 260 levels by my count, so I suppose it's a treat if you like this kind of gameplay though it gets very repetitive after a while. You only have to finish the first 160 for the final achievement so it's not that bad."

If you’re into bubblewraps and and if you can still be motivated to play this type of game after first ten minutes go for it.

It is the first of the series, and she actually plays it a lot, so, I guess, it is good.From my experience, it is actually a good game with some pretty good time into it, but not really clear about its intentions. My mom does not speak english, so, once she finished the Quest mode, she actually thought the game was over and didn't see the arcade mode. The game should make it clearer that there is another mode that is different from the quest mode.The graphic is ok, the pieces from the game are not really well made, but they are ok. The game has some nice art on the characters and overall the stages backgrounds.The game is also pretty cheap and gets even cheaper with sales. If you like this type of match 3 game, I think it is nice to get this one."

Just no.Give this game a pass, as there are many better games of this type on Steam. It's just way too frustrating to be worth your time and money."

I keep coming back to it when I want to play a nice match game with a lot of nice special effects. No wierd non match game/puzzles like the others, just good clicky fun.I had to delete my original review to post this, original was:Very nice and addictive match-3 game. I liked that I could play completely in a mode without a timer (I hate games with timers)."

Season Match was not terrible, but I didn't feel like complexity scaled very well.  The maps themselves lack the sophistication of 4 Elements, the graphics are mediocre and it would have been a nice touch for the soundtrack to change as you completed each season and help give each chapter of the quest play its own flavor."
