Not 250 ""missions"" as stated in the description above.----Classic match-game just like 4-Elements for example, nothing much to say.Smooth backgrounds, nice soundtrack - Everything looks fine, but nothing special.I managed to finish the game and get 100% achievements within 3hours due wild clicking, no tactics needed.This game is good for the quick and brainless fun. Or for people who want to grab another 100% quickly ;)"

Now with mini-games that are fairly easy or a pain in the a-s-s.Like #1 in the series, the story is forgettable, graphics are ok, sounds are great and character portraits are fantastic!Great fun when you just want some dumb stuff to do."

It's a non-standard Match 3 title with every other stage being hidden object ""goals"" on the same map per world, and an incredibly bizarre story about warring... seasons? Months? Whatever they are, a bunch of differently-Asian people representing these concepts all bicker and magic at one another until you help them out or repel their opponent. Via matching and breaking and clicking all 20 of the things that sort of blend into the map.Competently done though! Gotta give it that. They polished up the original's rough edges."
,Recommended,320650,18075308,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,Pi,"70 levels.   30 match-3 levels, 30 Hidden Object levels, 10 Mini Game levels.I would not say it's the most fun match-3 game.   Montezuma's  much better.   Puzzle Quest again much better.For the game lay, Match-3 click as fast as possible in the areas with largest groupings.  the HOB are easy/straight forward.  The mini games are mildly fun except the daisy one - that one isn't fun, frustrating is the most generous description I can give it.There's nothing brutal about the game, but neither is it overly captivating.   Last achievement is difficult.I gave it a borderline thumbs up, but I can definitely understand why someone would have an opposing point of view.Definitely wouldn't pay full price."

There are two mini games that are INSANELY fast. I tried CPU killer at 75% and different mouse settings and didn't come close.  It is crazy to have difficult mini games in a match 3 format!"
,Not Recommended,320650,28293804,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,TheCyberDruid,Nice match 3 game with horribly annoying minigames. Every second level is a super simple hidden object scene and at the end of each stage there's an annoying and often quite difficult minigame. This really makes playing the game a chore.

Which seemed pointless.Also, each level includes a hidden object round - which is fine. The problem, for me, came with the occasional challenges that you have to pass to get back on to the match games: one protecting daisies from being blasted, and the one that entirely blocked me from going further: one clicking on an expanding flurry of snowflakes. Both of these were all about extremely fast reflexes, and clicking furiously for a couple of minutes.I'm not adverse to fast-action games, but I'd not expected them to crop up in a match game, nor to be as challenging as they are, quite randomly in a completely different genre. I bought the game for relaxation, and quick-thinking strategy, but it ended up being a frantic click-fest."
,Not Recommended,320650,30183824,Posted: 25 February,all,Taller-Paul [iRiSHMAN],"After completing Season Match 1 not even 24 hours ago i couldn't wait for my second installment of the game, the layout in the first game was perfect the game play was perfect, it was easy on the eyes, so what could they do to improve the game nothing! instead to release their 2nd game they decide to add pain in the♥♥♥♥♥mini games which ruin the game experince.Between each level there's a mini-game of hidden object, which is straining on the eyes, the CPU shoots away up for no apparent reason too and the game seems determind to run on my gtx graphics card rather than standard intel hd which it's more than capable of, i wouldn't expect such a simple game to require so much resource.The User Layout has got worse at least with the first version of the game it explained every power up and how to use them however in this version they just have random leafs in jars with no explanation.the tile patterns don't work out very well meaning you cant clear all the obstructions to pass the level and your forced to use power-ups to complete the level.So yeah my advice stick to the first version of the game not the second version of the game, if it's not broken don't fix it!"

,Recommended,320650,16638176,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Sessuro,"5/10I liked this game but it has no real value. There are many more better match 3 games out there especally since this one doesn't even really have matching its more just spot 3+ and click it. Infact on most of the game you can just randomly click all over the screen and beat the level really fast. I bought this game for my Aunt, she enjoyed it aswell but found herself randomly clicking as well. I own all three games I must say they do get progressively better storywise. And the minigames do break up the game a bit so its not just the same thing over and over again, at somepoints the minigames proved more fun than the actual game lol.All in all it is a simple casual game, I'd recommend it only if that is what you are looking for. If you wanted better gameplayed I'd say get season match 3 it being the best of the lot that I played but the characters are recurring through the franchise so if you enjoy these type of games getting all three for the story wouldn't be too absurd even if they are short and the plot isn't too thick. lol"

It took me 6 hours to get all the achievements for Season Match 1, 10 hours for Season Match 3, but only 3!! hours to get everything in this one. It's very light. There are like only 35 matching levels, 30 hidden object levels and 7 mini-game levels. They even didn't care to implement an ending to the game >_< A bit disappointing, prefer the others and buy this one if, like me, you really wanted to play some more."
,Not Recommended,320650,16635710,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Abby,"I completed the first game, it wasn't great but it was relaxing enough. This game however is very frustrating because it has a bug that makes level progression impossible. The bombs don't ""explode everything around them"" so some blocks are impossible to clear if it is a chain-reaction level. I'm stuck on level 17.I like the addition of the different hidden object minigames etc inbetween levels, but I haven't seen many as I'm stuck, so...Until they do a bug fix, don't buy this unplayable game!"
,Not Recommended,320650,14382422,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,pesha.vashti,"I liked the first one because of the fun Match 3 concepts. I'm completely against the stupid minigames with the glitchy cursor which won't move/doesn't respond in anything approaching relative ease. It's completely impossile to kill the fast moving obstacles in some of the rounds with the responsivity given in the controls. I turned OFF the custom cursor with no resolve to the slow responsivity. It's literally just the game. Lagging. Like a lagger who lags. Add in that I really, really, really do not like games where the whole point is mindlessly clicking as quickly as I can with no strategy whatsoever involved and no, I would not buy this game again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Will I mindlessly click until I get 100% on this game? Maybe. I don't know. I can't decide if I want to waste more of my life on this or not. If I get beyond this minigame? It will be due to pure random chance."

The art for the ""enemies"" you match battle against looks like it was stolen from a different game due to style choice. Not fun even for someone who sort of liked the first game because it's not enough like the first game. This game auto pauses, which SM1 didn't, so that's a plus. The screenshot ability didn't work for me in either game."

But probably HATE the minigames.Minigames are disappointingly ""difficult"". Not because they are designed to be, but because the mouse controls are really clunky, lag is bad only during the minigames (you click and it does not register half the time due to lag...), the hitboxes on targets must be 1 pixel in size. If you don't hit that sigle pixel... sorry, you lose and get to do it over again and agian.  The Achievemnets for getting all of the Sharpshooter trophies won;t happen for me, since I don;t have aim assist and don;t have super human relexes.Very much a let down, after enjoying wasting my time on Season Match. Wish i could recommend this game, but I honestly cannot, in good faith. The scenery is even prettier than the original game, but that's the only real pro I can find.4/10 - mainly for poor optimization for mouse controls, clunky cointrols and ridiculously difficult ""easy"" minigames due to those clunky controls and lag."
