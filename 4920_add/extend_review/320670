,Recommended,320670,13947348,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Praxis-[CE],"The third game in the Season Match series offers more of the same match-3 style play from the first two games. This time there is a bit more content, it took me a little longer to beat this one than it did the first two games combined. There's a story mode, where you have to free Month-themed characters from the evil clutches of the Witch Crow by matching gems until certain treasures are unlocked. In between the match-3 rounds, there are little mini-games which require finding objects, sorting out puzzle pieces, or comparing two pictures to spot the differences. I found the mini-games in Season Match 3 to be more consistent, and more in-line with the overall game itself than the ones in Season Match 2.Unfortunately the issue with some of the small, oddly-shaped boards where gems are prevented from falling depending on the blocks that remain is still an issue, and the crystal shards that lock up more blocks makes the problem quite a bit worse on some maps, preventing any gems from falling to refill at all. Some powerups can get around this, but not all powerups are available on each board so sometimes the only solution was to restart. And restart again.Still, Season Match 3 - Curse of the Witch Crow is a nice match-3 game that's good for killing some time or relieving some stress. Or just adding some achievements, if that's your thing, since the series has great steam integration with trading cards, achievements, and nice items."

Warning: if you don't have a widescreen monitor, unless there's something I'm missing in the (minimal) options screen, you're going to have a hard-to-impossible time clearing some of those, items can be ""offscreen"". The window is 4:3 and the game seems designed for 16:9... but won't display as such no matter what I do.Please be aware of that before buying. That's not really a black mark on the game? But it is a problem."

,Recommended,320670,13976130,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,purplepenguinjen,"This third iteration of the series adds an arcade mode. The Story mode is half collapse style puzzles and half other puzzles types including hidden object, sorting picture tiles, find the difference, and some arcade style mini games.  The story is mildly amusing.  My only complaint is the the final piece of the story never shows, so you have no idea how the story ends.  This game is recommended for those who love puzzle games."
,Recommended,320670,31610578,Posted: 7 May,all,Ɗʊىƙƒαℓℓ ✬,"Way surpassed my expectations! Great graphics, loads of levels, fun minigames and someone actually bothered to make a story to tie it all together, which is cringe worthy but I like that about it. Achievements are clear, despite possibly being slightly grindy. My favorite aspect is definetly the variation in ""special abilities"" unlocked per character. It's well worth the price, I can't think of a single drawback."
,Recommended,320670,12764707,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,pango,If you play the timed version the timer is pretty brutal. I have had to do some levels about 5 times before I got them done in the time available. This is a good thing.
,Recommended,320670,26157827,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,Serieus,"Fun matching game with different special abilities as you progress through the game.  There are lots of hidden object games in this one and I felt like the game took much longer than it needed to last.  It overstayed its fun time.  Other than that it was a good game, well made, and definitely entertaining.  Easy achievements for those who enjoy chasing those."

,Recommended,320670,15244464,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,Naruto,"Not bad for a match three game, but the random clicking of one square kind of removes the skill of actually clearing puzzles. I guess it is no different from the other 2 in the series. Decent game; as others indicate, it is a great casual time killer, button masher on the mouse and probably get carpal tunnel after achieving 100%.One thing I wish it had was a cloud save, as I lost the save file when I changed operating systems, but overall it's an easy game to 100% achievements if you like collecting those. Grab this game at the next Summer sale.9/10"

My mom plays this game and she actually likes it a lot (I bought mostly for her).This game is even way prettier than the first in the series. It tries to have a story, but that's not the important part here. The game achieves nice puzzles where you'll manage to spend some time into it.Overall, I don't have a reason to not recommend it."
76561198032575440,Not Recommended,320670,34431737,Posted: 23 August,all,potato,"I love Match-3 games, and I like the kind with minigames (especially hidden objects).  This one looked like one of my usual guilty pleasures: glossy album-cover art, modular frame story (collect items to free the personification of each month of the year because A Witch Did It).Sadly, I overlooked the fact that the core mechanicisn't Match-3, not as we know it.You don't shuffle or move tiles (""gems""); you just click on where you see 3 or more of them together and all the connected ones disappear.  I can't articulate why that's so much less satisfying, but it is.  I imagine that other goofy Match-3 people like myself will feel the same and want to be aware of this.Also, the hidden object minigame is just not possible in windowed mode; there's stuff that gets cropped off on the borders.  (It was awfully difficult on fullscreen, too; there's no way to adjust the resolution in-game and by that point I didn't want to bother messing with my display settings)."

The one thing I was looking forward to, was the gathering of the months at the end of the game, but it didn't happen. hopefully there will be a match 4 and it will continue from the ending of match 3. When playing this game I loved the artwork and the scenes are spectacular. If you like match games, this one I highly recommend. Enjoy and have fun, it's worth playing. ps, remember to read all the rules and tips it really helps with the game,Thanks,Skinnydugan"

There's no way to change the resolution or switch to widescreen mode in the game options; you have to actually change your monitor resolution. I didn't feel like bothering with that, so I got a refund."

When you can't really think or just need a game to take your mind off things = this is it!  I learned to speed click super well and to enjoy it at the same time.  It helps having wonderful graphics, a story line, hidden objects, and LOADS of puzzles to do (to click through heh heh).  Unlocking powers and testing them is also amusing.  Thank you for making this game.  :))))!"
