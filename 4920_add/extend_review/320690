Frankly it's disappointing when you discover a developer and publisher who are willing to hoodwink customers by continuing to sell a broken product on Steam with zero concern to fix it or in providing any productive feedback. This game has had a serious bug of just crashing after 20 - 30 minutes of gameplay since its release on Steam. The problem with this is, whatever treasure chest you are working on, if you have not saved any of your acquired stars or checkpoints reached, you may have to go back and do that particular chest your working on all over again.5 tombs with 8 chests each and each chest having 2 - 5 score requirements needing to be reached to unlock them. You will have at least a minute on each chest to try and get the highest score possible which is achieved by matching at least two colour pairs together for example a 3 yellow combo followed by another 3 yellow combo, this will give you a score frenzy which doubles the score to all your matches for at least a ten second period from that time onwards. Other than pairing colours you also get additional benefits by matching up 4, 5 and 6 pairs and also get more score benefit if your pairs being matched up contain gems inside them.It's not exactly easy and you will be forced to have many retries simply because the game never plays fair and often gives you a completely jumbled up mess from the 7 colour varieties. Occasionally you will also be challenged in each tomb by a set of 3 clear these puzzle boards within a certain number of required moves. Each chest you open you will be given a star which you then spend to help level up your totems and puzzle matching perks. Once you have completed all 5 tombs you receive a big diamond and the chance to do it on an expert difficulty there is also a number of in game achievements which basically just demands a lot of constant replay.In a nut shell the game would not be bad if it was not for the bugs, it’s strange to note that you can actually play ‘treasure of Montezuma’ and ‘treasure of Montezuma 2’ online for free and both earlier versions, though being free, work really well, yet ironically the 'treasure of Montezuma 3' which demands payment is an inferior broken product. Where do your priorities lie Alawar?"

,Not Recommended,320690,29781168,Posted: 8 February,all,Lestrade 尚,"I was going to give this a positive review, because I was about to finish it, and if you spend 10 hours on a game, maybe it's not that bad.Despite the regular crashes that take you back to the very beginning of your current 'treasure' (series of levels).Despite the ridiculous puzzle levels that require to solve 3 in a row to get an extra star -- I'm all fine with having to solve them one at a time, star or not, but 3 just completely kills the mood, so I just skipped those after a while.Despite the excrutiating length of the game (there are probably 200 levels or something, none of which are particularly interesting, it's all just randomized).Despite the uneven difficulty (I was bored to death for most of the game, and then the end was so hard I had to retry some levels many times for no reason).And despite the complete lack of a story (which, okay, isn't a staple of Montezuma games, but this one really has nothing at all).I thought that at least the game 'knows' how to engage you with sound effects, animations and explosions. It's a good time waster, even if it's not as good as its successors.And then I finished the game and it said, ""Congratulations, you reached the rank of Divine Master, would you like to try Expert mode now?"", I said no thank you, I'll just replay the last few levels and try to improve my score. No can do. I'm thrown back to the beginning, and everything is locked again. So much for a casual game. So much for being a divine master. Don't call me that and then tell me I am not the god of you. You made me believe for a second.No, seriously, this is both a great match-3 and a terrible game."

76561197998830602,Not Recommended,320690,12607060,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,jonjermey,"Ludicrously difficult. The tile layout is random, and you have no control over what tokens drop, and no time to spend planning strategy, as each level is over in one minute, so your score for each level is largely a matter of luck. But you have to reach a certain high score in order to progress, and by the time you get to level 3-5 or thereabouts, you're only getting that score once in every ten or fifteen games. So you need to play each level over and over and over and over again waiting for the lucky break that will allow you to progress. It's a shame that the progression system is so crappy, because the game itself is fun -- but going back for to the same level for the fifteenth or twentieth time to try and get lucky is just a pain."

I have about 5 hours of gameplay and during that time it has crashed around 20 times, so if this is not fixed I won't play this no more.

,Not Recommended,320690,33203636,Posted: 3 July,all,Prankster-MMA,"It could be fun game to play, but it isn't. It's very annoying game to play.Game often crashes causing reseting level or skipping possibility to buy ingame upgrades.3 step bonus level is fun for few levels, after that it's getting annoying, especially when game crushes while playing it.When I play expert mode and I'm stuck, every few tries game is asking if I want to switch to casual (easy) mode... NO I DON'T WANT to switch, I'm playing expert mode for a reason, I already played casual and I want to play expert. If being stuck on level wasn't frustrating enough..."

It has happened to me twice so far, and the second time it deleted ALL my progress, which I had been playing the game for a total hour, and that is just gone now. Obviously this is a MASSIVE problem that I hope is solved soon, but other than that, I really enjoy this game. It has puzzle solving, a bejewled-type feel with unique mechanics, and the Totems in the shop are fun and exciting to use in game.Please fix this game crashing issue."
