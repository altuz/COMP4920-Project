,Recommended,320760,14469027,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,MeovvCAT,"This game... This game is great! The day it came out, I was a little skeptical... But after staying up all the way till 4am, my judgement was gone and I bought it... NO. REGRETS.Tokyo School Life is a Visual Novel of the bishoujo variety (It's basically a dating sim where you choose between several dialogue lines and those affect the girl that falls in love with you).If you're here for Hentai, go on the internet, play NEKOPARA (not the steam version lol), I don't care. This is not where you will get it: There is NO patch, this game was not intended as an Eroge, it was intended as a heartwarming story!You play as (Your Name Here. Yes. I'm serious!). Or atleast an 18 Year Old *What If...* version of yourself. The canon name is John Smith so let's call him John-san! You find out that the best student in class gets to go to a Japanese High School for 2 months, so you study your♥♥♥♥♥off and WIN! You get on a plane, hoping to find your sweet kawaii waifu.On the way, you meet Karin, Aoi and Sakura (In that order), three girls with different personalities, who surprise, surprise! They are the ONLY people who live in your dorm! That sneaky perv sensei... I'm not complaining though.Depending on your choices (that are pretty obvious by the way, because the character's eyes blink like little stars if your answer pleases them...) and Depending on dialogue your final choice is locked. Normally that pisses me off, like those inFAMOUS endings... But here it actually makes sense! I won't spoil it for you though.Gameplay wise, it's pretty damn solid! The story is funny, especially the iPad chat sessions between the girls discussing your choices (Gossip is so fun!). The E-mote technology, seen before in Nekopara, is actually more fluid and realistic now, sadly, there is no breat bounciness gauge. 0/10 would not bang again! Just kidding lol.Also, I heard there is no fullscreen function unless you enter ALT+Enter, I have to check on that... So I can't really subtract points based on that.There is some mild humour, especially involving otaku culture, so that's pretty cool.You can go up to 900 saves, so that's pretty cool, and the languages in the game are great! You can also set the textbox speed to match the voices from the characters, so if you want to train Japanese, this isn't good for basics, but it's great for advanced learners.Bad Things:The voice acting is epic. If you don't like it, you can disable particular characters. That's right. Love Karin's, but hate Aoi's childish voice? Disable her voice.However, only these three have a voice. John-san doesn't have a voice, and that's great, because it's supposed to be you, and a Japanese voice would ruin the immersion. But even NEKOPARA had voices for the side characters, like the Moving Truck Guy...Final Thoughts:Tokyo School Life is good. When I bought it, I didn't know what I was gonna get, so it went way beyond my expectations.The story, the graphics, the voice acting... EVERYTHING was just PERFECT!I can't give it a str8 8/8, because of some annoying things, but this game deserves a FULL ON 8.5/10 MUST BUY TITLE! Add this to your library NOW!TL;DR: This game has actual people in the background. 420/69, would printscreen again."

This is aiming at least to be a partial education experience and needs some appeal. which it delivers with some sweet, light hearted humour. A student from the United States obsessed with Japanese Culture fulfils  his lifelong dream and becomes an exchange student in Tokyo for two months.. He lives with three  girls, Sakura, Aoi and Karin. During his time there they give him memories he will never forget. This is pure escapism and a chance to live vicariously. So sit back, don't think too hard and enjoy the ride.CharactersThe three female characters  fit into the stereotypes expected; Karin is sexy, Sakura is classy and Aoi is cute but all with some quirks. Most of these quirks might be familiar to anime fans but still give some nice, funny moments. Despite some stereotypes  the characters are all well written and very likeable. This was clearly  intended  as Karin could of easily of been a ♥♥♥♥♥ and Aoi could of been a lolicon character but the focus is on their somewhat typical personalities. There is a romantic ending for each girl which can be gained through getting enough affection points. There is also a forever alone ending for completionists and a special message for completing all endings.LearningAs previously mentioned there is some learning aspects about Japanese culture for everyone such as food, customs and information about the History of Tokyo and other places in Japan. If you don't play these type of games often the anime aspects such as mangas might be completely new to you. For people interested in practising their language skills there is the choice of  Japanese, Hiragana and Romaji.ArtworkThis uses uses M2 2D Emote Engine and multi-platform novel engine, Kaleido ADV Workshop. The end result for the gamer is 2D sprites that have movements and expressions. The effect is subtle but it makes the characters come to life as opposed to still images. It blends smoothly with the high quality background art and looks very fluid. The voice acting of the three girls is a very good and as expressive as the aforementioned 2D Sprites. It is a treat on the ears. The background  instrumental music is not intrusive and very pleasant to the ear too.http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/609478105736254972/85E40880EFFCA812890402B97B276E81D8CA1E2E/ConclusionMary Poppins said "" A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down""...well you may prefer a spoonful of salt as this may too cute or as an anime fan would call it ""moe"" for you. Despite the games shortness the overall  excellent quality does not make this too overpriced.Despite the 18 warning this is a family friendly game, the strongest being a bikini shot. Finally I  need to mention a very similar game on steam, Go Go Nippon: My first trip to Japan. In short, this is the superior game. So let's end the review with the very catchy theme tune ""MOE to  Yoouu! which perfectly encapsulates this game:Moe to meMoe for you,Too much moeAre we excited or confused?"

I am neither proud nor ashamed of what I have done, but after much reflecting, I feel like I am qualified enough to add some insightful input to those wondering whether they should buy this title. So far I have completed nearly all three storylines (as far as I know), and I am pretty sure that there is only one ending for each path. I may be wrong about this, but the story only has one crucial decision that decides which girl you fall for, and there are no ""bad-endings"".I have not played many Visual Novel games in my time, but my first ""legitimate"" one was Katawa Shoujo (which I enjoyed thoroughly). Katawa Shoujo may have spoiled what I expected from any VN game afterwards, so try to understand things from my point of view.Tokyo School Life is a visual novel game where the protagonist (you) is on a two month trip to Japan as an exchange student from the USA. You have loved and admired Japan since childhood, and it has always been your dream to one day take a trip there. You taught yourself how to speak Japanese from watching anime, and have been talking with an old man you call ""Sensei"" about his time here. When you arrive, you are excited to experience all the great Japanese culture, visit some great landmarks, and most of all meet some cute girls. Early on in the game you have some bad first encounters with who will later be your love interests, and your roommates. You are staying in a dorm at a shrine with three other girls, and no supervising adults, so go at it. What will your life be like here in Japan? Will you get what you came for, or will the reality of Japan crush your weaboo heart?Pros: (I don't have a lot to say about the pros, they are pretty basic points).- The female characters are likeable, and have nice personalities along with being attractive (by art standards). They all have strong characteristics, and I found them to be relatively original (design-wise).- The art is well done, and the animation aspect is a nice touch to the usual static image that I am used to. The character art is fantastic, and the backgrounds are pretty nice.- The voice acting was spot on, and though I don't understand Japanese, I feel like the voices added a lot to the experience and provided a more immersive environment.-  The music is catchy, and even f you don't enjoy it, you can mute it or wait the until the scene changes.- There are some moments where the game teaches you things about Japan, but the information is nothing special.Cons: (I have a lot more to say here, but that's only because the problems are easier to go into than the positives.)- The protagonist (who you play as) is pretty unlikeable, and hard to relate with. He could say some dumb things, and despite his extensive knowledge of Japan, and that he learned to speak Japanese fluently FROM WATCHING ANIME (If this is even possible, he would have to have watched more anime than I can fathom), he was kind of clueless about some pretty basic stuff. This protagonist was supposed to represent you, as you name him, and you are unable to see what he looks like to allow yourself to picture him being you. This is fine and dandy, but not in the way they presented him. I felt like I was being misrepresented, and would have probably enjoyed it much more if the protagonist was his own seperate person, instead of trying to be me.- I felt like the content was lacking in a way, and not necessarily in volume or play time. The story seemed rushed, and it could have definitely flowed better into a more coherent story line (my opinion, not fact). A lot of the game was often times charming, but it could also prove to be redundant, and some moments felt like filler material that wasn't really adding anything to the experience.- Building off of my last point, I think the story paths ended abruptly, and were pretty unsatisfying, causing me to want more, or at least better closure. The credits hit you like a brick wall, and I never expected them to pop up when they did. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say anything more about this.- There are only really four characters in this game, though some background characters show up as just lines of text, you never see anyone besides the three main girls or the people who were a part of the background image. I feel like a little more character variety would have been a huge positive to the game, but I can see from a development standpoint why this could be difficult.- As I said before, I am pretty sure the outcome of the story depends solely on one decision, but I have not tried every option to test this theory. The girl that you get based on that decision is pretty obvious, since each of the options has a picture of the girl. Also, though this isn't EXACTLY a con, the decision making is extremely easy. It is not hard to pick the best thing to say if you actually know what's going on, and each choice is accompanied by a sound (or lack thereof). The best option has the loudest sound, and the worst one will have no sound at all, so you are basically told whether you made the right choice or not right after making it.All in all, this isn't any complex, thought-provoking read; but it is charming and enjoyable. If you're an expert visual novelist with high-standards, this probably isn't for you, but if you want to waste a good 14 hours pretending to talk with cute anime babes, that's a different story."

,Recommended,320760,14440144,"Posted: 12 February, 2015",all,Rawkie ♪,"Pretty solid VN so far. E-mote does indeed make it look really smooth. There's a lot of body movement for VN characters (think hands, arms, boobs) and facial expressions as well. It's very lively and aims to be funny. The dialogue may seem a little bit childish at times, though. This game is comparable to Go! Go! Nippon! in a way that they both tell you some informational/interesting stuff about Japan's culture or history inbetween character interaction, but it doesn't go as deep. For example, it doesn't tell you how to get to certain places, how much certain things costs, where to get a Suica card, etc. The main focus are the three girls.What's nice, though, is that it has multiple text options as it says in the description. If you're learning Japanese, this is extremely useful. What's even better is that the 3 main girls are fully voiced, so you can hear them talk Japanese and at the same time have the text in the chat menu display in English or Romaji and the additional text (in the top left corner of the screen) display in Japanese or hiragana (or any other combination of the 4).However, if you're not learning Japanese, or you're already extremely good at speaking/reading it, the price might seem a little too high. Overall, as somebody who recently started learning Japanese, I do recommend this game and I'm very sure I can learn quite a few things from it."
,Recommended,320760,16915317,"Posted: 6 July, 2015",all,Funnerific,"Go Go Nippon: Take 2, and no half-assing it this time. That's the feeling I got from this game.Among the practically nonexistent Japanese-made West-oriented kind of visual novels, this one is unmatched. But even if you know enough about Japan or simply don't care, you may find it interesting as it has enough to offer to stand on its own feet as a proper visual novel.But first let me talk about one of the key features of Tokyo School Life, that being the Japanese learning component. It is several steps ahead of Go Go Nippon which simply featured a second text box in a really tiny font where you'd ruin your eyes reading kanji. There was no furigana either. Now you can choose to set the main and auxiliary text boxes (the latter appears in a corner of the screen, can be disabled) to display the language you want, be it English, straight-up Japanese or Japanese written in all hiragana/romaji (don't do this, seriously). My only complaint here is that furigana is always enabled, it's actually pretty distracting as your eyes tend to wander towards what they can easily read instead of the complex characters. From a learning perspective, it's like trying to revise something with the cheat sheet in front of you.Tokyo School Life features 30 CGs (nothing unusual), 9 tracks (pretty good), voice acting and the e-mote system. Compared to Nekopara, the sprites in this game are a lot more animated. Watching Aoi bounce around always gave me a nice, warm feeling. :) I'm bothered by the fact that the girls never call you by your name in voice even if you don't change it from default, it's actually pretty rude in Japanese and even the original text handles it differently. Cutting corners I guess, and since most people on Steam wouldn't know about this subtlety I can't really blame the developers too much.You've got the protagonist, who is a big fan of Japan and knows surprisingly little about it despite being fluent enough to understand all the kanji words they throw at him in writing, various sayings and expressions and even some archaic dialects. The guy still writes in all-hiragana (only applies to a few chatroom scenes) and doesn't know the words itadakimasu and gochisousama, which come right after ""baka"" and ""temee"" among the words you'll automatically learn from anime.As to be expected, the heroines fall within some of the standard archetypes. You've got a yamato nadeshiko (the image of an ideal Japanese woman), a twin-tailed tsundere and the adorable little animal type (not biased, I swear).Without spoiling the story, the common route mostly consists of standard-fare comedy and exploring Japan, the choices you make will determine whose routes will be available at the end, which can mean multiple options so feel free to be nice to all of the girls, as long as you secure the required 4 points with the one you're most interested in (some choices give you 2 points instead of 1). Once you're in someone's route, expect things to get serious after a while. At times I felt that there was untapped potential left, maybe the routes were short and featured various degrees of cliché, but on the whole I found it to be pretty satisfying.TL;DRPros:- solid Japanese learning features, way ahead of Go Go Nippon;- decent OST;- professional voice acting;- e-mote system above Nekopara's level;- serious plot.Cons:- furigana always enabled in Japanese text;- protagonist's name always replaced with pronouns in voice;- some of the character routes could be longer or deeper."

,Not Recommended,320760,14662473,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,Jennifer Darknight,"I...where do I even start?I guess I should begin by saying that I knew what I was getting into when I bought this: It's a pandering moefest aimed at weaboos, But, considering that I'm a fan of Visual Novels, and have been playing them in Japanese and English for years, I figured I'd give it a chance.This is...honestly, even for a game of this type, this is very underwhelming.To save you from a long-winded speech, I'll give it to you in bullet points:- Routes are short, taking a minimum of an hour to around two hours. The stories don't really resolve well, instead ending abruptly with endings that feel more tacked-on than achieved through any form of progression. Stories end when the characters either realize they love each other, or some singular event happens. The ending is just a quick, few-minute epilogue that wraps everything up in a little bow. Aoi's story is the strongest, while Karin's feels unfinished and Sakura's feels more like an after-school special with a dollop of copout ending than a VN route.- Music is okay at first, but then starts to grate on your nerves after hearing the same bland tracks over and over. If you want music that will actually move you, this isn't the game for that; you'd best play Katawa Shoujo or any Key game.- Characters are stock. They react to your character's fumblings unrealistically and are borderline saints in how they tolerate his cultural faux pas. The protagonist is the only legitimate character (Aoi is in second place), and everyone else (again, other than Aoi) feel like stock puppets through which he can grow, rather than characters with their own dreams and desires. There is real effort in making them shine here, but quirks don't really make a character, and it falls flat.- There are no branching paths, no bad ends, no extra endings. You pick choices to determine whether you can pick the girl's route...and then that's it. This would be fine if the routes were longer and more involved, but seeing as they're not...yeah, it feels a little hollow.- The character designs are boring, for the most part.- This game is far too expensive for what you're getting. Fifteen dollars for maybe nine hours of gameplay? (Most of my hours were spent idle since I walked away from the keyboard several times while playing it) You're better off getting Planetarian or HuniePop to get the most out of your money.I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. But in just about every way, this game is a mediocre dud that sits in your mind for a few hours, but does little more than that. This is hardly worth the price of admission, and a trip that you'd probably best skip."

,Recommended,320760,16944073,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Falanukki,"This game is basically a story about a weeaboo, who travels to Japan to meet cute girls. Basically what Steam lets you think, is that the game itself would have a lot of content not appropriate for kids - for it asks your age everytime you want to check the game's info page. The truth is; there is nothing more graphic than what somebody would see on a public beach.The game is cute though, the animations and voice acting are pretty good; and you bond with the girls quickly. They're pretty varied and give you that ""family""-feeling, which is a really important theme throughout the whole game. You get to choose which girl you go after, and it's not really possible to mess up either, because you can always go back in dialogue. So, it's pretty relaxed to play. (I had to go back a couple of times too. It's not easy to tell which answer pleases which girl, not at least in the beginning of the game).Anyhow, long story short:+ Graphics, character movements/facial expressions and voice acting are nice+ The girls' personalities are different from each other+ You get to spend quite a lot of time with the girl you prefer, if you choose correctly+ Not too much anime clichés. The theme song is catchy too.- It's a short visual novel. It took about 6 hours for me - and I read very slowly.- The main character is a giant loser, and a bit too unrealistic for my taste.- You don't really get to be in a relationship with the girls, it's just having fun and spending cute moments together."

Almost immediately, I struggled to see myself as him. It's not that he's a bad guy, but I'm nothing like him, either.2) You don't get enough opportunities to make choices. The girls routinely ask your character questions, but only rarely are you, the player, allowed to make a decision on what is said in response.3) There are no animations for characters outside the three female leads - everyone else is just words on a screen.4) The music is really pedestrian.The game is only $7.50 right now, so, yes, I can comfortably say that, for that price, people should buy it. But this was hardly some earth-shattering experience for me.*Edit*Finished it up a couple of nights ago - my final thoughts (SPOILERS):Ultimately, while TSL is well put together, the game is marred by one over-arching problem that it simply cannot overcome, and that is that two of the three girls have *significant* personality flaws that would be a red flag for any sane suitor. Sakura is a liar - she lies several times throughout the plot, but her initial, signficant exchange with the player is a needless, terrible deception motivated by nothing more than avarice. I could never get past the fact that she made up a story about a sickly sister just to call dibs on a comic book - that isn't just mean, it's downright sociopathic.Karin, on the other hand, never shakes the initial tough-girl persona, even with the introduction of a shallow cuteness obsession that comes to dominate her later plot. Moreover, she's a narcissist of the first order, and her arc is dragged down by a sequence of me-first events that leaves you convinced that the only person who would ever tolerate her company would be doing so out of a desire to squeeze her largest-in-the-group chest.Speaking of that, I have to mention one final downfall, and that is the near total lack of fanservice. I'm not sure why Steam asks for a birthday to access TSL, because, outside of a few enormously tame bathing suit cameos, we hardly ever see more than a passing flash of skin. In fact, one larger, later part of Aoi's story has her wearing a mika shaman costume, which, while adorable, is about the antithesis of sexy."

Background sounds.  Female voice only.  The voice acting fits the characters.TranslationThe English that I've seen so far is quite good.  This quality may change later but for now I'll give it a pass.GameplayThis game has some interesting features not found in run-of-the-mill visual novels.  As mentioned before, the animated sprites are one of them.  And not just blinking and lip moving, but entire expressive motions...like head tilting, nodding, shaking, characters bouncing energetically, eyes sparkling, characters swaying sleepily...I also like the smartphone conversations that appear occasionally.  It's fun watching the text scroll up as each girl adds their input to the conversation.  It's almost like a real chat in progress.Misc NotesThe history has a neat feature where you can replay a previous moment in time if you click on that panel.  It's a great way to see an animation again.ConclusionFrom what I've seen so far, it's a fun visual novel to read.  Until I finish the game, I can't calculate the value to content though.

Probably a pro if you don't know these things, but it was irritating to me because I am a level 999 Weeb.Basically if you like second-hand embarrassment and want to watch an anime about a very cringey Western otaku kid choose one of three stereotypical waifus/stories by clicking your mouse button repeatedly, this is for you.If you want an engaging dating sim game where you actually have a measure of control over the story, look elsewhere."

There are 3 routes in game + 1 bad ending and 1 special ending (after completing 3 good endings). The heroines are voiced and animated (looks like most of the newer visual novels are animated nowadays). You can name your character (which means you can play as yourself). Story is fairly interesting, though I would want to know what would be happening after the game finishes (though there are some scenes that shows it briefly). There is also option of dual language showing (which also gives you choice between proper japanese, hiragana and katakana, and romanji).  To complete the game you need about 7 - 12 hours. This game might be good way to learn Japanese (thanks to dual lingua option) and Japanese culture. If you like visual novels you might also like the story.To sum up:Pluses:Good artConsists animationsWell made charactersOption to name your characterDual language optionMinuses:Lack of significant side characters (I like when game is more natural and has some side characters to interact with)Might not appeal to asians (as the main character is typical western guy)Sounds and voice acting: 8/10Music: 7/10Art: 9/10Story: 8/10Overall: 8/10"

But I figured I'd play it through to see if it got better. Before you select a designated 'route', the game isn't anything good. At least, not to me. I found the moving/talking sprites to be a bit much and a tad odd, and your character is an oblivious weeaboo not likable one bit. And the three characters you interact with are the only ones you ever meet in the game, which in a way is good as there are no surprises, but if you're not fond of them then tought luck.This is all in the first act though. The game poses a very neat system for selecting your route; each character whose route you can take represents a location you can visit in your school trip; Okinawa, Osaka or Kyoto. The choices you make in the first act determine which of them you are able to take, and then you can choose which you'd like to play. This is good as you're not forced to take a route you don't want to take. Not that getting the right route is difficult; this isn't a very 'interactive' VN (the route I played didn't have a single choice) so the choices are rather easy.After I chose my route and the 'real' game began, it vastly improved. The story wasn't that different, but it seemed to be less... overly happy/silly, which is good. I hadn't expected to really enjoy it, but by the end I was invested in the story and it worked well, and it did a marvelous job at tricking me with a false ending.One of the game's weakest aspects is the soundtrack. It's not overly 'bad', rather than underwhelming. The main theme is really poorly-done, and it seems the game had so little tracks to work with it even repeats the main theme. It's to the extent that the game's best moments take place in the absence of music; rather than having it emphasize the current events in the story, which is a shame.One playthrough, of which there are three, took me about 4 hours. A decent length, but regardless felt a bit on the short side. I didn't really mind since the game was strong and never overstayed its welcome, but if you're looking for a really long and deep story, don't come here. What's here is a short yet sweet visual novel. Although not really educational or informative for anybody looking to travel to Japan, it's still enjoyable and a good play.Of course, visuals novles are not everybody's cup of tea, and I'm not just talking about the 18+ ero ones either, but as a whole, some people like them and others don't. If you're considering getting into the genre, this would be a decent start if you can get past the inital parts of the game. If it's a bit too 'cute' for you (as it almost was for me) then there are lots of other great VNs out there to try as well, so don't let this one form your opinion too much on the genre. Despite some missed opportunities, it was still an enjoyable experience and one I would recommend."

( I have played it offline so don't be deceived by how little time I have in it )I'll try to be as honest as possible without being biased ( I do like anime and some of the visual novels ).So what game has to offer ?- 3 Cute anime girls ( with new E-motion system, it makes the game feel like you are watching animation! It's really cool )- Japanese translations ( Hiragana, Romanji, Katakana and Kanji! ) So if you are learning Japanese then this game is a nice asset to your study materials!- 3 possible outcomes ( I think there might be 4th bad ending as well but I haven't checked it )- Fully voiced,- Couple of hours of reading ( to finish it the first time, every time you play it however it gets shorter as the player tend to skip stuff... )NOW for the bad stuff.- UTTERLY CRAP backgrounds ( especially the one on festival with food stalls, hired children to do the work?! ) I can't believe that they have released the game KNOWING the quality of the backgrounds. Add to that the fact that they had around 4 background artists! ( I have seen the credits ).- Girls look cool BUT some CG artwork is a bit meh... and not animated :( ( except for eyes )- Story is CANDY COATED Gaijin ""dream"" of Japan ( in other words, don't expect realism or interesting story here... )- Little choices that impacts the player ( he has a certain mindset and you have no way to express your ""views""... think of Mass Effect choices yeah... you CAN'T be a renegade here :'[ )Overall enjoyable game but sometimes feel a bit ""fake"" / ""phony"". Don't expect too much and just enjoy everyday's life of those 3 girls ( because there is no other characters, well there are but they have no avatars just text ).I can't recommend this to people who are new to Visual Novels ( they will get the wrong impression ). Better to start with Clannad or even here on steam we have ""If my heart had wings"", if you are a newbie to VN.If you are a seasoned VN and manga reader you can probably skip this. The only gimmick of this game is the Japanese translations and new ""E-motion"" system that brings the characters to life ( although sometimes a bit ""phony"" and awkward ).If you really want to buy it....eh... then wait for sale.Thx for reading."

In my opinion, by adding name input they significantly increased the bond between characters and player.Usually in Vns, the player plays as a random guy w a random name. HOWEVER, by adding name input, it would make the player feel a little more into the game. Honestly, when I herd the characters (especially sakura) say my name in the dialouge, I just felt overjoyed.  This may seem like a small thing to developers, but for the player, this adds to the attachment of the player and the characters.+ Animatd Characters+ beautiful Scenary- In close ups, the edges of the characters look a little pixelated, but thats not a major issue.In all, I extremly reccomend you buy this game.

The VN itself's unique characters bring out personality with how they are portrayed and that helped set the tone. The facts relevant here are truly well mentioned to also introduce people into the culture. In the means of you progressing, each girl's story goes with yours and each end has their own appeal. Karin was cool and cute pop idol. Sakura was quiet, calm, and reserved manga artist. Aoi is a cheerful, strong, and kind, dojo disciple. You even get to use your own name in here and the facts stated worked well. The Bg sound more ""in tune"" with the bg. The story was well indepth and flowed. I do believe many will enjoy this."

,Not Recommended,320760,15820595,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,changtau2005,"++ Dual-language option. More VNs need to have this.+ Animated sprites (here, it's E-mote) used to great effect. This is recent tech and not many VNs have this.  Most VNs for PC which do use it (including this one) tend not to be very good though, hence the opinion amongst some VN review circles to categorize it as somewhat gimmicky.- - - There is much better reading material out there.I bought this for the dual language feature. Nekopara [Neko Works 2014] has it as well. These are a godsend for learning the language, as usually I have to run two clients (one Japanese, one English) otherwise, sometimes on separate virtual machines or computers if the two clients cannot run simultaneously. This saves me a lot of time syncing the two windows or looking up my dictionaries for completely untranslated titles.That said however, having just finished Symphonic Rain [Kogado 2004] and Hoshizora no Memoria [Favorite 2009] before that, I couldn't bring myself to stomach the content in Tokyo School Life beyond the first 10-15 minutes. The difference in quality of writing, and how much respect the writers treat the characters / protagonist with, is simply staggering. At least you know what you're getting into for Nekopara, and it is the better VN compared to this one.I've seen my share of hetare protagonists but this guy - who the game expects you to name after yourself - is a bumbling doofus. He claims he's a Japanophile, and was elated to be selected for a two-month student exchange program. Then how about studying up cultural practices and social no-nos before heading there, instead of causing a lady to trigger her personal alarm before even reaching the school? She may be the ticked-off tsundere, but the protagonist was eyeballing her up and down like the creep that he is, thinking about how good looking she is instead of helping her up and apologizing like a decent person would, after having bumped her flat on the ground and having his hand end up in an unfortunate place. Chikan, sekuhara yarou indeed. Also cliched as heck.The other two cover characters are introduced in scenarios that are equally cringe-worthy - causing her to spill her tea all over herself, touching her hand when reaching for the same book... The characters are objectified and put into these kinds of situations just for the heck of it. Now, I am acutely aware that this stuff happens in other games and anime, but the distinct lack of cultural sensitivity here, the choice of words, how eager the game wants to get to these scenes, and how the protagonist irresponsibly bungles these situations due to his social ineptitude and especially, his internal monologue in that goes on in that baka head of his, leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. The developer [M2] is the only one that I've seen actually hosting English content from a Japanese domain name. I didn't know that beforehand as I thought this VN was hand-selected by a localization company. Both that and the story setting makes their target demographic obvious, but I also didn't expect this degree of disconnect.Based on the number of favorable reviews, if you like this game anyway, good for you I guess, but I will be extremely wary of such titles from now on. If you only buy games on Steam, if you haven't read Grisaia no Kajitsu [Frontwing 2011] already, wait until the Kickstarted localization comes out officially - that's far, far more representative of a quality VN. Or give eden* [Minori 2009] a go if you don't mind a different pacing and setting. Or look beyond Steam for the best material in this genre, which most any VN on Steam (at time of writing) can't even hold a candle to."

You play as a guy that goes to Japan for 2 months through a student exchange program. When you arrive you live with 3 girls all with very different personalities. Through the VN you get to learn all of their stories and go around Japan with them. It's very cute, well paced and WONDERFULLY animated. It's very similar to Nekopara. It's not static images, it's animated models with voice acting. It looks amazing! I can't reccommend this one enough. It's not pervy nor is it very childish. It's a nice slice of life story. I loved it far more than any 23 year old male should have. I should also note that one route took 3 hours, If I had to guess all 3 would take around 5 (6 if you're a slow reader).Other things to note:-Not Kinetic. About 7 or 8 choices that will shape which path you go down during the game-May die from the cuteness that is Karin-Chan.-Probably not the best for those above the age of 25-30.

So far I have only played through one of the girls stories completly and that took me around 8 hours. Not too bad for the price alone, and I do look forward to the other 2 girls stories, though to be honest I didnt really find any of the girls likeable enough to motivate me to go through theirs. I only finished the one girls story because I had to choose one.Which brings me to the biggest issues with this game. Path branching. There are a fair number of times that you are given multiple choices on what you want to say, but as far as I could tell, nothing changes, and there is only one point when if matters what you pick, and its so obvious that it takes away the fun. It literally says, choose one of the three girls...So why even give us choices before that point?On top of that, some of the conflicts the protaganist finds himself in are so mild, but played off to being incredibly serious that it can be cringe worthy at times. (Particularly when talking about being cute, or being cool)This wouldnt bother me, if that was just a small issue in a deep story, or even if they made them react a little more realistically, its just that the issues feel so... FORCED... like the writers couldnt think of any real problems so just gave the story something random to go off of.Putting aside the negatives though, becasue they are easier to point out.What you have here is a solid, likeable story, worth the price. The art is really nice, and there is some interesting factoids about japan to learn. You also have the option of having the entire story in japanese with english subtitles, almost like a japanese learning guide, which in some ways suits the novel more.It really felt like they were going for more teaching japanese and japan facts, than giving a fully fleshed out and memorable story."

I must say it is darn impressive.Have you ever wonder what it is feel like to be a anime character or wish you want to be an anime guy surrounded by gorgeous anime girls. Well, this is as close as you can get.The story is well written. It is so well written that it put most triple A developer to shame, It makes some of the triple A writers looks like they are bad students trying to save their failing grade with last minute work hoping it would fool the teachers to giving them a passing grade.It starts off with the usual anime gimmick such as running into girls and feel their breast, walking into the bathroom while they are getting ready for bath (no nudity or sex in this game/ sorry guys) and spilling drink onto girls. After that, one of the main characters go angry. Just the usual anime gimmicks but tons and tons of hilarity like how the anime characters should react.The Emote - engine really shines in this interactive media and this is one of very few subtle but KEY ELEMENTS in this type of interactive media. You can read such slight gesture such as nodding off early in the morning or when making emotional connection, the slight gesture, body language and movement really makes a world of difference between a good game and absolute stinker.

That was the biggest happiness I have ever felt in my life...Character impressions are amazing. This game is one of the gems that is very rare in the visual novels... especially today's visual novels are mostly based on... whatever.Animations, sounds of the characters and backgrounds were a masterpiece. They definitely support the atmosphere. But do you know what makes the biggest support for the atmosphere?Musics.I loved them. They are really distinct. They made me feel a lot. I thank a lot for the composers of them.I totally recommend this game if you want to swim in a sea of feelings.

For example, かわいい will appear as カワイイ. From what my sensei taught us, katakana is only used for words that were not native Japanese terms (like chocolate or part-time job), and I'm pretty sure かわいい is a Japanese word.

Kinda cool if you want to learn some Japanese from the voicing + romaji subs, but as for heroine (heroin?) choices really you only get a choice between the quiet nice girl with a penchant for lying her asz off, the loli girl who looks like she might be 6 and has that maternal side and the big titted tsundere idol girl (all animu tropes). Honestly, I found myself the whole just wanting to get it over with and get with the big titted chick, but I had to wade through so much mundane crap to get there. The animations are quite well done but the backgrounds look like a lazy filter and paint job was thrown over what might've been actual photographs. Overall I could barely stay awake an hour in wishing I could be shooting up baddies or leveling a badass character in a fantasy RPG."

Very nice 3D graphics and animation on the girls that I wish more visual novel games used. I only played Sakura and Karin's routes, so I'm not sure how Aoi's routes go but I feel that the character development was decent until the very end of the routes. I felt like the romance and closures were rushed and felt weird and incomplete. Again, I don't know how Aoi's route goes, it could've been better for all I know.Would I recommend this game? Yes... somewhat. If you're dipping your toes into the world of VN's, I think this is solid entry-level stuff. If you enjoy games like this, then you should move on to greater VNs such as ""If My Heart Had Wings"" (great story, character development, and great eroge content if you install the restoration patch)."

On the down-side, it's full of way too much blah-blah, especially on 'your' side and I think I got to make one dialogue choice during that whole time. My clicker finger is tired, 'I' keep reacting in ways that I personally wouldn't which can be a bit jarring and frankly I think the whole thing would work better as an anime than a visual novel.That said, I think this is a must-have purchase if you're trying to learn Japanese and want to practice your reading and listening skills.

The three characters are really memorable; Karin with her cocky exterior and a love for food and all things cute, Sakura who is a timid manga lover, and Aoi, a caring and thoughtful karate enthusiast. I loved the art style that was present in this, with a static background and the characters being alive and actually moving, whereas with a traditional visual novel, the backgrounds and characters are static. A lot of times I found myself laughing or cringing at characters, or even becoming concerned about characters. If you have the $15 to dish out on this visual novel, I highly suggest it.

This VN is perfect!Good Points:- I've actually learnt so much about Japan just from the first few scenes!- Character progression is pretty solid.- At the end of every day you get to see a tablet with a chat room the girls are in on it, this allows you to see how they feel about you after each event.- The implementation on the E-mote system is genius! Now i can see the characters come alive on the screen, rather than the bland motionless pictures seen in most VN's.- Story never seems to get boring, always filled with twists and turns.Bad Points:- This is the companies only game, but its not the only one released with the e-mote system.

There are three amazing endings, one for each character. The ending after completing all three was extraordinary.

Its simplicity is what I think makes it a pretty good VN.You play as an exchange student, get close to 3 bishoujos and eventually start falling in love with one of them. Simple romance follows with some sort of drama going on (though I've only played Sakura's route at this point so not sure on the others). Just a typical high school romance plot you'd see in a lot of anime and manga.No major mindf**ks from what I've seen so far.E-mote system was a pretty nice touch imo.

Furthermore, players are able to toggle the written language (and even the additional subtitles) between English, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji for practicing reading Japanese.  The visuals and BGM are above average.  With the inclusion of animation with the visuals, it gives a new degree of immersion that truly absorbs the audience.

The graphics are nice, so is the soundtrack, and you really start to like your character, beside the fact he knows little to nothing about culture, only history from his beloved Manga, Samurai Maiden.One of my favorite things in this game is the lines. Not only are they recorded, so you feel like you are talkingto the girls, but also are they translated into either Romanji, Kana, or none if you so prefer. Oh and the characters are animated, thats a huge plus to, adding to the ""realism""Is it worth the money? I would say yes. The story is a tad too short for my liking, but to newcomers in the genre of Visual Novels, this will be a great and easy start. Three routes, three different girls, each with a few manageable quirks, nice and apealing visuals, and all in all, an easy pill to swallow. And not to mention its funny twists, you might have not expected, and the necesarry half nude elements, we all know and love from anime and manga, and especially Visual Novels.Really nice and easy, with very few reasons to get upset in the storyline.That is, if you are not like me, who rages at the outmost obvious trivia about japanese culture.SPOILER: Here are a few examples you might come across, which the character you play as HAS NO IDEA WHAT ISDried seaweed aka Nori used in the creation of Sushi, among other items of food, such as Onigiri or rice cakesItadakimasu aka a phrase used to express graditude towards the cook, before a mealYou will encounter more, but I am too lazy to write more (I am a couch potatoe)Favorite route: SakuraAlso I play these sort of games offline, hence my low play time in this Visual Novel"

You become invested in the characters regardless if you like them or not, and by the end you WILL like them all; and as sad as it seems to say it, by the end it's almost as if you know them personally, as if you're friends with them or in the context of this game ""family"".STORYThe protangonist (you, yes YOU!) have moved to Japan for 2 whole months to study abroad, and quickly meet 3 girls at different times during the first day, in quite the... well... unpleasant manner.

A visual novel is not be rushed through it more about the experience. I can understand if it is short if you rush through it but that not the point here, you want to make it feel like real life  when done this way.  This  made a bigger impression on me and made the game last longer. Basicly a chapter a day, You wont regret it.Your basicly over obsessed oktu who transfers to japan not making good impression at first but the girls grow to like you.  You have Karin, Aoi, and Sakura each have there own differnces. Plus you can learn some japanese as well, but sadly I have not tried that yet.It sort like your the anime charater for a change and this your perspective of what happened to you.Mine is a cross between Skaura or Aoi.it very clean visual novel with some mild foul lang."

Finding the one true love in life and overcoming adversity to keep it. They found love and were able to hold on to it with all their hearts. It is more told as a story than a game but o would read it again and again. My true one passed some 24 years ago and shortly after passing they found a cure for what she had but abit to late for us. I find a kinship with the male caracter this this hits home just fine for me. Maybe some day we will be together again.

The characters themselves are interesting enough, but lack truly deep characterization. However it is visually pleasing and one of the best out of the small selection of dating sims on steam. Overpriced."

However, there aren't many choices you can make. So if you are more into just wanted to sit back and interactively click though a good story. Here you go."

Characters having motions, cute girls, and, well, generally enjoyable storyline, it's all cool. Though I have only one complain, which is; this being too short. I don't regret buying it, and I'm not going into detail not to spoil it for enthusiasts, so that's all I'm going to say:Too short."

It's legit what the name suggests, you play as a transfer student coming to Tokyo for two months. It's an intensely emotional game guided by your choices.

It's very well composed, and it doesn't get boring after looping over and over. The fact that the main character is forced into the ""Otaku weaboo NEET trash"" category is extremely painful at times, and can make going on through this game very difficult. I still recommend it, while the story is pretty much skin deep, the art direction is beautiful, and the music is incredible.=================EDIT:I changed my mind, I hate this game. At some parts, it really feels like they didn't care about making this game at all. The background art in times isn't even art; it's just a picture they grabbed off Google Images that they ran through a filter in photoshop. Garbage."
