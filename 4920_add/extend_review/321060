,Not Recommended,321060,12039263,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,Firebunny,"I highly believe in giving things a fair chance before I throw my chips into a bowl, so, after having actually played it, I can say that this game is rather callous to Transgendered issues, at least over the course of the first two routes (if there is places it does this better, please let me know)You can generally tell what is going to happen long before it does. Since each character tells you precisely what they include (How many endings, what types of strangeness they will encounter) any real surprise is removed before it can sink in. You're left scrolling through lives that you can figure out precisely where they may be going (accurately) long before they get there. After about an hour, you start reading the text simply to confirm you were invariably right.The game is insensitive, and honestly I'm a bit hurt that someone could even make something like this. The artists have deleted several threads filled with honest criticism of the title, but they are also at the same time incredibly helpful both to me and others. They are just trying to stand by the game they made.I find myself genuinely conflicted, because distasteful art is still art. Even if I think what they show here is 'bad', it's designed with someone else in mind, and I wonder if that person really deserves for me to demonize their fun. In any case, I do not personally recommend this game to others. If this is your sort of thing, you could do well to wait for a good sale in any case."

I'm somewhat ashamed that I bought this game. This does coincide with my interests, and I felt like supporting an indie dev. It also got endorsements from a few webcomics I read, which also lead me to take an interest in it. If it were five or ten dollars, I would feel less ashamed, since I wouldn't feel quite so ripped off. In a world where Chroma Squad is 15 bucks, this game is a hard sell. I am not a troll and I am not a hater; in fact, I am somebody who is probably the EXACT TARGET AUDIENCE of this game.Now, I'll admit that I haven't played all of the paths. I stayed away from the anthro-heavy arcs because that isn't an interest of mine. I played through Dina, Yael, Dan, Nadine, and dabbled with a couple of the others.Positives-* Um... er... Dan's cute. I feel sorry for Yael. I could feel something for THOSE two characters.* I'm REASONABLY sure I don't have cancer afterwards.Okay, now that we've gotten the nice things to say out of the way, let's get to the meat of this. This is not a good game. This is not a good story. This is not good porn. It tries to be all three of these things and largely fails.First, let's look at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme as a game. Now, I'm not going to get into the ""are visual novels games"" argument. I'll accept here that a visual novel qualifies as a game because it's at least somewhat interactive (you make choices and there are branching paths). The number of choices are fairly limited and a couple (I think specifically of Yael choosing to slack off or not before the accident) are pointless and have no impact. I love alternate universe stuff and thinking about what might have been, but none of these endings were worth the effort to make save states to see how things play out. The differences are either insignificant or horrifying. This is more of a game than, say, Sakura Spirits (watch the Game Grumps playthrough of that, it's hilarious), but I didn't feel engaged. This is because of...The story. Oh Lord, the story. This game actually has a surprisingly in depth story, as the playable characters weave in and out of each others' paths. And that story, for me, crashes and burns because of the character Dina. (It would be on life support if she wasn't the horror that she is, but she kills it). Dina is selfish. She wanted to be a woman with enormous jugs, so she decided to make a serum to make that happen. Fair enough. The accident at the start of the game that forcibly transgendered everyone was unintentional. Fair enough. Dina's actions afterwards are horrible, however. She promises to help work on a cure. She instead works on something to make her more buxom. She tests that buxomizing formula on a character who wants nothing more than to turn back to normal on the theory that ""big boobs are awesome, and Yael's a jerk anyway, so forcibly altering his body further is AOK."" She enjoys messing with people, has no responsibility, no EMPATHY for the people whose lives she ruined and is never punished for any of this. She doesn't even lose her job and in fact becomes stinking rich. The game clearly wants me to think that she's a funny character. She is not. I hate her and everything she stands for. The rest of the cast are more or less ""insert body type fetish here."" Short and Busty? Dan. Sorta regular looking brunette? Yael. And so on and so on.I mentioned earlier that the branching paths often ended up being horrifying. The game does not regard them as horrifying. The game regards them as funny or sexy. However, paths where a character loses everything they have and is forced to transform into a half human creature and be objectified all day to make a living is horrifying to me. Paths where a character makes it QUITE clear that they have no interest in making already large boobs larger and is then forced into it by someone who claims to love them is horrifying to me. Sure, the characters accept this, but they do not feel like human characters. Everyone is EXTREMELY blase about everything that happens to them. The characters I actually sorta liked were Yael and Dan, and that's because I thought that their reactions to the whole thing (being miserable, at least to start) made SENSE. The game also has numerous romantic pairings. These relationships are rapid and forced but we're supposed to take them as being extremely romantic because... shut up, that's why! Clearly these characters who have been women for a week are able to make lifelong romantic decisions with people they've often JUST met! Because that's healthy! If I were transgender, I'd be insulted by how seamless and easy this game makes the whole thing seem.Now, you'd be justified in saying to me, ""You fool, you're obsessing over nonsense like gameplay and story when clearly this is just mindless smut based on a transformation fetish! You're just supposed to turn off your brain and be turned on!"" Well, (despite some comments I saw in the Steam forum to the contrary), that is exactly what this is supposed to be, though there's no law saying that your porno needs to have a character as hateful as Dina. Well, the art really gets in the way of that. I'm no artist and I couldn't do better. I fully recognize this. But the character models are often inconsistent from shot to shot. There are sexy ideas utterly ruined by the execution, as I think to myself, ""Is that Yael? I can't be sure... yeah, that's the same jacket, I suppose."" Especially jarring are the stylistic shifts you see in images where it ISN'T the character's ""talking"" body with a different outfit thrown on.The art has been described as amateurish and wannabe anime. I can't disagree with this. If this game was still in alpha and the images were placeholders along the lines of ""pants to be darkened,"" it'd be acceptable. If this were a free beta with the promise of future improvements, it'd be acceptable. I've seen no evidence of any future improvement in the art in the materials I've read. This game costs more than Final Fantasy VII (a primitive looking game with infinitely more style than this one) on Steam. There is no excuse. There are also a lot of head scratching artistic decisions. Characters like Dan and Ben are always feeling themselves up in public in scenes where they really SHOULDN'T be, based on the dialogue, just because the artist didn't draw another placeholder shot. The anthropomorphic characters are horrifying to look at because of how the hair is drawn. The ultrabusty characters are horrifying to look at, eliciting sympathy rather than attraction. Even with perfect line art, these decisions would still make the game hard to look at.In closing, notice how many times I used the word horrifying in this? Yeah, there's a reason for that. It is. I could see someone having a good laugh at the whole thing, but for me, I just come away feeling bad for myself for even giving this a second glance. Also, anyone trying to fool themselves that this isn't a borderline hentai is in denial.TL/DR: Do not buy. I wish I had a physical copy of the game so I could burn it."

I'm not sure what I expected, but it was not this.The art is terrible, it portrays trans people as sexual preditors who are mearly in it for sexual gratification and worming into women's spaces. Nobody in this game understands what consent means, giving people forced gender swaps and breast enhancements then getting angry when they're not greatful when you offer to dress them up and objectify them.What the duck."
,Not Recommended,321060,12064932,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Liquid Mantis,"The most insensitive game ive ever played.Having a sex change doesn't simply come down to the fact you want to have boobs or look sexy, alot of people do it because they don't feel comfortable in their own bodies. Its especially hard to actually read on Zeke's storyline when pretty much every 2-10 minutes, he mentions the fact he was forcibly turned into a girl and infact he has a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing a okay point and everyone is like ""OMIGOD YOUR HOT."". Jeeeze, there is stuff like this all the way through the story and in fact its pretty cringeworthy. Its pretty much gag gift status, right up there with bad rats.I could seriously see this game hurting the feelings of some people, and its not really in anything else but the writing. The writing is definitely the worst part, i absolutely hated all the Gender Bended characters when they interacted with others, literally all they did was talking about being a girl and how sexy they were. Not everyone is going to be like that if you force them at will, in fact i'd imagine they would be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and sue you.  The other storylines are just as cringeworthy (and funny) but Zeke's one is absolutely the most ive ever gotten actually angry at a visual novel that i've had to force myself to finish reading through it so a word of caution.A Few Bug Issues.Occasionally the UI will have you thinking its your protagonist talking but instead its another character. Spelling mistakes galore, too! It makes you think that these guys haven't even heard of a spell checker, its a magical construct that actually makes sure you haven't ♥♥♥♥ed up grammatically!Ultimately what the hell else can you expect from Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme. Hell, i accepted it because i figured it would be a bit of a laugh to read and it is so, i guess this game has that.However, if your in it for the narrative side there are many alternatives. Stuff like Katawa Shoujo and Analogue : A Hate Story tell the story in a much more interesting way. In the end this game will always be ridiculous while with Katawa Shoujo and Hate Story in some parts its some top class writing.I'd like to take the time to tell you that Katawa Shoujo is Free, and Hate Story is much much less costly.edit: fixed a few typos."
76561198102771498,Not Recommended,321060,20609442,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,Sonic and Hooters Forces,"So lets start this review with the question of WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GAME??? Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme (Is that the only ♥♥♥♥ing name for this game they could come up with? It sounds like they mashed together the names of a fetish porn and a arcade machine.) is a visual novel with some very light choices that dont pop up often. (Date this bland character or this other bland character) The VN it self claims to be ""A romantic comedy where a bunch of people become female"" Right off the bat that sounds pretty stupid, but it could have worked if you got someone like ernest hemmingway or quinten tarintino to write it. Lets jump right in to the review and see how ♥♥♥♥ed this whole thing really is.VISUALS/AUDIOPeople often call this game deviantart quality, this is an insult to the ms paint  fettish artist on deviantart. Honestly a painting elephant could make better visuals for this game.  The whole thing just looks strange, and it makes it worse comparing its self to anime and much better visuals of other cheaper visual novels on steam. Have you played SC2VN? Its visual style is very clean and colorful, and despite being koreanime, its a lot closer to the style then this drek.While I could tolerate the bad music in most other steam VNs, I muted the game the minute I heard whatever the hell the music was. I really don't know how to classify the genre of this crap, Somesort of girly pop with no lyrics? Stock free music from hell?STORYThis is the part that gets really bad guys, this is where the whole thing falls into the abyss. Firstly I would like to say if you are getting your idea of transgendered people from this game, go to this linkhttp://w.itch.io/dys4iabuy and play dys4ia, a game that perfectly sums up what it feels like to be transgendered. If you dont want to shell out 5 bucks you could get a gay freind or something.This game's story and writting can all be summed up by the campain of one character, the most evil and despicable ""protagonist"" I have ever seen in a video game, Dina, the main character. Dina is a selfish juvenile monster. Lets look at dina's list of achievments. The whole plot started because Derek, thought he was transgendered (even though the people who made this game only think with their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and have no idea what transgendered people are like). Derek was actualy just obsessed with getting big boobs (so many dialoge boxes were wasted with derek obsessing over boobs). Derek then uses some really inacurate science to make himself into a female. Dina.He accedently turns all of his researchers into women. The researchers wer not told they were working on gender manipulation and did not want to become female. So instead of looking for a cure to un♥♥♥♥ several people's lives. Our protagonists works on way to make her boobs bigger. She makes a boob expansion serum and gives it to Yael,  the reasercher that hates being female the most. Dina tells Yeal that the big boob serum is a gender reversal serum. Yeal gets even bigger boobs and dina never changes her back, claiming being female is much better than bieng male.Instead of working on a cure Dina: gorges on nachos, gets drunk at a club (You can tell the authors are are little kids because dina acts the same drunk as when she is sober) and works on a way to make herself into a half human half whatever the hell monstorcity. BTW Dina never gets comeupance for the horrible things she has done, she just gets filthy rich.Oh and how can I forget this little detail. Dina goes to the mall and sees the researchers buying clothes. She then hides behind a plant and starts taking pictures of them. When the mall security gaurd Stephane, catches her she arrests dina for sexual assault. In the mall security office Dina claims she will delete all the pictures off her phone, stephane watches as she does this. Stephane goes to the next room to take care of some buisness, and Dina escapes, laughing at how Stephane didn't know that the pictures were backed up in the cloud.  Dina then shows the pictures to her best freind and everyone but the reasercher who was in the pict... WHAT THE HELL!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GAME???!!!  WHO IS RESPONCIBLE FOR THIS???!!!VERDICTIf you want to laugh at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialoge just watch a youtube video. If you want to give a joke gift to your freinds just give them bad rats, its only 99 cents.  If you want male to female transformation porn just go to deviantart. If you want a visual novel get neoparka OR ANYTHING BUT THIS!  I WANT TRANSCENDANT GAMES TO GO ♥♥♥♥ING BANKRUPT! I WANT TO PERSONALY SWALLOW THE SOUL OF EVERY STAFF MEM...*Technical difficulties Plz stand byDont buy this game, not even for a giggle."

Yes, this is a rather weak attempt to do a review in the style of Zero Punctuation, given the fact that Yahtzee hasn't reviewed this game and it doesn't seem like he's interested in doing so.----------------It would be very narrow minded of me to say that all VN created by amateurs or fetishists suck, it's like saying that every shooter game released this day is a rather bland and weak work of copy pasting the same concepts but with different stories and some sort of different graphics (even when this is true 90% if the time). The fact is that there’s bound to be at least one thing to your taste in all different varieties of VN’s, be it about the most cliché story about heroes or mundane slice of life pseudo-comedies or even about sex maniacs that want to have sexual intercourse with every woman in the vicinities by sheer force of wank and luck. But it would be fair to say that there are certain popular trends in VN’s that tend to set off my “this is massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alarm. I would list them but thanks to this particular VN I don’t have to, now I can just point at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme and say: “Pretty much that”.Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not sort of fascist VN connoisseur who cannot function without a sublime argument and jaw dropping CG’s, reading about nonsense, plastering your own dark and deep fantasies and making a plot that doesn’t appeal even the most twisted of fetishists is fine with me, as long as it brings me some degree of fun or enjoyment. I’ll make an except at making a VN with Mary-Sues so unbelievable ♥♥♥♥ed that you’ll start to wonder if those magical crystals you added to your coffee this morning were actually sugar. The game starts rustling my jimmies when it populates itself with a cast full of rapists, sociopaths and incarnations of fetishism and starts neglecting even the most insignificant amount of plot or even art decency because it’s too busy vomiting fetishes at us that makes me want to beat the faces of every character with a mallet.Allow me to expand, the abominable cast of characters lets you summarize what can happen when your entire VN is a walking abomination made of your own fantasies and the only thing the player can do is chug the ♥♥♥♥♥tream like there’s no tomorrow. There’s no reason to not add any ♥♥♥♥ed-up character but the game seems to be too busy eating its own♥♥♥♥♥♥and feces cake to care about it. It’s like a friend invited you to some convention, under the false promise of some food and fun, but then you realize that the convention is about ponies and your friend buys you a hamburger in apology, but no, you won’t forget this betrayal, oh no.The producers are trying to play the: “Intricate and deep story about transgender issues and society” card, but in truth you’re only invited to a party where the cake is only a cover of nice looking icing but under that there’s only♥♥♥♥♥♥and wank. It seems however that after all the rambling and rage about this game attracted the developers are only plugging their ears and yelling really loud: “IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT, DON’T BUY IT. THANKS FOR THE MONEY”, totally oblivious of the fact that here, in Steam, you can’t rate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you don’t buy it. There’s going forth with confidence and then there’s the developer whooping my nose with the tip of their big self-pleased stiffy. Not that I think that most amateur VN’s are sublime works of art that deserve the maximum amount of praise, some are only worth of a shot in the balls. But the only thing you need to do is not grabbing all the worse parts of every single trend and fetish in history and magnify it by 200000%.The “story”, if one can be so bold as to call it so, revolves around a pair of male “scientists” (a term that this game uses so loosely that the genitalia of the most concurred sex worker is cleaner than this) that are FIXATED with becoming females. And I made the word fixated big because it’s something that borders plain and pure madness. But not the kind of madness that makes you do the right thing in the wrong way, no, it’s the kind of madness that whispers in your ear and makes you wank in front of your parents. The kind of madness that was treated with electroshocks and brain lobotomy.Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme is a game that really makes me want to hate it because everything about it is twisted (get it?) to a degree where all that could possibly be remotely enjoyable has morphed into a horrible ball made of the most horrible nightmares. And there’s nothing wrong with nonsensical writing, there’s some charm to it in fact. But this shiny gold star I sticked for the attempt at nonsensical writing its almost immediately torn off for some truly abhorrent drawing and writing design. Genderbending: Fine. Genderbending with some animalistic tweaks: Fair Enough. Genderbending with the option of going full furry: Now we’ve dropped into the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness. But then there’s Gender Bending, with the option of going full furry, mermaid, goo girl and others mixed with the worst writing in the history of humankind and art worth of a 4th grader: And now the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness has closed over our heads.Lazy attempts at absurd aside, GBDNATE, strikes me as a rather mediocre attempt at a game. An argument as solid as farts and that whole speech about wanting to create a truly enjoyable game about living the life as the opposite team aren’t valid points when your whole game is just a pile of turds.  The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions, they say and this game sure makes you notice that you’re on a different kind of hell. Instead of red skinned fellows wielding pointy tridents you are pinned against sexual deviants, furries and mentally challenged people. Even when they try every single approach to the other routes, you can see that it’s just a misuse of a good formula.You see, if that were the only fatal flaw, we could call this game mediocre at best, and then go back to the wanking, but no, this is just the tip of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ iceberg. I’ve already mentioned the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art. And even when the artists says he’s trying to “improve” all I can really see is a moderate amount of effort being put in not sucking so much rather than stop being a complete disaster. IF at that you add the price tag, which is 25$ you can see with ease what the problem seems to be. Because, let’s be honest, if this massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥was only 2 bucks then then the only complains would be: “Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but for 2 bucks it’s a nice way of getting a giggle of two (If only you could call this an attempt at comedy), but no, the price is way high for a quality this low.At this point it seems that the developers are only trying to grab the most amount of cash in exchange for the least amount of effort. And no, the: “Then don’t buy it if you don’t like it” card cannot be played here, devs. Also, speaking of the green devil, I must remind (Or tell) you that this game was FUNDED before. Yes, the devs got even more money before they even got this game on Steam. And that makes you think that they could’ve hired better artists or a decent writer for this.Overall I can only recommend this game to masochistic ♥♥♥♥♥ that enjoy psychological pain rather than the physical one, but at some point you will also feel the physical pain. And you don’t have to tell me, I’ve spent 110+ hours in this thing reading every passage trying to find the most minimal trace of good writing but at this point I can safely assure that my adventure has ended in total and abysmal failure.Paying the full price it’s equal to asking a gentle colonoscopy. You won’t like it but you paid for it, and the guy who’s doing it it’s probably enjoying the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this.Rating; Welcome to Deviantart"

The deviantart tier art showcases how little budget went into art production when the game was heavily funded. It would seem like the developer only kept the artist because either A) The artist is the dev's friend or B) The artist pretty much did a lot of the art already or C) Both A and B. Most VNs don't need good art to be good but the artistic value in a fetish/harem VN should at least be more presentable than 7th grade ""decent"", considering that's exactly what this game is. It's a fetish game.You play as a male who gets turned into a girl. That's a fetish and also delves into the realm of transgender issues, but I'm not going to talk about that as I am sure this game doesn't even graze that subject, considering this is purely fetish and not social commentary. Then you can go further into your fetishes becoming weirder things or having body expansions. This game would be better as a dress-up game as I'm already falling bored of the character interaction and find nothing interesting in the characters. That could be due to the visual representation of them. Thanks again, art, for being so subpar. It seems like this could have been written by a young teen and you can notice the attempts of proper grammar leaking through the text as it feels forced. This is because the developer is French Canadian. I doubt they're a young teen, although fetish art this bad and fetish writing on Deviantart is generally young teenagers, which is pretty shocking when you think about it.On transformation it seems most of the characters instantly enjoy and embrace their feminine selves instead of trying to fix the damage that was done. This can be construed as the characters are all perverts or actually wanted to be females to begin with. I doubt this is even a plot point of the scientists who created this disaster, as they apparently do not have a clue what's going on. What I think makes this worse is the fact you get to have male love interests. I can understand embracing your feminine changes but these characters are almost right into it and ready to be girls. I guess if they wanted meat in them before this would make sense they'd be instantly okay with it as a girl.Overall, there are better (and free!) VNs or games in general with fetishes that are more well played out than this game that you can jerk off too. I still recommend this game. It's a disgusting waste of $25 but if you want to show your friends how much you love buying them trash and you have the disposable income, you should buy this for them."

Honestly, I went into this with just knowledge of the screenshots, yet still I kept an open mind about what to expect. As such, I can see how this does appeal to some crowds and why it doesn't appeal to others. And for only 3 people working on this project, it is not half bad. Again, would I recomend it to others? No. Do I believe that it should be on Steam? I'm a bit conflicted there as I have seen other visual novels here, some with gameplay elements, others like this one.

I actually paid full price for a game I wasn't expecting to like, but in the end, it turned out to be be nowhere near as bad as I expected. Now, don't get me wrong, this game is by no means a godsend or a masterpiece of any kind - far from it. But if you're looking for laughs, something weird to show your friends, or are genuinely interested in any of the fetishes this game covers, then this is the visual novel for you."

It's basically about two guys make a gender swapping thing (like the title says) and it get's all ♥♥♥♥ed up. Personally, my favorite character has to be Dina by how batshit insane she is. Dina's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and always gets her way (somehow).Anyway, I can get at where some people honestly hate this game and I can tell you why. The art is ok, the dialogue is cheesey as ♥♥♥♥, the characters have no actual form of a women, as in their proportions are way off.BUT, besides the downsides, there is one good thing I got from this: The crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥and creepy characters. The characters have impossibly large breasts that make them look like an hourglass with one larger end than the other. Later in the story when people start changing into an anthropormorphic animals I sometimes jumped out of my God damn chair cause they creep me out. The dialogue is hilarious and what they do is hilarious. The ending (I'm gonna spoil a little so be prepared) is so ♥♥♥♥ed up. I felt bad for everyone and only the people who acutaly WANTED to have their gender changed got the best of the lot while everyone else is stuck as a female and let me tell you something: SELF PLEASURE DOESN'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS. I'd guess the suicide rate was pretty high after the events of the two-part finale.Is the game worth it? ABSOLUTLY but you have to be ready for some fetish ideas in the story (That MIGHT be the reason why I like this game but don't think I like it because of the breasts). Is it worth $25? No, it should be 10, at most 15. But don't let the price steer you away, I'm looking at you CS:GO.Anyway, to sum it up, get this game for the laughs and how crazy the characters are. I'd like to leave a quote by Jim Morrisons ""People Are Strange.""People are strange when you're a strangerFaces look ugly when you're aloneWomen seem wicked when you're unwantedStreets are uneven when you're down(Singing this the whole time I was playing it)"

You keep playing it just to see how bad it gets, and it just keeps getting worse - or better, as this game is hillarious if you try to take it seriously.I reccomend it heavily, especially if you plan on reading throuhg it with multiple people.

But people just need to treat this as a game, with another what if situation and enjoy the story for what it is. It's a long, semi-choice driven visual novel that has decent graphics (all things considered) And for me, a lot of fun to play through each of the character's stories, some even multiple times.There is also hate on the game for the graphics, but really, I loved them. The backgrounds were recycled for the entire game, but each of the characters had a set number of poses and costumes. And they all worked when they were used. I enjoyed the art style quite a bit and had a lot of fun playing through the game.If there were a single problem I had with the game it would be the final two chapters of the story. I won't spoil the plot, but it felt rushed, and while I know that the developer had tried to tie up all the loose ends of the story and make sure it somewhat fit. I would have personally felt better not having all the main characters having a what happened in the end senario built into the end of the story, it kind of makes the choices of partners, and endings you can have in the individual ones less exciting and fun.Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game and it left me with the feeling of reading a good book and  would recommend it to anyone looking to spend an hour or so having a bit of fun with the story."

Hopefully the developers will hear the feedback and start developing other characters that others can identify with. Dina, is actually my favorite.  Seems to be the one that offends people the most. I see her as quirky, brilliant, courageous, but just has a little bit of tunnel vision and accidentally ignores others. We all have our flaws. I think it's meant to be light and fun.Watch some YouTube videos or check out the demo if you are interested before buying.

Alot of it is fan service, I will admit, but the amount of individual scenes, characters, personalities, and stories that manage to link up to one-another in some fashion is to me mind boggling.I recommend this game to anyone who does have even minor interests in gender transformation, anthropomorphic transformation, chest expansion, or same sex romances/multiple romances. Also, I highly recommend this for someone who loves a complex story tree that branches out into so many different avenue but still manages to keep the overall story intact.Yes, I will admit that the art and stories are not on par with that of Nekopara or If My Heart Had Wings, but it is a very close second to me. Though the story is leagues ahead from such trash as the Sakura Spirit/Angles...Give the Gender Bender a whirl, I believe in time you’ll come to enjoy the transformation as much as the characters. I look forward to the Rose story arch and hope to see more for this developer in the future. Awesome job guy!As a P.S. to those who are interested (or care), I’m a woman and I still enjoy this game. It’s nice to think of guys being able to see the world from our point of view.Edit 1: It has been a long while since I have played as I was waiting for the Russell update, then life happened and I was pleasantly surprised  by the addition of Aleanne.First, let me say that the game does get better as you play it! Not only in story, but in art as well. You can see the artist improve with each new update and I find it prenominal. Like watching an artists progression only through a story telling media.I will admit that it would be nice to see the entire game redone to fit the new and improved work, but that would be asking for an almost complete overhaul every time the game is updated. Not feasible in the slightest with the pittance that is being charged for this game.Second, I hate to say that Aleanne is a little disappointing; with a story that feels rushed and a good deal of typos and incongruities, it’s not as captivating as the previous. But then I assume it would be hard to follow up after Russell, which is a really fun pit of story/puzzle.Regardless, this bit of negative does not tarnish the game as a whole. It is still a wonderful game that will captivate and keep you going for a lot longer than most of the story games out there. I still highly recommend this game and look forward to the Scarlett update and any others that may follow. Keep going Dev, you’re doing amazingly despite what a few haters may think!"

A few typos here and there, and the auto-play feature doesn't seem to work for me, but otherwise it's pretty awesome. I kinda wish there were more choices, but I can wait until the full cast is included before breaking down the creators' doors... lol$25 is a bit steep for a visual novel, though...Anywho, it's been enjoyable playing this and while $25 is a bit steep, I'd say it's worth it, if you're interested enough to play all the characters. If you're the sort who'll only play one character and then drop the game, you might want to wait until it's 80% off, but that's lame. Especially since most of the characters aren't a rehash of other characters from a slightly different perspective. Each one has his or her own motivations, etc.So yeah, great game. Worth the price if you play through multiple characters' stories. Has some choices for each path, but more would be better. Dunno how that'd be implemented without rewriting some of the story, though... /shrug"

The gender swap is not an uncommon thing in manga or anime and this isn't the only visual novel using this theme, but the writing is sub par and the artwork is, in my opinion, bad and at certain points even beyond worse.I also don't get it why the writer(s) keep mentioning ""huge/fat/massive soft boobs"". Is that the only reason why they wrote this story, to talk about boobs? Sorry, but that's pretty lame and very childish in a dumb and insulting way.besides of that, this visual novel allows for some choices and has many different characters to play as, which is nice. All the characters are somehow connected to eachother, story wise and so you might see a single character several times during other play throughs.I would do recommend this game, but only on sale, because the artwork is too bad and almost a disgrace to the franchise."

It's no great work of art, but the characters are amusing and plots are enjoyable.I reccomend this to anyone who likes seeing the Three Laws of Gender-Bending in action."

The choices would feel so much more rewarding if you could live the life of a furry or goo girl for a while to see how actually living like that would be in the long run :DI'm a big fan of lesbian love relationships, so this ones got a big thumbs up from me <3"
,Recommended,321060,12591163,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,Zurea,"Simple choices with varying effects that give multiple endings for each character. A good 'fetish novel' to curl up with and read when feeling slow or just want a little pick-me-up fantasy read. I can agree that its not for everyone's tastes, and if you haven't read a 'Graphic Novel' before I wouldn't recommend it as a start, but for those that have read graphic novels before and enjoy the types of things that come in this I'll say a few things.Cons I've seen- Minor Spelling/gramtical errorsPros I've seen- Good stories that can become emotional- characters aren't 2D on their emotions- Imersive 1st person perspective that is also shown from a 3rd person view allowing you to be in the mind of the character while not actually being the charater.I'd love to see these stories continue and hopefully as it develops we'll be seeing more characters and additions to the stories as what happens later down the road.Rating 8/10"

My knee is hurtful.)Should I give honest review? ...Well thenGood:Extremly WeirdLesbian (girls to girls....something else.)TransformationHumorBad:Sloppy textLack of arts (I'm ok with this)Is there anything else should I say? Originally, it was stored on Desura and I haven't bought it until I noticed there was a greenlight which I already did vote it. But it pass through Steam and it cost 25 dollers. It's quite overprice that I ever seen than other games.The game is not finish until they'll put new characters or new routes until final products."
