It's a beat-em-up where the screen quickly clogs up with enemies, but you can't maneuver to avoid them very well (there's not even a jump command). Nor is there enough variety in the moveset to enable you to manage the crowds in a strategic way. So basically you just mash buttons and hope for the best.$10 is an outrageous rip-off for this. It's a port of a silly mobile game that was obviously meant to be played in short spurts at bus stops, bathrooms, and the like.  Youmightenjoy it for the initial (brief) laugh and lame-brained combat, but paying anything more than $2 would be a big mistake.(And if you're looking for a simple, silly action game that actually retains your interest once the joke wears off, get ""One Finger Death Punch"" instead)"

Romans, cowboys and other random enemies. The game originally made for hand helds) plays in short stages where you usually have a objective to complete. Those usually range from kill enemies, survive, don't get hit, or achieving a certain score amount. It's just too bad the game play is incredible boring and broken. Your character can take a hit from close, far, from enemies not even facing him, and worst of all from enemies not even standing on the same level as him (this game has the bad 3D fighter mechanic of walking close and far from the screen). You can also perform a divine punishment which a finisher on stunned enemies but this seems to happen almost at random and there doesn't seem to be a sure fire way to stun a enemy. Also after you see it happen the first time it turns into something you wish that you could skip.As per usual for these games, you are expected to do a lot of grinding to level your character up. I never did notice a difference in it though as even after fully upgrading your damage the AI still seemed to take the same amount of hits. If anything it just makes it easier for them to kill you. Graphically it looks like something you'd see in an iOS game, it has bright cartoon looking graphics. It is horrible to control however, feeling stiff and sometimes unresponsive.Overall even on sale I can't recommend this. It really doesn't have anything going for it and you'll hate it more then you'll ever enjoy it.Score :1/10http://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/06/13/fist-of-jesus-review/"

If you like Battletoads, X-Men, Simpsons, AVP, TMNT, Final Fight, Castle Crashers, Double Dragon, Scott Pilgrim, or any other game in the beat em up genre, you will love this.Unless you're a diehard Christian with no sense of humor - then definitely stay away.For the first 2 hours I played this game tonight I was laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off at the dialog, the animations, the names of powers, the enemies, and everything in general.There is one thing I will note and that once you get deep into the game like chapter 3 and beyond, it gets harder than ♥♥♥♥, no joke. Have fun beating Lazarus the second time, I gave up after 10 fails. I may be missing something.You get Judas and Jesus and can swap betweenthem - though thus far the controller bind for this does not work at all - and they each get 3 unique powers, usually one being protective, one being an AoE, and the other being a straight line attack that is also AoE but can only hit in a straight line. Your characters can  pick up various weapons and items in the levels or buy them before it starts, and  you can also destroy world objects to gain items.Each level presents a goal you must meet before the timer ends in order to proceed. Usually it is to survive but in the harder levels it is to kill a certain amount of enemies and gain a certaina mount of points, without dying, before the timer runs out. And on some of these levels, it's ridiculously hard - enemies will literally fill the screen until it's impossible to move.Regardless, I haven't had this much fun with a game in a very long time."

I do still have problems on the main menu (controlling the cursor is nigh impossible because of how fast it moves, so I have to use the mouse), but otherwise the game can be played with a controller now.  Hence my review update.It's fun to play, and the theme amuses me a great deal.  It could use a more polished translation (particularly as I get further along) and a more detailed options menu, but overall the game's presentation is charming and puts its theme to good use.  The rather silly but well-made promo videos I've seen for the game did a good job of capturing its nature, and I approve.It's been fun to play so far, though it's starting to wear thin gameplay-wise (I have reached the desert level, and I'm starting to lose interest in the gameplay, which doesn't change all that much).  It turns out the game is single-player only, which feels like a missed opportunity but oh well.  The power-ups are fun and over the top, and I like having two characters (with the backup jumping in after the first dies).  But the combat definitely feels a bit samey after the 20th or so mission, and your movement and attack options start to feel pretty limited.I definitely recommend the game all the same.

Here is my first impression video review and read on for a more in depth review.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPZHKFHtMGs&feature=youtu.beJesus brought Lazarus back from the dead and unwittingly started a zombie pandemic that spans the ages. You get to play as either Jesus or Judas and eradicate the zombies before the world is lost.So far this game is a lot of fun and has a delightful amount of gore in it. Things I like so far includeMortal Kombat like fatalities on zombies.A nice array of special abilities.The ability to gain levels and upgrade powers through rpg elements.The art is fun and fresh.Dialog is funny and may make you lol.The controls handle well.Decent variety of baddies.Things I don’t like so far include.Button layout for the keyboard is odd. Luckily you can bind whatever buttons you want to fix it.360 Controller not working properly. It tries to work but very wonky.They don’t tell you what buttons activate abilities in game you have to exit and go to the key binding menu.More on gameplayYou can tag team between Jesus and Judas on every level. Think of Capcom vs X-Men and such. Each guy has different special abilities and different traits that make them desirable. When you kill zombies they drop coins that you can later use to either upgrade your powers or to resurrect mid level if  you happen to die. There are plenty of weapons that you can find mid level such as a sword fish, super fish, chain, stave and more. This really does feel like an 80’s early 90’s game done right with better graphics. This game does have the angry bird approach when it comes to progression. You can get up to 3 stars on each level depending on your performance and at certain points you need a minimum amount of start to continue. That being said you may need to go back and 3 star a few levels to move on. Don’t forget your upgrades as you go.This game is definitely worth a play it is fun and seems to be a good time sink. What I need to find out now is if it is a good cheap game for those of us on a budget. I will update this post when I see how many hours of gameplay I get through and let you know. you can also listen to the podcast for a more indepth review after hours of gameplay."

Extremely well actually, graphics look nice (if you are into that sort of stuff, cartoony i mean) and story is really hilarious and full of epic one-liners. Now i personally do not feel offended by this theme eventhough i am a Christian, but if you are too much into religion i guess this game shouldnt be an option for you. So lets move to pros and cons.Pros1. Basically the whole story and the vibe you get while playing is priceless, plus funny one-liners and names of powers2. It runs smoothly, effectively handling large amounts of enemies without any lag or whatsoever3. Music fits really well and you will find yourself whistling4. Challenging levels, basically from the very start. Thats both a plus and a minus depending on your character.Cons1. Its way too repetitive. Basically after getting to about half of the game, you will have seen all of the enemies. Also i didnt really like mixing all the zombies together just like that, i mean Romans, Egyptians and cowboys, just doesnt feel right. Special moves involving divine punishment become just meh, losing that shock effect it had for the first time. Also there are only 3 animations for that which isnt a lot in my opinion.2. Horrible bosses! This is maybe the worst aspect of the game. Basically you have three different bosses which appear over and over again but each time with more enemies to help them and less time for you to finish it. Gets frustrating really fast.3. As mentioned above, levels are challenging to the point of being ridiculously hard. Like get no hit and get 25 divine punishments on mini-bosses.4. Achievements involve a lot of grinding. Stuff like equip a weapon before the level 300 times shouldnt exist in my opinion (game has 50 levels i think so that would mean 6 playthroughs) or kill that many zombies with a leg, get xxxx number of divine punishments etc. So not really easily obtainable.5. Again grinding up, you will find yourself unable to beat a boss or some levels without raising your level first. Basically without gold for reviving or good punch etc. you dont stand a chance against any tougher composition of foes. It took me a while to get to lvl 25 and there seems to be 40 levels (according to the achievement)6. Some minor bugs such as cowboys with guns being able to shoot you even though they are facing another direction7. Now this is irrelevant but some grammar mistakes seemed to annoy me. Stuff like ca'nt instead of can't should be correctedAfter writing this i see that i listed more cons than pros. I still recommend it though as you will certainly have fun for a while and laugh a lot. But get this only while it's on a big sale. It is way overpriced, i got it for 50% off and still feel it's kind of expensive."

However, skilled players (and, through the use of abilities and items, you can certainly develop skills) are rewarded with the star ranking system. Those who are a little bit OCD, like myself, will probably find themselves playing levels over and over trying to get that last star for completionist's sake.The mechanics can be a little buggy, particularly in regards to abilities - which sometimes (though only rarely) are not activated when keys are pressed, but will still require a cooldown before they can be used again. Movement is a little clunky, and it can be hard to align your fighter with enemy hordes, making it frustratingly difficult in an encounter where multi-kills or zero-damage are necessary to complete the level.The soundtrack is Western-themed, upbeat and excellent. The settings are charming, and the dialogue witty, if not a little cringe-inducingly tongue-in-cheek at times.I'd definitely recommend this to casual or veteran fighting game fans, and also to any militant atheist with an axe to gring."

The basic concept is that you're Jesus and Jesus going up against the minions of Lazarus, proving once again that sometimes dead is better. Starts off with zombie peasants and zombie Centurians, then for some reason kicks it up to zombie cowboys and the like. It's a weird angle to take, but I've found it fun.The initial problem with it is def the controls, as that has taken some work to sort out and I've ended up having to google for it instead. Not ideal, but eventually I get past that and so it got better over time. The early levels build up in difficulty and complexity slowly, however that really kicks up to another level and the last 10 or so levels start to get incredibly difficult with an unrealistically steep difficulty curve, and I'm not even sure if the last level is beatable without a whole lot of grinding first.There are some gameplay issues that show up throughout as somewhat frustrating, there's def some issues with the KO method being reliable or predictable, and it seems to be somewhat random, which is a problem when some levels have goals for that. The inconsistency also shows up in the achievements, as there's some achievements that require grinding something that is basically randomly generated, which is the sort of achievement that is just frustrating.Overall, while those are problems, those still feel minor to me. The brunt of the gameplay is still causing stars to fall from the sky or having Jesus create walls of fire in order to kill zombies, and it's got a pretty entertaining tone to it that I find fun.

Some of the levels do get pretty challenging. I got it on sale and I would recommend you do too. Ten dollars is a little pricey for a game this simple. My biggest grip is that the hit boxes are way off. It's hard to know sometimes where exactly you need to be to not get hit. This becomes particulary annoying at the squid boss. Also the game continuingly repeats itself. You have to fight each boss three times and what's worse is that they don't change any except for the fact that they take less hit damage each time.

But if you think your Super Mario is the bee's knees, I've got another moustachioed superhero that's gonna rock your socks off.His name... is Jesus. Maybe you've heard of him.Jesus was a pretty cool dude with some wild ideas. He was a rebel, he was off the chain. And he loves you, too. He'll always love you, no matter what.Unless you're a zombie. Zombies are his natural prey. Or I suppose you could say... pray.Now, I'd recommend for you to take a seat. The following may shock, appall, and/or entice you.This is a game where you play as Jesus, fighting a zombie apocalypse with your bare hands.If you are not sold on this game, I'm afraid you're beyond help.This is Fist of Jesus: The Bloody Gospel of Judas. Yes, this is a real thing. Available on Steam, iOS, and Android. You can pay real money for this. It's seriously a thing.Jesus has accidentally resurrected zombies, and they've now infested everything. It's up to our hero Jesus to save the day. It's nice to finally have a realistic depiction of what happened in the Bible. Such a great game, and educational too.It's a simple beat-em-up, like the old TMNT or Double Dragon games. Jesus must ""save the souls"" of the zombies. With his fists. Or swords. Or chains. Or shotguns. Or massive crucifixes. You'll massacre your way through each level and unleash holy vengeance on all before you with your best friend and sidekick Judas. He's totally not gonna betray you or anything. With his help, you'll be taking down zombies, bigger zombies, and cowboy zombies. Yep, this game has it all.However, like I said... if the initial revelation that such a game existed didn't sweep you off your feet, it's not the game for you. Fist of Jesus is not a perfect game. It's not an in-depth game. It's mindless fun, the way beat-em-ups are. There are mild RPG elements, and you can learn some special moves. Jesus can spawn bread from thin air and raise pillars of fire. You can level him up until he can punch off zombie heads in one hit. Teach him fatalities, like ripping out hearts or uppercutting spinal cords out.And yet all of this can't save it from being needlessly grindy or repetitive. Leveling up is definitely necessary. Later levels will crush you if your fists are not holy enough. And you'll need to grind for money to purchase character upgrades. Which would be fine if every level wasn't so repetitive. It's not like there's any structure to the levels. They're just the same blank battlefield. Sure, each level will have different weapons and items lying around the arena. But that's not a major difference. There's no level design.Simply killing everything in a level isn't always enough either. Each level will have different win goals. Sometimes you just need to survive. Other times you'll need to earn a certain number of points, or kill a certain number of a certain enemy. Which can be especially frustrating if you're not sure WHY you keep failing a mission. The points are kind of confusing. You get bonus points for fatalities or using weapons, and yet I've failed point-based missions where I got a dozen fatalities in a row. When in actuality I just needed to have a higher level Jesus and kill zombies faster.Your score in each level will get you a ranking from one star to three stars. These are needed to perform the miracle of opening new levels. The greatest of Jesus' miracles. However, sometimes it's near impossible to get more than one star in a level. Similar to how getting the right number of points to beat the level is confusing, reaching an unknown amount of points for the three star rank is even harder. They should really clarify the point values of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Would be easier to figure out ""oh, I just need to do this"" instead of ""I killed everything, why is this not working"".Still, even with its semi-decent gameplay... I've sunken a pretty big chunk of time into it, and have enjoyed every second of it. Because Jesus with a shotgun blasting through hordes of zombies is the greatest dollar I've ever spent on Steam.I've spent hours just mashing buttons and laughing uncontrollably. Because I just used a chainsaw to dismember a massive zombie. As Jesus. Sure, Judas is in there too. But I main Jesus. He's my main. That should be a bumper sticker. ""Jesus is my main"".The best part of the game is its ridiculousness. The stupidly cute sprites and goofy art style, mixed with the animated bloodbaths and gory dismemberment scenes. The fact that you're playing as Jesus, using a shotgun, to kill a zombie in a cowboy outfit. None of it fits together coherently, and yet it works. It just works. The music is sort of dramatic and western-sounding, and the sound effects are goofy sounding. And it's hard to tell if the writing was done by someone who's native language is not English or if it's done on purpose. A lot of semi-nonsensical dialogue.This is a game that you can judge at face value. There's no hidden depth to this game. It's not a hidden gem of any sort. It's hilariously stupid. If spending a couple bucks on a game called ""Fist of Jesus"" sounds like a good idea to you, it will be worth it. If it sounds stupid and you think you wouldn't enjoy it, chances are you won't. The enjoyment comes from reveling in the chaos unfolding onscreen. Jesus beating a zombie to death with his own arms definitely sounds like a good time to me. Maybe you'll think differently.That's how wars start though. I dunno if you want that. Especially if Jesus can take on an entire army of zombies with only his fists. Jesus ain't having any of you nonbelievers out there. The God Delusion? Better be ready for some brain contusions, know what I'm saying? Jesus is out of control.He appears to be invincible. And he's the main character. Clearly, his story must have a happy ending. Right? I never got that far in the Bible, I always get lost trying to figure out who's begetting who. Or why they're begetting people. Begets aren't all that good. Croissants are the superior French food.Croissants are always buttery and delicious.Begets are just like my humor. Tasteless.Let's get biblical, biblical. I wanna get biblical.I couldn't find anywhere else to work it in but cringed so hard when it crossed my mind, so I knew it must've been important to fit in here somehow."

,Recommended,321110,15990964,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,Redbeard,"I had to buy the Fist of Jesus game because of the name alone, just to have a bit of a laugh.In the Holy Land, Lazarus has brought back from the dead a whole lot of zombies. Jesus and his BFF, Judas, have to fight them off (actually, Judas may be not so much of a Best Friend Forever, but perhaps a Best Friend For The Moment - you know, until that whole 30 pieces of silver incident comes between them).Jesus and his BFFTM play tag team in fighting the zombie hordes. As Jesus, you keep killing the zombies until you die, and then Judas takes over - and vice versa. Fortunately, Jesus comes back to fight again in the next round - you don't even have to wait three days for him to resurrect.Not a lot of tactics are involved, but there's a whole lot of very fast click-click-clicking and tap-tap-tapping on your keyboard, as you kick and punch your way through the cohorts of the living dead (if you want to get a case of Repetitive Strain Injury, then this is the game for you).Jesus and Judas smash the decaying departed with chains, clubs, swordfish, body parts, and other unlikely weapons of mass destruction. Presumably the idea of turning the other cheek doesn't apply to zombies.It has a 1980s game style, so be forewarned to be underwhelmed by the game mechanics. Don't buy this for serious game playing - buy it on sale, play it for a couple of hours, and then throw it away.Fist of Jesus should only be recommended on the basis of having some cheap laughs. If you're ok with that, then - in the words of the Great Lord on High - ""Game on, my Son!""P.S.Interestingly, the game is based upon the 2012 film, Fist of Jesus - a short comedic sacrilegious production from Spain.The film is available on the internet, with English subtitles. It's only 14 minutes long, and - thankfully - you can fast forward through it, if you can't stand watching too much of it.https://vimeo.com/88799881Watch the film if you have time to waste (and a high tolerance for stupid movies) - just make sure that you have your fast forward button at the ready. The short film is worth a look at, but only just to see how awful it is."

76561198002555407,Recommended,321110,20480745,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,bioloco,"So a few days ago I saw this game on sale for $2.50 and I had a hard time saying no just from looking at the title. I did a video of my blind reaction which I think captures what this game has to offer pretty well which I'll link to and will follow up with a full text review below.Initial Reaction:Holy Crap Jesus Fighting Zombies!!I can tell you how funny this game is all day but I truly believe the proof is in the gameplay. But now on to a more formal look at the game.OverviewFist of Jesus is a side-scrolling beat-em-up game featuring Jesus as the main playable character. It follows him and Judas on their journey to stop Lazarus, whom Jesus has resurrected from the dead, from raising a zombie army bent on taking over the world. The gameplay is simple old school fisticuffs action, and presents it's challenges in a series of Mario 3 style level on an over-world map.PresentationI think this is one of the best things the game has going for it. The art style is charming and cutesy while the juxtaposition of that against Jesus f-ing Christ mercilessly beating zombies to a bloody pulp is absolutely hilarious. The animation is what you would expect from a simple game like this but they put some nice touches in where it counted. One such instance I vividly remember laughing at was when judas ""skirt"" flies up showing his purple undies after throwing a fish. These sort of funny little things combined with some very over the top, and flashy special moves such as ripping out zombie's still beating hearts or chainsawing their limbs off with a saw fish skeleton make for some very entertaining visuals.GameplayI have to say, for what I assume is a port of a mobile game over to steam I think the controls translated pretty well. I played with my PS4 controller which the game allows you to map to which I thought was a nice touch. I will say, figuring out what buttons do what from the menu they give to map the controller is a bit of a pain but it's worth it if you have the patients. The in game controls are tight, punching feels good, using items such as rocks, chains and SWORD FISH! feel even better. The hit-boxes can be a little crazy some times but honestly it mostly works in your favor in that regard. I often found myself hitting 3 or 4 zombies at once which was nice when I was getting surrounded.SoundI think the music for this game, while a little repetitive (I think there's only like 4 songs in the whole game that I heard) was very fun. I didn't get bored of it, and even caught myself whistling the main theme the following day. The sound effects in game are what you'd expect. Thwaks, sawks, and thuds for punches, and moans for zombies. Though the sound of Judas' Ki Wave (Ha-Do-Ken) was very satisfying.Other NotesThere's a lot of good things I can say about this game but there is one glaring problem I would be remiss if I didn't mention. It is fairly buggy... Most notably was a bug I found when I completed a level. After clicking the next level button I was put on a loading screen that just would not go away. I would hear the game load behind it, and it would even take input to the point where I could start the next level behind the loading screen, but the overlay would not go away. Each time this happened the only fix I could find was to re-start the game. That glaring bug, the fact that mapping the controller to it was exceedingly difficult, and some moments of legit ""engrish"" in the game's dialog do mire the experience a little, it has to be said.VerdictSo when I got this game last week it was $2.50 on sale. Given all the laughs that are to be had with this game I think that price-point is totally perfect. Spend your $2 and have some fun. The bugs and little problems are totally overlook-able considering how cheap it is and how funny the ascetic is combined with some pretty decent gameplay. That said I absolutely would not spend the $9 regular asking price for this one. I think that's robbery considering the state this game is in. So my final word... Wait till it's on sale again, and 100% get it then, you'll definitely have some fun.Thanks for reading and I hope you found my review helpful, and/or enjoyed my gameplay video. If you disagree of have something you want to add, feel free to leave a comment!Thanks!-The Bearded Potato"
