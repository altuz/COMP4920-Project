The game itself isn't bad.  A lot of the HO scenes are a tough, which compared to some of the HO game's was a nice change of pace.  So why the negative review,  Simply put, I cannot, nor will not, condone yet another dev that slaps a port on  an app game over here and refuses to support it.There are 5 broken achievements to the game.  If you go to the steam boards you will find that several people (myself included) have emailed the devs letting them know about it.  Their responses have been bold faced lies.  They have said:1)  They have so many versions it's hard to find the problem.  (this is the only version with achievements so. . . . ?)2)  They haven't been able to find the issue.  (they created the port, not a third party, which means they are the ones that coded)3)   They aren't sure they are going to be able to fix the issue.  (there are several devs that have just eliminated broken achievements from their games when they couldn't find the issue)And through all of this, they continue to gleefully sell their game with no warning on their page that some of their achievements are broken.  Buyer beware, and oh thanks for your money.I don't play games solely for their ahievements, but when they are there, I enjoy the extra challenge and replayability that they give.  I; however, also went to college not for the grades but to learn.  If I were to enter a class and find out that if I 100% every test I would receve an 85 max I would probably have been miffed (anyone still use that word?).  This is the same.Not only do I not endorse this game; I will subsequently refuse to purchase any games from the devs and publisher in the future.  There is nothing that is more telling (imo) of a person or company that will take money from you for a product or service and not stand behind it.  With so many games on steam, I would love to see valve start holding devs accountable for selling broken products and ban them from selling here again.  I love steam for all it does to fill my entertainment void at times.  Devs like this one don't deserve to be a part of it.Cheers."

It's been a while since I played a hidden object game that didn't feel too short. It also had some charming Indiana Jones references that made me smile and I really liked the protagonist. Bonus points for having different difficulty settings, that's always a nice and considerate touch. The best part is that this isn't a clear-cut hidden object game. It has many mini-games but also many adventure elements that kept my interest and made the experience even more enjoyable. Oh, and it has a bunch of extra hidden-object and other mini-games after you finish the game! Yay!-On the other hand the 3d animation is almost funny in it's crudeness, which becomes even worse when compared to the aforementioned jaw-droppingly beautiful illustrations. The plot may be interesting but the writing is bad. Some scenes are so poorly written that they become disconnected from one another, to the point I thought I'd skipped some in-between ones that explained how we got from point A to point B (no, unfortunately that was not the case and yes, I double-checked). The voice acting was hilariously slow and boring.But most importantly the puzzles were not challenging even on the expert difficulty.I still had a good time it's true, but there's one thing that really annoyed me, and tipped the scale into me not being able to recommend this. There are 2 specific puzzles in the game, one being the final one, that are near impossible to complete on a pc. It was clear the game was meant for touch-screens and those 2 would have been a breeze if I had one. But I don't and neither should I since I bought this on Steam and not for my tablet. This is something that should have been addressed and fixed before it was released on Steam.I spent the better part of an hour trying to frantically click through the tiles of the final door puzzle. That was obviously not intended by the developers, seeing how easy that task was on tablets. It wasn't fun and neither felt rewarding when I finally made it.There are other minor problems like some pixel-hunting and adventuring that just don't make sense -you have to look through the weirdest places to find an item that will give you a solution to a riddle no sane person would ever imagine, but they are not even close to being as irritating as the final door puzzle.So yeah, I can't recommend it although that doesn't mean it's bad. Overall I had a good time, even if I lost some sanity points somewhere at the end. It's rough around the edges and that simply did not rock my boat.Try it at your own risk."

I highly enjoyed it and the game does have some replayabilty bonus as well. I found the HOG parts of the game fun and challenging, the puzzle parts were also challenging, a few of the puzzles are even more diffcult than challenging. There is some extras to play as well, as you can attempt to get better scores on all three levels of puzzles outside of the story of the game. This can add hours of playtime for the game and it's pretty fun as well.The game possibly can be a little buggy, there is help in the forums for those that find they have a problem. Also, a few of the achievements are broke on steam. As far as getting all the achievements there are a couple that would be pretty difficult  to get, I finally gave up trying to get the last two myself after quite a few times of trying.If you like  more challenging HOG/puzzle game, I recommend getting this. It is very fun and gives you more hours of playtime than the normal HOG game."

I've casually observed others play them in the past, so I had some idea of what to expect.   I'm not easily impresssed, but Melissa K. and the Heart of Gold impressed me.   The production values are high.  The cinematics and voice work are better than I expected.     The artwork is top-notch.   The story that creates a narrative for the gameplay is intriguing enough to want to see how it plays out.   The puzzles so far are not brain-taxing, but they are not as brain-dead as something in recent Telltale games (which I enjoy and appreciate as interactive fiction).For the price, this game is a steal.   We all know that Steam is now overflowing with substandard, buggy, amateur, and ill-conceived titles.  This is NOT one of those.

Even William Shatner delivers dialogue faster than this.The writer clearly wanted to make an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider epic but got lost somewhere in the endless sideplotting and should have focussed less on twists and cut scenes and more on great puzzles.There is the constant backtracking, where suddenly new items shows up either just after you have visited a scene or 10 minutes later.The game also has a problem in navigation in that you are really not aware that there might be extra scenes to your left or right, as it gives no indication they are there.I usually give these types of HO games a thumbs up due to good puzzles, good HO scenes and a decent amount of play time, but the boredom of this made me even skip the extras and the ""Collectors Edition"" adventure."

It's essentially a point & click and hidden object game, with a cliche plot and a pretty terrible script and voice acting.  The puzzles are often well made, and there's a option (and achievements) for playing every puzzle separately and beating all of the ""best scores.""  Despite putting in the time and doing this, I somehow and missing a bunch of achievements for them.  Perhaps part of the game/achievements are broken.  I know some of them art on Mac at least, because there are 5 more achievements I have credit for in-game that Steam won't register.As far as the game itself goes, gameplay is a bit infuriating.  At times the narrative of the game and the nature of the puzzles are non-sensical... and you'll most likely need a guide even if you're a very seasoned adventure gamer, not because the game is difficult, just because the game doesn't always make sense within its own design.  Also, in an attempt to obtain the a final item for an achievement, I started replays of both the regular game and the Collector's Edition additional chapter.  Both of these replays are now ""frozen"" because of broken, insurpassable hidden object scenes that don't have the objects in them I'm supposed to be finding (this isn't a case of me not knowing what the objects are-- I've beaten these puzzles on speed runs for ""best"" scores and know all of the objects intimately-- they're simply missing from the puzzles).  As both of the games are now broken, I'm giving up on getting the last few achievements.All of the achievements and broken elements aside, I'd probably rate the game a 5 or 6/10.  Because of them, we're down to about a 4/10.  Parts of the game look beautiful, but it's obviously designed for IPad.  There's one final puzzle at the end of the game that's impossible without a mouse, and seems best played on a touchscreen.  If you're trying to do it on a laptop touchpad (as I was for a time while traveling), it's impossible to complete.  Overall I found the game tedious and not very fun."

Do the voice actors unnaturally manipulate the pace of their speech to fit the CGI characters' sometimes bizarre lip movement to the point that it's painful to watch? Count on it. Is the gameplay in many places non-intuitive? Yep. Does the game commit the absolute most heinous HOG mortal sin of all - failing to provide cursor change on mouseover of active areas/items? It sure does!...but does it deserve a thumbs down? IMHO, no.This game is often annoying and dumb (to the point it - seemingly unintentionally - made me LOL a few times). But there's still more than enough of a game here for me to give it a recommend. I think you'll find this especially true if you play a lot of these types of games, generally enjoy casual P&C/HOG's, and get this one on sale. The graphics are good (I liked being able to drag the scene to look around) and there's plenty to do. In the end, I found more to like about it than not.Also, the game played well for me on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux).PS I almost exclusively play offline.

It has a female archaeologist and she gets to explore Thailand!2. References to Thai culture are absolutely fascinating3. It's feels like a huge game - over 4 hours play time, and that's unusual for these point-and-click/hidden object games4. It has all the right ingredients - interesting locations, hidden objects, mini-games, puzzles, variety of special objects5. There's a real variety of puzzles6. The music is lovely in places and the game has all the feel of something that took real time to make7. There's a baby elephant! (definitely need more elephants in games - developers take note)But, desite all this, it just doesn't work!The reasons are (includes some spoilers):1. The acting and characterisation is rubbish! The dialogue is so poor in places that I physically cringed. The Thai monk characterisation is borderline racist.2. Finding some of the locations is really tricky - the rendering of the environments gives you little clue that there is anything else to investigate.3. Some of the 'puzzles' are nonsensical. Why, oh, why do I use a 'catalyser', some sawdust and another chemical to fix a clearly broken boat? A boat which, I should add, was moments ago in a raging inferno which I had to douse with a fire extinguisher, and yet is miraculously unharmed! Oh, and at one point I have to dress a monkey so he'll give me an elaborate bracelet which makes me strong enough to break the bars of my prison!4. The tone of the story and characters is all over the place. Melissa flirts with the other male archaeologist - is he meant to have been my mentor? Surely there's a real ethical dilemma about that one? What about having to retrieve the pickled remains of conjoined twins from a Mengele-like experiment, to satisfy an unhappy ghost? And yet, my character also asks whether her fellow archaeologist (he's so boring, I forget his name) has a ""male"" attitude to driving, and I'm meant to find it funny.I really don't quite know how so much could be included in a game, so many hours could have been taken, and yet the result is so poor. There might be some fans out there, and sure it will take up a good few hours to complete, but I wouldn't say that there was anything I really liked in this one.

A really nice idea was the ability to pan in various scenes and discover items on the edges of the screen. It is an entertaining (at least in the beginning) point and click adventure if anything.

It's not a big negative, but it's there.The setting and theme are original, but the storyline is the still the boring and completely unoriginal ""find the missing person and deal with supernatural elements"" that all HOG developers are obsessed with.Direction was lacking from time to time and but the hint button was handy when it occurred.Overall, I think this is a game worth checking out if you are into HOGs. The Storyline was the weakest part of the game, but it wasn't enough to stop me from completing it. There is a lot of originality and the interaction was fresh.

Whoever drew them had a good deal of fun and skill, and they are really nice to look at, especially the jungle and water oiasis area later in the game. Sadly the animations on the people are derpy. Your guide looks a bit malnourished, but only in his arms. And when he talks he opens his mouth way to wide for the smallest words; it's kind of like an awkward play-dough. Same goes for a monk you meet later. The animations on Melissa during cut-scenes aren't that bad, but her boobs are jacked.The story isn't bad, but it is spotty. I never heard anything about Queen Elizabeth in game, contrary to the description. I do know Melissa works in an office and gets invited to teach a young monk in Bangkock politics or something similar. Why? No idea. Apprently she's famous and gets a huge warm welcome when she arrives that's featured in the papers. The little monk goes missing and you gotta find him. There's quickly some hint towards the paranormal with some scenes that made me jump because they literally come out of no where. No build up, no warning; just bam, creepy imagery and delightfully terrifyinig sound effects.Melissa has some visions, blah, blah. There's a lot to do with Buddism and the legend around it and the atmosphere is very nice. You meet this random guy that literally shows up out of no where but apprently Melissa knows - he's an old professor or some such, and either they screwed each other some time in the past or they both kind of wish they screwed each other and never got around to the act. I don't know if there are others of this games that should make me understand, but I'm lost from just playing this one.Otherwise the gameplay is nice. Good clicking, and you can move the mouse to give you different perspectives in the scenes, which works really nice to give it a more 3D/real enviroment feel. Puzzles aren't too hard and sometimes might be too easy. I'm playing on medium because easy is literally TOO EASY.Anyhow. The voice acting is pretty good, the cutscenes can end a bit suddenly and be a bit rushed, but the commentary from Melissa can be rather funny and she's overall the best character.I reccomend the game because, despite the flaws, it's a pretty good with a pretty good storyline, when you know what's going on.

Most of the point and click puzzles were challenging enough without being too overwhelmng.That said, the final ""reverse Tetris"" puzzle was very annoying and felt out of place due to being more of an arcade game instead of a logic puzzle. I guess it's meant to be a bit of a joke because there's an achievement for failing this particular mini-game 10 times, but it still really didn't have a place when compared to the other puzzles.My only other gripe is that a few of the individual solutions didn't make a lot of sense. There were a few times when the game (via the ""hint"" button) showed me the solution and I thought to myself, ""Seriously? I would never have made that association.""Even with those bumps, the game was primarily a smooth ride.

,Not Recommended,321150,23773285,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Sugarstar,"This is clearly a phone game ported to steam. Game mechanics include dragging the screen around and when you click, a tapping finger appears. Even on expert mode, if you spend just a few seconds without clicking on something, the finger appears to guide your actions/hint you. Puzzles are largely touch-based - dragging flowers around without knocking any off, drag a rolling screen around until you find the button.The logic behind what to do next makes very little sense. If you click on something, text appears that it ""looks interesting, but I'll check it out later."" So, instead of discovering things as you find them, the game will guide you to go back and click on a spot on the ground outside when you are trying to find a way into the rooms inside (becuase something you needed was out there).At one point, you cannot pick up a map on a window until you find a curtain sash and tie the curtain back. :|There are far better point-and-click/hidden object adventure games out there. This one is just frustrating."

To say this story line doesn't make sense is an understatement.  There is no reason or logic to chain events together meaning you'll be looking for a random object to click on in within the various areas or using the hint button like it's your job.In no way have the developers created something worth playing here and may God have mercy on their souls.

This is by far the most awesome puzzle adventure game I've played in a long while. My favorite part was being able to pet the little gecko lizard, which you get to name."

I really enjoy adventure and puzzle games and games with a good story line. This game has it all. However, there are a few things that I got annoyed with:The cons:- The ghost voices were annoying,  The voices sounded like they were drunk on nyquil when speaking.- The ""guide"" talked too slow too like he was on drugs.- The elder monk was too weird (but all in all likeable)- I found myself using hints way too much because the ""clues"" were in areas that you would never think to look or have a reason to.  Nothing gave you a hint as to where items might be unless you actually used the hint button.- Some of the puzzles were too hard to the point where I had to ""skip"" a lot of them.---->SPOILER ALERT!!The elder monk sacrifices himself in the fire, you sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. *cries for days*The pros:-Amazing graphics, beautiful scenery- Really good story line with some plot twists to keep you interested- Great voice acting except for those damn ghosts- You get a lizard for a pet, how cool is that?- You can move forward without having to do a lot of hidden puzzles.All in all I would say try this out for yourself and see how you like it. I paid .49 cents for it and I would say I got my money's worth.  Just wish a few things were a little different that's all :)"

Finding things just to find things. Fine for the phone to kill time but too boring to sit through on pc."

I played on the easiest setting and still struggled with what I was supposed to be doing half the time.I do love the Gecko though"
