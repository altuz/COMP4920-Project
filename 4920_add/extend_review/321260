Apparently they had Australian servers and took them down before there was even a chance for it to take off. I never saw the servers...?Banned from forums for complaining about it and was called hostile by the developer who tried to make me feel sympathy for them only having 5 developers with no office space and being unable to develop a functioning network/server system because they failed to correctly setup the infrastructure in the first place.Read at the bottom of this post for the reason for being banned, it's pathetic at best as they are hiding all negative feedback rather than taking blame for their own mistakes... You will be appalled.The developer tried to alienate me in front of other people within the community discussion who were also disgruntled about the exact same issue that I was having. So that says something about them.You want to talk to me about independent developers who have no office space being unable to create something good..?

If the health gets to zero, the beast is ""defeated"" and disappears (or dies, not sure, you see a strange reddish fountain, I don't know what to make of it.. ).If you lose a beast, you'll be instantly switched to another beast you have picked up before.If all beasts are gone, only the mere mortal remains. That is what you spawn as, a simple human. But you have a crossbow (fully automatic). At least something.The thing is, you don't just have to watch the health of your beasts, no, your mortal form takes damage too. And if your human health reaches zero you are dead, no matter how many beasts you picked up before..Interesting concept for a multiplayer shooter, I have to say. Innovation is still possible in that genre, it seems.Here is the thing: I have found no other games, no other players, nothing, zero, nada..This kinda defeats the whole point of a multiplayer game, I would say...Until this situation changes: Not recommended."

,Recommended,321260,12983871,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,xeroslash,"I've held off on writing a review until I've experienced Duel (1v1) firsthand, but now that I have, here are my impressions.Wickland is a fast-paced arena FPS centered around the Duel game mode. While you're free to participate in Free-For-All/Deathmatch games in warm-up, Duel is the real meat of the game. For an Early Access title, the game plays and feels complete based on the features it advertises, both graphically and mechanically.If you're on the fence because gameplay looks fast, don't be afraid - mechanical movement complexity is kept to a minimum compared to games like Quake and Unreal Tournament (you get WASD, jump, and a simple wall-jump that's easy to perform; that's it). This is so that you can focus on item control and timing straight away, which are two of the foundations of Duel; grab and hold onto as much of the map's pick-ups and beasts as possible, while denying your opponent the same.Speaking of beasts, they replace the role of weapons. Upon first glance, they seem to be simply re-skins of weapons that have functional equivalents in other arena shooters, but you'll soon notice that each beast has its own armor value, and these beasts can soak up a major portion of incoming damage. In Duel, beasts do not respawn until they die, which makes armor pick-ups an important element to control, since your weaponry also have a lifeline of their own. It's this tug-of-war of attempting to relinquish your opponent's control of their beasts while keeping up your own item timings that makes Duel exciting and tense. Map sizes are also just right; many veteran arena shooter fans may find the maps a bit claustrophobic, but they are kept small enough so that it's easy to remember where most pick-ups and beasts are located after running through them a few times.If you've ever entertained the idea of playing Duel in an arena shooter, give Wickland a chance. It's unique take on Duel makes for some very fun experiences, and I like it for being an accessible arena shooter that also doesn't hesitate to punish you for your mistakes. Highly recommended."

I have never found 1v1 duel interesting in any of the other games I've tried. Sure I love some of the other gametypes. But not duel, Then I cam across this and thought, this looks amazing. But it's duel..What really sold it was this articlehttp://www.fpspulse.com/articles/wickland-arena-prestige/, that explained the concept and it sounded so cool. So I had to give it a try. I started of playing a bit in practice mode, looked up some tutorials on movement and all the others. Felt prepered, went on warmup and was cool. Then I gave the duel a try, and seriously. After some guidence I have to say this is definitely one of the best multiplayer game I have ever played. And I wasn't even a fan of 1v1. When understanding the game, you see all the potential it has. Not only do you control the mega and the armor.But you also need to keep track on which beast you killed to steal it away from your enemy. And if you find your opponent being really good with rockets, you try and steal the ammo everytime you can. You make him weaker and weaker until there's just human left, and you win the game.This must be the most satisfying game I've ever played.BUT, please read the tutorials to understand how to play the game, or else you will be lost and confused. Also, see warmup for what it is, it's just warmup. The action happens over at duel."

,Recommended,321260,34371653,Posted: 20 August,all,Sweep,"About WicklandWickland is an indie arena shooter heavily inspired by classic FPS games of the 90's. Morph into eight deadly beasts and use their own unique abilities, blaze through maps at insane speed to pick up power-ups, and fight your friends or foes in classic maze-like arena maps, just like the good old days. Wickland is an arena FPS dedicated to PC Gamers.Release Date: 14 Nov, 2014The GameplaySet in what seems like Midievel times, Wickland brings back that oldschool fps feel that we all remember from the early 2000's. There are 2 modes at the moment including what they call ""Warm up"" which is basically just FFA Deathmatch and Duel Mode which is a basic 1v1. Both are fun to play but I find FFA a lot more fast paced and fun. Weapons are very similar to those of Quake and even imitate them in a midievil way. Instead of keeping the same character through the game though, you switch between them on the go by simply scrolling or pressing a number key, each character having a different weapon. Health pickups, Ammo, Armor and Weapons spawn around the map and must be walked over to be collected all respawning a short time later.All in AllWicklandis a really nice FPS Game!7/10 From MeSweep"

I finished in third place in the latest tournament of Wickland too.Buy Wickland, you will find the best and competitive duel mode 1v1 ever made in an FPS arena. If you want to play or want to learn something on the game add me...However there are 7 beasts in the game plus the human (your main character), when the duel begins you have to pick the beast spawned in the map, every beast has its armour and can die, but you main character (the human again) will not die, you will lose only that beast you picked and it will respawn again in the spawn, yeah because if someone pick a beast it doesn't spawn until the beast is killed (this happens only in the duel mode in the Free for all it doesn't happen). Every beast has its own primary and secondary fires. So you must combine fires of beasts that you picked in the beginning to do a lot of damage to your opponent. More beasts you have, much possibilites of winning the duel you have. When you will kill a beast of your opponent, you must go to the spawn of that beast to pick it to gain advantage on your opponent. There a lot of things too, buy it to find it.Really I hope you will buy the game because it's great."

Wickland has so much depth to it and is so satisfying to play like no other Arena FPS I know. Be aware though that it requires more than aim, movement and killer instinct. You need to time items, make quick decisions and best have a plan b ready if you are suddenly on the backfoot. Take your time for reading the basic gameplay overview, make yourself familiar with the maps, weapons and movement in ffa and duel-practice. Don't expect to master this game within a few hours. Know that there are players that are much more experienced - but also very helpful and willing to share their knowledge. Eventually you will play intense duels that go back and forth and can last for 20+ minutes! The moment that your opponent finally bursts apart (praise the gibs!) after such a hard fought battle will feel like a wicked coronation!"

The twist is that instead of being able to select from different weapon varieties, you get to select from (so far) eight different monster characters, each one specializing in their own weapon varieties and style of play. The player selects and changes between them using the scroll up and down mouse wheel just like you would with weapon selection. As it stands right now, you start each match as a Crusader knight with a rapid fire machine gun-like cross bow, and quickly collect icons that allow you to transform into a King Kong ape looking monster, Creature from the black lagoon fish monster, Nosferatu vampire character, some crab looking creature, a wolf man, ect. ect. It's great and so much fun. The big problem for me is that there isn't a large player community right now. It's a shame because it's such a hidden gem. This game definitely needs more publicity. Hopefully the addition of bots and more maps when it happens will stimulate and grow the player community. Great job developers and programmers. This game is fantastic!"

There is no other game that is this extraordinary, despite all of the bad ratings. in this game, you can morph into 8 different animals, starting with the human, then a lizard, then a gorilla, then a werewolf, then a demon, then a frog, then a fish, and finally, a blue          ogre-esque thing. these different classes shoot different things. The easiest class (in my opinion) is either the human or frog. The human has a fully automatic crossbow with low damage and mediocre accuracy, and the frog shoots slow-fired, high precision, high damage green slimeball things.now time for some pros and cons:pros:-you can switch between the classes at any time, pressing the keys 1-8-there is a practice mode where you can play against as many bots as you want (literally, you could play with WAY more than 100 bots on a tiny map)-there is a VERY small learning curve-it's one of those games that's easy to learn, but hard to master- you can choose between third & first person-when one character dies, the other is used. You only die when all the characters you have unlocked are dead.cons:-awkward FOV-really fast movement (this can be good or bad)-you lose health slowly over time(can be good or bad)and that's the end of this review of wickland.

But I figured I should give a warning to people who stumble across it.The game is good. Witckland is a Quake style shooter where you pick up weapons that change you into to strange mideval (?) fantasy monsters that have different magic powers that work like traditional guns. There is a werwolf, ape man, and many more creatures. I like the concept of a weapon changing your whole character, and would like to know if other shooters use this premise.The levels are all dark castles, so setting can be a bit dull, but the levels are well designed.This game uses a health and armor system where you can pick up power ups to heal like traditional 90s shooters. The controls are very tight and great.The main issue is all forms of servers are dead. Meaning the only form of gameplay is bots. Bots are super mobile and accurate, so they can provide a great challenge if you are into that sort of thing. Also you can use external programs to make a server with your friends temporarily and play. But I don't have friends with the interest to put in the effort, and assume others would be in the same boat.Achievements are a small factor in games, but can add a fun moment or extra challenge. Achievgements here are just win a large amount of games. Which is impossible without hours of planning and grinding. There are no unique, funny, or furfilling skill based achievements.I got this game out of a bundle with a bunch of game I did want, and if servers were still working/ easily accessible it would have been a treat. The bottom line is there are dozens of shooters that have working servers to get similiar gameplay (although maybe without such a fun and unique theme.)I rate the game 6/10. It's nothing spectacular, but it's serviceable in fun. But being dead, comparatively difficult when compared to other games to get a single game going; I can't reccomend it. If someone knows a shooter with a similiar theme, aesthetic, or mechanic where you're whole character changes based on the weapon I'd love to try it out."

,Recommended,321260,15567735,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,c5,"Wickland is an awesome medieval spin on the classic arena FPS formula established by Quake and Unreal. The key spin that this game has on the formula is that instead of picking up weapons, you pick up entire characters that you can switch back and forth between, each having their own weapon. While that may sound confusing, it works extremely well and anyone used to Quake or Unreal Tournament will have no problems at all getting used to Wickland. Each weapon has an alt-fire and they mostly feel pretty unique (although there are a couple takes on old classics), giving Wickland it's own pace and feel. The map design is gorgeous and makes good use of the unreal engine and the controls (especially aiming) are rock solid, which is crucial for a fast paced, skill-based FPS. The playerbase isn't huge, but there are enough people playing to have a good time, and if the amount of people playing ever does dwindle too low, the game is cheap enough that you can get copies for your friends and play it amongst yourselves. The only downside is that you can't host your own servers, which unfortunately seems like it isn't in the cards right now due to the resources available to the developers, but I've had no problems with lag or anything like that (I'm from the US and had no issues playing on an EU server). Right now the game is on sale for 99 cents, which I would say is a steal for such a nicely constructed package."

The weapons feel like quake and unreal and a ♥♥♥♥ed up child, and its great. This is going to be replacing CS:GO for me, assuming more people play it.EDIT: There is a major flaw to this game: There is no 'real' P2P multiplayer (Player 2 Player). This means don't expect to have the freedom of creating a server to play with your friends. The game is entirely locked to a few servers. The reason for this is that the devs can't be bothered to add a few settings for servers, so instead of having to connect to one server for everything (duels, warmup, lobby), they could do something that many other games do, which is have all as a seperate setting. For example, what could be done is add duels as a in-menu thing, and then the duel can be hosted between the two players, rather than having both players connect to the same server. Then likewise, they can add a simple server file that only needs to start 1 instance of the server, and not 10 (or so the dev says 10.), which allows players to find and start p2p 16 player FFA matches easier.I changed my recommendation to a negative for this very reason. I feel that is a game is entirely multiplayer, this should be the very first thing that gets done. Now, I have posted threads on the forums in an attempt to see if the devs would  change from this console-like method, but they seem adamant to keep their decision claiming UDK3 dosen't allow it (Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I've used UDK3 before and it does). The dev then goes to claim that in order for them to do this, they would need a commerical license, which is also not true. Adding on to this, don't expect to be able to find any multiplayer server  with a good ping, since the ones that are hosted always, are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The lack of players is for these reasons, and without players the game can't be played.

I have nothing against fast paced gameplay, but lightspeed is a wee bit much. The monsters/weapons lack a feeling of any real power, and the health system is a bit confusing. It leads to longer lasting battles, as well as crazy fast chases around the map potentially using up all the ammo of several weapons just to get a kill.Also, the bots are rubbish. I saw a dev post saying they considered their bots between ""Hardcore"" and ""Nightmare"" on Quake III Arena's scale, but I feel that's quite an overstatement. How could multiple bots at that difficulty level pose almost no challenge for me, but worse still, ALL get negative scores?! Oh please let that just be a glitch, cause that's just embarrassing. =sI want to enjoy this game, I really do. I LOVE arena shooters. But Wickland just doesn't satisfy my itch for arena combat like Q3A or Unreal Tournament do."

Only buy if you want to play with BOTS!!! I repeat MP is no more.An interesting take on the arena style shooter, runs well on low end systems to boot. Its main issue is that even a well made 90s arena shooter like 'Wickland' can't pull gamers away and hold them. Especially gamers that would naturally gravitate towards 'Quake live' or  unreal tournament, next to these the content just isn't there nor the playerbase. I'm unaware of any new low but healthy playerbase arena shooter on steam except 'Reflex' maybe? Granted apart from dabbling a little now and again in the genre, it's clearly something I don't play alot off. Playerbases also in Arena shooters especially low playerbases aren't the easiest on new comers. Good twitch reflexes and god like aiming, from the demigods within the population can alienate most of us motals. Anyway back to Wickland.What I am glad to see is that Bots are included, its what most MP games should be including! If you are buying Wickland I recommend you pick up a few copies and gift them. Great fun to be had against friends, which should last, as long as a classic 90s style arena shooter holds interest to you or your friends. To boot it is on sale a good few times at a heavy discount. It scrapes a recommend from me, its back to a simpler time before complex FPS took over. Just remember there is next to no playerbase.A cautionary 90% off recommend."
