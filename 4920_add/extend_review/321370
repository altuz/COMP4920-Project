It feels like it is still in early access, and can use some work, but theres a lot of potential. As a full game though as it is right now, I would not recommend it.The controls seem slightly delayed, and are sloppy. Jumping is a huge issue, as well as running.You tap slightly to make your character move and NOT fall off, and your charater doesnt move. So you hold down for slightly longer, and your character goes flying off the sign.I've died so many times because I hit spacebar to jump and because of the delay, the character doesnt jump, just runs straight off the sign. It is very frusturating and unrewarding. You have no control over your jump, once you jump your charatcter will jump at whatever speed you were running at, and you have no control of the jump while in the air. So quite often you'll jump from a sign right into the abyss.The idea of the game in general is very creative, but as a platformer, there are much more polished games out there you can get for a cheaper price.The controls are just so sloppy that it ruins the game for me. I'd recommend this game once the controls are fixed."

I reviewed this game a while ago, and gave it a negative review – based on its original controls, which made the game unplayable for me. A few days ago, the developer Midnart contacted me, informing me that the game has been patched, including the controls. So I gave it a second chance – and I am glad I did. The game is now controlled smoothly and after beating it (which took me, I do not know, 2 – 3 hours maybe? ) I can see its other positives:- Good atmosphere – from tense moments like running from poisonous gas, through adrenaline riding moments to overall melancholic feeling of the game (loved the end – no one left behind :) )- Fine music fitting the game- Clever puzzles – some of the puzzles seemed frustrating at first, but once you realize the principle of solving them, you will feel a sense of accomplishment (at least I did) – the puzzles are based mostly on perceiving the physics of the environment and interaction with it- Stylish graphics – although minimalistic (based on sign infographics), they serve their purpose and benefit the gameThe game is basically one continuous trip (not classic levels) with checkpoints on the way. The one negative that comes to mind is its length. On the other hand, if you want to spend an evening or two with something interactive (rather than watching stupid movies), Sign Motion is a good alternative."

If you want quirky indie platforming/puzzle solving, go play braid or limbo, not this.Keep away."

[deaf],"Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 10/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 10/10Overall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).General GameplaySign Motion is an extremely creative 2D scrolling puzzle/challenge game that begins when events throw your character's sign out of its normal existence.You play as a stick figure, either male or female (changed in settings), that traverses across of signs from throughout the world.  The signs in the game provide clues as to what puzzles or challenges you will face, ranging from sliding cars to falling rocks, explosive crates, and poisonous gas that chases through through a large portion of the game.Your progress is saved after each major puzzle or challenge and, if you 'die,' you restart at the most recent save point, ready to begin the challenge again.Although the game is not overly hard, it provides a hint system for the slightly more complex challenges that explains in three individually revealed images how to pass the challenge.There are a few visual treats in the game as you go along, including indicators for how much is left to travel before you finish by way of US destination milage signs.Sign Motion is ultimately a game on level with mobile or console gaming that was ported to PC.ReplayabilityAll in all, Sign Motion is a really cute, creative, fun game that will entertain you for a few plays.  Realistically, you could get 2-3 fun iterations of this game before you've successfully completed all of the challenges without issue.General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsOptions are limited in the game, which is a design for both console and PC games.For HoH gamers, you can choose volume between master volume controls, game sounds, and game music, allowing you to tune according to what is best for you.As a side note for mobility challenged gamers, this game uses either A and D or left and right arrows to move forward and backward, left control to push/pull objects, and space to jump.  These keys cannot be changed.Subtitles & CaptionsThis game can be complete and enjoyed entirely without sound, so no captions are needed or provided.Chatting/CommunicatingThis is a single player game; no chatting.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf"
76561198059876777,Recommended,321370,21612526,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,Satans Little Helper,Sign Motion Is a great little puzzle platformer that in my view deserves more credit than what it has gotten in the overall reviews. Sure the handling is somewhat frustrating from time to time but the overall experience is still really great and the design of the game is pretty remarkable with an otherwise dead world of signs and figures comming alive. The soundtrack of this game is also really great and fitted the game very well. The game is rather short and its fairly easy for the most of the parts. I will rate this game 8/10

I typically like games like World of Goo, Diner Dash, and other casual games but when I saw the preview, I was intrigued.  It was the most unique game I'd seen.So I played it and like many people, got frustrated.  A lot.  But then, I'd figure out the puzzle and what I needed to do and had a great feeling of achievement.  This is a game where you have to think and it feels good to exercise those mental muscles!  I'm enjoying playing it."

It is a very interesting platformer game in which I am always wondering what the next sign or obstacle will do.  This is an awesome game with lots of updates that get rid of most of the bugs.
,Recommended,321370,12693412,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,Le_Scoops,"With the recent update the developer added more responsive controls to the game. This made me appreciate the game a lot more and have a lot more fun. There's still some issues with trial and error design that will just straight up kill you the first time no matter what. It's worth it now, in my opinion!"

There are so many signs out there and so many funny things we've all thought of (bacon comes to mind immediately), I think some optional paths and a play on those ideas would have made it a great game. That being said, with it's linear design and somewhat sluggish controls, I think it's still worth playing, but I'd wait until it hits a 75% off sale."

The game has a certain ""Limbo"" vibe to it: Silhouette main character, simplistic controls (left, right, jump, push/pull), environment puzzles and many, many deaths. It never gets overly frustrating because, except for a few sequences, checkpoints are never far apart.Cons: The controls could be a bit tighter, and the game is pretty short for the full prize (2 to 3 hours playtime, including all achievements)."
76561198287322197,Recommended,321370,21570483,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,crescendo2020,"This game is odd in the way that it could have been so good. The music, atmosphere, and ideas surrounding the plot are great. The controls and level design fall short.  It's a 3-hour long platformer that will frustrate you when your inputs are ignored. You cannot adjust the game volume (there's an option, but as soon as you exit it re-adjusts back to the default setting: blow your speakers). The puzzles are very easy to figure out, but sometimes difficult to do because of shoddy controls, or time-limits. Both of which are a platforming no-no in my world. It feels awkward to control at times, funky things happen that (I'm assuming) shouldn't, like getting stuck on corners of platforms instead of landing on top of them or climbing them which the controls call for. For the 75% off price I bought it at, it's worth it; about two bucks. At the full price, it's not worth it. I urge this programmer to make a sequel and focus on controls and level design, because this idea really could be amazing."

,Not Recommended,321370,21708737,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,The Nacho Man,It's a unique idea with some decent ideas but the controls are shocking and the puzzle design falls apart once you encounter the gas leaks. In a puzzle-platformer you have to expect decent controls and good puzzle design & the sluggish and nonresponsive controls just makes the poor puzzle design stick out that much more.
,Not Recommended,321370,12616105,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,Derakor,"The idea is excellent but the attempt at trying to implement real world physics to the characters animation and movement, resorts in very poor control response. Shame really this could have been a great game but with the rather inadequate feel of the characters con trol can't give it more than a 5/10."

,Not Recommended,321370,22621512,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Chironaila,"Would like to give this a positive review because it started out really fun, but it turned into the most annoying thing. I like the simple graphics and overall look of the game, it's just what it needs to look like, signs. The timelimits on the puzzles killed the little satisfaction I got after finally beating the umbrella course. Would appreciate a walkthrough because right now I can't seem to figure out what to do before the poison cloud kills me. (All I can do is get a suitcase stuck between two signs.) It doesn't always read that I want to jump so I ran into death too many times, and sometimes I just get stuck on boxes/signs. I hear rumors of a Sign Motion 2 so I hope that one fixes the few but annoying faults of this one."
