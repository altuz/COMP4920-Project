No game has given me more pleasure in competing and compelled me to become the best player I can be for my team. I don't think there is another game with the same emphasis on team-play that Supraball has. It's like soccer mixed with hockey but with guns that can shoot the ball really fast with different spins/curves. The graphics may be a turn off for some individuals but I hope that people can look past the cartoon look as there is more to gameplay than just graphics. There are still a few bugs but that is why this is only the early access release and not the final release. I look forward to meeting the newer players and hopefully together we can make this game a competitive e-sport.I urge any new players to watch the tutorial videos or complete most of the in game tutorial. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple, but you can manipulate these mechanics in ways you won't believe at first.* For a starter tip make sure you get familiar with how lock passes work and how your movement affects the route of the ball as it travels toward you.EditThis game has really been struggling with its player base so keep that in mind when you are going to purchase this game (especially if your NA).Edit #2: The game is now Free2Play so jump on in and enjoy! Hopefully more players will come because of Free2Play."

I'd recommend this for anyone who is willing to take steps to be a team player and enjoy the game for love of the art of a genre that needs more exploration.It's inspired many and deserves its due.It's free to play now, you can enjoy everything about the game without paying a cent. If you enjoy it. Get a key set yourself apart from the pack.Enjoy mates good times ahead!"

But with the time I spend on it I could see how the game is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That are just MY thoughts you can always try this yourself for me this is just a decent game ."
,Not Recommended,321400,22791900,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Mazzer,I do not recommend this game at all in the current state.Pros- Fun game to play with friends- The game idea has potential but the developers seem clueless- Dedicated servers (for now)Cons- Very very few players and none in Australia even during peak time- The game seems exactly the same as beta 18 months ago- It's unlikely they will improve the game during EA- The server list is still outside of the game- The UI has been reskinned and the arenas graphically updated (only changes in 18 months)- Game is unplayable with lag due to teleporting- Overpriced which will deter players and without players a mp game is dead
,Recommended,321400,33389514,Posted: 8 July,all,Azure,"This game has insane potential for competitive and esport gameplay. If you buy the game now, you will see empty servers and likely will be stuck playing against and with bots. It is widely understood that the game will be going free to play within the next month, so if you are interested in playing Supraball I suggest you wait until then.People who want to play the game (despite having to put in extra effort to find a community to play with in the game's current low population state) are the people who should be purchasing the game now.Supraball is a solid competitive experience, those who are giving the game negative reviews right now do not understand that the developers are not ready to support a big playerbase. They buy the game expecting a finished product, when in reality they are buying a copy of a game that is not intended to be played by the masses. When the developers have decided that the game is ready, Supraball will go free to play and those who focus on the game's low population as a reason to leave a negative review will be welcome."

Wait for it to leave early access before considering a purchase, as even the devs advise this decision at this point. This is a recommendation against buying, not nessesarily a negative review against the game itself, as the mechanics and nuances of gamplay are tuned to perfection, even when compared to a fully released game, there's just nobody to play with whatsoever. Will update the review when the game leaves early access and as it is given more content."

It's easy to learn but very hard to master, in fact, no one has even come close to mastering it yet. But don't let that scare you, after training and just playing around with friends for a little bit, when you become a little more adapted and better at the game, you will get addicted, it is a ton of fun. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who's interested, you should all give it a try, it's wonderful.tldr: good game, buy it"
,Recommended,321400,23711210,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,nickdec97,"Everything about this game is new and exciting, this is newest inventive sport game that has grabbed my attention next to Rocket League. It takes time to learn and master the game, and having little to no player base right now leaves very few chances to actually grasp the concept and understand it, but all it takes is one steam sale to grow the player base and make this game super fun again. Although i have only played two hours on steam, I played it back before it was on greenlight with friends, and it felt so good to finally pay for it on relive it.The community is simply just old Deathball (original game before supraball) players that have been playing since the games conception and instabought it when it became available on steam. Asking them for help in game is your best shot at learning to be honest, and most of them will be willing to help you. They love this game and want it to be as great and busy as it used to be, so crushing noobs that don't know any better won't help when they are on your team later.The community is small right now, but will fill up. The developers know this issue and really want it to fill up. They are very transperant in all of their announcements and have all players (especially new ones) in mind. They have recently updated a bunch of tutorials for the true beginners, and then the community is always nice in game and will help you.This is a great game, well worth the $20 once the community fills up and sales start happening. It pains me to see such bad reviews because few people have bought it yet. It is a good game, its unfortunate the player base is still small but will surely pick up. It is fun when there are people to play with, and I have yet to run into anyone that is rude or mean. Just alot of old wise Supraball players that have been playing before it was even named Supraball.Basically, Yes the community is small and hard to find matches, but this is the beginning of something bigger. When the community picks up so will this game, but i still highly recommend it."

76561198004532205,Recommended,321400,22830138,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Kisszup`,"Wall of text! \o/One of the few games I happily spent some money on. However I don't really recommend doing the same thing for new players. But let me explain.I have no clue when did I get hooked into the game. Probably I saw someone streaming the game and decided to try it out. It was free to download, it was in alpha and it was quite fun. A few skilled players taught me the most important moves and tricks and I slowly figured out how these things work. And then I got a Closed beta key for free and after that, we're here.I knew what awaited me when I bought the game. No risk for me (aside from the usual ""it's a dead game *hurr durr* waste of money""). I enjoy it because I know what I am, and other players are capable of. As a new player it's risky because you'll either like it or not. A free weekend or a lowered price definitely needed for ""the casual"" players to try this out.And yes, the price. It's quite high for a game that ""lacks content"". True! But the developers will add more and more and it will be more diverse, especially if we'll have a bigger community to play with. I bet they're not going to stop right here, when they're halfway through the marathon.The development also seem a bit slow. Maybe they'll release everything at once, and that's why it takes so long? I don't know. However I'm not a programmer, I don't know how hard it is to create a game and new contents so I'm not judging.The early access misses some really needed content, like tutorials. Of course, there's an online ""How to play"" article which can be found on the official website but who reads that. It would be a really good idea to read it, though... :D You might not know what those things are but after you try those in-game, I'm sure you will figure it out. If not, and you need some advice, most of the skilled players are there to help. We currently have a small playerbase and we surely don't want to lose it because of some confusing game elements.But the core of the game has been layed down for a while now. It's lovely, it's simple and yet so fun if you get a hang of it. Of course you are going to get a bit frustrated if you get knocked out like 10 times in a match because you weren't fast enough with the ball, but as you progress these frustrations will be gone and you start enjoying the game (like I did). You start feeling that you can do better, whatever happened can be done in a different (and better) way even if it was your fault. You'll watch out for it next time. And who knows, maybe you'll score that winning goal or you save a last second shot in a tight match. ^_^Even though there's a few cons about this game and can be considered risky, I definitely recommend this game if you like what you see.EDIT: Fixed some grammar mistakes ( I hope xD ). Thanks for the heads up. o/"

Like Rocket League, the first hours you have fun failing over and over again and then go crazy when you finally start to score goals. Once you get experience and want to play in a more competitive way, this game offers you loads tricks to break the enemy team and score, the limit on these tricks is your imagination.Although the game is sick, the main problem has always been the players. We're always running out of players to play whenever you want, either for beginners or for more experienced players. Due to this problem, new players tend to join the lobbies where the old players are, and some of them (like in every other game) refuses to play with them, therefore they end quitting the game, which makes it impossible for the game to succeed.However, some of the old players try to help the beginners to keep playing the game, but it is not enough, we need a huge increment of players so everyone will be able to enjoy the game."

It rewards fast paced teamoriented plays. It reminds me a little of Valves majorly underappriciated game Ricochet where movement and precision are key to a high level play. This can be frustrating for new players as the introduction and succes are depending on utilisation of creative and advance mechanics.The visuals are simple yet pleasing and that results in a low hardware demand. A PC as strong as a PS4 should run it on medium settings.Pros:-Simple yet pleasing visuals-Solid game mechanics-Teamwork decides victory-Rewarding and broad learning curve-addictive for fooball/soccer lovers-Not demanding towards HardwareCons:-Not intuitive configuration of controls (new players should configure during practice alone [May.2016] as the launcher is still buggy)-Sound Options are lacking-Minor bugs in the launcher-Launcher still needs a major overhaul-Price and content not matching

It looked really simple because of the way they played it so I decided to pick it up. This game is one of the most skill capped things and it is absolutely fantastic. The only problems I see with it right now are the amount of players and the Dev support. This game is starting to host tournaments every month which is great. I think it's a really good idea, but there are a lot of downsides too. The amount of players for NA is very small. Sometimes there are around 15 people, and other times there are only 2 or 3. The new player experience is basically someone joins the game with friends and starts to play, then they will quickly find out that it's not as simple as you think. Then a little bit of time goes by and they start to go against other players and learn that there are people that have over 4000 hours in this game and will absolutely crap on new people. The pub stomping in this is just a bit too much to handle sometimes. If you actually read to the end of this review then I thank you. I do recommend this game.

Instead I strive to be better, so that I can be the spanker someday. Obviously there are veterans on here that have played much longer than most people, so expect to get tag teamed by gorillas every now and then until you hone your skills in a practice server. Don't be salty about losing, because you will adapt overtime and become a more adept player. You have to work as a team, and you have to have fast reflexes. The movement is like that of Unreal Tournament, so 12 year olds be damned. You can strafe dash left and right, and you can quad jump in the air, which is incredibly useful in avoiding a nice kick to the face. You can put a backspin, front spin, or a side spin on the ball, which confuses even the most hardened gods sometimes. Passing is easy too, but it's also very easy to intercept as well, so git gud. All in all, it's a great game with some relation to Rocket League, but don't call it a Rocket League rip off, because this came out before it. See you on the field fam."

These are just a few descriptors that I feel accurately represent the state of Supraball.When buying a new game, I am often curious as to what creative energy went into bringing it to fruition. Supraball is a downgrade from the original mod in terms of art direction. This being the case primarily because Deathball used UT2K4 assets. Deathball had hundreds of user-created maps, a plethora of player models, replays, pausing, and in-game ready system, a more sophisticated kickoff system, better in-game stat tracking, and more gameplay variety. A UT2K4 mod, that had been in development for two years, had far more going on for it feature-wise than a standalone game that has, according to the dev team, been “in the works” for four years. Being a programmer, I understand the challenges behind creating something like this. However, the dev team chose to price the game at $20. Rocket League also costs $20. Rocket League is far ahead of Supraball in almost every area one could think of, and the dev team has invited this comparison via their pricing decision.Gameplay-wise, Supraball is nearly the perfect type of game for me. That I cannot recommend it to most gamers should be a red flag. If you put in the time, a high-level game of Supraball can be more interesting and enjoyable than perhaps any other game I’ve played. It’s that you have to look past the poor art direction, underdeveloped visuals, missing features, nonsensical rank and lobby system, and the very steep learning curve (assuming you want to play in the higher-level games, which is where Supraball becomes far more interesting). In the hands of the right dev team, this type of game could be very successful, as you’ve seen with something like Rocket League. The Rocket League dev team listens to their community, has been a lot of creative energy into their game, and seems to generally “get it”. I cannot say the same for Supraball’s dev team. If you’re looking for something similar to Rocket League in concept, that gives you more control over what’s going on, and has, in my opinion, superior overall gameplay, buy Supraball. Just know that there are several glaring things that you must overlook, and I don’t feel that the vast majority of players are willing to or should have to. If you’re buying this game based on an expectation that it will continue to evolve, don’t. If the game were priced under $10 USD, I feel it would be easier for me to recommend. At $20… No."

,Not Recommended,321400,34692203,Posted: 2 September,all,DRFTGRPS 大陰茎,"So I paid money for this game when the devs got greedy. Issues needed to be fixed and playerbase was slowly dwindling down. Instead of issues being fixed to improve the game and regain playerbase, they make it free to play and add cosmetics? After I have already paid money for it?***What's happening is this developer is trying to tap into / create a cosmetic market after seeing the success of such markets such as CSGO, PUBG, Dota 2, H1Z1 etc.***AVOID THIS HUNGRY HUNGRY DEVELOPER AT ALL COSTS***"
