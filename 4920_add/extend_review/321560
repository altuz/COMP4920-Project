If the dev reads this, just want to make you know that you're a god at designing levels *clap*. Many devs should play and learn from this game.I really think this game deserves way more love. I totally recommend it to everyone who likes platform/time trial challenges. If you enjoyed games like ""10 second ninja"", ""Super Meat boy"" or ""Dustforce"" just buy this one, you won't regret it.Overrall grade: 8.5/10"

Gets to the point where the game feels like it's running out of steam and either has to add stupid levels or levels that are the same as older levels but more precise in the inputs. Eventually the game feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again and becomes a tedious grind to progress.There are some very good things about the game. Some of the levels have interesting designs. The main gimmick is unique and works well, and the overall look of the game is very nice. Honestly, if the game were limited to 100 levels, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more but as it is now it's just too much of the same style of level over and over again."

If you're looking for a nice puzzling game to get, get this game! The only thing I think it needs is a level editor though. That would be a nice edition.The music is great, even though it only has two songs (trailer and ingame)."
,Recommended,321560,12976306,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,Virizian,"Pros:- Simple yet striking visuals. It uses sharp contrasts and certain color schemes to create a very unique aesthetic. This is minimalism at its finest- Main gameplay mechanic involves shifting into the floor and building momentum (the floor naturally accelerates you upwards when you shift into it). Very simple, but it's very fun to ramp up speed and try to hit the little dots.- Solid level design and a good amount of content: There's quite a few levels (~160), and they vary in interesting ways. Most of them revolve around the main gameplay mechanic of shifting and speeding at the right moment.- Challenging yet not overly difficult. There are some frustrating levels, but for the most part it stays reasonable. If you wanna really push yourself though, there be medals. Those are much tougher to get, and it can be fun yet frustrating trying to shave seconds off your timeCons:- The soundtrack is minimal, and this is less fun. It is a very simple track that repeats and sometimes changes around as far as I can tell. It doesn't get annoying, but it lacks variety.- There's not much to the game beyond the challenge of shifting through the ground and collecting the little dots. It's a pretty simple game."

Smooth controls, unique gameplay and tight visuals ensure you'll have a great time with THE SUN AND MOON. A perfect game in my opinion. It's even better than SUPER MEAT BOY. Go get it."

It's a great game with a bunch of levels, I haven't beaten them all yet. This is a game you can come back to every once in a while when you're bored or want to kill some time.Challenging and fun"

The art style and music are very chill and have very good chemistry together.  The controls are tight and very nice.  Great game. Also, you should definitely check out the developer, Daniel Linssen, because he has made many cool, short, creative, good games.  His art style is awesome. 8.5/10"
,Recommended,321560,27490607,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,BaalsDepe,"I find this game really appealing everytime I play it. The music is very good. The visual design is striking, but a little exhausting after an hour or so of playing. The concept is pretty cool as well. I'm not sure what to say about the difficulty, though... it's a very difficult game that requires precise timing. You can get to ~ level 50 without much effort, but around 80 things get really beefy and I wonder if I can even continue using my wireless controller to advance becuase of the lag.Still loving it even though I've lost my save game a couple times :)"

,Recommended,321560,17116574,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Cyril,"So. This game. Is... I would put it in the ""meh"" category if Steam had that one, so this is a very light recommendation, but I think its main mechanic is interesting enough and it does enough with it to justify a recommendation, I did have a good bit of fun with this game after all.That being said, I kinda wish this was a shorter $5 game. Instead of the 160 levels, give us 80 of them, pick out the better ones and give a more consistently enjoyable experience. This game really feels stretched out for content, in the end. There are some levels that toy with a few extra mechanics (time shifting blocks, blocks that pop in and out of existence when you hold the shift button, a few autoscroller-type things, basic stuff mostly) but the majority of the game is confined to making use of the main mechanic in a static environment. And there's only so much that can be done with that, I felt the game getting repetitive pretty early on and it didn't get more varied down the road.There's also an uneven difficulty curve, I feel. Outside of the bonus world, I didn't find myself challenged too much by any particular world... but each world had a few levels way harder than anything around it. A lot of the boss levels also felt a bit unfair, having to pray that the boss would end up in around the same spot every time so that you could learn the level and complete it, and the final boss especially felt too long. There's a fair few levels requiring precision beyond what the game gives you, too. I feel like focusing on really precise movements in a physics-heavy game may not have been the best of ideas. But that's just me.The main mechanic of the game is pretty interesting though and makes for some enjoyable platforming challenges. There's some levels about getting enough height via flying through blocks, other levels about trying to get down below via gravity and clever use of the main mechanic, and some just straight-up platformy levels. The extra mechanics occasionally thrown in also make things a bit more interesting; there's a few levels where you basically fly using the user-controlled blocks, and the boss of the 8th world has this very clever proximity thing going on, I really enjoyed that one especially. There's also plenty of replay value here; every level has three time challenges to meet. Personally I couldn't be bothered to even go for time challenges most of the time, ending up with very few sun medals and only a few dozen of the full-moon medals, though usually the half-moon medals aren't too hard to get. I spent around 7-8 hours just playing through all the levels once, so there's no shortage of content here, certainly, though honestly I would have preferred a bit less in the end xDOverall it's a solid precision platformer, definitely unlike any other game I've played, but I feel the focus should've been on making a more compact and enjoyable experience rather than just throwing every level the developer made into the game and calling it done. I think it would've made this ""okay"" a pretty ""great"" one if there was a bit more polish to it."
,Not Recommended,321560,15209785,"Posted: 4 April, 2015",all,Zincoshine,"Well now, this game is considerably more shallow than I thought it would be. I thought it would be something like ""the floor is jelly but I was wrong. It's just a simple puzzle game that goes from level to level. there is no story to it even. The music is atrocious so you can forget about immersion. This would be fine at 5 dollars, but the base price is 10 dollars. I bought this for 6 dollars and I feel cheated considering that I've bought much deeper and richer games for that price and even cheaper than 6 dollars. In the end I have to ask myself, would I tell my friends about this game? the answer is no, so I can't recommend this.Edit: I've also remembered that similar games of this level can be found for free, I remember playing one such game 4 years ago, something about the goal being to die by being struck by lighting, I forgot the name of the game. yeah, I totally cannot recommend this, go find similar free games on newgrounds, like n game"

Some levels are puzzles where you need to use your brain to figure out how to proceed. Other levels are crazy difficult precision challenges requiring perfect timing and dexterity. Most levels are a mix of the two. All levels give a great sense of accomplishment when you beat them.Extra points for this game's soundtrack and sound mixing. The soothing music helps make the otherwise frustrating levels into a relaxing experience. The sound mixing is so smooth, I can't tell when one track ends and an other begins."

Very simple pick up and play presentation makes it fun in short bursts, but trying to get the best time on each level provides a lot of depth and makes you really appreciate the mechanics and design even more."

If you love puzzles, this game will eat hours of your time as your unlock new groups of puzzles, each with thier own unique visual themes and, to some extent, unique challenges. But even among the puzzles that share a theme, no two are alike. And all the while the soundtrack expands, always being familiar, but not feeling repetative. Figuring out how to beat any one puzzle is the first challenge. Beating it in a shorter and shorter amount of time...? How well do you understand... gravity?"
