76561197987070734,Not Recommended,321600,12124761,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Grove of Dreams,"Short version: poorly constructed game, frustrating, not enjoyable.Long version:1.  Images are extremely poor quality, and some of the ""lost objects"" appear to just be clip art or stock photos taken as a whole (i.e. a polar bear standing on an iceberg, when the object is just ""Polar Bear"").  Many images are warped or so faded as to be virtually indistinguishable from the background, made worse by the low resolution / clarity of the entire game.2.  Moderately poor English grammar / usage / spelling.  Everything from subject / verb agreements, to misspellings (""gorgoile"" -> gargoyle), to typos (""Bulp"" -> Bulb), to flat-out misidentifications ( glass of beer = ""juice"", swan = ""duck"").3.  The ""story"" is almost entirely inconsequential, told in poor English, and generally not at all consistent with the legend of the  Flying Dutchman.4.  Though advertised as something that will ""keep you searching for weeks"", I completed the entire game in 65 minutes, much of which was spent trying to figure out why grasshopper = ""flute"", or why the ""jellyfish"" looks like watermelon, etc.5.  From what I saw, there is absolutely no ""randomization"", nor are there ""hundreds of objects"", nor are there ""dozens of locations"".  I saw seven locations:  cave, island, boat, house, ""hotel"", pier, ship (end).  Each time the objects may or may not be loaded... but they were *always* in the same place.  Once you were able to locate an item, you'd never have to search for it again.6.  Interface was clunky ... upon finding an image, you had to wait several seconds just for the game to realize you'd done so ... move the object to your satchel ... then open the screen up for clicking again.  Clicking more than 2-3 times in rapid succession would greatly advance your timer (even if you were clicking on the correct object, but before the last one had made it to your satchel).7.  Obviously a ""bargain bin"" title at ~$5 USD ... but you'd probably be better served by getting a cheeseburger & fries (or literally any other $5 object)."

I'm not even sure why I played it to the end.Pros:- The TitleCons:- The title is misleading. This game has nothing to do with the Flying Dutchman.- Graphics are blurry and some items can't be seen at all. You WILL be using the hint button.- Quite a few items are misspelled and some aren't even accurate. You WILL be using the hint button.- The hint button takes forever to recharge.- Music in no way reflects the pirate theme. But if you like Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies...- They ask for the same items over and over so after a bit, there's no challenge at all.- Game is extremely short. Actually, this could be considered a pro.Please don't spend your money on this game. It's one of the worst things I've played."

Some of the objects are extremely difficult to find as the resolution is very low and colors and graphics blends into each other, ot it's placed right at the edge of the visible screen, with only a few pixels showing.Not to mention the objects themselves and how they are named, like asking for a ""Duck"" and the correct object is a swan."

Sadly, it's probably the worst of the genre I've played.There are only about 6 locations and you have to find the same objects over and over again in each one. This is easier said than done because all the objects are so blurry and the resolution of the scene is so low that you are basically clicking on smudges and hoping that is what they want.This has nothing to do with the typos or bad translation or whatever is going on. The game tells you to click on a ""duck"" when it really means ""swan"". It wants a ""beer"" when it asks for ""juice"". And what is a ""bulp""? A light bulb, obviously.It's also incredibly short; I finished in about an hour.I'd advise against this one, no matter how cheap it goes."

( or ducks I can't actually tell the difference).  I love how this developer catered specifically to my needs!  However I can tell the difference between a flute and a mayan statue, so 0/10."

I read all the negative reviews, but ignored them.This is probably the worst Hidden Object game I have played to date, and I have played quite a few.  The graphics are so blurry, it is almost impossible to find what you are looking for.  Even when I have used hints, it is impossible to see some of the objects, and that is when I actually gave up the game.It seems the designers of this very lousy game did not even know the name of the items they put in the game.  I was supposed to find a duck somewhere, and then when I finally turned to the hint-button, it marked the SWAN!  Ok, ""The ugly duckling"", I know about that, but I highly doubt that was the intention here.Avoid this game, it is not even worth the trouble of downloading it for free.  Just stay away.  Move along, nothing to see here!"

,Not Recommended,321600,13491929,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,Nebu,"I could forgive the spelling mistakes, since it seems like English is not the game developers' native language. However, the game suffers from several flaws that make this (thankfully short) experience pretty painful. For a ""hidden object"" game, the picture quality is atrocious, as if the game assets were saved as low-quality jpegs. Some of the objects you're asked to find are ambigous, such as being asked to find a ""bird"", but only one of the four birds on the scene will actually count. Other times, the objects are completely mislabelled, like being asked to find a ""duck"" when they mean ""swan"", or being asked to find a ""flute"" when they really mean ""grasshopper"".There's only really 6 scenes in total in this game, but the game forces you to replay the scenes over and over as a form of padding, I guess in an attempt to stretch out the game. It doesn't work: Once you've found the pelican the first time around, it's really not that hard to find the same pelican at the same exact location the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time you're asked to replay that scene.I bought the game at 50 cents, and I'd say it was just barely worth it for the laughs, in the ""so bad it's good"" sense."

First of all, there are FREE spellcheckers online, USE THEM. Second, there is a HUGE difference between a duck and a ♥♥♥♥ing swan. It shouldn't be too hard to find out which is which. You guys failed on this one, shame on you for releasing a game on this magnitude of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Even if you use hint, the item is not there.  So you have to start the search over.  Beyond aggravating!  A minor annoyance is mispelled search items.  Don't spend your nickels and dimes on this one."

A glass of beer is juice. Well, I suppose they're both light colored liquids in a glass? That grey blob over there that you can't even make out enough to tell what is is probably the whatever thing you were looking for that you just can't seem to find, but you may never know since the timer you can barely see ran out while you were looking for it. Can't believe I wasted money on this one, it was so bad. And short. And the story, what story?...In conclusiong, really, I'm telling you, don't read these reviews and get it anyway just to see for yourself how bad it is like I did, after all no game could possibly be THAT bad, right? Well, this one really is that bad. It really, really is. It's just not worth it, not even at 90% off."
