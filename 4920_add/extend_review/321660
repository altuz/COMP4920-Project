Nothing more, seems like the reviews that talk about deep business simulation are bought. It is not. After 2 hours at the lastest you will be bored. Needs more vehicles, machines and buildings, especially during later stages of a game. Not worth the GBP 16.00, if you really want it, wait til its on sale for a fiver."

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this as a simulator of mining or, if you don't care about mining, a simulator of business. The list of problems is too long to list, but any first year economist could tell you there are a myriad things ridiculously broken in the business model."

They make it seem like there is so much more to this game but really it is just a glorified econ game that could have easily been released as a free browser game and is about as cheap and low quality as a free browser game. Very little to do but point and click and mindlessly watch the same few backdrops...you really have no control over anything but the purchasing of equipment and selling of commodities. Oh yeah, there are only two things you can mine in this game...Iron and Gravel.Don't waste your time or money like I did."

You don't drive anything, you dont actually do anything.  I wish I could get mt money back.  Totally not worth the money spent."

If you like those type of games, this one is going to be for you and I recommend it.  If you are quickly bored, not interested in economic simulations, or think you are going to be driving mining equipment around don't purchase this game."

According to My Own Rating.I've had fun playing the game, but in order to do so, I've had to accept two facts. First, the video and screenshots are misleading, everything you see in 3d is part of an animated background that doesn't seem to be affected by anything you do. Then there's the fact that either the positive reviews have been paid for or I should go become a billionaire irl. I just find it hard to believe that mining industry is that simple and easy to run.Once you accept that it's an extremely superficial/simplified business simulator with an animated background view, it's rather easy to have fun if you like business simulators.That should be enough to clarify what the game is not: It's not a machine simulator, and it isn't a deep business simulator (in fact, it's even hard to say it's a good one).I've stumbled upon a few bugs (such as the PANIC message when trying to load a save file after completing or losing a game), but nothing that would make the game unplayable. Also, the free game settings seems to have been poorly designed leading to impossible scenarios, like when you try ""hard"" for all options and start the game with a production so low that you're losing money unless the price is really high and you don't start with enough cash to increase production or even survive a couple months until the market price rises.Other than that, I was expecting a very crappy and unfinished simulator, and it's just a superficial one, therefore, it's much  better than I expected.Don't expect much out of this game and you can have fun for many hours. Totally worth buying on a 75% off or better sale."

But some of the game balance is so hilariously off that its hard to play it very much. Contracts give you far less money than the open market? PR tanks and takes 6+ months to build, impossible to keep up with. Played a beat many of the objective missions and overall can't recommend this. I got it for $5 on sale. Definitely not worth the full $20."
,Recommended,321660,13142073,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Bandyman,"This is a full on Buinsess simulator managment game through and through, there isnt anything fancy going here and you wont be getting into the vehicles and driving them.This is purely a numbers game and all about running a business, if not a slighty dumb down way of running a buisiness it is still interesting trying to balance between contracts and selling on the free market whilst trying to keep a positive company image through various means such as safety, PR, maintance and labour effectivness.You must also keep an eye on the various assets your company has and see what the bottlenecks in your company is which  makes you have to decide when you should consider ordering new equipment or refreain as the market seems to be not so favorable and could cost you too much if you did expand.£17 seems a bit steep for this game considering there is only 2 forms of resources you can choose from (iron ore & gravel), it would have been nice to see others such Bauxite, Gold, Silver etc, with the various specalist machinery that come with these.Perhaps updates will come with these in the future.Mabey being able to pick the site you wish to start your company and having the resources specific to that area would have been a nicer touch then starting some generic company somewhere not exatcly known.It is a fun game if your into purely Buiness Management games, if your expecting something like Farming Sim and running your mining firm by jumping into vehicles and having your freind come and help, this isnt for you."

I am still saddened there is not a very good mining game on the market. If I were the devs, I would make a new game and  make it a lot more interactive and complex instead of just a hurry up and wait to do nothing game."
,Not Recommended,321660,35316013,Posted: 29 September,all,Gothpixel,"This game is heavily spreadsheety, to the point where there's not much game to it. It's all financial decisions, buying and selling assets that have assorted impacts on your production and expenses. You can sell materials on a free market or sign up for contracts. If spreadsheets with a plot is interesting to you, this may be your game. If you want something more like a tycoon game, I'd pass."
