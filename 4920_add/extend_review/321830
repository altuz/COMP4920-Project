In each level you have 45 seconds to shoot enemies (to get EXP and gems) and to open chests with gems. Then roof will start falling with drills(?). You will simply move to next level by digging down!Really positive thing is that even tho this game is early-access, it still has NONE bugs!If you like quick games where you have to start over when you die, then you definitely have to buy this.I think its worth of the 10€.Multiplayer is confirmed and it will come soon.

While I can't exactly put my finger onwhy, I just keep playing and need my daily Caver Kings fix.Definitely one of my altime fav indie titles.  I hope to see this get somefinal tweaks and definely look forward to everything else put out bythis dev as longs as there are more games to be made.While I this game has its own overall artistic flavor I would highlyrecommend it anyone who likes Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne andDungeon Souls (I personally do(and personally(Highly recommend(it))))"
,Recommended,321830,17373465,"Posted: 3 August, 2015",all,braxxie,"This game. I have no words. I love this game so much. This game went beyond my expectations by almost 500%. This game is so good, it's the only game I've ever written a serious review on. Where should I start? Amazing mechanics, endless hours of gameplay... This game goes beyond the limits of a roguelike bullet hell indie game. This game is at the same level of difficulty as Rogue Legacy, Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac: incredibly hard, but possible.Pros-Amazing look. This is one of those retro looking games, but despite that, it still looks absolutely incredible. The lighting is awesome, the character design's are top notch.-The game mechanics are amazing. Its really ""Escape the Lava"" on drugs, and escaping isn't the only thing you need to worry about. There's hellish enemies, bullets spewing everywhere, explosives, and freaking buzzsaws waiting to chop your limbs off. Every so often, there's shops and treasure chests you can buy powerups from and holy hell, each of these power ups are just as good as one another.-This masterpiece has a tremendous amount of gameplay. I can literally plays this for a wholeweekand still not get bored. Not only is this game replayable, it wants you to replay it. Every character is very difficult to unlock. Most characters depend on luck. Which brings me to my next bullet...-The characters, the variety, oh my god. You have a total of 12 characters to unlock and each character is just as fun to play as. My favorite currently being Bloop who is able to spew ink where he jumps to stun enemies. Then comes the weapons. there are 3 unlockable weapons and each one are hard to unlock as well.-It's a roguelike. Is there much to say? Roguelike's are my favorite genre of video games. There fun, replayable, fast paced, and usually really freaking difficult.Cons-Achievments don't really work. Not much to say about that.-I haven't played to much of this game yetTL;DR: This game is amazing. Replayable, fun, and difficult. My GOTY whenever it comes out of Early Access."

From what I can tell this will definitely be one of the most enjoyable games to come out in a long time.The powerup mechanic, the way how you unlock characters, the combat, the difficulty, and just the general feel of this game is very reminiscent of Risk of Rain. Really the onlybigdifference is that this game feels much more like an arcade game due to the mechanics being more streamlined (tighter maps, faster pace, character abilities are passive rather than active).If you enjoyed Risk of Rain, you will certainly enjoy this one."

The enemies bum rush you with beeline A.I. (walking enemies will even change trajecotry in mid-air if you dodge underneath). If you grind long enough, the game will force you to go to the next level with a slowly lowering ceiling of doom that instakills you.Jumping is at a set height, so have fun trying to grab that HP and jumping straight into the instakill ceiling.The eyeball motif just makes the enemies look really bland. It's like a cave was invaded by waddle-doos, or something.The weapons are GARBAGE. You get a useless pea shooter, a slow-as-molasses heavy hitter, and then a sawblade-launcher that does insane chip damage because the spinning blades will roll around on the ground.Every now and then you find an item shop where you get to buy as much as you can afford (enabling you to stack items)- I used to think item stacking was such a cool concept; but in reality it's a lazy and cheap workaround to making powerups balanced. Most of the time you end up spamming E in front of shops just so they can actually do something. But they're so spread out that they might as well not even matter."

Perhaps I've been spoiled by other games with a similar nature, but this felt too bland and repetitive, not to mention it is surprisingly taxing on my computer.  Perhaps you can hide behind the early access curtain, but this felt more like an overglorified Flash game.For a game that advertises variety, you see the same thing over and over.  The enemies quickly become familiar, and the weapons quickly become tired.  Three weapons with the same general mechanic do not ""play and feel unique"".  It's your standard set of light/fast, medium, and heavy/slow.  Plus three other weapons that, through a quick Google search, appear to be similar in nature with very minor variations.  I was disappointed.The powerups are slow to come by, and a lot of them feel pretty useless.  The most useful one was a simple weapon upgrade for damage.  There were flashier ones out there for sure, but they were either very rare to come by, or their help was minimal at best, or both.Perhaps I had a certain vision for this game that I did not get when I played it.  When I heard procedurally-generated, with a unique variety of weapons, I thought I'd be getting a different gameplay experience every time.  That's the point, right?  But I did not get that experience.This is not a bad game by any stretch, but it certainly did not blow me away.  Maybe if it's on sale for a couple of bucks it would be worth getting... maybe.

I can't run the game at all, I try to launch the game and I get two little beeps and then the game executable exits.From a Steam discussion it became apparent that by now the devs have known of that issue for at least a month and a lot of people on (especially on Windows 8.1 and 10, i.e. most people) are suffering from it recently (though their ""Bug Reports"" sub-forum seems to be littered with ""Game not starting"" -reports all the way from January).I tried providing them with as much data as I could e.g. from Visual Studio's debugger, and I gave them two weeks to try and solve the issue, but they don't seem especially interested in fixing it, and now they even deleted the completely inoffensive thread about the issue.I hope they do one day solve the issues and make the game run for their paying customers, and maybe I'll be able to say more about the game. However at this stage I am definitely not impressed by the developers or the game, and I have no other choice than to leave a bad review and ask for a refund."

,Not Recommended,321830,17661697,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Played this with four players using controllers, last night.WhileCavern Kingshas some fun and addicting features, it ultimately brings nothing new to the table, or necessarily does it better than similiar games.This is a pretty standard roguelite experience that is very similiar toSuper Crate Box, except its not free ;). Each 'level' is a static screen that you try to grind out experience until a death ceiling comes down, and you dig deeper to the next level. Each level has increased difficulty. There are bosses and small two item shops. The item art is exactly likeRisk of Rain, but they certainly feel more potent - which is a good thing.Listen closely to this devs:fix your music - it is horribly loud and terrible sounding at this point. Allow options to manage music and sound volume seperately, and stop looping that single track. It is terrible to listen to. I feel so strong about this, that I could not recommend on this alone.Pros:+I like the award trophies and unlockables such as the characters and various weapons+There is an addictive 'one-more-run' quality to this+Local co-op is cool, although terribly busy on the screenCons:-Enemy AI and tracking is terrible. It just feels way too simple - you actually have to 'bait' enemies around objects to get close to you-Sound is horrible, see above-It does nothing new in terms of anything, really (comment if you disagree and tell me what is new here)-Needs further optimization (I cannot play in fullscreen without it lagging terribly and I am playing on a gaming rig)It is fun enough, but there is nothing new here. I will probably play a bit more, but I don't recommend this game to friends at this point."

For me and some of my friends that play it the fun comes from how hard the game is to progress in the normal mode. There is many chactarters to chose from and each has their own play style. Mishka the lovable bear attacks faster at low health where as yoaji is stronger mellea wise and starts with a sowrd. Arena mode can be hard for the first few min's of gameplay but after 10 min's you are on the verge of being unbeatable. I highly recomend this game. If you want a challanging game thats harder then binding of isac but is just as simple this game is for you

I will always come back to this game when I have a little bit of time or when I cant think of what to play. I can use this game as just a mind numbing background when I want to relax or I can use it as a true challenge.Pros:+Fast paced+A lot of upgrades that allow different experiences every playthrough+Local Co-op+Eventually online Co-op+Game pad support-I cannot say how well it is supported as I have not used one+2 different game types, standard and arena. Arena is basically the extreme difficulty (to me)+12 different characters. 11 are unlockable+Each character has its own unique play style and abilities+Changes every play throughCons:-Some bugs to work out:-you can click locked characters and still be able to play them. this is the major one-Not a huge variety of weapons:-3 melee-5 long range-Steam achievements are not unlockeable-This is known and they are working on it.I love this game and I can only imagine that in the coming updates it will only get better. They are going to be adding some extras, which I am not sure what that consists of, and online Co-op which should be extremely fun. I would recommend this game to people who like rogue style games and mindless killing of cavern inhabiting creatures."

Every match has a slow build up to a crazy endgame.Unlike Risk of Rain however, there is no activating of teleporters or hunting down the last remaining enemies. Cavern Kings is significantly faster and lets you continue to the next area whenever you want (though that's not a very good strategy!). The game lets you destroy the environment with items, which lends the game to battles that feel more dynamic.In some ways Cavern Kings does feel a little derivative (you'll encounter enemies and powerups which act very similar to enemies in Risk of Rain) but the game's mechanics are different enough that this never feels like a problem.Overall this is a great game in early-access. If you're still on the fence, I believe there is a free demo available on itch.io!"
