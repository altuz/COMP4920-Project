76561197989132185,Recommended,321920,12433408,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,pulp-reduced,"Schein: what a ride this has been. Right away it strikes you with its gloomy protagonist and – excuse the clichéd comparison – Limbo-like, drab, backdrop. With it comes the mirror image reflected in the murky swamp, that for the duration of this game, we are an inhabitant of. The game switches between different colors that all signify their own version of the swamp, we have the rugged, gray and old normative state, where our character has a bleak expression, signifying the hopeless situation we are in, losing our son and all. Then we are quickly introduced to the green light, which turned our character into a young man, perhaps a boy, golden hair and smiling, perhaps the former self of the main character. Then we have what according to the achievements is: despair and insanity, with the colors red and blue, respectively. I would imagine it should have been the other way around considering the expression of the “blue” characters face seem like that of one who is in despair, and the “red” with fiery brimstone and an angry expression seems more like that of an insane person. But I digress. This is the basis of Schein's gameplay, and if I may say so myself, it's great.This game go from one minute being a slow-paced put-your-thinking-cap-on kind of game to a fast-paced rush through so-called “boats” requiring intense maneuvers that feel absolutely amazing to pull off, and as a bonus, don't make you frustrated when you fail, because it's so much fun to actually learn these patterns and perform elaborate patterns of jumps in accordance with color-switching. There is one level in particular that stands out in this fast-paced regard, with a somewhat fitting name, called “Speed of Life”. The way the level gradually integrated every aspect of your skill set to crescendo you into to some rather impressing stunts, really felt like amazing game-design, and was a lot of fun, to be honest. There were levels or puzzles that could have used some type of hint that you were doing the right thing, especially if you needed to bring a lantern or not. It was ambiguous and subsequently forced some backtracking, albeit minor and not really damaging to the overall experience. Boss fights appear in this game, which is interesting for a puzzle/platformer, and for the most part it paid off and worked within the games structure, as they were the means of which to gain more power. The last fight did become rather confusing as to when you were actually doing damage to this unnamed (to not spoil) thing, but ultimately felt as difficult as a “last boss” should be.Visual design is not particularly special in any way, but still enjoyable in a reminiscent sense, like the gloomy gray looking like Limbo; the hellish world and green forest-lushness reminding me a lot of Dust: An Elysian Trail, these games use similar textures and models for a lot of the levels, and kind of copy-paste it, but in the process make what's actually there look presentable. The changes, as touched on previously, that our character goes through in every color was a neat feature. In a way it connected to the story of the frustration of not finding his son along with this hellish rage-inducing red, or the coldness of realizing that he may not find his son with the blue, cold – to me distraught and acquiescent – expression. Design-wise things were thought out and seemed to have a purpose, and even though they weren't too awe-inspiring or interesting for any longer period of time, things felt worth looking at.Schein's story probably has something to offer, but it's delivered in a not so ideal way. The voice-actors sound either uninspired or far too whimsical, and the discrepancy between the two leads can at points be very distracting, at least for that moment, until the game hits you with another brain-hemorrhaging puzzle. In a way it seems mostly metaphorical, perhaps just thrown in to give the game some purpose, and sort of plays on how easily forgotten the story is in the context of the swamp and its hardships it throws at us. “Forgetting” and “moving forward” are keywords, along with perhaps “purpose” if you can be so bold to exchange the word “son” in every dialog with “purpose”, there are some interesting insights to gain from this story, but entirely speculative, but that's where all the fun is to be had, no?A cacophony of orchestral music littered with piano strings crescendoing into something larger was part of the in parts great musical aspect of Schein. The music stemmed from a scatterbrained person throwing epic orchestras in between slow piano pieces and acoustic guitars, silently plucking away. Was there a general tone, trying to match visuals with audio? Not to my knowledge, but the individual pieces were fine, the quality was high and when the loop was right it actually gelled well with what was happening on the screen. Scatterbrained, but well executed, well enough, I should say.It's a clear recommendation to me, but mostly for the gameplay, if puzzle-games are your thing, this will be your thing as well. Schein is unique in how these color-systems interact with each other and can often be very satisfying, once you clear a level or an especially difficult puzzle. Although the aesthetics were not ideally pleasing to me, they were not without novelty and worthy of at least some appreciation. It's a good game, you'll enjoy it."

After spending several hours with it, I've decided the level design is too cumbersome and technical to merit a thumbs-up.I want to recommend this game; the graphics are amazing and the triplicate-art shows a level of devotion and attention to detail that most games don't have. Unfortunately, the puzzles eventually get very minute and annoying -- so much so that the game is no longer fun. I simply quit caring and stopped playing. Maybe other people enjoy this sort of pixel-different placement challenge, but I don't want that sort of stress and frustration in my games.I struggled through many levels that I didn't enjoy, because I assumed the fun factor would return, but it never did. It's just not worth my time anymore.----------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review: A remarkable little platformer.Combine the focused visual concentration of Limbo -- the refined art style, the elegant control mechanisms unencumbered by needless complications -- with the unforgiving, punishing precision of Super Meat Boy -- the tiny ledges, the insane death spikes waiting below -- and you've got a superb title.You could wait until it gets cheaper, but I can tell this will be worth every penny of the $9.00 I paid."

I liked the fact that some of the puzzles are thinking based while others are reflex based. The game does not completely bogs itself down with a single type of puzzle over and over again; it alternates between these two types of puzzles to keep you interested to the game. You never feel any unnecessary repetion in the game. It has quite a good of an atmosphere. The graphics and music is nothing like Bastion, Braid but it is decent enough and fits very well with the atmosphere.There is also the underlying story which unravels as the game progresses. When everything is finished it just felt a bit underwhelming to me. For such an interesting and compelling atmosphere, I would have preferred at least multiple endings. But then again it is not much of a problem.I really recommend Schein for anybody who is interested in a good puzzle platformer game. Also considering its price, it is a very good deal for a low price."

,Not Recommended,321920,14530136,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,Blau,"First of, I need to mention the pros about this game:- very nice design (the first thing that captured me about it)- the game mechanics are built upon a good idea I guess- the story is so-so. The protagonist is trying to find his son with the help of a fairy like being that generally converses with him on the way through a magical swamp. Other than that, it's not too clear what's happening.Now, the cons:- Though based upon a good idea, the game mechanics are not enjoyable.- The game mostly consists of jumping and platforming puzzles utilizing the special fairy lights gained during the story (green, red, blue) and they main problem is that they get annoying fast, so much so that the frustration ruined the whole game for me within an hour of playtime.- In addition the moving and jumping mechanics are clunky. It's like the guy is moving in a suit full of lead.- The check points are not exactly placed in accordance with the difficulty of the areas (I would consider the game's difficulty to be hard in general).Conclusively, if you don't like hard and frustrating platforming puzzles I don't recommend buying this game. If you do...I'd rather suggest ""Super Meat Boy"": :D"
,Recommended,321920,14843353,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,certifiablygeeky,"Schein is a fun little platforming game. It reminds me of LIMBO with the dark gloomy shading. The difference is you have lights which, depending if they're on or not, show you different platforms and methods to get through the puzzles. They brighten the world and show how beautiful it really is through all the gloom."
,Recommended,321920,14953594,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,digivampire,"Charming little puzzler that does a lot of things right, but some wrong. In general the idea is that you manipulate light around you to reveal and mix different worlds so you can overcome obstacles. The concept works great and allows for some difficult brain twisters. The puzzles are challanging but also rewarding once you get past them.Graphics are decent, nothing impressive to me, in fact if anything I would say the game feels bit unpolished there but given its an indie game I'm not taking that as a con. It didn't bother me. Couple of things that did bother me though:- Unless you shed the appropriate light color you won't know whats there. This may not seem like a problem at first, but there will be many sequences where you have to navigate tight spaces switching lights and you will die many times because you switched the light too soon or too late and there is no way for you to know until you try (and die). Game that does this much better as an example is Fly'n where you have shadows of the other world.- The game tries to do a decent job at introducing you to different things you can do, but doesn't hold your hand. This means if you are particularly resourceful you may overcome some obstacles in a non intended way and never learn what new mechanics you were supposed to pick up until you get stuck much later, because you never learned it. Other things you never tried or had to try until you are stuck 30min on the same puzzle and discover ""Hey! This is possible?! That would have saved me hours had I just known!""The story is non fairly shallow, not going to say more about it. Overall it was a nice journey and I would still recommend just be prepared for some (good) frustration. 7.5/10"

The like the basic mood of the game, which serves as a backdrop for the different 'lights'. I usually play it in 'offline mode' when traveling or if I have to wait somewhere. I often get interested looks or questions by the folks around me, so the first impression seems work quite well for this game.Three things I consider essential to a storytelling puzzle plattformer, all are very strong points of Schein:- The savepoints are very fair and you don't have to replay a lot if you fail (and you will).- The cutscenes/dialogues are made in such a way, that they do not interfere with the puzzles. So you don't have to listen to them again and again. Together with the first point this gets you back to the puzzle quickly.- The jumps 'feel right' with respect to speed and height."

I also like the idea behind it.And I love platformers.But this game just have no flow. It plays very unintuitive, because the controlls reacts... strange... can't describe it.It also feels as the game was made for a smaller player character. You often die because ONE of your polygons hits a spike.... or another platforme... and so you fall into the swamp.The difficulty is not very high actually. You jump over platforms, try to avoid spikes and the water and use the light to see other paths and dangerous things. That could be really fun, but it gets boring very very fast.And then it gets frstrating... cause your character seems to be too big and cause you often don't know what to do and where to jump. (I hate blind jumps -.-)tldr;pro:- the visuals are very nice and detailed- the idea with the light orb that lets you see another world is greatneutral:- the voice acting is not my taste- the music isn't remarkable in any waycon:- the controlls are somewhat.. ""clumsy""- the gameplay has no flow- the dificult isn`t hard but often just unfairDon't pay more than 2€ for this game. So buy it in a sale if you whish to...But if you really want to enjoy a platformer or a jump n run, there are many others, which will bring you way more fun. ;)"

You carry different-colored lights, at most one of them can be active at a time, and they change the environment (what you can't see, can't hurt you -- but it also won't help you).The animations aren't that great and yes, there are platformers with better graphics, but the mechanics are great and so is the overall atmosphere.

Also the character is very good and you are very fast in the right mood for a good game with an interesting story.BUT!!!This game is just frustating... It is not possible to beat this game without a few hundred, or maybe thousand times dying. I beat the game to 50% and my deathcounter score is 452. There is no chance to make most of the the jumping passages in one run, without falling and dying. You have to die many times in one jumping passage, even to know, what you have to do next. This is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and there are other ways to make a game interesting or difficult. This game is not very difficult, it is just unfair. And it lags many times, so that it is impossible to time your jumps or lights changes right. And then... of course - you die. This is what this game is all about. Just to frustate you with unfair and impossible to make it in one run, jumping passages. Maybe this game could be good, but the producers just had no idea how to make a game difficult without being this♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""Schein"".So don't buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't know how this game could get any award.

It has a fantastic concept and mechanics as well as a plausible storyline. It tests your memory as well, so you'll become smarter. It's nice, easy and simple in the beginning but as you rise through the levels the difficulty elevates as well and can become quite hard... and I haven't even played far into the game at all, bul looking at some of the screenshots on the game's store page I am starting to realise that I'll have to put on my thinking cap in the future. This game has great potential and I thank the developers for creating it.
