This won't evoke nostalgia or stir the hard-core platformer in you, it will just end in frustration and boredom."

Games are about fun and progression, not frustration and anger. all in all it's not worth 2 euros in my opinion."

,Recommended,321950,13298434,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,熊猫何三XiongMaster,"[Short Review] The game is exactly what it looks like; a retro platformer with retro graphics (look at the screeshots) and retro soundtrack. The game itself is very solid and physics are well built but what really makes this game worth to be in your library is how challenging it is; just like those old school platformers where you may die once and once again and then get a ragequit (5 minutes break) and then come back to try it again.Pros:-It's a real challenge.-Nice retro graphics.-You touch a spike, you lose the oxygen and then you die lol.-It's cheap.Cons:-Forget about it if you have no patience.-Enjoyable for old platformers lovers, other public may find it boring.Recommended (8/10)"

By which i don't so much mean its a challenging game that rewards careful gameplay, I mean that it is constructed to kill you and be deliberately obtuse and difficult to play. My two principle concerns with the game are as follows:1. Often times the window of time you have to perform your jump can be measured in a few frames of animation I'd guestimate you often have a window of less than half a second to correctly jump and land on a platform that is slippery and has a safe zone only about 1 and 1/2 times the size of your avatar. *I am not good at platformers* so while i feel this is relevant to some/many players I acknowledge and pay homage to all of you who have mastered the art of platforming to the point where this is an exciting challenge. For me, it was not. It was merely frustrating when all i wanted was to play this quirky platformer with a nice aesethetic.  My larger concern can be found in the next point.2. this game involves a tremendous amount of jumping, in a land riddled with obstacles and enemies that will instakill you. This is to be expected of a retro platformer. What i was tremendously dissapointed to find was that often times, the only way to determine when/where you have to jump is by experemintation. Please don't misunderstand me i don't mean the jumps are difficult to land (they are, hellishly so) as that is part and parcel of the genre. No I mean that literally the only way to know where you have to jump is to jump and pray you land on a safe platform because the camera is often zoomed so close to your player that you can't physically see the next place you have to jump.I applaud games that are tremendously difficult. I enjoy platformers, even though i'm trash at them (super meat boy is a great example i love that game even though i simply cannot beat it). Yury however is punishing and rewards you for initial reckless behavior followed by absurdly difficult jumps and positioning.  I'm not telling you not to buy it, you may well be skilled enough to play it, i simply want to ensure your aware of what your signing up for.Game on Players~"
,Not Recommended,321950,23372198,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Critical Failure,"So much potential but the pacing is unacceptable. Nothing quite like getting stuck at a couple of monsters two seconds away from the check point and getting killed constantly. At least in commander keen when I would get stuck I could wander around good sized levels.Not gamepad comptatable which is unacceptable. Joy2Key is not an excuse.Graphics are good. What the dev tried to do was admirable, but from a guy who played computer games in the late 80s and early 90s, this game is still pretty unfun.Also, on a side note, this game IS Linux compatable. I was able to run it on Linux Mint."

,Recommended,321950,13988719,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,yuru,"Very neat pixel retro graphics platformer with high difficulty. Sadly it has a lot of flaws. Firsty the controls are not crisp enough for an unforgiving trial and error platformer, you feel somewhat floaty. Then there seems to be a problem with the engine, because the game gets slower every time you restart or kill an enemy. In the end it slows down so much, that  it will begin to stutter for a few frames every second. Last but not least this games suffers of very bad level design, it starts of pretty good and chellenging but the farer you get, the more tedious and boring it gets. In the end you jump over 200 floating platforms with no background or design whatsoever, just to hit a trap hidden behind scenery or placed stupidly hard, just so you have to jump over 200 boring platforms for 5 minutes again to reach that spot. This game needs a lot of work but could turn still out fun to play for retro platform fans."

The game possesses all the qualities of any hardcore 8-bit classic:  high difficulty which emphasizes skill instead of grinding or hoarding items, diverse and thoughtfully designed obstacles, and short length.  BecauseYuryis hard and brief, it tempts you to assay it over and over again to see just how efficient you can get.  Highly recommended, especially at this absurdly low price!"
