This game could do to me what has not been done for a long time.Pros:Better collision detection than most any games I've ever played.  Better than ""AAA"" titlesBeautiful artstyle.Combat is pretty darn nice, makes think about how you are going to fight each battle. As in its not a cake walk.Quests are simple, and they don't overwhelm you.RUNS SOOOO SMOOTH!!! LIKE BUTTER!!!!Cons:Not enough content yet(early access) to be expected.That this game hasn't been in my life sooner.Few bugs, no biggy.Overall its worth every penny, and needs all the support it can get."

This game has some MAJOR story telling potential. I get a Zelda vibe from it mixed with Fable, only 100% open world, destructible environments and its own unique style. I purposely play for a bit, stop for a week, then come back and check out the amazing things that have been added. If you like supporting indie companies and want a fun alpha in return, then this is your game. I dont see why this game, fully done, with a Disney quality story, couldnt be game of the year, obviously far off from this current state, but it has that much potential in my opinion."

I explored all maps which cost about 3 hours and there were no storyline and not many missions. What is worse, I lost my savedata after every upgrade. Basically, the most attractive thing for me was graphics. However, as I mentioned, this game developers works so hard that they upgrades this game frequently and everytime develop a lot. I have only played around 1 hour for recent versions, it surprised me a lot. It has few more maps(seems around 1-2 hours more exploring time), better physics, more comfortable UI, much more missions and interesting characters and better system in general. It seems still no main storyline; instead of, there are a lot of side missions, like 1-3 missions in each map. To be honest, I really enjoy this game because of the sandbox system in this game. You can carry or destroy almost everything in this game. For example, if you carry a NPC, they will be angry and attack you (not sure whetherm it still works now). You can also kill every NPC and loot them if you want. And lots of environmental stuff can be destroyed or carried, such as box, fence, stone and bush. It is very nice game for fun, I really enjoy it during exploring. However, it is an early access game and still needs time to develop, such as combat system, enemy species, bugs fixing, magic and skill system, main storyline, multiplayer mode and so on. I recommend buy it with discount because I think this early access game experience not good enough for original price though it has lots of fun."

The actual experience just feels bland and uninteresting.  Interacting with characters is largely boring, there never feels like there's anything to do, and the world itself lacks any feeling of being alive.It just feels like there's no point.  Generic bearded knight guy seems out of place with any action he takes.  Level progression is just sort of there with no real feeling of impact on gameplay. You can get by most of the time just running from combat as fighting feels unrewarding, and while the world seems huge, it's mostly just empty spaces and unexplained characters wandering aimlessly.There may be a good game to come out of this someday, but right now it just feels like a lot of unrefined, unfinished ideas thrown together in no particular order.  Maybe worth a follow, but hard to recommend as a purchase."

Now this game is quite fun to play for extended periods of time. There is a lot to explore, quests available from townsfolk, random dungeons, monsters roaming the land. It is a very fun free-roaming sandbox arpg. Grand Theft Fable?The gameplay is pretty basic 3rd person arpg. Not isometric like Diablo et al, but presented in an over- the-shoulder 3rd person perspective like Fable(or GTA). You can be nice and help people, or you can steal from everybody and be a murderous thug. I am sure that at some point a story will be added, but right now it is more of a free-roaming sandbox.The combat is slightly loose, and could be tightened up a little bit. For the most part combat works as expected. Sometimes it is a little hard to time strikes perfectly. This is not bad enough to be a serious problem,  just a minor quibble with the gameplay which I'm sure can be adjusted. Even if they leave the combat as is, I'd still be happy with the game. But I could be  happier.I especially appreciate the graphics, which are slightly cute and cartoonish, yet stunning at the same time with the settings maxed out at 1080p.The developers are definitely working dilligently to complete the game.""Our goal is to make Hardland one of the great action adventure RPGs.""""We want to make Hardland a world full of interesting characters, creatures, quests, and mysterious places. We will not dictate how you should play this game. We merely set the stage and let you make your own decisions. ""I think the developers are well on their way to realizing those goals.Old review:This game is far from done. The art and graphics are great (see screenshots etc...), the gameplay is coming together(per developer 70% complete).  The game world, on the other hand, still has a way to go (per developer only 20% complete). When complete, I think it will be a great open world fantasy arpg.I would not buy this if you are looking for something you can put lots of hours into immediately. However if you want to support what I think will become a very fun game.... I can't wait to play this game when the gameworld is closer to 75% ready!"

There are training maps and a rather large open world map to explore at this time but no real dungons yet. There are plenty of enemies to fight and NPC's to meet but it's all 'fetch quests' for now.

,Recommended,321980,13155566,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,MajorReisman17,"Just wanted to give my first impressions. Where to start :-).Firstly game enviroments feels very much like Cube world more than minecraft in my opinion. The terrain is still somewhat disjointed in places  e.g uneven terrain especially roads (unlike Cubeworlds beautiful smoothness in creating terrain and especially roads through the terrain). The terrain has some great effects when travelling from biome to biome (much better than Cube world in my opinion). Overall still really enjoying the terrain and just wandering about (which I did a lot in Cube world). Towns seem to be in the game but other than the  starting town (with walls around it) the other towns just seem barren by comparrison (just a few  buildings scattered quite far from one another  and  no road going  through them in most cases.  I hope the developers plan to tweak and add  more to the current towns on roads and make them unique in each biome (eg different looking buildings - e.g. in forrest roofs made out of leaves, plains roofs made out of hay etc......). Gameplay is interesting. It is somewhat basic at this time (although being an Alpha I expect that will hopefully change for the better). Finding items out in the wild is very limited at this time (the best thing I found randomly was a Magnificent Key). Most of the time you will find chests with no keys or barrels filled with fruit (very useful). Keys in particular seem very hard to find (too hard in my opinion). You can level up as you explore/fight although the effects do not seem to do much at this time (im my opinion). And yes I know it does raise my health  as I level up. Also have not found any major weapon upgrades other that armor shoulder pads at this time. one time found a spellbook (from a dead friendly AI) and could not figure how to use it, and  also a glowing green staff.  (most of my time was exploring anyway so not important). I feel this game has alot of potential like Cube world. I hope they are able to continue to work on this jem. The graphics look great although this game seems to struggle on my system (i5- 3550,  8gb ram and a 295 GTX graphics card). Make sure you turn down AA expecially. I was having a slide show when trying to run on Ultra with 4x AA enabled. Much better with Medium with 2x AA enabled although I does still seem to chug at times (obviously being an Alpha I also understand that tuning with come later - maybe at the  beta stage). Basically at the end of  the  day I do not regret purchasing this game at all and really looking forward to what they do next. I have already read on the work on the terrain generation (great) and I hope they can flesh the game out (more weapons,armors etc..) and would like to see some variations on  monsters for specific biomes (e.g. monsters in the snow biome will not be seen in the jungle biome for instance). Great job to the developers. I do not regreat investing my $14.95 purchase price towards supporting this game into a bright future. Thank you four your hard work."

It only looks good graphically (if your machine can sustain it!), but as far as gameplay and mechanics go, it still feels very much like a skeleton of what it should be. There is no intro or apparent purpose which is given to you as soon as the game starts; enemy difficulty half a minute into the game is quite steep; dialogues are as generic as they come and seem to make zero sense; NPC personalities are far from being fleshed out; puzzles? strategy? quests? How do you play this game? what are you supposed to do? This game has been so long on Early Access but yet I have no idea what this game is supposed to be.If the core of the gameplay is in action, the game is very unbalanced and not user friendly early on; the game does stuff like throwing a band of mini goblins, a boar (tough to kill at starting level) and a fire hurling knight which will totally demolished you in 4 hits. Your character will explode in loot you didn't even knew you had, because (you guessed it) you just started playing a few seconds ago...My suggestion to the devs: it's best to set down the gameplay and fix the little content to a good point, than making something too ambitious and ending with a lot of loose ends. The game may promise well, but it needs a direction and a sense of progression, most of all, to be enjoyable rather than frustrating."

The graphics are fun and different, very good IMO.  A lot of the equipment is bigger than your character and won't magically resize to fit you like in most games, so some things are humourously large. There is a fun faction system to play with. The combat is a bit simplistic at the time of writing this, but that goes well with the game's style honestly. I also like the way they handle the armor system, and how it can be destroyed to get at the soft bits (unless you're fighting a skeleton) underneath. I think all this stuff is very cool, but if you are the kind of person that needs flawless, in depth combat and want all your games to look like far cry or COD, this might not be what you are looking for. For everyone else: buy this game now seriously."

While its definitely not a really hardcore open world rpg like dark souls or anything it is pretty fun. Rather than making big blocky paragraphs that you and me both know won't read i'll just compress it into a list form.Pros;+Unique art style (never seen in any other game)+Pretty casual yet fun gameplay+Some cool locations to exploreNeuteral;=Could use some more animations here and there=Enviornment kind of gets repetitive when walking through wilderness=Kinda want more dialogue options, most people say one thing and your options are okay and goodbye=Optimization is alright, my specs are quite a bit over minimum. Optimization is not stellar yet not horrid either= This is a kinda silly one but; when you get near portals it makes a really loud noise ( I know what you're probably thinking, just turn down your volume, but its not that simple. I can have my volume down very low so everything else in the game is to a near whisper and portal noises are still deafening, it should be more quiet, RIP headphone users )Cons;-Mini map could be improved, it serves it's purpose alright but it's not the best-Combat could be improved-Some more enemy types would be nice. Most of them are pretty simpleOverall its not a bad game, it's certainly not the best but it's all around pretty fun. As of right now i'll give this game a 7 out of 10 however as this game updates ill update my review.Edit 1: This is made by the same people who made Mini gore which is one of my favorite ios games : ) , I feel this is in good hands as they are a somewhat known developer rather than some company you've never heard of before out of the blue.Edit 2 (9/18/15): Optimization got a big improvement as my FPS has had a huge jump, from an average of 20 to an average of 60!

It's a wonder to behold.--UPDATE--After playing the game more, I'm finding a lot more depth in the game. I have only slightly explored two areas of the game, but spent about an hour in each one. The fact is, destroying things is just so much fun to do, and there are little secrets and hidden gems everywhere.I'm floored by the art style, and the attention to detail is astonishing. I also just realised that the ground itself is destructable... That's not something I expected.I killed a goblin that was carrying an exploding bolt crossbow. I know how an exploding bold crossbow, and I have learned that many more items are destructable in the game than I had first imagined. Additionally, I learned that stones (which look like props) actually have ore and stuff inside of them. Nice surprise.Another really cool feature I noticed is that any enemy that you fight will drop any armor that they are wearing, also their weapons, and some additional loot. But it's cool to see that you get their actual items as loot. On top of that, you can break pieces of their armor off in battle, which is a nice little touch.Right now, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to have a goal in the game, so I've set myself the goal of collecting bloody goblin hearts from all my victims.Truth be told, I'm having a lot of fun with this game."

While the art direction wasn't and still isn't my cup of tea, it seemed to have great potential if expanded on and better optimized. With this in mind, I decided to wait a few months and see what the devs would come up with given time.Imagine my surprise then when I downloaded it again mid-year, only to find it had not only failed to improve in practically every aspect, but even regressed. Gone was the vast open world I'd enjoyed, replaced short chain of miniscule pregenerated maps and an endless, empty dungeon. Removed was the feeling of exploration and progression, the excitement and fun replaced with a struggle to progress anywhere that felt far more like a chore. The devs have promised to expand upon the existing game in the past few months, but so far the best they've managed is to shoehorn in a handful of mechanics that were in the original draft.Elephant people and elven wizards aside, their focus on prettier graphics and visual effects over replay value and depth will ultimately lead to just another average mid-tier indie RPG. Assuming they stay the course with their new design plan, I can't recommend this game over the plethora of other such games available on steam."

Do you want to play a game that is easy to access and makes you smile and laugh without being too silly? Then Hardland is the game for you.Hardland has a perfect balance between moderately challenging gameplay and the fun of exploration and looting. This game was not designed to challenge your skills, but rather it was designed to make you smile. And guess what... we all need to take a break sometimes and enjoy something goofy, right?In the Early Access version, you start with a default warrior character who gains experience by killing creatures (and completing some quests). There is no skill tree at this point. Gaining levels will simply improve your health and damage and allow you to equip higher level items. Simple and straightforward.Most environmental object can be destroyed (except very large objects like trees and buildings) and almost always contains something you can use including gold, simple weapons and healing items.So you can see the game has some sandbox and open-world features. The only thing that would complete the picture would be a skill tree and crafting system, preferably the latter. I'm not sure if these are being planned or not, but they would definitely make the game a more decent experience.But the most amusing features in this game would be:the wacky enemies and the items that you can loot from their corpses.You can kill merchants (or zombie merchants) to take their guns. You can kill a skeleton wearing a chicken mask to take his mask that allows you to attract chicken. You can kill a goblin to take his enchanted hammer or axe. Everything you see can be yours if you can take it by force! This makes you want to explore and find MORE enemies to destroy and loot. That would be the most fun feature of the game right now.The combat itself is nothing too special. You can exploit the enemy's blind spots and just mash the attack button until they're dead. Not too challenging, they will always hit you the exact same way, very predictable. And their hit detection is not great. Perhaps this will be improved in the future?So as you can see, there is lots of potential and lots of room for improvement. They need to add more NPCs, the quests have to be elaborated more, the quest bugs must be fixed. The map needs to be made more clear (I can't find the entrance to a dungeon using the map). The enemies must be made more challenging.One annoying thing right now is that every time I try to help the town guard fight an enemy, if I attack the guard ONLY ONCE BY MISTAKE >> he will chase me and try to kill me non-stop!Of course, there is no crime system right now, so you can pretty much kill all guards outside the town and no one would care.If you like the concept based on this description, feel free to support the developers and buy it now. This is a good game to buy for your kids if you are introducing them to the 3rd person RPG genre (particularly if they are less than 12 years old), but it's also ok for your own casual game requirements. Otherwise, just keep your expectations to a healthy minimum until the full release.Early Access rating : 7/10You can check out my playthrough below for more details.

There were items and monsters EVERYWHERE and exploring was enjoyable and entertaining. The only gripes I had was the LACK of things to do after I had spent my 6 hours discovering everything there was. We all wanted more from the devs and the devs promised such.Now forward to present day. I decide to come back to this still EA title and, well, theres LESS than before.

Also, there are no sounds for creatures or the world really, no tutorial, no nothing that keeps your interest if you are a new player an decide to boot this up for the first time.TL;DR this game failed to capture any audience. Its DEAD QUIET everywhere you go, and nothing really happens anymore. So no, I cannot recommend this ""forever in EA"" title to anyone looking for a captivating experience with things to do. Obvious choice besides this game would be Witcher 3 or Skyrim no doubt.If you disliked this review, be sure to comment and let me know what you think."

The adorable art style is reminiscent of plushies, yet the enemies are surprisingly hard hitting; ghouls are real beasts in the game, one has to time their attacks in this game.I must admit i was lost initially at the lack of clear instructions, a decade of linear campaigns has meant that old style games with really open worlds can be initially disorienting, though extremely satisfying when you start getting ALL the loot!Overall, i must admit it can be challenging, but i thoroughly recommend this game to anyone, the developers are also really involved with a ton of regular updates.10/10 Really interesting game."

When I had first purchased it, I could not even start the game properly. I contacted one of the developers for help and they responded almost immediately. Not only were they friendly, but they worked long and hard to correct the elusive problem that I kept having. After a week of correspondence back and forth, they had fixed my issue and I was off on my way into the world of Hardland.Graphics 9.5/10The first thing that struck me in this game was the absolute beauty of it. Everything seems handcrafted and personalized to the point that the graphics look like no other game that I've ever seen. It could not be better in appearances.Gameplay 8.5/10This game is certainly unique in fighting style. I have never been able to have so much fun with a few bales of hay and some barrels. The merchant that I threw them at could not say the same. He died...eventually, leaving me his awesome blunderbuss (OP btw). But this is when I noticed the first fault in this game. There was no consequences for my actions. Also this game NEEDS more of an open world because when I hear open world, I want open world, not just partly open landscapes. NPCs need more emotion and variation put into them to make it feel like a better story. Quests are fun, but slowly become somewhat grating. Quests need to be exciting and action packed with boss fights. Monsters to fight are certainly fun but I think that there should be way more to fight as well. Nothing is more fun than running aimlessly at night with an explosive crossbow shooting everything in sight, but I want to be able to shoot more than 3-4 kinds of monsters in a run.Sound 7/10The music that is there is good, but it is repetitive. There needs to be more sound tracks to play so that my ears don't start hurting after a long time playing. I like the style of music, but like I said, just add more.Overall 8/10This game is pretty good, but I stopped playing it because I wanted to wait for more updates. These are coming. I have only ONE MAJOR SUGGESTION: add multiplayer. I don't know how you would do it, I don't know if you can do it, but I know that if there is a god named Mountain Sheep, that anything is possible. If multiplayer is added, I will not hesitate to force everyone...EVERYONE that I know (yes I mean everyone) to buy this game (Not really but I would show them it XD).

There's a few smaller bugs here and there but nothing I've found that is totally game breaking yet.One last thing that would be nice, is if they fleshed out the sounds a little bit. Like just talking to the NPCs if a sound could come up or something it would really go a long way in making the game feel more complete in my opinion, as opposed to kinda lacking a little flair.I payed full price for the game havent felt like I need my money back, so I suppose you could say in the end my opinion is, that if this team sticks with developement Hardland will turn out into a nice little gem to hold onto, but I guess time will tell-Peace"

Between load screens, when you are trasistioning from one screen to the next (like entering a building), you automatically die. After that, once you try to reload the game you just keep automatically dying after the reload.Normally a glitch like this would not be a huge issue since you could always revert to the last placed you saved. However, this game is created to where you only have 1 save slot. Thus, you only have one place and time to revert back to.

The graphics are quite interesting and stylistically cool, and a lot of scenes are screenshots just waiting to happen.  From what I can tell of the combat, it's somewhat intuitive and feels natural.My main qualms about this game stem from the fact that so much of it seems barren of love and polish - as much of a buzzword as that is to use, it's accurate in my view.There seems to be no complete story - the player is a blank slate, completely wiped of distinct traits, but at the same time, unable to be customized beyond clothing options.  The dialogue in the beginner's area fails to truly engage me or tell me more about the world, and in some cases, even has grammar errors in it.  Many of the less unique NPCS are duplicated throughout the world and say close to the exact same things as another.  Quests don't involve a lot of tedium, but are hardly what I would call exciting or anything and wear me down before long.The music (a bunch of droning tones, actually) is WAY too loud in the menu, so I had to turn the volume down significantly, but there is little to no music in the game anyway, so there's nothing to add additional atmosphere.When playing, I didn't feel as if anything mattered in the world, because I could take anything from a town without consequence (there is no Take / Steal mechanic implemented and it feels unrealistic), and things can be thrown at villagers to hurt and kill them, but unless there are guards directly there, there are often no repercussions for doing so.  I did like wantonly knocking over and destroying things.  Many of the objects in this game are highly interactive and I think that was implemented well, but again, nobody seems to care enough about your destruction.Many players seem to have no problem with it, but all these components together made my game feel so tedious that I didn't have much of a desire to keep playing.  I felt as if nothing I was doing really had a point.  This may be fine in a game optimized for pure action, but when I play an RPG things like this matter to me!  I dunno.The world is touted as being open-world but when playing in the starting area I got the sense that I was being herded into certain locations because there would be densely-decorated places right next to large swathes of desolate landscape.  Sometimes you can't physically go farther because there are bunches of trees too concentrated to walk through (and if you try to get past, it's easy to fall in a crevice or something, and near impossible to get out - and then you have to restart the save).There are some UI and intuitiveness inconveniences ex.) the world map is hard to zoom in and is constantly panned all the way out so the icons overshadow the paths, and when you reload a save the map markers and paths are erased, so the map as a persistent navigation aid is useless.  This may not be the same experience for all players, but at many times the interface felt a bit clunky / clumsy.  I have more than once encountered a glitch where exiting a building caused the world to be ""flooded"" - the ground had sunk, exposing water and deleting many of the NPCs from the area, and I had to restart the file (and you are only offered one unnamed save slot) to get a non-glitched world.Maybe it gets better as playtime goes on.  I only spent about an hour and a half with it, after all.  But if the intro period was indicative of the game as a whole, I can't say I'm too impressed.In the end, I hope that Hardland releases as a more complete, engaging game.  Some of its parts show a lot of potential, given a little more grease to polish with.

You might thing, well just save the game before you go into a dungeon or house or wherever.  Well that bug affects the save as well.

I just loaded the game again and loaded my save which was about 1 min before I decided to enter a dungeon.  The save spawns me right outside the dungeon entrance and shows the death animation where all your loot and money spills out from you and the message ""you've died, click to start new game.""  That is your only option, to start over.  I have started over so many times from this bug its not funny.Don't get me wrong, the game is super fun.  Great graphics, controls are fluid and easy.

Healing potions are buggy, you only need 1 and you can use it forever by switching it out and back. A lot of things don't work correctly and a lot of items seem to have no use, I've only played about 4 hours or so but I found no use for most of what I was finding.There is no real direction but it doesn't feel like a true open world game, sure you can go where you want but most of the map seems to be blocked off by trees or mountains and water.

And the fact it released in 2014 scares me so I have to return it. Sadly, in it's current state I can not reccomend.I also played at 2k resolution with a 1080 and an I7 3930k and got 30-45FPS. Gross!"

My verdict is: DON'T buy it. Save your money for some indie game that cares about the player community._________________________________________________________Yes! They are still updating the game.. And not taking that long to do so.. Wich is refreshingly GREAT! They've just made a massive update today and freed the game from many bugs, and added new units like npcs, monsters and many new areas to explore, itens, etc. I'm hyped again. And can assure you guys: This game is WORTH buying. So much potential. Beautiful and original graphics.. Unique gameplay within a persistent world. Imma play now._________________________________________________________This is just sad. I bought this game after watching a few videos on youtube of gameplays.. It looked fun, and sure was in the first 20 minutes of gameplay. The lack of direction and objective is REAL. Its just BORING like hell. I do understand that this game is in early access, but there is SO much to work on.. I'm beginning to wonder if the developer will ever release this game some day. I know its not dead (last update was 1 month ago if I'm not wrong), but still. My hopes are dying. It has some great potential on this product I say. Also, the graphics are stunning and the animations are professional. But then there is the gameplay with that lack of everything. It only plays well. Not a single bug that could ruin your experience at its current state, but MAN. They're worried about polishing the graphics (see the last update) and not worring about the game experience at all! That worries me deeply. Oh well, I'm not giving up tho. I seriously hope that this game will be really great as it meant to be, some day. Not only because I liked the idea and stuff, but because I've spent MONEY on this. So, devs, please. Make it worth my (and all of your customers) while.And YES, I will be glad to change this review status to POSITIVE as soon as I see some things changed on this game. Currently, I'm just disappointed. Thats just some awful feel."

It evokes a lot. It was also on sale. The game took fifteen minutes to install.I clicked through some menus and cutscenes. I was in control of an avatar that bore little resemblance to me. I could press keys on my keyboard and move my mouse to control the square little man and make him do things like walk around and swing a sword. I pressed keys to make him walk to a big swirling vortex.I wandered for a bit, exploring. There were trees and rocks and other forest things. There were giant apples. They had words over them that said GIANT APPLES and they had a health bar so maybe they were enemies. I could attack them with my sword and eventually they would explode into an impossible number of giant apple slices. You could walk up to chickens and they would say ""Bwock, bwock!"" Perhaps a political reference? It's hard to say either way.There were some pigs, both big and small. I killed the pigs with my sword, and then some other animals. The sword makes a satisfy ssssswop sound when it connects, but the sound effect isn't at all dynamic so it becomes trance inducing through persistent repetition. I found some people and killed them too. If you hit someone with your sword, their name turns red and they run away. But only for a few seconds. Then they forget that they should be scared of you and you can just walk up and strike them with the sword again. You can keep doing this until they die.When people are killed things fall out of them. Cinnamon rolls, potatoes, forks, torches, hats, large bottles of poison, three-tiered fondant cakes. All sorts of things. I'm not sure what these people intended to do with all these things. I just left them on the ground.You don't run very fast, so it takes a long time to go from one village to another to find villagers. Perhaps the players should be able to kill someone and take their shoes and different shoes let you move at different speeds. Again, this is an early access game, and a lot can change, so maybe the developers have already thought of this.While I was looking for the next village I found a knight named Bald Travis and I put him in the ground. That is to say: I hit him and he fell over stiffly and his upper torso clipped through the ground. His squiggly disproportionate feet stuck up like marigolds. All the people in this game are oddly dysmorphic. They are all short, stout, thick. It makes me think about why my own body is constructed the way it is, which is something I don't like to do.I wandered some more. There was a boar stuck inside a tree, like the tree had grown through him, but he was still alive and thrashing violently. His name was Raggi the Maneater. I went over to try and help him, but merely making contact with him seemed to be fatal. My body went limp and a dozen bejeweled crowns exploded from within me. There was also one quarter of a watermelon and my quiet, un-beating heart.At that point I decided I had played enough to form a proper assessment of all the game had to offer. This is a work in progress, and there isn't enough polish to hold my attention. It feels like there's a lot of obvious areas to improve upon. I wish I could remove people's shoes when they die, or otherwise dress them how I wanted. I wish the animals said more things when you talked to them. I wish there were mini-games, like maybe you mash keys and fill a meter to put a sleeper hold on a villager. Those are all things that would make a much more engaging experience for a player like me. But for now, Hardland seems aimless and unnecessary."

Although there are some things I hope to see improved in the future before proper release.1. The Special Crossbow kills me if I aim too high, I'm not sure what is causing this colision but it lead me to not use the weapon entirely.2. Randomly exploding 3 different times while looting near goblin kings. I did not see anything explosive laying around to cause it, not sure if this is an error or I am blind.3. Enemy aggro range seems short, I don't like that I am allowed to single out monsters on the edge of squads/armies without getting swarmed by the whole group.4. Stamina doesn't seem taxing enough when you run out. You cant jump, run or dodge but you can still go ham with your weapon. I guess if you want to encourage berzerker playstyles this is fine as is if stronger monsters are introduced, but with a 500 damage ice wand I just run around and 1-3 hit everything without needing to dodge or block."
