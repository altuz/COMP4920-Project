,Recommended,322080,13968712,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,WithScience,"When his younger brother dies, the protagonist loses his marbles.  Navigate zany, topsy-turvy worlds to help him find them again!Actually: Disorder is a grim platformer based on slow, precise jumps and the ability to switch between two slightly different versions of the world.  Expect to jump from a platform that exists towards empty air, switch worlds, and land on a new one.Pros:- Great level design.- Challenging and interesting puzzles.- Solid exploration of the world switching mechanic.- Good replay value.  There are multiple endings, branching paths, and every hidden item you unlock can be ""enabled"" to add a challenging effect to gameplay.  (Think the gods in Bastion, or the limiters in Transistor.)- I encountered no bugs on my first playthrough, which is not something I say a lot.- The trick of the last level is pretty clever.According to taste:-  Tries very hard to keep a dark, gloomy atmosphere.  Let me put it like this:  I can imagine a depressed late-teen to early twenties person writing everything that the main character says in their diary.  That said, I wouldn't go out of my way to read that diary.- Some polarity switching games have very distinct flavors for the two worlds (Giana Sisters comes to mind).  Disorder switches between sad and agonized, or drab and creepy.  As a result, the two worlds aren't easily identifiable: at any given time, I couldn't tell you which one I was in.  This didn't bother me at all, but it was sort of unexpected.- Balanced around a slower character with a short jump.Con:- Pretty short.  I beat this game in 1.5 hours.  There could have easily been another few levels and at least one more major mechanic.- There should really be some sort of visible indicator of whether or not you're blocked from shifting.  I'd put an icon on the screen, but if the dev is really committed to not having a HUD, do something with the main character's facial expression instead.  The constant, cartoonish frown was a bit much.Overall, a good and innovative game, but I wish there were more of it."
,Recommended,322080,13975628,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,Whiterabbit-uk,"I was  initially attracted to Disorder not by reading the development diaries, or what the game was about, but by the  post apocalyptic like imagery  the  screen captures portrayed (they also  have a vague terraria like look with respect to the graphics, though  not in game play mechanics).On playing the game I  was  really surprised and pleased by the  way the developer had   created an otherworldly   platformer, with two dimensions that you have to swap between  to be able to progress.  The imagery is    a pixelated delight and the music and sound effects  add substance to the artwork.  Disorder is a creepy atmospheric platformer the like of which I've not come across before.  Well worth buying IMO, even at full price."
,Recommended,322080,16822403,"Posted: 1 July, 2015",all,Gunderson Mallard,"Grieving is hard to do.Disorder is a puzzle platformer with a strong narrative focus. The mechanics of the game begin with duality (think ""timef cu k"" among others), but adds some more dynamics as it goes including the necessity of crouching, inversions, dodging projectiles and more. As puzzle platformer, it is demanding and very well made. The solution and execution of each puzzle grows more complex as the game sinks further into the darkness of despondency.Aside from the core mechanics, cursory elements add more to the experience. Most puzzle platformers tend to be linear with a single solution, but Disorder eschews this with branching level design. It feels strange to narrowly escape from one puzzle sequence, only to look back and see that there are other ones that remain untouched and, now, unreachable, Some routes felt easier than others, but that's possibly because the more strenous route held a hidden trinket. These trinkets can be used to modify the game after completion and range from making your character float, or slip, to inverting the world. Finding and using these trinkets adds more replay value and challenge to the game.Along with being intellectually taxing, Disorder weighs heavily on the spirits. Dealing with sensitive topics requires great finesse. At the center of the game is a young man grieving, with different facets emerging from broken homes to suicide. Putting these complicated feelings into a game is no small feat, and Disorder does not hold back. The text of the game relentlessly peels away at the layers. Text pops up throughout the game, written across levels, repeating some sentences that are then saved in the journal. Swapping dimensions will morph these repeating sentences into a different set that, again, are saved into the journal. The deliberate pacing of the story relies on the player sitting still long enough to read both sets of monologue. The story can be difficult to stomach sometimes and every line only adds to this. The conclusions are powerful, and the player is forced to decide how the story ends.However, it should be noted that Disorder isn't without its flaws. Though the controls work well (essential for platformers), I found that there were some framrate issues which led to some frustration. Although I much prefer a game to end too quick rather than drag on, some people measure a game's quality by its length. In that regard, Disorder is on the shorter side, and if you are not up to finding the hidden items then the journey can end to quick for some. Another factor to consider is how many platformers you have played. Sure, everyone's played Mario, but even the most interesting of mechanics in platforming can be found in flash games. With that said, dodging projectiles and hopping on disappearing platformers with two characters in an inverted level that changes behavior with dimension might just be old tricks for some.Disorder is an astounding accomplishment. It manages to feel rewarding and new in a saturated genre both in gameplay and story. However none of these things change the fact that it is emotionally draining. This is truly an unsettling and unforgettable experience, despite some minor flaws."

I realize how lucky I am to have such strong family ties, no major life tragedies, and mental stability. The creative narrative, atmospheric music, and color palette really put me into the character's shoes. The puzzles are well thought out and bring much satisfaction upon completion. Easter eggs and cinematic scenes balance out the difficult puzzles perfectly making this game super enjoyable. Although I was hesitant to dish out full price, I am so happy that I did! Thanks Swagabyte for an intense, unique, and fulfilling platformer!"
,Recommended,322080,15085182,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,KingSigy,"Depression is a lot more common than people realize. You probably know someone who is battling depression or has a relative with the disorder. I know that the past 12 years of my life were filled with it, ruining my college experience and nearly crippling me with anxiety and fear.That a game like ""Disorder"" exists just makes me happy. I get nearly tear-filled when I see that a developer was brave enough to tackle subject matter that most designers would shake off. While the game doesn't go as far as I might have liked, the vague questions and platitudes make for some compelling writing that really sticks out for me, personally.These thoughts have all crossed my mind at one time or another. You may not know much about the main character, but to see, ""I'm not really worth it,"" cross his mind just reminds me of the hardships I faced to get through my mental illness. It is something that never leaves you, but you learn to cope.The mechanics of the game seem to reflect that. Your character switches between a duality of light and dark. While this isn't exactly original, the story set-up makes the idea very interesting. The graphics also sell the dark atmosphere and sad setting.The game is all about embracing your darkness and moving on with it. There is no sense in sticking to one emotion at all times. You will get nowhere in life, much as this game. You may come up to a dead-end, but switching around polarities can reveal another path.This also lends some non-linearity to the level design. For a platformer to include more than one path is pretty damn excellent. Hidden items are often on those paths, but I did manage to find a couple that were purely alternative routes (often harder, too).The enemies are limited, but each work within the games mechanics. There are dots which reverse their output with polarity changes. Enemies will fire in one direction while in light versus dark. There are some anti-gravity beams that will push or pull you, based on polarity. It makes for some great scenarios, even if a lot of them have been done before.The game is incredibly short, so it never overstays it's welcome. I personally know a lot of the guys from Screwattack, so I know this was intentional. They were born and raised on NES games that didn't waste time. I believe ""Disorder"" could have used some more difficulty, but replaying the game for alternate paths (or endings) sounds like a very tantilizing prospect.When I said that I didn't feel the game went far enough with it's premise, it was mostly in how little there is to the story. You are never explicitly told what the main character is going through. This makes some of the later ""revelations"" a bit soft. The full impact could have been extracted had there been some more background.I also think that the very final level is a bit of a cop-out. I will avoid spoiling it, but dying and restarting at checkpoints pretty much negates the challenge. One section did trip me up, but it was mostly down to timing my button presses. Apart from that, you can pretty much breeze through the end game.The price tag is also a little steep. I can see that it was lowered to $10, but I'm not sure if that is fair. I fairly enjoyed the game and would recommend it to people looking for something unique, but the length doesn't seem to justify the asking price. Maybe wait for a half-off sale (I did).Whenever you decide to take the plunge, know that ""Disorder"" is a very good game. Tackling darker themes and presenting mind-bending puzzles has given us a platformer that feels very different, despite borrowing heavily from it's predecessors. I wouldn't hesitate to say that this should be played by everyone (even if it's not A+ material).7.5/10"

It's challenging, super dark, and creepy! What else can you ask for? It took me roughly two hours to run through the game, but to my suprise I only unlocked two achievements plus it seems like it has multiple endings, meaning there is still plenty for me to do. I love a game that makes you want to go back and master it. The developers surely didn't lie about this game making you feel down, with the music and the story, not to mention the fact that it gets damn tough towards the end. I'll give it a 9.5/10 seeing that there is always room to grow. Great Game guys. I can't wait to put some more hours on it!!!"

However it's really short; I sucked at it and still I've finished in 2 hours. So the price tag is a little bit too high, you may want to wait for a sale.What's not so good: Very strange menu controls. You access the menu by pressing 'P', not Escape. But Escape has its function, it switches the game from fullscreen to windowed mode. I never got used to it so I constantly had to go to the menu to switch the game back to fullscreen.Also, there is a free expansion pack but it's so difficult I wasn't able to get past the second screen and I finally gave up."
76561198074264915,Recommended,322080,14062259,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,][sentrop|[,"Overall, Disorder is a solid 2D puzzle/platformer with a serious theme. Controls are tight and responsive, and the story while confronting in places, is still a pleasure to experience. The only let down for me is the short play length, but the time I spent in each level I still enjoyed. Disorder is a great indie title and has earned 7.5 out of 10.Disorder is the first game developed by Swagabyte Games, a small indie studio operating remotely from various cities in the U.S. I am a big fan of games that take on adult themes, like mental illness, and was immediately drawn in by the tale of the protagonist.The player on game start up is thrown straight into the control seat, and starts to unravel the story behind the young man. Disorder has an emotional story to tell, that is portrayed well throughout the levels. I won't go into any more detail about the story, as it’s the reason to play this game, but I will say, after only a short time I felt completely submerged in this young man's struggle.Boiled down, Disorder is a 2D puzzle/platformer, which uses one mechanic of swapping between positive and negative worlds to challenge the player. This swap world mechanic feels fresh in this psychological setting, and when applied on the different objects in the world has a varying effect. Moving from positive to negative, will freeze some platforms, reverse the movement of others, convert enemies to jump pads and generally change the landscape.The story that is delivered in small scenes with floating text, is also affected by the negative, positive swap. Be sure to take the time to swap during these story scenes, as it is extremely interesting seeing the two perspectives. Disorder's level design on the whole is good, and I had a great time, taking on every challenge the devs threw at me. The play length is a little short at under 2 hours, but the collectables in each level may extend the game life for some players.I have a weak spot for retro visuals, so Disorders pixel art style was right up my alley. The levels look amazing and really help to convey the emotion of the memory it represents. Even with this pixel art style I found the gestures and animations of the protagonist very powerful, and I never quite got used to seeing the young man die. The music is another great addition, and provides the perfect atmosphere throughout the game.For my full review and heaps of other delicious content seeGlitch"

It sends you into a psychological spin as you try to negotiate it's twisted world.You play the part a disturbed young boy who has created a world in his own mind and can switch between the 'real' world and the world from his memory. I'm not sure if that is a reflection of the developers collective mind or not but it's not a world I'd want to visit in real life.The graphics are 2D pixel art with particular attention to detail and I love the use different palettes for the two realms. The white noise planet/moon and clouds in the background create a stark world in which we can't help but feel a sense of helpless solitude.The music and SFX are haunting and help to nail the graphics into your sub-conscience. I think the soundtrack is available to download from their website (link below).The developers have done a marvellous job on this game and it's not one I would attempt myself. Switching between realms testing to see if it works for us (the critical gamers) must have been painstaking so they have my full admiration.For a video review:http://youtu.be/MEjqYwngKO4If you love indie games, why not join my Facebook group and suggest other games :)https://www.facebook.com/groups/indiegamer/Thank you to Swagabyte for an excellent game worth waiting for <3FMG"

Now that does sound like a cliche type of story but it manages to tell it in a very unique way with being a two dimensional world like Silent Hill. Which overall from the characters, environments, and all the effects are very well animated.Gameplay is what you would expect from a platformer with good controls but has puzzle elements and ways to shift between different dimensions which you will do often. Even discovering messages throughout the game (audio log type things) can impact the story in different ways on how you want the main character to live out his life.Conclusions: Disorder is very unique platformer with good story that have you thinking after playing this game.

I wish I had finished the game, but since some weird error always occured EVERY time I completed a level I had to restart the level I just had finished from the beginning again. Speaking of the saving system; if you decide to take a break and exit the game, you don't know how much of your progress has been saved when you return.Since Disorder mainly focus on the puzzles it made me forget what the game's about and I couldn't care less about the protagonist.

The projected gameplay mechanics looked really quite interesting and unique, and I must say that I am very much into psychological and puzzle games.Unfortunatley though, my excitement was in vain. I was lucky that I got this in a sale for around £2 I think, because frankly, the normal price of £6.99 is way too high for a two hour game. Sure the developers released an expansion pack, but those levels are simply a bit too difficult.However, as a review, I think that it is best that I start with what I DID like about the game. In honesty, not much really. I liked how the family members and the other characters from his past were portrayed in his head. If in the light, there were stick figures with a somewhat bubbly animation, while in the dark they were shadows with creepy animations. Some were really creepy in the dark section. For example, one person was banging his head on a window. Thing is, my character was blocking my view of this and when I moved, he gave me a jump. I thought the music was quite charming when in the light, but it felt like it was either the same or very similar pieces of music throughout the entirety of the game, meaning that I lost interest in the music over time. Finally, the eerie feel of the game made the game quite creepy, thus drawing me into what was going to occur next.Unfortunatley, what was bad about the game greatly outweighs what I felt was good about the game. First of all, The switching between light and dark was very interesting to begin with, but eventually it just got annoying on how much in interfered with the world around the character. Also the transitions between the two modes had a glitchy effect (which was understandably used as it portrays the character's fractured mind), which was just very distracting after a while and simply it affected gameplay too much, and also caused me to die various times.There are levels where the map is pitch black and the only way to see is through pools of light that are emitted through either you, enemies or objects around you moving. This just hurts my eyes and makes it even harder to concentrate on playing the game. Then when there are no enemies or objects around you, you can't really see much of what is ahead of you and end up either progressing very slowly, or running into something bad that doesn't emit light.The story was very vague and really quite confusing. It is shown through three or four sentences of monologue in certain places in the game. I say confusing because when you approach the area where the text is shown, it's not specifically the start of the section of the story, meaning that you not only have to wait for all of the sentences to be played, but also figure out which sentence makes the most sense to be the first. After you do that, you find out that you have to do it all over again when you switch to the light or dark...The main character isn't the best protagonist, being very neutral with emotions. I think that they could have devoloped on movment animations as the slowness of it also affected the gameplay, particularly in the parts where you have to be quite quick.Overall, due to the amount of negativities, I would give this game a 4/10, but if you are still interested in getting it, I would highly recommend getting it in a sale."

While it has functionable gameplay, it has a major technical issue, a poor options menu, is short, and has a terribly uninteresting and vague story.One of the biggest issues this game has is that it doesn't save your progress. When I returned to the game, after saving and quiting, I found that the game hadn't saved my progress which is why it took me 14 hours to beat the game when it should have taken five at most.The game's replayability is low. It has several levels, a few levels that are unlocked when you beat the game, and some gameplay modifiers that you can find in the campaign. I'd like to address quickly the supposedly creepy atmosphere this game has. It isn't creepy.And lastly, the game's ""story"" is boring, angsty, melodrama. I say story in quotation marks because the game is missing most of the story. The story is vague and missing details that would give it context, intrique, or tension. I couldn't understand the main character's motivation for one of his actions that drives the entire story. The story also does a poor job explaining the story. For example:Why did the main character run away?orWhy did the little brother die?orWhat was wrong with the kid's family?or why is this kid so angsty? And probably a dozen other things I could think of. There is a complete lack of any substantial narrative structure or characterization of the main character or anything that would make me interested in the story. I was so uninvested in the story that by the end, I just wanted something interesting to happen.The ending is a choice you make by choosing one of two literal paths that determines if the main character lives or dies. I let the character die because I couldn't sympathize with this extremely angsty and non existant character."

But here's the problem I never felt bad for our main character, because I could not relate with him, for people with depression you could but if anything this game should make you more depressed for the people with actual depression, and if you want to relate for this character but you don't have depression (say like me) than you're S.O.L. It's way to slow to do the simplest things, making the already atrociously cheap difficulty even more irritating. And to pour salt on the wound this was made by the same people who made AVGN Adventures. You know that fun, colorful, and visually stunning game (for what genre it is anyway), and while most would say that AVGN Adventures has cheap difficulty as well, it's actually rather fair becuase most of the time I blame me for failing multiple times not the game or it's controls, not to mention that it's a game featuring the nerd obvioulsly it's going to be difficult. But this game sucks all color, fun, and it all looks bland. So no I do not recommend this game for anybody who's expecting the same amount of quality of AVGN: Adventures. All in all very poor follow-up."

I also felt that the game didn't serve as a particularly powerful metaphor for grief, as it was intended. Here's my full reviewhttp://indieruckus.com/review-disorder/"

The story might grind on you depending on your tolerance for people who are intensely deep in their own despair. I will warn you that the game might have framerate issues and bad slowdown once you get to certain areas that have lots of projectiles and effects going on. It gets worse if you're running it full screen. Disorder would benefit a lot from a consistent 60 frames per second on lower end machines."

76561198087313362,Not Recommended,322080,35060861,Posted: 19 September,all,john_ergine,The dark story of loss and mental illness cannot hide the fact that this is a poorly executed little platformer with muddy controls. It is also badly coded and will in some levels drop your FPS to 10-20 even on a high end machine.
