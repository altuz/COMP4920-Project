,Recommended,322170,26449587,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Woony,"I definitely love this game. I would totally recommend it, though I should probably list a few pros and cons.Pros.- The music is breathtaking.- Contains a level creator for those creative minds out there.- The level design (especially in some user made levels!) is amazing.- The game is dirt cheap.- It's a great challenge to those who want a difficult game.- It serves as a good excuse when your monitor gets destroyed.- Icon/vehicle customization.- There are a whole bunch of achievements, icons, and colors to hunt.- A very simple game to learn the controls of (you pretty much only press one button.)- A Lenny Face icon unlockable.- It's absolutely addicting.- You can get it on mobile as well, and create a GD account so you can sync Steam and Mobile together, getting the ability to save and cross over your progress.Edit; - With the challenge this game brings, comes a massive feeling of triumph after completing a level that makes all the trouble worth it.Cons.- Despite the simple controls, the game isveryhard to master.- Very prone to causing rage.- Can elicit crippling depression if you fail at a high percentage.- Most levels contain flashing lights. This can be disorientating and possibly trigger epilepsy.- The learning curve starts off very smooth, but once you get into a higher skill range, you must devote more time into gaining more skill. Not recommended for people who don't have much patience.- Can possibly make you clench so hard that you need to get out some prunes.But despite the cons, I feel this game is an absolute must have, and is worth every penny. Which, luckily enough, isn't too many. :)"

Most people who do get the game (on mobile), will normally just complete the first and second level, get bored, and delete the game. However, if you where to keep on playing, there is so much more to the game. Just look at my hours, it is my favorite game. There is a huge community creating amazing looking levels. You can get friends, which can send you messages and like your profile page. There are over 120 icons to get. Each one getting better as you progress. Currently there are 7 different game modes, which all of them having new looks that you can unlock for them. There is much more to this game than this, but I'm starting to right to much.

,Recommended,322170,20761605,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Glypha,"Geometry Dash is a challenging, one-button, colorful, techno rave that made me more emotional than many relationships.Part of the allure of Geometry Dash is its simple controls; more precisely control. One button performs an action such as a jump, flip, or other momentum change. The game is either having the button down or not down, and performing this task correctly takes you to the end of the level where you can celebrate your victory as you see fit. Me I like a simple smile and approving nod, but I'm a class act that prefers to hide his emotions in the name of stoic professionalism, even in my moments alone.This game is a grown up version of The Impossible Game who filled out quite nicely and gets much deserved attention. The look of the game can change substantially from level to level, particularly for the user submitted content, as can the music, but it is often colorful, minimalist, and very stimulating. There's a lot of great music tracks, and the game levels often use those tracks to determine when buttons are pressed yielding a feeling not unlike dancing, but on one button, which yields a pure sensation of rhythm.There is a practice mode which is the preferred method for learning a level as death does not send you back to the beginning, and you can practice many areas repeatedly, although the real game is finishing real mode where you do the whole level in one shot.Achievements in this game are linked directly to customization options for your beautiful little shape man. Coins are collected in level and linked to achievements, and the unlocking of additional levels. They are a challenge though, requiring rerouting through a level to pick up. Once collected the stage must be finished, so it seemed prudent to leave these until a level was well learned, unless you learned the level in the way through picking them up.There is a massive amount of content for this game thanks to the user friendly creation tools in a variety of difficulties from, ""I tried everything to fail and couldn't, but what a trippy roller coaster"" easy to ""I failed a thousand times on practice mode and desperately searched for something near me cheap enough to break"" hard. There's a reason they're called demons, and it requires dedication to slay one. Remember that this game is not your friend.Geometry dates back to the 6th century BC, and the first identified arithmetic related relic listed Pythagorean triples arising from geometry. The term dash can refer to a small quantity, typically when cooking. This random fact is brought to you in part by dashes from theOriginal Curator Group."

,Recommended,322170,25796075,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Clearwater (G.E.W.P),"If life is all about learning to trust your instincts, then this game teaches you to go against them.Geometry Dash is a die-and-retry 2D platformer, in which you control a little cube/UFO/ball/whatever it can transform into, and try to reach the end of levels designed to be right at the end of the difficulty spectrum. Many of the levels - both official and user-created - are eye-clawingly difficult and rage-inducing, and punishment is swift: If you collide with an obstacle, you're sent back to the start in less than a second. But it's simple one-button controls and excellent music (The official levels feature music from artists such as Waterflame, F-777, DJ Nate and many more, with custom songs from Newgrounds being available to download in-game for user-created levels) will always make you come back and try again. And fail again. And try. And fail. Until the day comes where you can finally remember to not hit that fake spring, jump over that invisible spike and finally make it to the end.PROS:Excellent music from a variety of artists in the EDM genreSimple yet effective graphicsPick-up-and-play controlsOne of the most addictive games I've playedEndless amounts of user-created contentIt's only 3 Euros!CONS:Excrutiatingly hard, not one for those who rage easilyIn contrast to the price, the Android/iOS version is cheaper (Only 1.50 Euros on Google Play Store)Overall: 9.5/10. Even if you already have the mobile version, the PC version is an excellent excuse to double dip. Very highly recommended from an experienced Geometry Dasher."

I have invested hours upon hours (possibly over a hundred, to be honest) on mobile, it's basically one of the only mobile games that I think are amazing. Anyways, to the review.In a short summary, Geometry Dash is a fun, but challenging 2D arcade game, where you are a square that has the ability to traverse levels through many different states. These include ""Ship,"" ""UFO,"" ""Gravity Ball,"" ""Robot,"" and more (usually every occasional update). They each have their own function, all controlled by a press/click. You pass the obstacles, go through the level, and finish. You either usually earn a certain amount of stars and/or coins, which are hidden in the level.What I really love about the game:- THE MUSIC! The tracks are immersive, and give a fun feel to the game, as the levels follow the beat.- A LEVEL EDITOR! Get your creative on, and have a good time making fun (easy or difficult!) levels that play to your choice of music (you can choose the ""official"" tracks, from the main levels, use music from community levels, or grab a track off Newgrounds, using its code.- CHALLENGE! Every (main) level has its own difficulty. GD rates its levels, from ""Auto"" meaning you don't do anything at all, you just watch, to ""Demon,"" meaning usually quite difficult levels.Bonuses:- SKINS AND CUSTOMIZATION! Skins and colors for all your GD needs, from your regular square needing a little makeover, to making your ship look epic. You unlock skins and colors by completing levels, map packs (did I forget to mention that?), Demon levels, collecting coins, and more! Secrets [sure, call them easter eggs xd] also lay around, hidden in plain sight...- ACHIEVEMENTS! For those achievement go-getters, all in-game achievements are counted as Steam ones. Steamy!- PRACTICE MODE! Okay, so you've had enough of dying in one particular level. You get frustrated as you get to that one part you always fail at, then end up returning to the start. BUT WAIT! There's practice mode! This way, you can place checkpoints, helping you get better at overcoming your difficulties.- COMMUNITY LEVELS! Players can create levels (as I have mentioned before), and publish them into the game. If they're really good, it can get on to ""Featured""! Of course, you'll have to compete with those who have experience in level-making, so instead you can always enjoy (or try to, they can seriously be a task to finish) their entertaining creations.This remains to be one of my favorite games to ever play. Playing it on Steam is amazing, the graphics are greater, FPS is so smooth (shouldn't be a tough one to run, unless you're playing those really detailed levels - in the community). I also sometimes feel that using a mouse can be more efficient in control of your character; clicking is quicker. In addition, a bigger screen to play with is nice (sometimes my thumb interferes with my field of vision during mobile gameplay, as it's a smaller screen).The only warnings I have to say...- BRIGHT COLORS/FLASHES! I don't recommend playing this game with sensitive eyes... Lots of color changes/flashes. Could not be so great for some.- BEWARE OF RAGING... IT WON'T BE EASY, MY FRIEND. It's a game, have fun. Don't think you'll get it immediately. It will take practice, lots of practice for more difficult levels. Today's community levels can be insanity XD For some levels, I have dedicated thousands of attempts... And some I have yet to succeed. Don't give up!Hm... Is there anything else I would like to add? Multiplayer may be inputted in a later update, it's been predicted. I'd definitely love that (*cough* pls see this RobTop *cough*). Well, that should be it. I hope you consider this amazing game; it is worth every cent ($3.99, that's definitely a grab).I wish you good luck, have fun, and thanks for reading (this is a long review...) -~TR4NQU1L1TY~( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)7EDIT: Had to shorten it from original, 4k character limit wouldn't let me post :(Still, enjoy :D"
76561198149025221,Recommended,322170,30274112,Posted: 2 March,all,PeRFEcTcHAOs (MeNTALLyINsANe),"Geometry Dash uses a simple tapping/clicking system to control different vehicles that react when a player presses anywhere on the touchscreen (space/up key(s), mouse, or ""A"" button if playing on the PC version) and can be held down to constantly interact (on some vehicles). Users cannot control the speed at which the icon is moving, the only way to change speed is by touching a speed changing portal. The timing and rhythm of the in-game music are key parts of the game, often in relation to each other.The object of the game is to complete a level by reaching its end; however, if the player dies at an obstacle, they will have to start over from the beginning.[1] All levels (with the exception of the three Demon levels in the full version) are unlocked from the start, so they can be played out of order. Along the way, the player can collect up to three secret coins in each official level, which are scattered in either hidden or challenging areas (or both).[citation needed]The icon can take up to seven separate forms, which behave differently with each interaction. Forms themselves can be changed with seven separate portals, while the behaviour of these forms can be changed further with portals that include size portals, which change the size of the icon, mirror portals, which mirrors the game view, gravity portals, which change the gravity of the icon, double portals, that duplicates a reversed, anti-gravity version of the icon, and 5 speed portals that change the speed of the icon. All of these features give a variety of ways to play the game.If the player completes a level, he/she will be rewarded with diamonds and orbs that can be used to purchase icons, death effects or trails.Geometry Dash features 21 official levels, 18 of which are playable from the start. Each level has rewards when completing them.[1] 3 Secret Coins can be found in each official level, for a total of 63, these secret coins unlock 3 secret levels: 10 unlock Clubstep, 20 unlock Theory of Everything 2, and 30 unlock Deadlocked. (Until Update 2.0, Clubstep required twenty coins to unlock, and Theory Of Everything 2 required thirty coins to unlock.)These levels range wildly in difficulty; while some can be beaten by anyone, some require thousands of attempts to master and complete. Online levels can get even harder than the official levels, as repeatedly proven by the creators of these online levels. Over time, the ""difficulty cap"" has risen and risen to reach new heights each update, especially in 2.1 with levels constantly coming out.Levels are classified by difficulty, from Auto (Easy in the official levels) to Demon; in order of the levels' addition to the game, somewhat but not completely in order of difficulty.The stars represent the difficulty and the number of stars the player gets when completing that level. Also, official levels are worth more stars than custom levels. For example, Demon levels are rated 14 (as in Clubstep and Theory of Everything 2) to 15 stars (as in Deadlocked) for official levels, but only 10 stars in the custom ones.Geometry Dash has a practice mode that can be used for any level. Checkpoints are available in this mode, allowing for restarting at checkpoints instead of the very beginning. These checkpoints are marked by green, diamond-shaped gems, resembling those from The Sims series.Besides the twenty-one official levels, the game supports custom levels. To access these custom levels, the player must have the full version. Notable objects that can be used include blocks, rings, jump pads, portals, spikes, and user coins among others. Coins that are verified can be collected for new icons, or to be used to unlock the vault.The player must be able to complete their own level with all coins in normal mode in order to ensure that it is actually possible to beat. A level can be verified in separate attempts such as completing a run through in one attempt and then collecting coins in another; however any changes made to the level will make it unverified. These levels can either have the same music already in the game or custom music from Newgrounds.Each user-created level has a unique ID, which can be used to play the level without searching its name. As similar to the official levels, user-created levels are classified by difficulty, which is decided by RobTop, by players or ""level mods"" who can send a level to RobTop to be rated. Unlike official levels, they cannot be played offline unless they were previously downloaded."

I've seen the community and the game develop from time to time and it seems to get better and better. Geometry Dash is a unique Platformed-Based game that has grabbed the attention of millions of people. I think the game has sustained its popularity with the world and that's the beauty of it! Great work :D

Thinks, ""Wow, I bet I'll beat that level in under 5 tries too and get all secret coins!""3. Gets 30 secret coins after much sweat, tears, and rage in order to unlock Deadlocked.4. Plays Deadlocked for the first time without going in practice mode first.5. Dies at 1%6. Tries Deadlocked for 1,000 more attempts without barely making it past 10% of the level.7. Rages8. Repeat from #611/10 would rage and break my PC again, thanks rubrub.But anyway, Geometry Dash is a really frustrating to advance in a level but addictive and rewarding when you complete a level, and is a great game to pass time. I love the Map Packs, which are essentialy packs of levels which the levels are created by the community, and they make me rage as much as Electrodynamix did (I swear that level is a Demon level in disguise as an Insane one). Used to have this game on the phone but switched to PC because I always failed at easy parts and this game takes up a lot of space on the phone so I don't suggest getting this game on the phone, but it can be fun to play whenever you go. But this is all I have to say about this game, but I'll be back when RubRub makes us rage more with a new level soon on 2.1."

There isn't a life system; you can try as many times as you'd like to, even enter Practice Mode to study the level and familiarize yourself with the track.ReviewThe GoodThis game provides excellent music, all can be found on Newgrounds. They even allow you to get creative with a nice Level Editor. Major levels pre-made give you quite the heckle the more you dive deeper into the list, including the ones unlocked through secret coins. Players can even customize their forms in the game: Cube, Gear, Rocket, Robot, and UFO, and the trail, plus a color.The BadIf your reaction time isn't the best, some of the levels in this game won't be so fun for you, as the transition between the different forms can be quite tricky.

This game has a great community and its cool to watch it grow. It is well known on the ipad and now its on the pc.Only a few problems-The game is over priced, ok $4 isnt bad but I still think since you pay extra on the PC you should have everything unlocked. Now hold on I know thats a bit to ask for and its just my thought.[BIG ONE]4 words. Not Optimized For PC! It can get pretty annoying. Sometimes there are static lines going through the screen. It also gets blurry sometimes and it distracts you from the game. I am sure this can be fixed and I understand it may take some time.To conclude my review, I think this game has a great potential, I cant wait to see it get updated and grow on the PC version.

You can even make your own levels, and I really like it!So overall, I think Geometry Dash is a game worth getting.

I had this game on my phone for like a year and half before, maybe even 2, can't remember, so I can definitely say that this is a good game.The gameplay is really simple- You are a little block that jump, and you need to complete levels filled with many hazards and really good music. Each level is actually named after the song that plays in it. It's very simple, yet it's very fun, addictive, and really difficult too. The key is to listen to the music's beat to know when to jump, but sometimes it won't work, and you'll need to have a really good reaction time, and you'll have to remember the level's details if you lose.So in conclusion:Pros:+Simple gameplay that can be understood quickly, yet still fun and difficult.+Great soundtrack.+User created levels which can contain music that isn't from the game and taken from Newgrounds.+Customizable character/ vhicles, custom skin can be unlocked from achievements.+All updates are free and full of content. (Most of the time :P)Cons:-When you pause the game and then press the Escape button to resume, it actually closes the level, which is really frustrating after I've played so many games that you can use Escape to resume the game.

,Recommended,322170,18754481,"Posted: 29 October, 2015",all,Temporum,"Okay. First off, this is the most addictive game I have ever played. The awesome music, the determination to complete a level and the thrill of reaching the ""finish line"" all combine to produce a masterpiece. I can't even explain how amazing this is, but once you complete a level you just can't stop. You feel the pressure to play more and more and it just dawns on you that you've dragged yourself into a paradox where memory and timing are the ingredients to your solution. The things players do in this game are unbelievable: some of the levels are incredible whether they are easy, ""demon"", detailed or not (also, bear in mind that in order to upload your own level you must complete it yourself first).Second off: the customisation factor. As you can see in my profile picture, you can make your character look really cool. In order to do this; surprise surprise, you must play and earn achievements that unlock specific objects and colours. The icons in my profile picture are two of the hardest to retrieve: the cube is earned by completing thirty demon-rated levels, the ship is earned by retrieving 90 secret coins and the rainbow trail is earned by completing 10 creator-made map packs. Sounds difficult, huh? Well, all it takes is time and, as I said, once you start playing you cannot stop.That is all I really have to say for this sensational game: I'll leave the rest for you to find out. Overall, this is my second favourite game (behind Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a thrilling horror game) and I would recommend it to anyone."

I started with the cracked version of the game couple years ago and didn't expect levels to get that hard and some amazing updates. I remember first when I started playing, the first few levels were the worst and the hardest. It was so exciting to get 50% on stereo madness when I first played the game x3Went through some levels and it got easier every day, even though I kept failing. At that moment the first few levels were a peice of cake, but electrodynamix was a bit annoying, i kept failing so much I stopped being angry. Failed at 93% then 95% then 97%, but I kept trying and got it, same with the other levels. Getting angry at the levels is pretty pointless, unless you want people to laugh at you. Just keep trying and you'll get it.About the community....Well, one of the most supportive and nicest community i've ever seen. Those people will always say something nice, about your level, about yourself..anything really. I'm creating levels and looking back at my old levels..I can say they are not good, but people thought it was good, they said it was cool so I just continued on creating, those people helped a lot.One of the biggest reasons I love this game is cause of what people can create with the level editor (and the music, the music is awesome). I always thought the very first levels were cool, then I went to the online levels, my mind was blown. The beautiful, detailed, amazing levels that people can create it just insane. Bossfights, animations, custom backrounds, that was amazing to see. I started working on that too (I'm not a known creator, my levels are still bad compared to others x3) and hopefully to make something, and it kinda worked out. c:God damn typing all of this was hard x3 Anyway, awesome game, awesome people, lanny faces, awesome levels, awesome community. Playing it and still gonna play it for a long time. WE LOVE YOU ROBTOP X3 Over 9000/10"

,Recommended,322170,14045812,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,KRUSHER99,"On its surface, Geometry dash looks like a shameless impossible game ripoff, however, with a level builder able to construct  very hard levels, as well as easy ones, with an integrated ability to share your level.There are also more mechanics than one would find in the impossible game, such as parts where you fly around in a kind of jet, or one where you basically play flappy bird but fun.There are also hidden collectibles (coins), and after collecting 20, and 30 coins you will unlock new, insanely hard levels.Additionally, assuming the PC version will go the same way as the mobile version, there will be regular updates, bringing new levels.Finally, there is a practice mode incase you are messing up on one part of the level or can't find a coin on a level.This review isn't to say that it's a perfect game, because quite simply it's not. A lot of people won't like it simply because of its genre, and admittedly, as a mobile port it does have some major UI issues (it's probably what keeps this from going onto my favourites list, hopefully the developer fixes up the PC version and gets some proper UI).Overall, however, this is an extremely enjoyable game brought down by its UI problems, and not everyone will enjoy this genre.TL;DR:Pros:- Fun game, rewarding and challenging.- Level editor with built in sharing.- Plenty of levels, with updates bringing more.- Collectibles, which unlock new, hard levels.- Practice mode.Cons:- Major UI issues - may bring the game too low to buy outside of a sale.- Semi-niche genre, you may hate the game because of it.~7-8/10"

It has currently 20 different main levels you can play, with each level introducing a new element/design/gamemode/portal to it. The soundtrack is AMAZING. But it gets better. Unlike most games, you can actually make your own levels and share it with the world to play. You can like/dislike, rate the difficulty, and play every online level uploaded, obviously. This is a HUGE upgrade from the Impossible Game, which obviously was the idea and point of this game.There are some BIG cons however.First off, the community. The community is currently TORN with a mixture of different negative effects. There is racism, profanity, judgement, haters, etc. The community tends to always use overused memes, such as the ""Back on Track Demon"" for an example. Another thing is that creating levels just doesn't seem as fun anymore. It used to be making fun levels, but now all everyone cares about is decorative levels, but obviously not ENTIRELY true to most extents.Overall, this game is good. I personally don't like to get with the community anymore, as it has gone INSANE and will mess with your head. Some even thought about suicide over it. If you are going to play this game, just stay far, but not too far, from the community. This game is worth getting while it is on sale. While I put my recommendation of this game to ""Yes."" it is not ENTIRELY true. There are still some holes left to fix. I rate this game 7.5/10."

It may look like that at first, but this game (in my opinion) is way better than the impossible game. For one, it's currently cheaper, 2, it has a WAY better soundtrack full of techno music (mostly) and has many different parts in the actual game that make it stand out, like rockets, UFOs, jump pads, gravity switchers and more! It also has a lot of replay value. Even if you finish all of the normal levels in the normal ""Campaign mode"", you can play custom-made levels made by the community, or make your own and share it with others! This game is addicting, enfuriating, and all around awsomely hard. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun short game to play.The only problem with this game as of right now is that there is no easy way to record it. on the mobile version you can use Everyplay to record, but this version doesn't have Everyplay yet. So you will have to use an external recording program like FRAPS to record gameplay. Hopefully they add Everyplay to this version of Geometry Dash."

From the first level to the last, you will have a great rage inducing time, there are easy levels (Stereo madness) to hard (Clubstep).  Then you have that one level that only one person has beatin, without hacks (Cataclysm).  Although not all of us will be like the gods of GD, we will all have that same feeling of dying in the 90% range on a  very hard level, and then having to start over again.  But you will still have a good time smashing your keyboard and mouse at the same time for hours on end, trying to figure out how you just died, when you obviously jumped over that spike.

I stumbled upon this game on the play store by accident and started playing it.About 3 days of playing on the phone I became a god at it, I beat every level and wanted more. Ive been there supporting it in the back for years. Later on in school people always asked me to beat levels for them and said I was the best!!!. I was always the kid that people just saw and never talked to me, they singled me out and to hear this from other people encoraged me. I started becoming better and better and I just have this nostalgia when I think about it, When I was in my freshmen year I always played this game with a friend and had a blast, we always did challenges together to see who was the best, this game helped me meet good friends and I will never forget them.I still play this game to date and will always support it throughout its journey in updates. I am in the top 100 and want to set out to get to top 10. For me this game was importaint to me in my life, I will never forget this game and it will always be one of my favorite games alongside, Last of Us, Undertale, Pokemon, and year one Destiny.Everyone should try this game and see really why it can or cannot change people.

As you would expect, this game can get really frustrating, but beating a level (or even your highscore) is one of the most satisfying feelings out there. You will find hours upon hours of fun playing the main levels, and the player created levels online. Speaking of the player created levels, the level designer is one of the most user friendly I've ever seen. It's easy to use, and easy to understand. The soundtrack is phenomenal. All of the tracks are very upbeat and catchy, and they will motivate you to beat the level so you can hear more. There isn't anything negative about this game that I can think of, and for that reason, Geometry Dash earns a 10/10.I recomend Geometry Dash for both casual players who want to have some fun, and to hardcore players, willing to take on the insanely challenging demon levels."

There's a lot of challenging levels in this game (over 18 official levels plus countless creator levels) and that's what's been the main thing about the game (I think?).Pros:+ 20 Challenging Official Levels (it's beatable, just don't give up)+ Various game mechanisms to increase the challenge+ Practice mode (key feature, trust me on this ok? ;)+ Character Customizations+ A lot of Music (plus custom music from NewGrounds)+ Level Editor with near-endless possibilities+ Custom levels that are actually good (the numbers keep on growing)+ Awesome decos (good job RubRub)+ A social system (and also links to stuff like your Youtube account)+ It's still getting better (2.1 is currently under development now)+ Relatively cheap+ MoreCons:- The Community (some part of it is good, but some others are... well... I can't describe)- Re-post levels, spam levels and ""free demon"" levels (can we please have them removed)- Hack control isn't too effective (but hey, it's stil developing)- Updates are slow (but hey, it's better slow than never)Warnings:> Epilepsy (some custom levels)> Not reccomended for people who tends to slams things if they rageConclusion and side-notes:> Worth the 4 Dollars (36K IDR in my country).> Good for those likes challenging games> Don't get too upset with peeps insulting your levelWell then, have fun :D"

The simple graphics are more than enough to let you know your way through the level. The soundtrack is truly outstanding. This score could belong to major franchises and it wouldn't be out of place at all. The controls are perfect. I use DualShock 3 to play this game and it works well. Control wise the game is quite simple. You just have a jump button and that's pretty much it. It's quite deceiving because they make you do a lot with only one button. There are antigravity and flying sections. That makes the game a lot more challenging and help to avoid the feeling of ""more of the same"". You have to adapt if you want to survive. Some levels are so hard that you have to try over and over. It took me more than 100 attempts in some levels. The game displays in the beginning of each stage the amount of attempts you took as if it was trolling you. The counter gets high pretty was. If you die at 95% completion you have to do it all over again (but you win a achievement for that lol).Unfortunately the game isn't perfect. Some deaths feel pretty cheap. I'm talking about the times you go through a portal and you don't have enough time to react. Most of the times you will die the first time you go through a portal. That could be solved with a sign telling you what the portal does. If a portal has antigravity they should let you know. The portals change colors but that doesn't tell the player anything. You have to react quickly but sometimes during these transitions it feels like the game was unfair to you. They should present the gameplay mechanics first in a safe environment before - flying sections for example - before they ask you to do it risking your life.I'd recommend it to anyone who is a bit of a masochist and loves games such as Super Meat Boy or even Dark Souls. This game can be harder than these games in some levels."

All I had to do was understand the games physics and what you could do. But every human brain on this planet always no matter what situation you are in... Will go for the easy route out.

But most of the community base is toxic (except for some good people) which is why I choose to ignore the community.I love this game's creativity potential, and the level editor, all the online levels make it so that there is unending fun to this game, and alongside the 2.0 update, there was an even higher added chance for creativity, and levels became way cooler as of this update.So come on down and enjoy the game, listen to the music, celebrate at your victory, rage at your 98% fail (happens to many times), and give yourself an enjoyable challenge.See you in the spike pits ;)"

Feel the beat of the music as you go through levels in the game. The more progress into the game you make the harder it gets and your rage may get even higher. Some nice features to the game are you can play other levels made by other users (online levels) and you get to make you own level if you want to.

,Recommended,322170,23210921,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,HysDomLeg,"Geometry Dash is a game that is incredibly easy to learn, while simultaneously providing a delightful challenge to master. It has very creative visuals, and it teaches the player what to do in a very natural way. It coaxes the learning out of the player, which means that there are no tedious tutorials to try to get through as quickly as possible.The level editor means that there are plenty of user-designed levels, and the featured list is very good at giving you very well designed levels. Not to mention that the level editor is extensive, allowing you to use a large variety of tile types, enable and disable snapping, rotate blocks, use layers, change the level's colors, and use custom music from Newgrounds. Plus, there's no doubt in my mind that there are a large number of features in the level editor that I haven't even seen yet. It's limitless - it even allows you to listen through whatever track you're using and click/tap on the screen with the beats to create guide lines WITHIN the level - something that is invaluable for syncing up your jumps, falls, and other movements with the music. The developers did a stellar job with this.The game runs very well, and there are plenty of settings that you can alter to fix it in the instance that it doesn't.The character customization options are a nice touch to an already great game.This game provides virtually limitless content for an extremely affordable price. Finally beating a level is very satisfying, and the practice mode is very helpful for getting there. However, I do have one complaint for the practice mode; the auto-checkpoints do tend to screw you over from time to time. Luckily, you can disable them easily, and manually setting the checkpoints uses a button that is very natural and not even in the slightest bit out of the way.The variety of ways to control the game work well. By default, you can use the space bar, the up arrow, or the left mouse button. Personally, I prefer the up arrow, but the great thing about this is that it gives the player the choice to use a button that is most comfortable for them.The number of collectables makes this game all the more fun. Each main-game level has three star coins, similar to New Super Mario Bros. These coins let you unlock some of the later levels. Then, a lot of the map pack levels have a different type of coins, which you can use to unlock different secrets, which I'll let you figure out for yourselves. The collectables give the levels a lot of replay value if you miss them the first time, and if you get them all, then you have all of the user-generated content to move on to.Ultimately, this game is amazing. It's incredibly inexpensive, and I would have been willing to pay thrice what I did to own this game on Steam. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys challenging rapid-react games such as Super Hexagon or The Impossible Game. You'll get hours of fun out of this game - trust me. I just got it yesterday, and I've already racked up four hours!"

First off, the game is well developed, with very minor and uncommon bugs (mainly lag skips every few levels). The game's music is absoloutly amazing which makes a great positive. You have tons of different colors to customize the tens of icons you can UNLOCK (yes all of them!), which makes the game customizable, and more fun. The only issue with this game, which is why i still do not play it much more... (i played more on ios which explains my play time) is the difficulty. Out of all of the time ive spent into this game (not to mention enraging moments included) i can not beat the 9th level out of around 16 i beleive. You can download hundreds of different levels, at different dificulties. This game takes major hand-eye cordination, patience, and some incredibly fast reflexes which are hard to master. I do recommend this game to people who have played things like Bit trip or have played the ""impossible Game."

It is so fun to play. It seems like the user levels are much better on Pc than iOS. The only problem is that occasionally the clicks dont register, but that only happens when im on the edge. Also, never use the space bar to jump. Using the mouse it alot easier. Also, if you have epilepsy, you will probably die. Most of the levels are really flashy and have tons of flashing lights and sh!t."

,Recommended,322170,17189364,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,◄Problematic Toad►,"""10/10 - More addicting than weed!"" - my original review, boy was I unfunny....I feel like I really should give a much better review than just a dire attempt to be funny, so here we go.MUSIC:If you enjoy electronic music, of all genres, you'll enjoy the music here. The soundtrack for the main levels is brilliant but thanks to custom levels, you can play levels with a large array of music since you can download lots of songs off of newgrounds. The music is perfect in this game.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay involves your character auto scrolling from one side of the level to the other, avoiding obstacles on the way. Whilst the gameplay is very simple (for the most part only requiring one button) the level design in the game allows the gameplay to feel dynamic, challenging and rewarding. If you enjoy trying to improve your skills in a game without an upper limit then this is for you. The gameplay also gets more interesting in custom levels as some people have managed to invent all new gamemodes, such as swingcopters. Overall, the gameplay is very good but could get boring for some people.REPLAY VALUE:This game has the most replay value out of any game I have ever seen thanks to it's custom level system. This means that there is a gigantic array of levels with all sorts of difficulty levels and creative deco and gameplay right at your fingertips. There is also a level editor which allows you to create your own levels very freely.CONCLUSION:If you enjoy platformers and a good challenge this game is for you, it's fun and creative, allowing you to lose more hours you can afford. The music is excellent and the custom level system will give you loads of replay value. However, the gameplay can get stale after some time, even I have taken long breaks from this game due to being tired of it.Overall, I give GD a 9/10"

You can use different forms other than the regular platforming cube that simply jumps up and that's it. As of my review, there are 6 different forms: Ball, Robot, Wave, Square, UFO, and Ship. There is, however a new form that seems to be a spider, that has yet to come in update 2.1.SquareThe square is the most basic, and most common form used. You click, the square jumps. You click a jump booster, (These can be located through levels and let you jump in the air when you click while on them) you jump. It's really as simple as that.BallThe ball also carries a very simple movement ritual, as will the others that follow. The ball is basically just a gravity switcher that lets you switch from traveling right side up, to going and changing your gravitational pull to make yourself go upside down. This, along with all other forms except for the wave and the UFO can use jump boosters to, you guessed it, jump.ShipThe ship is controlled by holding the click/spacebar to go up, and letting go of it to go down. It does have a little bit of a smooth, not harsh movement to it, so if you're heading down and quickly need to fly up, you're problably already dead because it takes a second to lift up it's nose and start going up. You should look ahead so you don't have to act out of immediate surprise, and rather act with prior knowledge of the danger that is ahead.WaveThe wave is essentially a ship but with a few adjustments. It is controlled the same, but it has more of a jerk than a soft lift up, or fall down. This is both useful and frustrating because if you flop somehow you could be instantly dead, because this form needs a LOT of focus. It quickly flies up or down at the snap of a finger.UFOThe ufo is controlled like flappy bird, you tap to go up, and press nothing to fall down. There's not much explanation needed for this form.RobotThe robot is essentially the square with a higher jump boost off the ground. Through my play, I haven't seen this in many community levels, but it is a fun form to use.Pros.Extremely fun and addicting gameplay.Millions of fanmade levels.Hard working devs with updates happening as fast as they can perfect them.Limitless creative opprotunity.Great value.No idiotic DLC packs or wallet disintegrators.Much moreCons.Strange glitch caused by libcocos2.ddl that prevents game from running, this glitch appears randomly and can happen at any time (If your computer doesn't suck it MIGHT help)(Update) I fixed the bug, and geometry dash works fine again.This game is overall stupendous. I rate it 10/10. I might not have explained everything correctly, I appologize if i didn't ;-;"
