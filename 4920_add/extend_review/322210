,Recommended,322210,15651469,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,XShadowY,"No grindy unlocks, no boring collectibles, no superficial score or time counts... this is raw, baby!...and I love it for that!I`m a little tired of the flood of typical 2D side-scroller with their 8-bit looks and sound. A pixelated look does not necessarily deliver an old school gaming experience.Well, this game here comes very close to what I think is a very good ""gaming in the 80`s experience"" and it does so without the blocky look of its competition. And it`s pure survival, no leaderboard race...What fascinates me, besides the artwork and sound, is the flow of events you take part in. The weapons, enemies and levels are very well designed and after a while of playing you feel like the main dancer in a gun ballet...You can handle each situation with your standard pistol, you are never defenseless, it`s just a little bit more fun to take out the other surgical instruments. Some guns are better in specific situations, but basically you could use the pistol throughout the whole game and this, in my opinion, is very good game design.And if you solve a tricky situation with just your standard piece it will put a huge grin on your face.What else makes me smile all the time? The reloading animations and general physics engine!It`s just fun to see (and hear) how your guy is reloading the good old double-barrel shotgun, and the empty cases gently sliding down an elevation. After reloading the pistol he is even pulling back the slide...The levels offer a great variety of putting your gun ballet dancing to the test and are well balanced. At some points you just need to rush through a room guns blazing and then there are other moments in which you can pause and hide behind an obstacle......and speaking of the grin you got while playing: The chain reactions caused by a misthrown grenade are just hilarious.So, my final words regarding this game:To the developers: Where can I sign-in for a monthly subscription of more levels, enemies ... more everything?To you: Never forget to reload your gun after a shoot-out!(If you don`t ... meh, it doesn`t matter anyway, if this game is your thing you will just smile and return ...double prepared this time, of course)If 2D enforcing for the mob is something you always wanted to try this game is an offer you can`t refuse!"

,Recommended,322210,17677142,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,[slckr]robilar5500,"Alright, this was a fun game that definitely shows its fondness for the Metal Slug series.As far as this game itself, it was over the top silly, with super exaggerated voice acting that was at times hilarious. The story was actually pretty cool such as it is, and was a pretty unique take on how a zombie outbreak might begin. You play as a hitman/enforcer, Vinnie Cannoli, sent by your boss to pick up a dude named Frankie who is held by a rival gangster family.♥♥♥♥♥♥just gets out of hand from there, lol.The graphics were really cool looking. Very cartoon and gangster Noire all at once, with vivid colors and striking landscapes, minimalist as they were.The enemy variety is fairly limited, but the game isnt long enough for that to really matter. You basically have a couple different types of a few different enemies (zombies, zombie rats, gangsters, and military).The gameplay was pretty fast and furious, with an assortment of cool weapons that you find along the way and can scroll between on the fly. Ammo isn't generally scarce although you will have some barely eked by with not much ammo left moments. Also, health packs are in the form of cannoli, lol, which Vinnie seems to love and comments on pretty much every time. This alternates between funny and annoying depending on how many times you here it in a short span of time (such as if there is a cannoli at the start of a boss battle which you keep dying in). Speaking of boss battles, there are pretty much three of them, although the last has several parts to it.What else? Lots of jumping around and blowing stuff up. Some platforming mixed in.Oh, and the script was strictly followed by the voice actors. They embellished a lot, as is evidenced by the fact that the subtitles wont necessarily match what is being said. It works though. You can tell they had a lot of fun with it, and that is a theme that carries through all the aspects of this game. Just the right length to keep you interested and allow you to appreciate the labor of love which was created here.Holy Cannoli! I give this 9 drunken, St Patties day gangsters getting in your bullets way and being eaten by zombies out of 10 possible."

,Recommended,322210,25384710,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Ivan,"""MHHHHH THAT'S SOME GREAT CANNOLI!!!!!!""This is a good one to review, at least for me because it just has everything it promises in the store page description.When it first came out, it caught my attention just because of the name and the 2D Artstyle that reminded me of 'Thing Thing Arena' and the  'Metal Slug' series  plus some other games I enjoyed quite alot.The price tag has always been very low (10 bucks at launch) and it has been on sale multiple times before I finally bought it a couple of days ago. At this point I regret having waited so long because it's just that good.I planned to get this for myself to play occasionally and calm down after work - buuut it only took 2 sittings (~2h each) with a coop partner and we finished it in 3.7 hours. So you may expect a little longer playtime if you go in solo.I am not disappointed at all because it was cheap, on sale and visually stunning.It's a simple game with 'easy-to-learn-controls' and satisfying combat with a vast variety of weapons including: Revolvers, double barreled Shotgun, RPG's, hell even a gun that electrocutes people (like that Tesla gun in 'Wolfenstein 2009'). All of these are fun to use and some are more useful in certain situations than others, but overall well balanced.You have a great variety of enemies as well ranging from rats to humans to zombies, even a goddamn airship, mostly containing even more varieties within the enemy type like flying goblins and relatives of Left 4 Dead's Boomer.The story is, as the title might suggest - not the most serious one - but I can tell its definitely funny and full of stereotypes about the Italians in a plot that has been seen in so many Mafioso movies / games. But this one doesn't even take itself too seriously and delivers in style, guaranteed to at least make you smile while playing it. I wont spoil too much but it contains betrayals, zombies and 3 interesting boss fights.So all I can do is strongly recommend this game to everyone who loves to relax with just fun pointless gore. You have to like the genre to like this game; but if you already do I assume you already picked this little jewel up by yourself.The graphics (wich are handdrawn as far as I could see) are truly amazing for an Indie Game and I wonder if the developers (Crazy Monkey Studios, Claeys Brothers)  have plans on making a sequel or similar games; I am definitely looking foward to it!One last word about co-op and Achievments; it has local coop only (up to 4 players) and i had no problem using the Xbox 360 Controller and Keyboard that uses controls somewhat similar to the older Lego games which is fine by me.Achievments are fun to get, full of references and occasionally challenging and I think that is what motivates me to play it again sometime on harder difficulties.Hope I wasn't testing your nerves too much writing this and hope I could give you a small glimpse of what this game is about and help you deciding to give it a try or not.Take care bois n' gurlsThanks for reading Stranger;<3 bise bise from Paris"

,Recommended,322210,15681422,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,WASP.Killer,"A very good 2D platformer.  I downloaded the demo which consists of the complete Bonnino's Stripclub level in October from Mod DB.  It was an immediate hit at my house and got put on 4 gaming PCs.  Having bought the full game I'm equally pleased and it's good to see so many positive reviews.Anyway the demo is still available and I recommend you DL it.  Note, the demo only supports 2 player co-op while the released game supports 4 players.  Co-op usually makes most games easier but not this one (at least the demo version).  I think this is a plus as you can't simply spam your way out of trouble.If you play on ""easy"" (one of the 4 skill levels) you can complete the game in about 3 hours (and much faster if you speed run).  However, to gain 100 percent achievements you would have to play on impossible and this will make some of the achievements really hard so you would be wise to do a run through on easy and then play again on impossible."

You are Vinnie, a mobster and you have been hired to free a man from an opposing mafia gang. As you arrive in a city that resembles New York, you are welcomed by hordes of zombies. That's where your story begins.Pros:- simple but good story- nice, bloody splash effects- eight different guns that feel very unique- well balanced on normal difficulty. Bosses are a little hard but manageable.- beautiful, smooth graphics, no glitches- nice, discreet selection of songs from the 20's- very good voice acting- great comic style- limited amount of ammunition. I liked it because it forces players to use all weapons.Neutral:- the game is short. I finished it in less than seven hours but if you play it in a rush or on easy difficulty you can probably finish it in five hours. Some people might say that's too short but given the fact that it's not an AAA title I think it's OK.Cons:- most of the remaining achievements after finishing the game on normal difficulty are extremely difficult to collect.- switching weapons via the controller is a little cumbersome, at least in the middle of a fight. That's because you have to cycle through eight weapons.- cutscenes are a little blurry- achievement for finishing the game on easy difficulty does not unlock after finishing the game on normal difficulty"

Everything seems to be upside down in this town and soon you will find yourself in a action-packed story fighting zombies (1920??????) , gangsters and the military.Your arsenal is very thin at the start of the game, but it will increase quite rapidly, and thank god for that! The likes of the 2 barrels shotgun, Magnum, Thomson (machine gun), grenades, Molotov cocktails, Bazooka and even a Flamethrower will be put at your disposal to kill all your enemies!This game has a marvellous atmosphere with its cartoon graphics and superb soundtracks. The levels are well designed and if you are like me, starting most platformers at the normal difficulty, you will probably find this game a tad challenging.In terms of the controls, you can use a game pad or your mouse and keyboard. I actually prefer playing it with the mouse and keyboard.Positives:~~~~~~~~-	Great cartoons style graphics-	Superb soundtracks-	Runs smoothly-	Addictive and really fun to play-	Trading cards-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Can be frustrating in some levelsA great game to own.

What is Guns, Gore & Cannoli about?1925, Thugtown is invaded by zombies. You are Vinnie Cannoli and your boss hired you to get someone safe and out of town. Trust me, there's no need to know more, as the best part are characters, situations, humour and gameplay.GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.Beautiful. Simply beautiful. The game is a cartoon platform, very colored, nice characters art style, most of them recalling stereotypes or movies (my character is the one resembling the Godfather, of course) and locations or enemies are often hiding some reference or gag as well.SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.I wasn't expecting that but here comes the sweet. According to the year there's some 20s band-like music with kind of a cheerful mood that gets in total contrast with the constant splatter situations through the whole game. Simply hilarious.GAMEPLAY. How does it work?Just like any platform. You jump, you shoot, you find weapons and grenades, there are bosses. I could call this a 1920s Metal Slug on steroids. There's a local coop mode with up to 4 players, because just like all metal slugs you enjoy it better with friends. Too bad there's no multiplayer besides shared screen.LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?Not much about the game, actually. It's more about technical issues, such as the lack of a multiplayer/coop online, or the ridiculously buggy joypad setup. Luckily for me I don't play with joypads, but it's quite embarassing when you set them up for your friends and every key binding gets lost every time the game starts, and once in game everytime we all die joypads lose association with the player, forcing us to set up everything again.TL;DR. Pros And Cons+++PROs+++THE GAME.A good platform playable in coop with friends, filled with humour and stereotypes about Italy.---CONs---NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.Which is nonsense. Shared screen is great until you try joypads, but There's no chance to play with friends online nor even on a Local Network, which is nonsense from a sale point of view.JOYPADS.The joypads association system is buggy. And I'm being generous while trying not to swear talking about how bad it works. Briefly: it doesn't keep settings even in game once everyone dies.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64"
,Recommended,322210,18648775,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,Bah,"Very quickly, I recommend this game with a caveat, I cannot recommend buying at full price. If you get cheaply or in a bundle, its a fun, playable little romp.A quick summarization of the plot of this game is simple, you're a mob hitman who has a job for your boss and the location is infested of the job is infested with zombies. Not much else to say! Its a fairly well crafted 2D sidescroller with some very nice art, passable voice acting, and music that fits the time period.My playtime is a bit skewed. At the time of this review, I have 4.8 hours into the game, but that is double my actual playtime as I was about to finish the main game around the 2.5 hour mark, but an update broke my save so I had to start over again. It's length leaves a lot to be desired needless to say.Pros:+ It looks great. The artwork alone is enough reason to install this game.+ Its fun. There's a decent variety of weapons throughout the game and blasting zombies stays fun. It has a lot of classic side scroller elements that bring back the old days with a modern coat of paint.+ The level design is fairly varied.+ There is traditional side scroller challenge to bosses that is reminscent of similar games from back in the day.Cons:- Extremely short. Almost insultingly so.- Local co-op only in a game that is screaming for online multi. It's 2015, not 1994.- Low replayability.This game deserves to be lauded for the heart that went into it. I really loved the artwork in virtually every respect. I could nitpick some aspects, but I don't think that would be fair because it succeeds in making a light hearted 2D zombie game within an era that is represented very well by the work that went into it. However, as I stated in my opening, I do not feel this game is worth the regular price of admission. It just doesn't provide enough gameplay if someone is on a limited budget. A multiplayer mode and some more depth to the single player game would go a long way in justifying its price point a bit more.Verdict: 6/10. Its good at what it is and worth playing, but its definitely something to wait to get on the cheap."

(and there are a lot)- you don't have a reliable melee attack to kill enemies. Kicking enemies only helps you get a few seconds to reload weapons. Unless you kick them into fire or off a rooftop.

Probably not but heck give this game a go anyway.Step back into the roaring 1920’s and face off against Johnny law and the prohibition. Of course Johnny law has decided that normal crime fighting is going to lose the war on booze so where else would they turn? Zombies of course. Step into the shoes of Vinnie, the wise cracking sociopath with a penchant for death and a hankering for Cannoli’s.This game is more fun than you can shake a stick at. Face off against hoards of the undead that come in all shapes and sizes. Want foul smelling football players or whip cracking corpse call girls, this game has it all. And not only the walking dead either, you have a fair share of gangsters, mutant rats and a soldiers to boot. All of which can be dispatched using your large array of assorted armaments.The comic book art style adds to the humour and leads to a truly unique experience, in my opinion anyway. The jokes are pretty good, the story is detailed and presented in a way that makes you want to play through to the finish and see how the truly disastrous adventure ends. The varied environments add to the overall doomed feeling of the city and its damned inhabitants. The score was nice and really lended to the time period.A particular note of interest that I had were the many varied ways you could kill your foes and the animations they brought about. I loved how much detail was put into the game and how each of the more unique weapons had its own way of melting, burning or blasting enemies to puddles, ash or guts respectively.This game is a riot and I had a great time with it. I would recommend this game to anyone even at full price. Also if you want a challenge try for the achievements, some of them are more nightmarish than a city full of blood thirsty undead.Have Fun ^_^"

You have health, human enemies have health, even zombies have health! This may not seem too bad on paper, but the existence of health in a game like this slows things down IMMENSELY. You have to take your time with each enemy as they come, and with very few exceptions take at least four shots to the body, two to the head. Human enemies are even worse, because they duck under obstacles for cover and throw grenades if you're a bit too trigger happy. Groups of five or more enemies at once, in an arcade-style game like this, should never have health.Everything else about the game is fantastic. The ability to kick enemies to push them away and temporarily immobilize them, as well as the requirement to reload, add a lot of depth to the game. The levels, along wih being very long (at least half of this likely due to the aforementioned health bar problem), allow you to take adventage of the kick and reload mechanics by giving you objects to duck under, and ledges where you can kick anyone stupid enough to attack you into the fiery pit below. Some enemies also have shields that require you to kick them if you want a good shot. Even if it does look a little bit too much like a GoAnimate cartoon, the dreary, cartoonish art direction certainly stands out from many other indie games on the market."

Its a fun run, however the single player is a bit too short for its own good; which will leaves gamers feeling kinda empty.The local/online multiplayer on the other hand,  feels a lot like its in its beta stage.

Instead the camera in multiplayer is static and kinda makes the experience feel kinda disappointing. What also doesn't help matter is the lack of variety and low amount of modes and stages to choose from in multiplayer. There's some fun to found in them, but its not very special and won't satisfy you for long, unless you're playing for lulz.Overall, this game is fun but feels kinda undercooked.

""Open world survival"", ""Metroidvania"", ""Retro insipred"" and so many other buzzwords that are flung around like toys in the hands of a spoiled child. And what Guns, Gore & Cannoli does different is put forth some real effort into graphics, art styles and voice acting to make a stellar side scroller that doesn't rely on dated ""8-bit"" graphics.The story is cheesy and entertaining, and comedic in the same way that the names of the characters in Airplane! were. You are Vince Cannoli, a local mob enforcer sent to Thugtown to do your job. However once you arrive, you find the whole town is in the thick of a zombie outbreak released during St. Patrick's Day. With a gun, a lot of one-liners and a desire to see his job through, Vince goes through the town trying to figure out why the hell this is all happening.Gameplay is fairly rudimentary, basic movement and weapons with little variation but easy to understand without going into elaborate details. The Graphics and Artstyle are the game's trick card, because they're stellar for what it is. While it is 2D, the basic look is comic inspired. And I don't mean ""Telltale's lazy shading"" I mean actually comic book inspired, like♥♥♥♥♥♥Tracy or The Shadow. Character features are slightly exaggerated while detail is still taken. Every gun can be positively ID'd, there's some intriquite detail behind both backgrounds and the various enemy types in the game and there are moments where I did go ""This is some impressive looking♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.So if you want a side scrolling shooter that isn't knee deep in 8 or 16 bit art style with a fun main character, solid gameplay, great graphics and options for local co-op, here you go. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is enjoyable as hell to play, and I'll applaud the devs for actually trying to make an interesting and different game in a marketplace filled with generic similar crud."

It has the side scrolling platforming that has an emphasis on the use of guns and requires you to use certain weapons for certain scenarios. It also looks to be hand drawn with breathtaking detail to scenery and to the characters that the game presents itself with. The game is made to act like an arcade game with an emphasis on the 1940's theme with a cartoon y atmosphere. The game has an emphasis on simplistic controls with the requirement of being engaged enough to react to enemy attacks and hazards into the environment that may be head over heels for certain people.emmersionThe game’s story is nothing to be impressed but fits into the atmosphere. Nice and tight. You play as a mobster who gets tangled up in a zombie outbreak and is tasked by the mafia to save a certain person before he gets himself killed. The game’s main protagonist doesn't take himself seriously with all the quips he makes when he gibs an enemy but doesn't ruin the story or theme with out of place emotions, acting like more of a Deadpool-esque character. The characters have a noir theme to them with mock ups of charging based enemies, big and burly and the slow, small enemies that are barely able to take damage. With the help of the art style, you know which enemy does what, even when you first meet them. The art style in the environment is hands down gorgeous with the same breathtaking detail to the likes of Rayman legends and Skullgirls. It doesn't have hand drawn animations, instead it has fixed images on the characters that have multiple joints so the animation may not be anything to brag about but the movement is nice.gameplayThe game play is satisfying to play. Not difficult like metal slug, but enough for anyone to pick up a controller (or a keyboard) and able to learn on the go. You are given a variety of weapons throughout the game like handguns, shotguns, machine guns, explosives, and the various rare exotic weapons with limited ammo.  The weapon selection acts like the one in various old fast past first person shooters, like Serious Sam and Quake. Gibbing an enemy or mowing down a legion of zombies or goons feels good, and seeing soldiers panicking and jumping out of their guard towers because you lobed a grenade in there and seeing it blow up with the people inside it feels incredible. The AI in the game is surprisingly quite intelligent, especially the ones that use guns. They will retreat when you get close and get out of cover when you lob a grenade or Molotov at them. the weapons in the game all have their uses and the game forces you to use variety, even the starting pistol feels great to use.the nitpicksI can only think of a few problems. Sometimes the placement of enemies can feel like a cheap kill, enemies with rocket launchers and mobile heavy machine guns will kill you with ease because you couldn’t see them, and there’s a phase in a boss fight that feels more like a chore more than a challenge, but it only lasts for a few minutes.conclusionThe game is great if you want something that looks as good as it plays and even for its short length, it’s a hell of a time to play. I recommend getting it if you want to be involved in a ridiculous task with minor slapstick comedies and racking up the kill count. If you want a meaningful story go play NEO Scavenger, Papers Please or Undertale which have a more meaningful choices and actually make you feel as if you’re involved in the world."

The game and its story is basically that you play as the mafia enforcer Vinnie Cannoli in the prohibtion time who is up against both rival gangs and hordes of different zombies aswell. The different enemies you are up against has different weapons and skills like some are fast runners and others are slow, some can be killed with one shot and others are more resistant and demands either more shots or with more heavy weaponry.The gameplay is pretty much to get from point A to point B while blowing enemies and a few bosses  to kingdom come. In the gameplay sense this game isnt very  original but where the game really exceeds itself towards other platformers is in the graphics,soundtrack and comedic departments. The graphics is like taken out from a cartoon and eventhough some usable platforms sometimes blends into the surroundings it all works very well together as a live cartoon. The soundtrack is also very fitting to the game with its jazzy toons that is like taken from the time period of the prohibition. The comedy of this game is really funny as it is as stereotypical as it comes in regard of italian american mafia flicks and mr cannoli often comes with a kliche' one liners about the guy/zombie whom he just blew to smotherines.This game had my attention from the first time i saw it but i wasnt sure it would live up to my expectations so i just bought it in the summer sale eventhough it wasnt really much reduced in prize and im really happy that i did that as this is a really great fun. Ive played platformers since sega master card system and on the amiga aswell so i have played my share of these types of games and this one is really great even at full prize. The only thing i can complaint a little about is the length of the game but still in my opinion its an acceptable one.Ill rate this game 8.5 out of 10 and its very recommendable for all platform and cartoon and gangster fans with a love for over the top comedic violence and funny one liners.

But all is not well. Before Cannoli has time to get his bearings, the ship is awash with rotting lunatics. Best grab your guns and persuade these walking stiffs to a horizontal lifestyle!Right off the bat the monster design, the guns, and the atmospheric soundtrack grabs hold of you and refuses to let go. Every gun has a purpose, every mob a weakness; it's up to you to experiment and find out what works. For example: Try getting close to the hatchet-throwing zombies and use your sawed-off shotgun.Now for the problems (and there are a bunch). The game gets pretty frustrating due to its sparsely placed checkpoints and punishing game mechanics. One unlucky jump and you're right back where you started. This is an issue, especially on mouse and keyboard, since you'll be doing a lot of jumping in this game.Then there are the boss fights, which are just tiresome. They break up the flow of the game for no apparent reason other than “here's a boss fight!”. And then you die, and have to start all over again.Okay, so here's a drinking game for you: Take a shot every time you spot a stereotype or someone says the word “Cannoli”. You'll be drunk off your♥♥♥♥♥in no time.On the bright side, I encountered one (count 'em, one!) bug in my entire playthrough.

,Recommended,322210,15922434,"Posted: 20 May, 2015",all,Happymartin,"When I first saw this game on Greenlight, I was interested but concerened, it looked ok gameplay wise, but honestly it looked like a typical garbage game from Newgrounds that you'd find common in Greenlight these days.Boy was I wrong. I was very wrong.Guns, Gore & Cannoli is like a expensive dessert at a restaurant, it's small, doesn't take very long to eat, and just like an expensive dessert, it's amazingly satisfying the moment you take your bites, chew it, savor it, and then some.In this game you play as a hired gun (He says he's an Enforcer for the Mob but it's never explained what family he belonged to), named Vinnie Cannoli. He was hired by a big time Mob Boss named Mr. Bellucio to travel to his hometown of Thugville, USA to find a guy named ""Frankie the Fly"". Seemed simple enough, but a few days before during Thugtown's celebration of Saint Patrick's Day, Zombies started appearing  from seemingly nowhere, and over the next few days it was overun.Your job? Gun your way through a bunch of zombies, 1920s Gangster style to find Frankie, uncover the mystery about the Zombies, and hopefully find a way to escape before the Military cleans up (as per Zombie anything cliche).The Gameplay is a side scrolling platforming shooter, like say Contra. You grab guns, ammo, and throwables to kill zombies, you move to the right until you reach the end of a level, simple as that right?Nope, Zombies are surprisingly challenging sometimes, but never to a point where it's impossible. Zombies range from the typical slow walkers, to rage fueled runners, fat guys that explode, gassy zombies that belch acid gas, and more. If you're not careful as you fight level from level, you can very easily die, as Health is only found at checkpoints, however it might appear that more health spawns on higher difficulties, this has yet to be confirmed.BUT, it's not all Zombies though, there are also living enemies too, like Mafiosos and the Military sent in to ""Clean Up"". They're even more challenging because they have the ability to shoot back with guns and toss grenades to keep you away.And  the Difficulty adds to that too. It's not noticeable on Easy, and it's kind of on Normal, but Hard mode is when poop hits the fan big time. We're talking more fast runners zerg rushing you, and big charging zombies taking almost 25% of your health off with each hit. I can't wait to see what Impossible brings.There are plenty of nice weapons to use on the Undead and not yet Undead citizens of Thugtown, from your 1911 with Infinite Ammo capacity, to the classic Tommy Gun, and others I won't spoil in this review.Level design is good, you'll never get lost or stuck, an the obstacles are tricky at points, but again, never impossible.Art wise I'm really impressed, Backgrounds and character design is nice and cartoony, the animation is also impressive too for a cheap indie game. The voice acting is also a nice touch, cheesy at times, but Vinnie's a likeable wiseguy, being an analgamation of just about every single Italian New York Mobster from the 1920s rolled into someone that kinda looks like Totalbiscuit with a fedora.As for how long it is, like I said in the beginning, it's not a long game, you can beat this in a day, but you will leave feeling so satisfied that you'll want to replay the game on a harder difficulty like I'm doing right now. But I imagine the game's length increases with the harder difficulties.Overall this game is a surprise, what I thought was going to be a one note Greenlight game, instead turned into a wonderful, and cheap, game that has replayability, and a nice speedy install time where you can just install and play the whole thing again later on when you're bored playing Triple AAA games.Pros:-A short but fun story involving Mobsters, Zombies, and Saint Patrick's Day-Gunplay is solid and feels good, with plenty of guns to play with.-Enemies and Environment are challenging enough to make you want to replay the whole game on harder difficulties, and since the story is short, you won't feel like wasting time replaying the same levels.- Well produced Art and Voice acting adds real charm to this game, elevating it from the typical artsy pixel games, and garbage runoff from NewgroundsCons:-No Online play, but I have a feeling that will change eventually if we ask the devs after a while, but otherwise if you've got a mate with you in real life, the 4 player co op should suffice.-Short Story, I really want more of this game, If these guys ever do a sequel, it should be longer and just as fun as this game is.Overall Opinion: You should definantly buy this game, it's fun, short and sweet, and only $10, probably less come Summer Sale."

It has a beautiful art style, and makes its levels very enjoyable to be in. The 1920's Prohibition-Era Chicago looks amazing, with several real world references (i.e. Capone's Soup Kitchen). The experience is mostly linear, with the only ""exploring"" being entering a door or window off the main path for ammo. The gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game, simple platforming elements in some segments, with linear 2D shooting being the main element. The basic keyboard controls were confusing at first, but you can customize the controls however you want. The story isn't much, but the few cutscenes are very polished and are filled with nice voiceovers of the characters. The protagonist is a mob enforcer, and he is can be sarcastic and makes several jokes throughout the game. The only real complaint I have, and it's only because I like this game so much, is I wish it was longer. This game is definitely worth your money."

,Recommended,322210,16848881,"Posted: 2 July, 2015",all,Franky,"My cousins and I are the true connoisseurs of the side-scrolling beat 'em up. Amongst are favourites are not just the obvious Battletoads, Metal Slug, and Final Fight, Streets of Rage, TMNT, and X-men Arcade, but obscure classics like Spiderman: Maximum Carnage and The Punisher (to say nothing of Comix Zone and other single-player excellence). To say that we like our side-scrollers co-opy and button-mashy is an understatement.We're also Italian and love Sopranos.So Guns, Gore, Cannoli to us is pretty much the dream game, and aside from some rough edges — particularly level transitions and its weird spawning system — GGC proved to be a welcome return to form for a genre that has been largely neglected.The corny story is actually very well executed, with nicely-voiced and drawn cinematics that break up the otherwise excellent gunplay and average platforming. The animation of the action, in particularly, is worthy of note; the flamethrower and electricity gun produce some very satisfying results. It all feels, plays, and looks very Metal Slug-ish.Piece by piece, you can easily tear apart the game's mechanics — nothing is really best-in-class here — but the parts are very much greater than the whole.Given that, it's not hard to recommend GGC if you're at all a fan of the side scroller and have a bunch of bros or broads to help you fight the good fight."

The harder enemies require either a specific weapon to effectively kill them or a specific tactic. The movements and sections seem somewhat repetitive but it's a side scrolling game and I don't think that could be any other way. The way the developer changes up the enemies from one climbing stair section to the next or changes obstacles around, makes each step new.I found this game pretty addictive the first time I played it and it was 3 a.m. on a work night before I felt like stopping. The game has a decent checkpoint layout and that makes it seem like bite-sized segments and I wanted to keep going. My only complaint about the game is that it is difficult to change directions quickly, especially when crouched and surrounded by fast moving zombies.Overall the game beats the old 80's side-scrolling games that I used to play in the arcade. I even found an old friend from the 80's in the game as well when I saw R2-D2 next to a trashcan in the foreground of an early level. Nice touch Crazy Monkey Studios."

Get it if you enjoy Metal Slug and the like but only get it if it's on sale, I don't recommended it at the current price cause, besides being too short, it doesn't have online multiplayer which is a must for these types of games in this day and age.I enjoyed the art-style, the high-res 2D graphics and animation, the 20s/30s theme and loved the music -tho it might get repetitive for some at some point- the variety of weapons is a plus, tho the way you change between them is unintuitive when you have many and in several occasions it can get you killed, 'juggling' through 'em all. There's different types of enemies, you fight more than zombies. On hard mode it proves challenging in many areas, especially cause of the AI which I really liked, I'm specially talking about the living ones, they sure do have more 'tricks' than moving forward and shooting and even then, there's also variety for the dead ones. I enjoyed the writing and the voice acting, the story is cliché and filled with Italian stereotypes which isn't surprising given the title but surprisingly it does have zombified, drunk leprechauns so for that reason alone you should get this game! A first in any genre, game of the millennium material right there.Really looking forward to Crazy Monkey Studios & Claeys Brothers' next game."

These games tend to be focused on reflexes, jump trajectories, shooting timing, like a shoot'em up with gravity. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is nothing like that.Believe it or not, with its badass lines, it's cartoonish look, and its promotional videos pumped with action... this game feels and plays more like a survival platformer where you can jump really high than an action game.Every weapons has to be reloaded. Its not just the counterpart to the infinite ammo of the basic small gun, you have to watch out for your clips so you don't get caught reloading with zombies on you. You only have so much ammo for each gun at any given moment, so you have to keep swapping weapons to keep a steady output of damage going on. Most weapon are only effective if you shoot the head (double damage)... but you can't aim, so you're constantly trying to kick enemies or jump up slopes to level your gun sight with the enemies' heads. You can't really outrun the running mobs, so each time they run on you while you reload, you have to run for a long time before safely turn back and shoot them. And when monsters manage to get a grab on you, you can only jump at the minimum height, you keep being stunned, and since it bumps your avatar sideways, your aim changes accordingly, making you shoot the ceiling instead of the enemies.The only working approach I could think is to walk carefully, take on small groups of enemies, always retreat when run onto, handle each situation separately and spare ammo so that you don't run out of it. This is NOT how a run and gun should be played, but that's the only way I can think of playing that game.So in the end I COULD recommend this survival gory game, but the physics are bumpy as hell. You don't lose life because the game is hard, you lose life because controls are hard.It's not very expensive though, so if you want to prove me wrong, be my guest and try it for yourself."

76561198061401443,Recommended,322210,26632109,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Triple Seven,"""More zombies?"" was admittedly my initial thought upon seeing this, but I'm pleased to say that my fears were quickly put to bed, because this game is loads of fun. This is a nice throwback to old-school shoot-em ups in the tradition of Metal Slug with a visually pleasing, cartoon-inspired look. The art style is charming and well done, and does a good job of invoking the stereotypes and cliches of the setting that it wants to poke fun at. The voice acting is solid, there's a good difficulty range for various skill levels, and there's a decent weapon variety. Don't expect level ups or character upgrades in the modern sense, but if you're a fan of the 1920s gangster aesthetic or want a good, side-scrolling shoot-em-up that doesn't rely too heavily on nostalgia to justify its existence, then you're in for a good time. Would absolutely recommend."

Guns, Gore & Cannoli takes 2D Action Side Scroller Shooting into a next level. Although a bit slow-paced and lacks on the variety of boss battles, the graphic looks great, the details on the guns and their reloading animations are just straight up sexy, the ammo management feels realistic, the cutscenes provide immersive experience into the story, and the classy music brings you back into the history of mobs and gangsters. It's a quite a well-made game for its price."

Let's put it this way if someone told me it was created by the makers of Metal Slug it wouldn't surprise me. Obviously Crazy Monkey Studio had to be inspired by Metal Slug because this game artistically looks similar and plays allot like Metal Slug. I applaud Crazy Monkey Studio for nailing this gameplay so well. I hope for a sequel and more games like this by there team.I highly suggest if you like run and gun Metal Slug or Contra style games you definitely buy this one, very fun, very good looking, 90's style 2d shooter, I can't say enough good things about this game. Enjoyable story, good cut scenes and even has a Smash Bros inspired 4 player vs mode in it too. A++++"

It has a taste of get-back-to-me as soon as you get the reflexes and the game mechanics in mind. Who would not like that game especially when you can enjoy a romp removing all your frustrations of the day playing and killing thugs and zombies ?  Go for it, with a blessing from Don Cortisone..."

There is a lot of guns and a lot of gore and some cannoli.  It's a fun little platform shooter.  The mechanics work well and there is a good amount of different zombie types to kill.  It's difficult in parts, but not overly so.  The game is short.  Right around 5~ hours on normal.  So I would recommend getting it on sale."
