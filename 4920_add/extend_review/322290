,Recommended,322290,15165020,"Posted: 1 April, 2015",all,changtau2005,"A cute Ys-style game from Falcom, originally released for PC in 2004 and ported to the PSP in 2007. The game's environments and BGM are quite relaxing, as you wander about the town, helping characters solve their problems. The voice dub is competent, if goofy in a way, and the characters are very well-drawn and animated. The art is very well done. Almost all of the various headgear and costumes you acquire along the way fit Parin rather nicely.There is a lot of attention to detail in this game. Stand Parin the protagonist next to a character dancing to his boombox and she will join right in. Characters go about their lives in town and might wander in and out of different buildings if you are looking for them. Parin in particular is full of personality, from the way she acts and how she responds to other characters.Gameplay-wise, combat is smooth, and the invincibility frames you get are very generous. It's not nearly as difficult as Ys, but some opponents are notably tougher than the rest though, otherwise this is a very child-friendly game. There are plenty of secrets to find and things to unlock. Truly mastering a stage would mean getting S triple + rank, so there is plenty to do.Criticisms incude: keyboard key-binding options are not the best and camera control with a controller is non-existent. The option for Japanese audio would have been nice, but Mastiff (the localization company) is looking into both of these at time of writing. The higher difficulty levels also need to be unlocked first.Games with unadulterated charm are rare these days, so give it a whirl if you like the genre."

,Recommended,322290,15132720,"Posted: 30 March, 2015",all,Valrion,"Cute Game;Voice acting is superb.Story is as cheesy as you'd expect after seeing the trailer.Rhythm Drilling = Crits which is kind of neat but not neccessary.Couple neat puzzles but its nothing you haven't seen before.Has secrets hidden here and there which give some stages some needed replay valueThis is a very face value game if you think its cute- -you'll probably like it.Keyboard controls are a bit awkward, for instance;Holding down right click and space bar at the same time makes your character appear to be doing a ""Space jump"" where she just kind of overs in position doing a lazy jumping jack if you move your cursor just a tad infront of her.Controllers however seem to work just fine. (i use an xbox controller.)This is a puzzle game which is also ironically its most challenging aspect; there are parts where it doesn't tell you where exactly to go next and so you must scavanger hunt. This can be semi-frustrating having you pace around in levels at random --or worse-- when you're in the right level and you miss exactly 1 breakable pot, chest or monster which ruins your S Rank which you need to acquire gold medals and ""master"" the stage.   Forcing you to retry the stage later.  Its one of those kinds of games but I'm just glad its not always easy.Fun Story: I got semi-trolled by this game early on when they had you guess a password and i guessed it right away but turns out the password was case sensitive which is why it said it was incorrect.After more playing; This game has all kinds of hats and costumes to unlock. Hats being very important as you will find yourself constantly switching them out while in the midst of your endeavor (one shows you where the ever-important loot is, one makes you immune to water damage, one makes you gain more coin, another hat for combat yadda yadda yadda..) I found myself switching to a hat to kill a monster then to another to pick up the coin then to another for the world traps but that's just me being nitpicky.If you're okay with an innocent sense of humor then I'd definitely give this game a shot.May your drill pierce the heavens; as Parin's cuteness has pierced my heart~"
,Recommended,322290,19206790,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,FissionChip,"TL;DR: Don't be fooled by first impressions. Gurumin gets better a couple of hours in, and is very nostalgic of N64 and PS1 era games, so a great one for sitting on the couch and devoting a weekend or more to!NOTE:If you don't like the English voices there's a zip of the Japanese voices here:https://steamcommunity.com/app/322290/discussions/0/611701999538422445/The English main character is probably better than the Japanese, but both suffer from lack of enthusiasm compared to the animation.REVIEW:This game does not present itself well in the beginning. The intro music is certainly an interesting choice in much the same way the unskippable movie it accompanies is - it reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon's attempt to appeal to ""the youth"", so it's just a bit cheesy. That sets the tone for the first little while of the game really, you just can't help but treat it with a skeptical:""am I actually going to enjoy this...?""after the intro. It's as though Gurumin saved all of its A-Game material for later, then realised it still had to actuallystartsomehow, so just threw in a montage of characters you don't know, to music that you weren't prepared for, then pretended it couldn't hear you when you told it to stop.That feeling dissipated over the next hour or so though as the game began to remember that it actually isn't bad(or maybe my hangover just eased...). The music gradually gets better throughout the game, comprising hints of RPGs from bygone eras intermingled with... well, bits of everything really! In fact some of the tracks are downright awesome despite being anything but the norm for this genre! The writing style begins to feel more familiar as it goes on, and for the most part delivers on the ""sensible chuckle"" humour; Though I do take issue with the more liberal translations, like adding""You stink!""where the original Japanese character just noisily pratfalled.The combat is a mixed bag of genuine challenge(read: oh-god-where-did-my-health-go)as well as confusion(like hitting fish underwater). To keep it quick; it gets better as it goes on, and you get used to the lack of feedback compared to more mordern games. This could have been better handled, but it's easily forgiveable considering this was aPSP(it was in fact released on PC in 2004 as noted by Genki in the comments. Thanks!)title originally released in 2004, and it plays well enough to be mastered if you're bothered enough to pay attention to the timing. You gain more abilities, weapon elements and upgrades as you go, all of which are up to you, so there's a decent feeling of agency here. There's even a special ""Beginner Mode"" which in addition to reduced damage and penalities, also stops ice from being slippery, which is just a really thoughtful feature! Gurumin could be great for all ages and player skills as a result, though younger kids might still need some help with the puzzles.There's also keyboard and mouse support which can be remapped before playing, and adding that to the high resolution capability makes this an example of a port done right!The big of the smalls is this:Despite initial apprehension and a couple of hours of admitted ""hrm..."", something kept calling me back to the game and I actually had a lot of fun! Maybe it's just that it reminds me of games from the Nintendo 64 or original Playstion, like Croc or Mario 64 or even Ocarina of Time, but I just HAD to play this game sitting on my couch in front of my TV. And... that's all I've done pretty much for 2 days straight now! And hopefully many more to come! This is a stupidly cute, amazingly solid, retro-console styled game through-and-through. So make use of the Steam streaming function if you can, and play it on the couch on the biggest TV you can find!Additional: Parin's animations are adorable."

I bought it some time back and played it for a few minutes completely disregarding it as a children's game. I regret not giving it a fair chance before. The gameplay is simple, relaxing, and really fun. The story is basic but keeps you entertained. RPG elements are present and satisfying.The only negative I have is the cruelly fiendish subhuman pervert - a grotesque armpit-licking derelict, whose birth certificate is an apology from the department of contraceptives, which keeps hitting on the main character."
,Recommended,322290,15260566,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,BorschtBoy89,"There's a sudden J-Jazz sequence about 20 mins that totally took me off guard... followed immediatly by a blue blob monster pop-locking to the techno blasting out of his boombox while lens flares go off everywhere.The best single word I can think of to summarize Gurumin is: Charming. The action is fairly simple, but not too boring. The story is cute without being overly Moe or cliche. The voice acting is actually very good, if a bit on the stiff side. The music is pretty good and worth mentioning as well, although I recommend turning the BG music down a bit in the pre-game config.This game is actually pretty remeniscent of MegaMan Legends, which is one of my all time favorite games. It doesn't QUITE stand up to that, but it does evoke similar memories.Not bad for the price, I recommend it if you're looking for a good Japanese action-adventure!"
76561198301533785,Recommended,322290,29025161,Posted: 4 January,all,Cactoos,"With first impressions in mind, it may be hard to decide if buying the game would be worth it. Certainly I was not the only one that felt the same way after reading some of the reviews on this game. After choosing to buy it, there was no regrets to be felt as the game progressed.The beginning can throw off gamers from seeing the true colors of this game. It almost felt like watching a cartoon with the 'odd' opening cutscene, full of characters you won't be introduced fully to until later, playing right after the setting is introduced. It is unskippable so prepare to watch it and its entirety. Afterwards, feeling skeptical about the game is totally natural. Eventually, this notion is more than compensated with the game's solid gameplay and attention to detail, specifically how the main character, Parin, reacts to people and the environment. As this game is a port from the PSP well over a decade ago, the developers certainly took the time to add in small details that made the game more enjoyable.The game ramps up difficulty fairly quickly and is proven to be a challenge, especially those who are unprepared. The combat seems to be on point with the game being somewhat forgiving when being damaged, also adding in how invincibility frames plays a role in survivability. However, bare in mind that the controls for some moves are quite sensitive and may activate undesired attacks. Overall, it isn't a terribly difficult game unless you are trying to attempt triple S rank on every stage or playing on Crazy mode, the highest difficulty possible, or perhaps both.The story is very lighthearted and in many cases child-friendly, but that alone is a big part of the reason why this hidden gem of a game stands out. It is rare to find a good game in the market that isn't even remotely close to having any adultlike values. The voice acting, as amazing as the cast is, can be slightly better though as sometimes there are scenes where the voices of some characters do not match their body language or the current mood of the cutscene.I recommend playing through this ARPG at least once if you are a fan of RPG-like genres. I would also recommend using a controller if possible as the style of control with keyboard or mouse can be confusing to use. There is simply a ton of replay value and charming RPG elements that is well worth the $9.99 (Guaranteed worth it if bought on sale).EDIT (Author's Note): This is my first review on a game and did this as this game seems to not be getting enough attention.-----------------------------------------------TL;DR - A cute style ARPG that has a few blemishes that shouldn't hinder gamers from enjoying Parin's adventure. This hidden gem game is often very, very overlooked as good."

,Recommended,322290,34031925,Posted: 4 August,all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"Love this game; the title is a give-away to how charming and innocent this game is. You're a young girl and are attempting to help your monster friends save their home. And reclaim lost furniture.What carries this game is its charm; there's something likable about the characters and setting. It feels ""Studio Ghibli-ish""; those that know the studio and have watched a few of their movies know exactly what I mean. There's a child-like whimsical nature encapsulated in the experience which the character designs, music, art style, and the totality of the visual helps convey. It makes for an entertaining experience everytime you boot it up; but that just might be me since I believe unique visual flairs to titles add to the experience and make them uniquely their own. This is one of those titles that people would place in that, ""I would enjoy a cartoon series or short episodes of this being made"" because what's here is fantastic.The game itself is no slouch: whilst clearly targetted at children its still quality. It's on the easier side, but you'll still see the game over screen a few times and get damaged plenty, especially when you're attempting to get used to the game during the initial stages. The title is a mixture of platformers, light puzzle game, but is mostly a 1 button fighter with a few special moves and a drill that can be charged in battle. The charge is required against most enemies as they have armor, and the armor needs to be obliterated through a charged attack. You have an attack button, a dodge button, and a jump button. Simple.My only complaint is the inclusion of the critical system in the game. At the top of the screen there is a bar and musical notes coming from the left and right side of the bar meeting in the middle. If you attack anything when the musical notes meet in the middle of the bar, you get a critical hit. Critical hits build up your drill's power and inflict more damage. The mechanic is interesting, but you will never realistically be stopping your attacks to time hits better. As it stands, criticals are incidental more than anything, as no one stops in the middle of striking opponents to get the timing down properly. It's like telling you you can juggle during matrix fights-its impractical. It's a superfluous mechanic.Also worth noting is the weak sauce that is some of the ""worlds"" having levels that are just mirror versions of previous levels. Feels like padding and lazy as hell. It's not a lot of levels, and some are interesting, but still worth noting.I'd place this game in the same categories as some of the Kirby Titles and Starfy: games that look to have a certain target market but bely an experience that can be enjoyed by all. Although the comparison is a little unfair, as the aforementioned franchises tend to have titles that usually lack any semblance of a challenge. This game may be targetted at younger audiences but it will still trip you up here and there. Additionally, the plot has depth that you otherwise wouldn't expect.All in all, recommended. The game isn't particularly *amazing* or anything PHENOMENAL, but it has so much charm and the totality of the package makes for an enjoyable experience. The ending was bitter sweet for me as I wanted to see more of these characters and wished for it to continue. You get a solid game with characterization reminiscent of a child's movie that adults can enjoy even moreso than children due to its innocence that is lost on those that lack the ability to place nostalgic value on it."

The camera is pretty bad, so the game feels like it's blocking your attempt to see everything, and the platforming leaves much to be desired.

It all look pretty cute.The quality on sound effects and music is quite good.The action platforming is also quite nice, not too easy, and certainly not too diffcult.The bosses in the game pack quite a punch, but by the first boss you'll probably have figured out how to dodge those.All 'n all, a great game for anyone that loves 3d action platformers."

The platforming is average but it does have interesting ways to reach certain targets (like the homming attack that you do when you jump).ControlsThe controls offer different ways to play the game, either only mouse, keyboard and mouse or controller. But I recommend using the controller since it's the intended way of playing it and because you won't get used to the other 2 ways for a while.The buttons are very responsibe and there's no delay.StoryThe story is extremely simple and easy to follow, you discover a village of monsters and decide to spend some time playing with them, but one day the bad guys from another place start to spread fog in the world and destroy the village, thus your objective is to recontruct the village by getting the objects back to their respective monsters.CharactersThey're childish, but they're enjoyable and there's a good amount of friendly humor in the game.SoundtrackAs expected from falcom, they deliver in that department and the songs are ones that I would listen from time to time.

It features an all-star voice cast featuring the voice talents of actors you may have heard from before! (ex. Pierre and Doug are voiced by Robin Atkin Downes, aka The Medic and Dee Bradley Baker, most known for voicing many Spongebob characters is in this too!)-A storyline that at times can be serious, but most of the time doesn't take itself seriously and has many light-hearted elements.-An absolutely awesome and always upbeat and rocking soundtrack!-Simple and intuitive controls (not to mention fluid)-Has RPG elements but for those who are new to games with RPG elements, this game simplifies them, saving you the stress of understanding them.-A ultra-simple equip mechanic, just put on a different piece of headgear on the fly to use its attributes to turn the tide in battle!

As Parin you will make many monster friends while being tasked with helping them fix their world by tracking down items in all sorts of interesting environments.  The story is heartwarming in a childlike way as both your monster friends and bad guys all have interesting personalities and the well written script and professional voice acting really helps bring them to life.  Along the way you will bash evil monsters with an array of combat moves that you can unlock with money you find in each level area.  The combat is a combination of joystick twirling and timed button pressing, nothing revolutionary but it works well.  There are also platforming elements that you will use to navigate the terrain and search for hidden treasure, healing items and head pieces (hats, ribbons, etc) that you can equip to power Parin up in different ways.    Graphically Gurumin is somewhat blocky and basic, but it’s very colorful and each area you explore is filled with interesting inhabitants that evolve as you explore further, helping to reduce the repetition that often accompanies action RPG’s.  Playing thru Gurumin is like exploring a new park as a child who has a vivid  imagination; discovering monsters, avoiding the lava and having a grand old time in an adventure that is light and fun with enough of a gaming challenge to feel satisfying.

It quickly becomes apparent that there isn't much to do in the mining town where he lives, but Parin is soon sucked into an adventure to rescue a group of friendly monsters. The game is fairly light plotwise but its enough to drive things forward and the dialogue is often funny.The games real draw is the action packed game play that requires good use of your drill and special moves to beat the crap out of a variety of foes. It features an interesting critical hit system that is linked to the games music, get the timing right and you will do extra damage. There are also some light platforming and puzzle solving elements. This is an update of an older game and it shows in the textures which are sometimes muddy and lack detail, overall though the art design is very good and Parin herself is well animated with a variety of expressions and idle animations that bring her to life.Bear with the slightly rough start and you will be rewarded with a game that is deeper than it first appears.Pros:Charm in spadesAmusing dialogueFun action RPG-lite gameplaySome good musicGood art designCons:Dated texturesCamera can be touchy in confined spaces7.5 out of 10 and well worth the $10 entry fee."

Probably some good music, decently fun, something I can relax to with a good atmosphere harkening back to the olden days of something like a PS1 or N64 game, right?No.  The game scores you on something so stupid as destroying jars, which is boring, and a terrible mechanic.  Who thought destroying jars was a central mechanic?  Finding secrets, sure, something to entice exploration, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stop to poke every jar with my drill.That's just a game killer right there, and that's not even mentioning the fact that the PC controls are abysmal.

With this game, however, it repeatedly sets to Button 2 every time I go to set the bindings.  Only this one.  This forces me to use a clunky movement style that makes jumps nearly impossible.  Don't forget, you don't jump until you RELEASE the jump button, and the jumping sound will spam repeatedly until you do.It's also a bore to start up.  Takes a long while to even start playing, and you're just forced to watch cutscenes with terrible voice acting, a Saturday morning cartoon intro with a bunch of crap you don't actually understand, and some stupid song that rivals Street Fighter 4's vanilla theme(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYK_4zut03U)in how awful it is.Skip it/10"

How was I to know right? After all, a game being remade for the 3DS and gaining quite the amount of attention should be good right? RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT?WRONG.Choppy graphics, repetitive gameplay, dreadful dialogue and very generic backgrounds. Not to mention the sparse enemy types, wonky hitboxes, poor controls and the dreadful 'BOING' (you all will know what I mean). Just take my word for it when I say that this game is  super generic, and even the different stages are basically reskins of the ones before with changed room placements.Equipping the drill with different elements to nothing besides providing a bit more damage against specific enemy kinds without modifying stats or providing skills or abilities. That's quite sad given that the main catch of the game is the drill, and the methods you are supposed to 'improve' your drill basically does not do anything different. Yes, you can buy drill skills, but most of the time you will still end up spamming your normal attack.Controls are slippery, swimming is horrendous (you have to be at the surface of the water in order to jump out from it and sometimes I was just literally a few pixels away from the surface and wondering why my jump button didn't work) while the fact that the act of swimming itself drains your hitpoints adds to the frustration. Certain areas that requires precision platforming was simply terrible. Add to the fact that there are so many invisible walls and sometimes you're wondering whether the game developers completed programming to a certain point, saw that the game was 'playable' and released the game without programming the remaining parts of the game that were required.In short, unless there's a Steam sale that puts this below $5, don't get it. And once the game goes for below $5, still don't get it."

,Not Recommended,322290,28334740,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,Kryyss,"TL;DR Gurumin tries hard. It tries very hard but feels like it lacked a good quality assurance cycle or clear leadership from the creative team and the result is a haphazard mix of good and terrible gameplay. But unfortunately it is more of the latter which makes it not worth purchasing.And now the full review:Gurumin wants to be Legend of Zelda so badly that it hurts, but fails to engage the player in all the ways that Nintendo understands. Would it be fair to call it a bad game? Unfortunately since you have to front cash for it, yes it really isn't worth the money and here is why.The developers have really done a great job on the art-style of the game although the background music varies from great to ear-bleeding, however I will admit that initially it started off very strong. But after about 4 hours of gameplay you suddenly realize how you start to lack any motivation to keep playing. The game is extremely linear although you can choose in which order you want to tackle batches of levels that are unlocked. There is a progression system of a kind with various headgear you unlock and upgrade but in all honesty the only two which you will ever use are the Vampire Disguise hat and the Nightcap since these have the most practical bonuses and overshadow all of the others. You gain new moves but they are just more powerful versions of the same early abilities and there was an attempt to introduce elemental weaknesses with fire/elec/ice but it really causes the combat to become anything but fluid as you pause the game, select the different drillbit and then unpause again. The devs could have simply added hotkeys and it would have really made the game feel much better. There is an unforgivable attempt to extend how long the game is by mirroring levels with some different enemies thrown in. But this also adds to the tedium as you retread the same areas you just completed but in reverse. The 'keep the beat' method of getting critical hits is original but totally unworkable as your attention is focussed on the phantom blob creatures themselves so I don't know why they kept it in the game.The game quickly runs out of steam and you can tell the developers noticed this as they try to mix things up with platforming sections. Now... 3D platformers are fine but they require some great camera work to ensure that players are able to judge distances and the main character needs to have decent air-control or jumping distance - Gurumin doesn't do any of this and therefore you will often miss landings or plummet to insta-death. Gurumin also does the unforgivable mistake of giving you an ice/snow themed level with precision jumps, sloping edge platforms that Marin will skid off if you don't stay in the middle and slippery surfaces. The level is an exercise in patience as you creep around everywhere and spend much of your time finding the perfect angle for the camera to make that critical jump over insta-death canyons.There is a plot here.. somewhere... but it really would only appeal to young children (5-7yr olds). However the difficulty of some parts of the game would make the game inaccessible to them. What should be a central driving force to keep the player pushing forwards becomes yet another missing ingredient for a good game. Characters are also 1-dimensional and the developers idea of creating a 'mystery' means they just don't explain why anything is happening or they drizzle out trivial details. That isn't mystery, that's compensating for a shallow story.Sorry folks but when I reach the point where I want to turn the game off to go do housework because the game is so tedious, you know that there is a problem with it's design."

Characters look at each-other when present, the main character will do poses like Sonic would do when you are idle, but never punishes you for it. There are lots of animation flourishes, but they don't get in the way of gameplay. They are done right because they aren't something that is player-initiated. There's also victory dances. Not enough games have victory dances. I miss that about Final FantasyThe combat control is excellent. I can't tell if the 3D platforming is good or not due to the nature of 3D platforming. That part is frustrating. You don't feel like you have as much control of the character as you do in combat. Still, there's more combat than platforming, and the game is very lenient on screw-ups when you do platformingAs a budget game, I give this game a definite yes. I even say that it's worth above the budget level, but people may not buy it at more than $20. This feels like a Playstation-era game, and plays like one of the good ones.There's also something Charlie Brown-esque about the voices that I kind-of like. It's nicely different than dubbed anime characters almost always having either that WWE or Wonder Woman voice, especially children. The awkward voicing kind-of works in this game, even though they could have acted some lines better when the lead character makes certain facial expressionsI also find the replay value of this game to be high.

With each stage completed, new stages are gradually unlocked.All in all the game is rather simplistic and your inventory space is somewhat lacking, but it's just the kind of typical action game to entertain you for a few hours at a time. Different moves, abilities and specialist gear offer a small amount of versitility but if you're happy just whacking baddies with a giant drill then you're pretty much set for a childish but excellent adventure."

For such an old game, it actually looks decent and runs fluidly enough. A fun action game with enough to do for a weekend or so. Safe for little kids with just a bit of weirdness. Cute overload sometimes. Music varies in style and complexity (don't judge the soundtrack by the opening screen music alone)."

I did not realize they even planned a port for it. the PSP is starting to age and I am glad I still get to play classics (ish) like this on a more powerful system.First off, having played this to the bone on the PSP, I can address its content immediately and compare what I've experience in the PC port afterwards.+Solid action platformer+Engaging enemy variations (strategy cap must be on!)+RPG/level elements+Replayability+Decently lengthed game (especially for completionists)+Fun and memorable characters (most are some just add some spice to the setting)+Great voice acting for the time period of its deveopment (espesially since its in english)+Made by Falcom, the genius behind the Ys franchise and the early Legend of Heroes games-Simple camera mechanics sometimes lag behind gameplay-New Game + requires collecting items again (not necessarily a bad thing, it does add a ""replayability"" aspect than a God Mode)-Completing the game 100% will take a lot of effort, some skill and back tracking-Some progression aspects are vague (rarely)Overall, this game was one of the rare gems in the PSP treasure trove along the lines of Ys: Napishtim (which Xseed is porting to PC this month), or Ys: Felghana (already on Steam!) in regards to genre. It has a very straightforward story that engages you with plot twists--sometimes unnecessary--that let you keep going. The leveling and gear system here also works well, not to mention customization options with all the different costumes. Gear levels carry over to NG+ given that they need to be reacquired. The characters are memorable and all play a role in the game. One particularly elusive cat, will definitely pique most players interest. The enemies are given so much variety throughout the game that merit a different approach everytime a new foe is encountered. Some can even get a tiny bit frustrating(-ly fun).For the PC port, I think they only really need to adjust their config menu. Add support to the d-pad and R analog stick, for example. (I prefer using d-pads for platmormers like this because I feel more in control of direction. hehe) Video options also show little difference to me, noted that I'm not too keen on major graphic settings other than fps, res and vsync. I think that this game is aged and simple enough that the settings they give do not entirely make the game too noticably different on medium settings or ultra. The PC port, specifically, feels odd with the PSP type camera system, but perhaps it is more a complex fix than I give it credit for.The games negatives aren't exactly negatives, per se. Nothing that holds back from enjoying the game entirely, but clearly show how this game was really built for more simpler control inputs. Noting that I play this game, like most of mine, using a gamepad.If you've played this before, pick it up! If you haven't, PICK IT UP!! Otherwise, pick it up anyway! :D"

It has an interesting mechanic for critical hits and it's pretty cool that the weapon the main character uses is unique. I really enjoyed playing this game. That being said, some of the stages aren't linear with the story, I was able to fight the final boss before completeing like 5 levels. Also if you look up any walkthough and it tells you the item you're supposed to find in each level it can be WRONG becuase the hats you find are randomized every game. Some of the mechanics aren't the best, mainly the camera but it is worth it to pull though it because the game is just so fun and has an interesting but not complex story. I love to play video games but I don't really like hard games (bc I know what I'm about) so it was difficult at times but not unbeatable. Also once you beat the final game you can do a New Game+ and I think there is a hard mode so if you enjoy tough games it would work for you too. :)"

Very fun gameplay, cute but engaging storyline. I like that it gives you the option to 100% each level and get gold coins so you can exchange them for cool stuff from your Grandpa, that sorta gives the game more replay-value. Love the art style, really enjoy the little items menu/inventory! Levels aren't easy either (obviously they aren't absurdly difficult but they take a bit of strategy after a while). All in all I recommend this game, even for full price. Only thing I didn't like was that pervert character Cylinder."

A really cute, harmless 3D platformer that really captures that feel of N64/PS1 era games. The game was originally released back in 2004 and then the PSP a few years later, but I still think it has this old-school charm that you don't see in most games these days.I still have a ways to go before finishing the game completely, but from what I've played thus far? It's a very relaxing a mellow experience that feels really enjoyable and has a classic-anime flavor to it."
