It's easy to get the hang of but it also has lots of challenging elements. Playing singleplayer is pretty challenging and I don't recommend that for people who are new to the franchise. The game, after all, is called Don't Starve TOGETHER. Multiplayer is great. If the host doesn't have a great connection it can be laggy. 98% of the time the game runs fine online. There are so many character mods and music mods in the workshop for this game that it never gets boring. What's even better is that when you buy the game you get a copy to give to a friend. Overall I think this is a great survival game and I definitely, recommend Don't Starve Together."

So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently. I really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features. Really pumped to give the ""A New Reign: Part 2"" Update a try tonight."

,Recommended,322330,18698161,"Posted: 26 October, 2015",all,Smurf,"My review of the game:Don’t Starve Together is a dark fantasy survival game where players are transported into a randomly generated map that is eager to kill them. Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger for as long as possible. Craft weapons to fight monsters, cook food to stave starvation, and make sure you always have a fire for nighttime. If the harsh winter, packs of hounds, or dapper walruses don’t get you, something else will. Players can choose from three game modes with different features, including whether to play with complete strangers or friends, or to allow PvP.Don't Starve Together key features:Hunting and Gathering – collect resources from different biomes and creatures to cook, build, and craft things to survive.Team Play – everyone must survive! Share and support each other in the dark world, because if one player dies, their presence as a ghost will eventually kill you by driving you insane.Crafting – create your own tools, food, items, structures, and clothes to help you survive through the brutal seasons.Randomly Generated New Worlds – new maps make each game different and unique. You’ll never find yourself in the same world twice.Great Soundtrack and SFX – the music of Don’t Starve Together is refreshing, creepy, and haunting. Each character is voiced by a different instrument, which adds an interesting flavor to the sound dynamic of the game.This game is incredibly fun. I sunk about 270 hours into it already. I recommend playing with friends or on a private server because there is known to be griefers, and I know of one instance we ended up restarting many times due to it. That's to be expected with a game like this, and at times can add to the gameplay, especially when PvP is on.This is the sort of game which tells you ""don't starve"" as a helpful basic premise and then seems to delight in revealing the sheer volume of other things you shouldn't touch, prod, eat, walk near, or forget to build in case of sudden death.In fact it would be more accurate to have called it ""Don't Starve And Also Don't Try To Make Friends With That Tall Bird And Did You Remember To Build A Fire And There Are A Lot More Spiders In That Nest Than You Think And Seriously Please Stop Going Near That Bird"".Oh, and in case you're wondering, Webber isn't a spiderperson. He's a child that lives inside the carcass of the spider which tried to eat him. Which is, y'know, quite a bit darker.If you like survival games, if you enjoy Tim Burton-esque artwork, or if you’re just looking for an unforgiving challenge of a game, pick up Don’t Starve immediately. Pretty much most of the stuff about this game is fantastic, and you’ll undoubtedly fall in love with it.Ultimately, it’s a game that just keeps giving, even as it tears your life from you.8.5/10"

,Recommended,322330,13408099,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,-».•´Puddilicious`•.«-,"This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers.Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers.Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge."

This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.Good luck!"

Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过Once a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员）If you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别.At last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”.I love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together."

,Recommended,322330,33449615,Posted: 11 July,all,Mad,"**NOTE: This review will be constantly updated to accomadate any changes in my opinion, updates, etc.**INTRODUCTIONI heard a lot of good stuff about Don't Starve Together, and I've watched some of my favorite YouTubers play the game. That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.So the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, ""well, why the heck not?"" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.Haha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER ISDon't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the gamethatmuch more enjoyable.You're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.This is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.Thepurpose of Don't Starve Togetheris to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.I usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).If you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.PLAYINGI really,reallylove this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. (A lot). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.The great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.Exploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.""It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-""- Quote from Kuep.^^^ He read it.""You're a spaghetti-o-"", he says.Don't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of ""WTF"" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.THE PROS- Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.- Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.- Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.- Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.- Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.- Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun ""survive"" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)- Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.- Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?THE CONS- Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.- Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, ""ehhhh""-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).- Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)PLACES TO IMPROVE- Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.- New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.- New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)It's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there'ssomuch fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.I want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well. I think it's perfectly suitable for the game, and it's extremely likeable as well.This is a game I definitely recommend. A lot of fun, with challenges, and the great survival aspect I love. It's very original, and the characters are extremely comedic. The game can even be relaxing if you choose for it to be, or it can be freaking death chasing after you every split-second of your existence.Credit to: Kuep for suggesting an important con and giving a quote!"

First off, that's like saying ""Castlevania's just Mario with a whip""; the mechanics and overall feel of the two games are completely different. That aside, I love this game. Be warned though, once you boot up this game, you may never see your family or sunlight ever again. You'll probably want to start off playing this game alone, since it's frustrating to have a noob constantly die in the base, and not even know how to play the game. We're trying to survive too buddy, now go learn the game! :D-------------------------Be warned though, this game is HARD. It is not for the faint of heart, or the easily frustrated or impatient. The game's page boasts about how unforgiving this game is, and they're right.I personally recommend playing the game for a bit with God mode, and faffing about with the console commands for any newcommers to this harsh game. (I personally recommend using the mod, Too Many Items. It's a very helpful mod that acts as a visual HUD for the console.)-------------------------Here's a list of things you could try doing:You could try your hand at taming beefalo.You could try taking out some of the Giants.You could gather supplies for those who need it.You could explore the caves.You could raid the ruins.You could traverse the Labyrinth.You could kill the Ancient Guardian.You could battle the Marble Chess pieces on a full moon.You could then battle the Shadow Chess Pieces on the new moon.You could then gather 8 fossil fragments and assemble them in the atrium.You could then fight the Ancient Fuelweaver.After that you could go fight Toadstool.After 20 days, you could go die to Misery Toadstool.And by the time you're ready to do almost all of those, you'll realize that, before you know it, you're on day 200, and it's 5am in the morning, and you have missed a week in school.-------------------------All in all, it's a great game, that's more addictive than crack cocaine. Trust me, you'll be saying ""Oh, I'll just continue playing until the full moon, then I'll go feed my kids"", and before you know it, you're on day 1600 and you've been pronounced legally dead.

,Recommended,322330,24326439,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Retribution26,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason.If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed.Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!"

One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from!In this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).In don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots?♥♥♥♥♥♥WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS.This game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun.Definitely recommend this game.

,Recommended,322330,29686846,Posted: 3 February,all,CupCray [DFS],"Don't Starve Together is a top-down survival game of the original Don't Starve, now with multiple mouths to feed with.You start off by selecting one of the diverse characters from the Wilson Family and are thrown right into the world. Your job is, as the title suggests, to don't starve and survive the upcoming 4 seasonal periods. As from there it goes on, you craft science machines to invent new things, get clothing to fit into the current circumstances and fight off hundreds of hounds, spiders and giants along your way. If you die, there's no other way to be resurrected except a few rare items or the all-famous Telltale Heart, crafted with the blood of other players (literally).Pros:This game is harsh. It is full of little things that try to kill you or the other way around, limited resources are almost guaranteed, and let's not forget the seasons. You have to prepare for the upcoming season you are about in to enter, which can be a bit tricky sometimes to get used to. Clothing, Hats or items that help you stay cool, warm and dry are crucial.The gathering of resources and understanding the core on what to do to survive is satisfying to watch. Having your own base set up with all required farms, chests and structures gives a successful feeling to the player and encourages them to repeat said process, to see if they really got the hangout.Speaking of base building, this is a good game to play with a friend to that has a basic knowledge. A newcomer can learn fairly easily where the rabbit is going and should get the hang of the survival techniques quickly. It may be confusing on what to do first, so it is always recommended to watch what others do, hence said before that it is good to play it with another friend with basic information.Immense workshop support. This is a big plus for all the mods out there. They can make your life easier, harder or just add some neat little things that really don't change the core too much but help out a ton.Cons:The lore of this world you are in is briefly explained as ""statues that stand around"". There is no real way to tell how much the game developed in the story without looking it up online. I wished the lore would be given to you at least a bit while playing.While the world is easy to jump into, the resource placement can be pretty shady at certain parts. I once had one world where thousands of lizards spawned in the middle of the desert, or one biome wasn't generated at all, even after exploring the entire map for a good solid 10 days.Seasonal periods last for a long time and aren't something you would play quickly for an hr and then go shut the game off. To get into winter, at least 20 days are set, which are about 2 hours in. It doesn't seem that much but the time can feel stretched out at this point.Conclusion: A very good survival system with lots of food and magic (as Klei likes to pronounce it anyway)"

Not only physically, but mentally. You've made it through the hard part, after all- right? Those silly spiders and frogs couldn't keep you down! Then you hear it, feintly echoing over the empty plains: barking. ""What's that?"" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.Except you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.==================A new day... a new chance?You push through the first 29 days in this hell. You've made quite the home for yourself! And look at that! Not even the fire-dogs could stop you now! ""Another victory!"" you yell, as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all. You revel in the moonlight, basking in the greatness that you're all responsible for. A bird cage? Farms? Bushes? Fridges?? You're advanced now! You're self-sufficient! Proud survivors! Everything is brilliant! Not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you're all feeling.But then, as you sit to enjoy a moments peace, the serenity is disturbed. A tremor. A single shake in the ground, followed by a monstrous roar. The team pause, confused. Suddenly, before you know it, another is unleashed. You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.You observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes. You close your eyes, drop your clothing, and assume the necessary position for what is to follow.You don't quite survive that winter."

I never like playing survival game because I'm not very good at surviving but this one is different.This game is just like any other survival games, throwing the player into a world without any instructions but I felt that every deaths is a learning curve that the players learned as they go unlike other games dying from the same thing and never learn anything. Plus not most survival games are third person orientated.Just like other games, this game also really push you to your limits such as testing your ability, skill, resource spending and time management. You will need to be strategic when you're playing in a harsh world this game puts you in. Planning ahead and praticing in game combat skills if you're one of those hardcore players. Oh yea, there is also PvP for those sociopathy people who killed people for fun.If you're like me who prefer calm and relaxing gameplay you could play on endless where you are not punished too hard if you died but still keeping survival game vibe.In the end, I would recommend if you like strategy games, this one would be the one for you. Just before you play I would highly suggest that you go watch some videos and reading wiki before you start playing unless you're like me, entering a gunfight with a knife."

Futhermore the food consumption is directly proportional to the mouths to feed, micidial element at start game when you haven't an advanced base camp. Even if you're veteran this mode will test you. Therefore, you don't let your guard down.....Supplemento al gioco principale che ne allunga, sicuramente, la giocabilità. Multiplayer fino a 4 giocatori e mondi personalizzabili possono rendere più facile o più difficile la sopravvivenza. Con le impostazioni di default i mob faranno più danno e avranno più vita, in relazione al numero di giocatori. Inoltre il consumo di cibo è direttamente proporzionale alle bocche da sfamare, elemento micidiale a inizio gioco quando manca un campo base sviluppato.

Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.Recap:Buy it!10/10 would recommend to all my friends again."

This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.Original Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well.Other than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it.Klei delivers, and I personally can't wait until this game has Adventure mode me and my friends can play, as well as ALL the characters from Reign of Giants.

I was in constant fear of starving to death, going insane, and running for my life from bloodthirsty packs of hounds. I was dying a lot and most of the time it was my own fault. I kept playing though because with each death I learned a little more about how to better survive the next world.The best part of this game has to be the friendly community. I always love joining a random server and being greeted with a friendly ""hello"" usually followed by directions to a base. I learned most of my Don't Starve skills from more experienced players who offered their help and advice. Now I happily do the same thing for new players. It's a great feeling knowing that people are enjoying the game more because of me.If you ever get bored of the normal gameplay there are also tons of great mods on the steam workshop.

,Recommended,322330,29889923,Posted: 12 February,all,Domino,"My review about this game was originally a silly joke in the form of a satirical in-game scenario, but I feel like I really need to do it some justice. Don't Starve Together, ideally, is just that: Don't Starve, but Together, with other people, normally with your friends since public servers are admittedly going to generally be pretty toxic. However, it is still perfectly playable solo, and there's so much more to the game than just being a multiplayer version of its predecessor. The team behind it seems genuinely passionate about what they're doing, so much so that some of it even rubs off on the workshop and the creators of a lot of the mods in it. They even gave Don't Starve Together away to owners of Don't Starve for FREE back when it was still in the beginning of its early access stage, and INCLUDED all the DLC they had for the latter game at the time.To start, if you don't know what Don't Starve (Together) is, it's probably one of the oldest, truest, and all-around best survival sandbox games out there. It has a unique artstyle, some interesting lore, and easy-to-learn but still always threatening and challenging gameplay. After hundreds of hours, I'm still learning and being amazed, or, at the very least, intrigued by a lot of the things I still don't know about that I accidentally stumble upon while playing. It's truly a new experience every time. It also doesn't have the problem almost every ""survival game"" out there has nowadays, too, with being very one-dimensional, predictable, or feeling just like one of those dime-a-dozen copies of popular representatives of the genre. There's so much you can customize for each individual world, both the good and the bad, the objects and the mechanics, it's just overall very customizeable, which is always a welcome feature, especially to the picky folk or perhaps the type who easily get bored of games with one or very few different settings, and that's not even mentioning the mods.Oh gosh yes, the workshop. It's absolutely wonderful. Although a lot of people can agree that making and maintaining mods for the game can be very difficult and ""time consuming and a mess of coding"" in the game's current stage, the level of activity and additional customization that can be found in the workshop is amazing and provides virtually unlimited replayability to the game.Honestly, to any modders reading this who still support their mods, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm genuinely thankful for what you're doing. You make the community and the game even more awesome than it already is, and it wouldn't quite be what it is without all of your contributions. Unless all you do is make reskinned Wilsons of anime, pony, or FNaF characters with nothing more than a buff to the base character stats. Seriously, cut that out. It's embarrassing for everyone.This is also the only game I know of with an in-game market worthy of mentioning without some stupid desperate attempt to grab your cash for every box you want to open. You get free boxes of cosmetic items for your characters just by playing, and can also open them... for free! And you can even buy and sell them on the Steam market, and recycle them with a function in game.Seriously, I can't think of any downsides with this game--even if I could, the good most certainly outweighs the bad--and it's tough to imagine Klei bailing out on development and letting us down. So why haven't you gotten this game yet? The devs deserve your support and you deserve to give yourself a quality time killer!"

Every character is unique and those specialties are even more colorful in multiplayer as you can take on different roles that you are suited for in your co-op or group play.   If you enjoyed Minecrafts vanilla survival experience but now want a much deeper and more challenging adventure, take the leap and jump into the world of DST!Note: from here on out (since launch) the base game and Don't Starve Together will have diverging content updates which means that there will be content not included from the base game and vice versa.Note: in the description it is called ""expansion"" but it is entirely a seperate game, you don't need the original game to play this.Note: for multiplayer it says (Co-Op) but you can't share screens and you need 2 versions of the game.Note: game uses Steam Workshop, so you can download tons of mods and that includes some modded in characters from the original game's new expansion ""ShipWrecked"".Note: difficulty is VERY high, but that is the ""point"" of the game of which is literally called ""Don't Starve""...they mean it.Despite its challenge, I recommend this game for all ages and interests.  It's not unlikely to die your very first night playing the game, and then the second night, and then the third...but that is the point of the game and once you start diving into this dark and twisted world,  I promise you will find adventure as well as a new tickling, creeping sensation to jump once again through the portal into the Codex Umbra...FOR SCIENCE!"

You can do everything you want, included create a big camp & organizing little wars against the spiders & the giants ( chance to win multiplied of 100% ).

You have to worry about freezing to death in the winter, constant rain in the spring will drive you insane, and the summer gets so hot it will set your things on fire. Finding specific resources as a group and crafting items can help alliviate these problems, but disasters will happen regardless.The combat is very simple, and some might call it lame, but I enjoy it. Often times it is better to run from an enemy than fight it. There are 5 or 6 rare mega-bosses that really force you to change your gameplay up.If you have a lot of friends and want a game you can consistently play together for long periods of time, this is definitely a good choice."

76561198090383305,Recommended,322330,18951063,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Honeydewing,"I found Don't Starve Together rather enjoyable, it's very fun, and very easy to play. Klei have done an amazing job coding the original Don't Starve into this multiplayer version and it's obvious that they've done a brilliant job doing so. The game itself consists of a 2D/3D background with a cartoonish grey outlook where your aim is to survive as long as possible until you die, depending on whether you have a friend on your game with you, there will or won't be a chance to respawn. If a friend is on with you then he/she can craft a ""Telltale heart"" to bring back a dead player at the cost of 20 health, 3 grass and a spider gland. Dead players cause sanity loss on living players and can roam around ""haunting"" objects and creatures. Perhaps later on as an idea for haunting, the dead player can control the object/animal depending on sanity and having low sanity can allow you to control bigger and more ""alive"" creatures/objects.Don't Starve Together also brings the concepts from Reign of giants into the game, such as the actual ""giants"". These giants seem to be seasonal with ""bearger"" at autumn, ""Deerclops"" at winter, ""???"" (or goose/moose) at spring and ""Dragonfly"" at summer. These Giant enemies bring a new challenge to players and can bring games to an end because of the high attack damage they possess. This can be a rather difficult challenge for players as giants such as ""deerclops"" can come out of the darkness in winter and destroy your base/encampment.Don't Starve Together also brings new characters and character concepts into the game, such as ""Wigfrid"" a warrior woman who can only eat meat and has her own character locked weapon and armor called the ""Battle Spear"" and the ""Battle helm"", I found this very useful and fun to be able to use a new weapon which won't bring down sanity, however the character itself can be rather restrictive as when I played as ""Wigfrid"" I felt as if I were restricted to my base as I could not wander too far from my food source which was rabbit traps. Perhaps ""Wigfrid"" could eat food and it would be more filling so that it makes up for the fact that if there is was little meat left the character won't die so fast of hunger and allow for players such as myself to be able to explore without too many restrictions.""Webber"" is another addition to the game and is described as (""Is a monster, befriends spiders, grows a silky beard"") he is a very good addition to the game and grants a bigger freedom in the game as the character can eat a wider variety of foods such as monster meat, which I found as a brilliant idea for a character. The character itself though get's attacked by ""Pigs"" if the character gets in a close proximity and this can be very repetitive and persistent, this is a good idea at best but perhaps the character ""webber"" could just be unable to befriend ""Pigs"" and just instead of being attacked just avoided.Overall I found the game very enjoyable and would be happy to see any improvements in the game such as previously stated and caves which I'm sure Klei are working hard on."

I've been playing this game for roughly a year now (The Together Edition) and OH BOY IT'S FINALLY OUT OF EARLY ACCESS.Let's start off with the good.This game is so much fun with friends and a GREAT way to make friends. On average (from my experience) the communty i friendly. It is Don't Starve, after all, so it's a unique gameplay and idea. There's a bunch to do, especially with mods. I've done everything form 1v1 tournaments to just regularly playing/surviving. The game is updated regularly and maintained with a close eye. I love how responsive the creators at Klei are. They love to stay interactive with their fans and fellow gamers. There's an interesting backstory to DST, which branches from DS (Learn about it by playing the CycIum puzzle). I just love this game so much.Now, for the bad.There's not much here. There are and always will be bugs, especially when mods are involved. Without Don't Starve background, the game can be a bit dificult, but that shouldn't be a problem with help from the other gamers (assuming your server has other people). That's pretty much it. The game isn't really bad.I'd recommend this game to anyone who:A) Likes survival games.B) Likes games that involve interracting / making friends.C) Likes a very interesting sketch-like art style."

Other times you'll find a good spot fairly soon into the game, only to realize that there's no boulders nearby and you're pretty much stuck because you can't build advance structures.You WILL die, starve, and go insane multiple times before finally figuring out the do's and don'ts.

Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.  If you're not prepared, then prepare to die!"

Draft of this game is so amazing, graphics, all crafting mechanisms, seasons and items - they are not too OP but worth it. Every world is randomly generated, making each save original (I really like exploring uncharted coasts). This game is every time trying to beat you. It is sometimes funny, but sometimes, it makes me VERY angry. Also a community is super. Almost every 3 days someone creates extraordinary mod - character, item, dish, animation, etc.For some people, it may be really hard, but that is also the reason, why is it in MULTIPLAYER (if you have got minimally one friend to play with, you will spend much time by playing DST).I actually find one think, which tricks me off: When you pause the game, playing just one (without any friend), it will NOT be paused, it will be still resumed instead. I also hope, Shipwrecked will be on DST soon (in DS, you can buy R.o.G and SW DLC and switch between them), but in DST is permanently R.o.G. on.FINAL RESULT sounds: Thanks god (eventually to Klei) for this game....Keep on mind, it is still a BETA.PS: For newbies is every tip important, so I will maybe create a page, where will be everyone able to write anything about this freaking awesome game."

Like a real marriage, but with lots of weird, moody pets and no life insurance. It was love at first sight and our favorite multiplayer experience so far.It includes all of the original game's DLC (except Shipwrecked). That means all the crafting, the fighting and the conflict is here, only now it's a shared experience. Play with friends in your local network or against Steam members from all over the world. If you want, you can still play alone as well, but why would you?While Klei didn't get around to making achievements for it, which I would've liked, they've managed to get me addicted with the game's skin drops. Collecting clothes, trading them and personalizing my character suddenly became just as important as keeping it alive.Need another reason to play Don't Starve Together? When you buy one, you get a free copy for a friend! Even better, if you owned the original before Don't Starve Together was released, like I did, you may already own it for free! Either way, it's a must-buy for casual and diehard gamers alike!"

,Recommended,322330,14189142,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,KMEO,"If you've played the original Don't Starve and have been aching to play it with your friends, or random people, I highly recommend this game. This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to ""observe"" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to ""pull their weight,"" because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.If all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).Even though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve."

,Recommended,322330,31679990,Posted: 11 May,all,malaisling,"The pinnacle of survival games, which actually requires players to survive. Normally survival games are just, start off with nothing in the wilderness, kill everything else and build a castle. This game requires players to actually work to stay alive and build a settlement to further aid in their survival creating a highly unique and innovative experience. Unlike many other games, it also uses a very stylized and intricate art style as well as having a very well written although unspoken plot.The game features a healthy amount of randomization which makes each world relatively individual and fresh, and while the combat system is simple it manages to still feel satisfying. While including a lot of grinding like most survival games, in this one it barely feels like a chore because the player is constantly working to gather the supplies to immediately build something new. There are only a few instances where the reward for time spent is very far off, what the player chooses to do is rewarded or punished very quickly.The game however makes no effort to teach the player anything, which results in both a more refreshing experience and an unfair one. Players will die numerous times to things they had no way of preparing for without looking up a guide, which potentially involves numerous world resets and lost progress. It does not feel as bad as normal trial-and-error psuedo difficult gameplay, but it still can be a problem. Especially when the game will continue to dish out unfair situations even after players are experienced; as there is always one more thing players did not know, which they are punished for not knowing.Finally, the game also has problems with balance. As there are many overly effective tactics players can use to make survival much easier. The game puts so much effort into being punishing and unforgiving yet there are random aspects of the system which are far more lenient to the player for no reason. Which means if players enjoy difficulty the game hypocritically makes certain things far easier then they should be, just because. Various content in the game is also underpowered or overpowered in general, and so there are certain items players will default to using a lot and others they barely will. This even including the playable characters.While the multiplayer side of the game is exceptionally enjoyable, when in a good team, the public multiplayer is still susceptible to griefing. Although after a couple years some counters to griefing were finally patched in. There are also various bosses in the game which have their health scaled to ridiculous amounts in anticipation for multiple players being present, and so playing the game alone or with a small group will make certain fights unfairly challenging without the use of a health scaling mod."

I am having fun just as I did when I first started playing two or so years ago. My only beef is that the dev apparently got greedy and charged for 'early-access' to multiplayer. I put early-access in quotes because it will eventually be free to anyone who owns the single player build, but not till sometime in the future (who really knows, right?).I have to overall recommend this version, because it is really fun.

Track of time I'll tell you that we passed. If you want to survive in the game when team play is also really serious, you must do your assignment.Gain The Goods=If you're lucky, play valuables gift packages from du you know.(If you are really lucky of course :)For example:the other day I was opening the present from next to a warm campfire.When fully opened here again, what we mean by the sounds of the Black skirt: elegant(Red Level) item I dropped.Cs:Go with pulled out a knife of my dreams rejoice item 12tl know if it falls into water as as it saddens me a bit, but still kept on going.When opening the gift packs to you and playing with your friends and have a good time.

Players who are new to this game will have much problems at surviving, but you learn from your mistakes. It is very challenging and you always need to do something productive otherwise you're gonna die. The Tim Burton art style is just incredible and looks so good.

,Recommended,322330,29686204,Posted: 3 February,all,Not Ywey,"I've never been good at writing anything, so here goes my first serious Review.To the point: This game is good if you like having big goals/ or would like to make friends. 9.5/10-FRIENDS-I've made many friends in this game, some of them are even my besties now. A friend introduced me to this game, a friend helped me through this game, and a friend showed me to a group of friends I will never forget. This game will enhance your best experience with friends as you fight, survive, and thrive in the wilderness.-GAMEPLAY-Don't Starve Together is a classic survival with many challenges. I'm sure you know most of the basics like ""don't starve, don't eat this, and don't hug the shadow right? Let's skip that. There is a lot more to surviving than building spectacular bases, raiding the ruins (Mid-Endgame stuff), creating farms, and setting goals. There comes a time however when Don't Starve Together gets repetitive. You could fix that with the large amount of mods available in the Workshop, or try to set goals for yourself. Here, I'll give you some to work with...-Raid the ruins by winter.-Fight all the bosses in a run.-Set Tusks to more or lots.-Long term Ruins base.-Build a huge wall separating a piece of land.-Play PvP with friends or strangersHOWEVER... HOWEVER HOWEVER HOWEVER...This game has faults as well. As you know, some people are complete bum bums, and they try to ruin the fun like in most multiplayer games. This game has griefers. These terrible little creatures are fueled by the salty tears of the people who got their base ransacked by these little demons. Basically they can burn your base to ashes, smash it to pieces, steal, destroy, and just tear it apart with ease. There are also other types of bum bums which are very rude to others. This community is not perfect, but the risk makes it worth the reward.Now if you're planning on buying this, you should probably know some Don't Starve Together gamer terms.PK - Pig King (The Gold giver)DF/DFly - DragonFly (Boss of the desert)Griefer - Despicable creaturesKiting - Dodging an enemy and hitting it too.AG - Ancient Guardian (Boss of the ruins)Deer - Literal Deer, not Deerclops.Tstone - Touchstone (A 1-up basically)Quarry - A biome full of rocksMosaics - A mix of turf and biome. Usually includes a rock biome inside and a pet cave.PK Forest - The Forest surrounding Pig King, Autumn colours.Roll - To roll a die. do '/roll' and you can roll a number between 1-100. You may edit this as well. For example: /roll 10D10000. The maximum roll you can do.My goal for this review is to get you ready for this game, and hopefully I succeeded in that."

The mod system isn't perfect and some players can't use certain mods unless your the host of the server. There aren't many mods in the workshop yet either, but more will be added in time. This is comparing to the originial don't starve mods so it's actually not bad at all. There are lag problems which led to many restarts, but overall it's stable enough to play and lots of fun!

These games typically are a bit weird because you never get an unfinished copy of it until it's done. However it is a quirky little fun game that's 2D. Typical old school point and click type game for movement where you point and click on floor. Movement is a weird because of the graphics and the character gets stuck or has problems moving around things at times in order to pick things up. Could use more work. The devs actually put out updates and fix things. They have been timely with caring and tending for their game. This is your typical survival game. You can actually beat it in adventure mode but it is very short and not much gameplay is offered there.You can build but it is very limitted. No roof's or shelters for you either. You can make things like umbrellas but you will never have true shelter other than building a fence. The fences are not durable and there are no gates available. It's a chore constantly breaking things to get in and out of your fenced area. Storage isn't good. Crafting storage takes a lot of wood and offers very little space. You end up crafting 30 or more just to keep your things stored. You can't really build too much and you can't rely on farming because in the winter nothing grows. You can survive from animals you hunt or stored rabits as well as other things here and there like birds. Provided, that you prepared and stocked up on items to survive. The game offers seasons which may or may not make things a tad more difficult due to weather changing.Food will spoil quickly even in a craftable ice box. I suggest storing rabits with traps you made to catch them in storage chests so you can avoid the spoiling of food through the winter. Each storage chest can hold up to only 9 items. The idea is get what you can and survive while preparing for winter. Collect and gather resources and craft items to survive or play adventure mode and survive. At night if no light is made by you, you will die and just about anything else can kill you as well. Fun for a few hours but not enough to keep you busy for months. I pop in and out of it as new things become available.Several mods for this edition of the game as well as the original version of the game. Recommended for short gaming sessions for those who want a much easier and funnier survival game. There are ways to avoid death by crafting armor or touching a touching stone or getting supplies to make magic items non stop that can aid you to stay alive. But if not prepapered you will die and have to restart your game again as there is perma death. However in this version of the game you can come back to life if you have your settings set for that.This version is almost the same as the original version of the game but allows for playing with other people you pick or with randoms. You can very easily play with other people with little to no hassle or set up on your end. You do not need to deal with port forwarding settings which makes this co-op experience more attractive to newbies. Their wiki for the game is a bit weird to use and no search bar is even provided so I suggest just reading forums or talking with their community for help or ideas. Although it is not really needed as they game shows you what you can and can not craft. Making it so much easier rather than playing a survival game where you have to be glued to a wiki page because the game failed at teaching you anything or showing you what you could and couldn't do. I am really liking the games that clearly show you what is going on and what you can make. Enjoy! :)"

The style, the game play ideas, the humor, it's all there.Why won't i reccommend it though? Because the community at the moment is bad. Most servers are filled with begging newbies, who can't find food (which isn't all that hard to begin with!). Sooner or later they'll just steal whatever is in your crates and fridge. You have NO WAY to prevent them from taking it besides pretty much carrying everything with you. Which is pretty annoying, as your carrying potential is pretty limited.When winter comes, most of those players die from freezing. Then they'll bug you to revive them, so they can eat up the rest of your savings... Just abyssmal.If you only play on a private server with friends, go for it! It's still a great game after all!

,Recommended,322330,24016515,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Eggplant Edwardson,"Well, Don't Starve Together. I love this game, and I don't think I need to point out why, over 30 thousand people have already pointed it out. Impeccable music, unique and incredible art style, brutal yet rewarding gameplay. I have to say, it's hard to stop playing this game, and not in a Skinnerbox method, Candy Crush/WoW kind of ""I can't stop playing."" I'm a total survival + sandbox game junkie, and this fills both of those needs. It's hard for me to name a single problem with this game itself, but I'll get to the problems with it that aren't Klei's fault later on.---The Game Itself, and what it's like.---The game is a blast, full of tough decisions, engaging gameplay, and stress. Lots of stress.Don't Starve Together has you managing a few main things, this being your HP, your Hunger, your Sanity, your temperature, your wetness, and probably most importantly, time. You need to go throughout the world, collecting any resource you can simply to survive. Survive intervals of hound attacks, which get more frequent as time goes on. Survive full moons, where normally friendly pigmen become ...werepigs. Spooky. You'll travel throughout an unforgiving world and eventually set up a camp where you can unlock new recipes to help you survive. Later on, winter will start. In this, plants grow more slowly, days are shorter, nights are longer, and you can very easily freeze.  After a long time, you can improve your base and make surviving ""easier"". It's a grand world of fear and surprises, I'm only scraping the surface.---Playing Singleplayer---Playing singleplayer is great, but if you wanted to do that, Don't Starve is better for it. It's considerably easier, and it even has another gamemode, Don't Starve Shipwrecked that... Well, I'm getting off topic. Singleplayer is great, but it's not where Don't Starve Together is centered.><~~~Playing Multiplayer~~~><Ooh, fancy.Multiplayer is where Don't Starve Together both shines and falls flat. If you gather some friends and make a private server, it's a total blast! Some of the most fun I've had in a while. Spoiler alert, having food isn't as easy with 6 people.You can survive together, help each other, and if one of you dies, one can revive another for a relatively small price. Truly, in multiplayer, cooperation is key. And that's exactly why public multiplayer is the only real flaw in the game.The game's community, if you haven't heard about it before, is... Well, it's something else. Over half of the people who play the game are imbecilic and lazy, or just game-ruining for a good laugh. If they don't play well or even decently, they're probably stealing your stuff, destroying your base, or literally just sitting around doing nothing!True story if you care to listen, actually, I was once in a server that made it until late winter. We even defeated the deerclops, a major boss in Don't Starve. One of the players who lived in our base hadn't really accomplished much. The player that had helped our base grow the most was asking him politely to do something, and he didn't respond. I gave him a golden axe, and asked him to chop some trees for logs. He took it, and did nothing, instead asking for food. The other person started yelling at him to do something. Again, he did absolutely nothing. We ended up kicking him.It gets MUCH worse than that, however. People just join, ask if they can join your base, or asking for key resources, with varying levels of grammatical errors. If you refuse, they'll give a quick ""f*** u ur a n00b"" and then proceed to either leave, or whine and complain until kicked, or until they inevitably die because they weren't actually playing the game.~~~Conclusion/TL;DR~~~DST is an incredible game blending fun mechanics and stressful decisions. You definitely should buy it if you have friends willing to play with you. If not, then buying the singleplayer Don't Starve would be better... This game isn't worth it for public multiplayer. About 1 in every 6 servers you join will have a decent game waiting for you. Just about everything in the game itself is flawless... If you can take the community.So, get ready for a fun night with friends. Deal with sanity, monsters, hounds, and especially other players. But most of all...Don't Get Caught Out In The Darkness Without A Torch. Can't wait for that game."

Talking and planning is essential here – maybe you will see your buddies in a new light after a few hours of a desperate battle against the many odds the game throws against you.Beware: human emotions tend to go haywire in dangerous situations. You'll know what I mean if you ever built – what you thought was – a reasonably stable ecosystem only to completely be bamboozled by some irresponsible action of a friend.Life will be tough but it's addicting. Especially together!+ realistic simulation of being lost in the wildernis with your friends. (=you die)+ lovely graphics+ the well goes deep: there's much to explore+ endless replayability+ intuitive gameplay (this one's a must)+ stuff gets patched and refined regularly+ you can burn forests!- main menu is a bit confusing to use with the controller- you may lose a friend or two- you can burn your campNomitated this game for the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.

We were having lots of fun with this game until one day: Don't Starve Together Beta confirmed everyone! As soon as the game was open to the public we received it for we already had Don't Starve. We were so happy that this happened, I didn't start playing until some of my m8's wanted to play. So I started hosting a game and we're having so much fun 7 hours into the game. We've also got mods on it to make it even beter! Since it's still in Beta it is a little buggy but we're okay with it. It took me a little while to make and account because the Email wasn't received till later the day I signed up. But we got there in the end, the mods we've downloaded helped with some issues with lag and glitches, and we also got some of our old favorites from the original Don't Starve so we're pretty happy about that.At times can be a challenge but yet a simple game, I'm not yet used to the attack style of the game yet but I'll get there, I'm more used to first person shooters, but I'm not gonna go there.... You choose a charecter and spawn in to a brand new world, your arn't yet to know what is expected to happen, but around the 9-10th night be ready, for there is a band of wolves that will come your way!Also to fans and friends and other people the game dosen't take that much to run, easy to handle and a great game! I will also be recording this game with some mates after some time in the near future, so be sure to check that out when I do. Thanks for reading and I will leave a little ranking of the game below!I rate/rank this game 9/10 for now, when all the glitchy stuff is fixed and it is out of Beta I will be giving it higher! =)"

But a friend of mine had told me about it, which lead me to do what I always do before buying a game, and start researching some gameplay on Youtube and reading some of the Steam reviews. So I decided to give it a try, buying one of the packs that include two copies so i can also give this game a try with my boyfriend. Ever since, this has now become one of my favorite games!!! I love the challenge of surviving as long as possible. In the beginning, i was lucky to survive to day four, but now, with the help of my boyfriend and two friends, we actually manage to survive to summer. But since we have never lived up till then, imagine our surprise when the sun and heat made our whole camp burn down... saddest thing ever. Overall, there will be many things that surprise you along the way, but if you all don't starve together, you can all survive together. :)"

My only complaints are that you loss some of the atmosphere and miss out on underground adventures (for the time being I asume). I play this mainly with my mom. I used the information I gathered from single player and guided my mom through the game. She wasn't interested at first, but loves the game now. The only problem is that they killed the fun of playing as Willow, my mom's favorite character. I prefer Willson because his style works to calm the player and stop you from making recless decisions. That's compared to playing Woody in the past. The game also has problems with workshop mods, but only a few of them."

The world has seasons and two of the seasons (Spring and Fall) are relatively easy to survive, while the other two seasons are more challenging (Summer and Winter). You need to spend your time wisely in Spring and Fall to make it through Summer and Winter. If you like survival games, you will likely enjoy this one. This game can be challenging at first, but stick with it! It's a lot of fun and its especially fun to play with friends. Try to play through an entire year so you can get a feel for all the seasons with all of its unique challenges and monsters.

It's definitely really, really fun to play with friends, and the mod support is excellent. however, finding your friends is extremely difficult...summer is also a huge pain, and so is fire. certain items help prevent things but the method of acquisition (if you don't mess with the settings) is kind of very late game, despite seasons coming and going quickly.T here are certain methods that make restoring things, but there's just so much going on, it feels like a clutter of things.I'd recommend a play, and it's pretty fun.Maybe watch some videos out there. It's a pretty nifty sandbox/open world game, and there's a lot of fun things to do. but losing progress is definitely very, very annoying."

Secondly, (sometimes) people may want to PvP, even in other servers, like waht happened to me...i died because they saw that i was a noob and decided to kill me multiple times. Thirdly(the worst), because you may be playing with friends, the monsters' health are doubled! EVEN if you are playing single player!Anyway, when there are cons, there are always pros, which are the following:-You can play ANY character, even Maxwell from the beginning! (Don't starve need you to unlock by earving enough EXP, which takes a TON of time)-There are new items and other stuff which are not available in DSThis is a really good game that can kill hours of time. Plus with enough time the seasons will change, bringing you new challenges everytime, which may even kill inexperienced players (like me).However, with enough practice, you sure can master the game, and even go beyond surviving, thriving!This game is REALLY worth the money, also buying it will include another copy, which you can then give to your friends, so they can play with you. Overall, this game is REALLY worth the time and money, and can even keep you entertained for years!"

""Ten out of ten."" -Person who makes quotes.DST is the multiplayer version of the hit game Don't Starve (DS). I bought DST with the DS bundle.Don't starve together is a great game. It's fun and very challenging. There are lots of monsters to fight in the game.e.g: Tallbirds, Spiders,and more.The most amazing thing in the game is the beefalo. You can tame 'em. kill em, whatever.Respect the beef. *cough* azure *cough*Most of your time will be spent gathering resources, such as: cut grass, rocks, twigs, and logs.I like to play singleplayer. You can easily do this by clicking on Host Game on the main menu and setting the maximum player value to one. Or you can go make some friends by joining a random game.The crafting system is simple and elegant. Just click a couple things and you're done. Some of the recipes are crazy. Such as the ""Glossammer saddle"" which requires SIXTY EIGHT butterfly wings. But it's well worth it.The seasons are each unique. Autumn being the calmest, and in my opinion spring being the most hectic.Autumn has little rain, average temperatures and it's generally calm.Winter has low temperatures, in which your character will freeze to death.Spring has tons of rain, when your character is in rain, and you hold wet items your sanity depletes rapidly.Summer has very high temperatures, your character will overheat and take damage very quickly.Hunger: It's easy to control. just eat stuff. You can make crock pots make more efficient food.Sanity: Your sanity depletes 5/minute during dusk and night. And if it depletes below 15%, your character will be come insane. Shadow creatures will become hostile and attack you. Don't be scared though! They drop nightmare fuel which is required for the best weapon and armour in the game. Bait their attack by running into their attack range and run back to hit them once. then repeat. and DO NOT pick flowers! Use butterfly wings to fight them (See below)Health: You take damage when you are attacked or are overheating, freezing, starving, etcetera.One of my favourite ways to regain your HP (Hit Points) is to eat butterfly wings. Run at them until your shadows match up or are very near. And then hit CTRL and F. Eat them to recover 8 HP.Anyway. Overall, Don't starve together is an AMAZING game. It's really fun, and I've met awesome people from it.BUY IT!"

Now there are four of us in a steam group altogether that play this game, and we are all in love with it. And if you don't have friends (I feel bad for you), you can just jump into another player's server, provided it's public of course. The gameplay is fun and addictive. I find myself encountering new and more challenging enemies as the days go by. You can even set how many of these enemies spawn. The crafting system is a little bit difficult to get to grips with and could use a little work but all in all, a great game. 10/10 IGN would rate again."

The game itself seems pretty stable, even at day one.  One of the main problems I have with this game is that having played the Reign of Giants DLC for quite some time, it all seems rather easy.  As long as you can find some flint as resources can be quite scarce if you join a game that has been running for more than a couple of hours.It's great to see things developing again for this game.  It has HUGE potential.  There just needs to be more to do as once you learn the basics, such as pick flowers to balance your sanity early on.  Cook your food and wear armour for fights the battle for survival doesn't seem so hard after all.  Most games I have played don't seem to last until winter.  I do intend some longer planned sessions with friends.  The casual games I have joined seem to end up with quite a lot of fire starters trying to burn down the world.Overall it's well worth the money and I have a lot of confidence in the developer to add new features and hopefully get Reign Together with Giants, or some such title."

,Recommended,322330,28154927,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,A Gramophone,"If you've never played don't starve before, let me tell you:It will be hard.You will die.Starvation is the least of your worries. Most of the time.Also, this review will have no 'spoilers' for what's to come.Do yourself a favor and play a bit offline before hopping to online servers. They're likely the reason for ~1/3 the negative reviews.And one last thing: You can hold space to pick up nearby things, and F to lock onto hostile enemies / living things you've recently decided aren't worth existing anymore.Personally, I keep finding myself come back to this game, playing it in short - long bursts. It has so much replayability, especially in the multiplayer edition. Maybe it's the art style, maybe it's just to see how fast I can make my gear for the next season, maybe it's because a friend wanted me to play it with them. Regardless, every time I play it I find myself entranced once more.And if you listen closely, I can tell you how your first few days will go if you've never seen anyone play this before.Attempt 1-20: You explore about, not sure what to do as you gather grass, sticks, and if you're lucky in DST multiplayer, flint. Unfortunately, you'll die on either day 1 or two, further if you're lucky enough to have another person's base established (DST Multiplayer.) Unfortunately, you will die early on, and will become a liability at best. Of course, this will evolve, as you begin to question if there's any challenge to this game.Either that, or you'll join a Winter / Summer / Spring server eventually (both of which have some... pretty nasty effects, to say the least. Best you avoid them.)Attempt 21 - 100: You finally get the hang of things, and make it from Fall -> Winter, or Spring -> Summer. However, you've never dealt with either, so you find yourself huddled against a fire or a tree for the majority of it, and likely die when... well, this is spoiler free, as I said. Maybe you'll check out the caves as well, before quickly heading back up because you didn't prepare for it.Attempt 101 - 500: Learn about the whole 'quality of life' items you can get - ham bat, pig skin, etc. Become decent atkiting, basebuilding, etc. and ultimately find your niche in one of those categories. Question how the hell you live through summer. A thought comes to your head to go in the caves and just camp out there, but often times it leads to your death and quite frankly it's a spooky place to be.Attempt 501 - 550: Start making it further and further through summer until you eventually make it through. Caves become quite smooth for you.Attempt 551: Wait what the f***Attempt 552: What's this guy doing in fallAttempt 553 - 600: Figure out how to survive fall again.Attempt 600+: Become fairly good at the game. Exploring the ruins is something you want to do, but you've never been down there before and - well, the cycle of the caves repeats.I'm at the Attempt 600+ area, so currently I can't quite speak beyond that without talking out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Turn off Reign of Giants, make the days long, make winter short, and switch it from Survival to Endless.-Only 6 players can play in your world at a time.-No dedicated servers. If you're not online and hosting the world, your friends can't play.Conclusion- If you like survival games & playing with your friends, you'll really enjoy Don't Starve Together."

I caught the game somewhere on the internet when it was a beta iOS title and it was running via an emulator of some sort. I was instantly in love and kept telling people about it. But they thought I was crazy and said no one wants to play a game like that, sounds like too much work. Wrong they were! (Channeled a bit of Yoda there)It's in my top 5 favorite games of all time. It's on an even more elite list of mine. I've purchased this game, no less than 6 times (possibly more). I bought Don't Starve for both my PC and my iPad (sometimes you're stuck somewhere you don't want to be. Nothing like pulling out your iPad at the Drs Office and playing some DS. Parents LOVE when they see me, because their kids crowd around to quietly watch...and occassional adult too). I've bought the game numerous times as gifts for other people, including my own daughter (we even did a version of Hard Knock Life (It's a Don't Starve Life) about the game.I rarely if ever buy a game more than once and for more than one console, unless I LOVE a game. I dare say I will still be playing this game when I'm a dottering old grandmother. Telling my grand kids..now THIS..this is how you make a good game. Watch and learn kids..watch and learn.

,Recommended,322330,26269112,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,strokeontent,"One of the best games I ever played. 9/10The game itself has a challenging yet adequate learning curve and plenty of content to discover. Overall the community is friendly and inclusive, definitely best played with friends.The first few games feel like everything is out to kill you (because it is), and you get a nice adrenaline kick just from frantically trying to survive and loads of laughs as you die in the most unimaginable ways. As you get more experienced and basic survival is no longer a challenge (took me about 30 hours for the novelty of survival to wear off), you'll start planning a bit further and preparing for each season's harsh climate conditions and bosses.This is when the real game starts and the importance of long term planning, working well with others and managing time and resources effectively become more obvious. It's no longer a matter of surviving, it's a matter of doing it in the most ingenious way possible by combining and interacting the different elements of the game.e.g.: Frog rain in spring? Certain death for some, free food for others.Even when you are familiar with the above ground map's climate conditions, biomes, mobs and resources, there is still a lower level (Caves) to explore, which adds an extra layer of complexity and adventure to the game.As if these incredibly addictive and time consuming aspects of the game weren't enough, there's yet another level which I am just starting to explore which are the Ruins of which I've only seen a couple of mobs and resources despite having played for over 200 hours.The only thing that I believe can be improved (hence the 9/10 rating) is that other than autumn, all other seasons can be quite un-welcoming to both new and experienced players alike, so you're much more likely to (be left to) die when joining a server during winter or summer.My favourite aspect of DST, is that it delivers these challenging mechanics and interactions through hilarious visuals and dark sarcasm, which will inevitably make you laugh even in the most difficult situations."

Don't worry, we had a great time around my campfire(or what was left of that campfire) and we played hide and seek all the night. He managed to find me in every corner of the map; it was fun, though, it was like I had a second Chester but a little bit bigger.Me and my friends had great time in this game. I like how every creature in this game automatically dislikes you and wants to kill you or steal from you(I look at you, Cave monkeys and Krampusse!). I think some of them are a little too overpowered(Dragonfly, Toadstool, Bee Queen) but that's the fun of the game.I highly recommend this game because you learn what really teamwork is and you don't need a high-end pc to run it. I have a ten years old pc and this game never crashed or stayed below 50 fps. Another reason to buy this game is the consistency and frequency of updates, which are delivered for free.

We've gone through Minecraft and Terraria but they no longer hold any appeal. The best way I can descibe this game is that it's like a survivalist sandbox; more dangerous than minecraft and even though the plot about maxwell isn't implemented in dst, it feels like the game has a direction. The graphics are great and I find the 2.5D style quite charming. Plus the modding community is very strong so there is always new content to try out."

So the game is basically a multiplayer online game where the point of it is to go as long as you can without getting killed or dying in some way shape or form. The biggest fault of the game is it gets boring after a few hours so be sure to give mods a chance if you dont like the game itself. The biggest pro of the game is that it is great for having a good time with friends and working together. Overall I think this game is a great buy for anyone who likes survival games. I give this game an 8 out of 10.

Here's why.I'm fully recommending the game, but from a certain standing point. I would have to say that even though I found the game enjoyable and tons of fun, it doesn't have lots of replay value. After you've played multiplayer for a few days, and each server resets itself, it gets kind of repetetive I'd say.You start to see the pattern emerging and quickly get tired of it.However, for cc.50-100 hours of gameplay and fun, I'd say it's worth the price, and you get what you paid for.ProsOriginal design and authentic, makes playing the game feel refreshing.Plenty of items and crafting to explore and work with.Chester.Good community workshop with more than enough mods.ConsGets a bit repetetive.Community can be very toxic and destructive(even on PvE servers..especially there..)Public servers hosted by Klei can be very laggy and ping heavy, thus resulting in only a few okay ones. Shouldn't be a problem if you can host for yourself, or find a decent one."

It is here for years now and it has become one of the most liked survival games so there re lots of gameplay videos and trailers you can check before buying. But like i mentioned its a must have and its really cheap for its worth.pros:- endless gameplay with lots of content.- awsome graphics, sounds/musics.- very colorfull and changing with all the biomes, seasons, day-night cycles and even with random maps which has to be like a copy of each other but nope they re not.- even tough its a sandbox survival it has a very good story mod which is implented in sandbox play. i consider it a pro cos first of all you can play both sandbox and story mod in one save with same character without ruining or effecting each other. starting the story mode is even better. you dont just click a button but complete some task which re not given but to be solved as you play. not givin more info as it will be spoiler.- simple to play hard to survive meaning you can play with your family or moto gang.- runs smooth even on low spec laptops with all that shinny graphics thanks to easy to render artwork models.- bug free! yes never noticed any bugs. well maybe there is some but not even noticed so gues its more than enough.- for controller types this is one of the rare games that i consider gamepad is better. good support and even if you re not familiar with a controller you can easily get used to it while playing dont starve in minutes. well its a must if you ask me.- very active developers. every month/year i expect them to leave the game alone as its ok already but now they come up with even more content.- very active workshop. lots of mods new characters etc.- CHEAP for this kind of game and developing/support. really they deserve more for sure.- even if you say im done with this game (well yea after a year or something you dont wanna spend like 5 hours playing same game) you cant get rid of all those artwork, musics and all kind of stuff about this game. it suddenly becomes something like a childhood memory that you cant forget. just like a cartoon character or something.well cant think of a con but maybe some can say its a bit repeating but to say that you need to spend at least dunno 3-4 months playing. also 1 out of 20 people hates this game just in very first mins of gameplay for no reason. dunno why maybe the artwork but yea thats the fact :Dso if you want to add another game to your favorites of all time list just go for it."

The addition of extra players, plus tweaking of existing mechanics balanced around multiplayer and an incentive to keep your companions alive, makes the game very fun and leads to a lot of memorable moments, especially with friends (like when they're insane and being attacked by monsters only they can see, and you're chasing them trying to force-feed them jerky to make them regain their sanity and make the monsters stop attacking).If you enjoyed Don't Starve, and you have friends who also enjoy Don't Starve, this is great fun and I highly recommend it. If you want to play online without friends, do so at your own risk - the community is varied at best.p.s. Connections can be finnicky at times, but the game is generally quite playable and rubberbanding is very uncommon. There's never any real desyncing issues with the host, and most mods work clientside and won't affect the host."

I use the premade telltale heart to save one and craft another to save the other one.13. After they're ressurected I find the third and I have them all follow me back.14. Night comes upon the world and everyone (but me) flips. (Me - uuugh.)15. I barely save them.We stay put untill morning.16. We head back toward the base.17. One friend finds a tentical spike by a body.18. A bee attacks him and he flips (rappid tapping f to hit it).19. The idiot hits me several times and kills me. (Me - You idiot. WHY?!? I get you're a noob but geeze.)20. I tell them how to save me but they pretty much just screw off. (In my head ""screw you guys"".)21. I haunt science machine causing it to burst into flames. (Me - Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry guys. *Lies*)22. They franticly run around THROUGH THE FIRE. (I burst into tears laughing as they scream)23. They all die.24.

Now, it doesn't compare to the original game story wise, because all the characters are already unlocked. This kind of removes a lot of the story aspect or appeal of trying to complete certain challenges. Then again with this in mind nothing compares to a multiplayer expirience where you're just having fun with your friends. If you're looking for the story and lore aspect you're going to be more satisfied with the single-player, base game.

76561198074644085,Recommended,322330,20100230,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,AfroSpaceJesus,"This game receives a lot of credit from the start of my review for being so incredibly unique. Allow me to begin with a brief yet relevant tangent: the ever-growing community of gamers in today's technologically advanced society has brought about more and more games being produced with each passing day. And as great as that is, a lot of these games have begun to look the same. Call of Duty, Battlefront, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, they all satisfy the exact same prerequisites to create a wartime, pro-America, FPS videogame, and they all appeal to the exact same audience. I'm not saying these are bad games by any means; as a matter of fact they are each highly successful franchises in their own regard. All I'm saying is that they're all too similar to one another. After playing just one, I get the point. Shoot the bad guys, dont let them shoot you. There's nothing noticeable enough to distinguish them from their competitors, but the demand for such games is large enough that they can share the market.Now back to the review: Don't Starve is NOT one of these games. And that's why I love it so much. It almost categorizes itself into its own genre, and I applaud that endlessly in this day and age. The permadeath feature of the game is frustrating to the novice gamer for obvious reasons, but there are in-game settings to adjust the penalty for dying. The gameplay itself is exhilerating, especially when coordinating strategies among friends (although if you're anything like my friends you'll spend hours screaming at each other over Skype), but that's all part of the fun. The world is vast, and there are lots of areas to explore, enemies to kill, and loot to find and craft. The goal is blatantly simple, but the means of completing the goal are devastatingly complex.All in all it's a great game at a great price, and it's often times on sale (I bought it for $10).Two thumbs up!"

You will cry inside when you die, and dance when you make your first permanent base. Luckily for when you die, you can be resurrected by a friend,  touch stone, or the portal. Even though you can come back to life in DST, this game is unforgiving. Don't Starve was even more brutal (with permanant death) but still fun. DST has a lot of content and I recommend this for you.

Between its vast majority of places to explore, character variety, and constant additions, the Don't Starve game series is one I'll never get tired of. Every game you join or world you create you discover something new, or are forced to play in a different way to adapt and survive.Many survival games, once you get the hang of it, it doesn't stay much of a ""survival"" game. But with Don't Starve Together there are many situations that you may not expect to happen that can catch you off guard, such as the newer bosses constantly being added, getting ambushed while exploring the caves, or even just running out of resources forcing you to rely on your wits, instantly putting you back into the game.The Klei developers themselves are also amazing people, I have seen them time and time again actually talk to those who play the game so people's voices are actually heard, and they are constantly adding new things to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a completely refreshing and new twist on the survival game genre, and wants more of a challenge out of their games. 10/10"

There is pretty much all of the original content included, minus Adventure Mode and the Shipwrecked DLC (not original content, but whatever).There are many great mods out there for this game, from things to make the game easier or harder, adding new features or characters, or just tweaking small things here and there. In addition, making a mod for this game is surprisingly easy, and there are many great tutorials out there to help you along the way.All in all, I think that Don't Starve Together is a great game, and only £11 for pretty much two copies of Don't Starve and the Reign of Giants DLC, where can you go wrong?

It has artistic elements reminicent of Tim Burton's style; rough pen designs, a dark and limited color palette, with odd and disproportionate bodies, characters and monsters, which work to set the tone. Unfortunately some of the art assets don't scale well on higher resolutions, perhaps a redux or texture rework would improve such, although this contributes to the fact that it works pretty well on most machines regardless of specification, even providing a netbook mode for such hardware.There are many elements to the survival, producing a somewhat steep learning curve. However, you may edit certain parameters that affect the generation of terrain, giving rise to many possible scenarios and replayability in addition to potentially easing it's difficulty through specific options such as turning off bees. Actually, just turn bees off, it's better without.good stuff."

The concept of being able to connect to people all throughout your country and not just your local area is absolutely genius. So many multiplayer games that iv'e played only allow you to game with locals. DST? worldwide. If your worried about connection, it tells you your ping so you can select the best server for you. Gameplay? Fabulous. It includes so much more than the normal DS and is constantly being added to every now and then. For example, they just released a new boss mob, the bee queen. How awesome is that. The artstyle is outstanding and the ability to add mods just makes DST a whole new experience for gamers. I rate 10/10. Obama out *mike drop*."

Does the sales often and also includes a gift for your friend. These guys are the real gamers who are constantly working to make this work and I can see that. Hopefully this game farther develop. If you like original 'Don't Starve', you are likely to fall for this one as well. Here's pros and cons of this game:Pros: Get to play Don't Starve in multiplayer. Also RoG contents are included/in process (still beta after all)Cons: Host-guest game sync issues (latency). Some bugs since still in development. Major bug is where server is no longer joinable by others or particular players. Many times not good game experience with strangers. Too many noobs. :pUpdated: Jan 2, 2016 @ 3:52pm------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Klei is still making more contents! This really amazes me. Playing this game since the beta, I thought after official release from beta, no more contents would be made after fixing bugs. But game continues to add contents. Contents with background stories that puzzles players. The lores and the mysteries that it entails. Its amazing. Very in dept of a game. It takes a form of what is a survival roguelike RPG into deeper and deeper stage buildling on top of it. Who knows it might turn out to be something like of MMORPG? It has limitless potential. Only truely skilled players may be able to conquer the game to its depts.Updated: Aug 17, 2017 @ 11:37pm"

Don't starve together gives me an incentive to thrive and do well, because I'm with friends, and the developers really communicate with the community, (they even did a cheeky ARG). It's great to do well, but about half of my playtime is messing around with console commands with a few other people, which was arguably the more fun section, though it was less rewarding. The art style is very cute but dark, a lot of effort put into examination quotes, particularly for wendy, some of those quotes are so edgy i burst out laughing, and others just plain sad, ""I used to like playing with Abigail""-upon examining the rain coat. (Abigail is her dead sister, who she brings back as a ghost). Most of the community is very constructive on the Klei forums, and the people who really like this game dedicate much of their time to it, particularly Glrhmzz/Glermz. The lore is very spooky and mysterious, and i think worked out why it is classed as horror, and you too can find this if you dig a little deeper.This game is a lot like marmite, but rather than hating it, the people have just not heard of it. This game is my personal example of a cult following, which often forms one of the best communities. The few who do dislike the game (check the reviews...) because of specific reasons are mostly due to not enough effort put into it. A few other people I know who got this game recently were barely surviving the first days of winter, whilst me and the more experienced veterans were starting our megabase. Though i do accept this game is not for everyone, try to survive a year, and then see what you think. Once you survive your first year, the survival aspect dimms- though it is still very easy to die and you can relax a bit, choosing to go to dangerous places and pick bigger fights at will. You really need to put effort into this game to get a lot out of it, but if you do, it is definitely worth it. Also, use the c_rollback() command to go back to the start of the past day, it does the same thing as the menu but quicker, so it isn't a cheat, it really helps save your sprawling metropolis you poured hours of work into burning down."

I love how in-depth Klei have gone in the Characters, including designs and backstories. The art style is beautiful, hats off to those in charge of the Art in-game! The music compliments the artstyle, too, fitting in perfectly with the eery feel of the world you're forced  to survive in. The animations and overall cartoon feel goes well!Moving onto gameplay, you start of with the only playable character being Wilson (<3). The game gets progressively harder as the winter approaches, and is a very unforgiving towards players - every that could kill you, most likely will. To the ones who haven't already played this game, I recommend playing singleplayer first, and possibly reading up on a few tips and tricks to get you started; It's easy to get caught out! It's good fun to just jump right in, and have a good go though!As for the community, I have personally found them to be a caring and kind one. A creative bunch, you can find a lot of player-created mods and fan art/fiction/music etc on the internet.10/10 gameplay, 100000000000000/10 community (I've personally found them all to be so kind X3), 8/10 replayability for singleplayer, 9-10/10 replayability for multiplayer!Do I recommend this game?

I haven't even spent very much time on this game (as of today, 12/19/14) and I already am in love with it.Pros ++Great Graphics+Good Amount of Playable Characters+Can Play With Friends (obviously)+Awesome Mega Turkeys+Good Amount of Water; Not Too Much, Not Not Enough, Just a Good Amount of Water.Cons --You Really Expect There To Be Any Cons?

You're not only trying to survive but you're trying to beat your own preious goals each time you begin a new server. Every day that passes you and your friends scurry off trying to gather as many supplies for the winter (and days ahead) and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot.The multiplayer element really makes the game just as enjoyable as the single player version. With friends you're able to set goals and tasks to each person and team up in combats. PVP is a ""hunger games"" like experience. Seeing another player is frightening but an opportunity to team up and take on the server.Modding for this game is highly accessible and easy to implement. The host of each server controls modding, so whatever mods they have installed, they will be the only ones avalible to use. Un-modded servers are available, however if you havn't played the single player version of Don't Starve I wouldn't recommend joining any un-modded serves. The game requires some getting used to and practice.As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body. Highly reccomended, good luck and Don't Starve."

The game DOES have a story, but you do need to do a certain number of things to beat it (I don't know how). The game is best played with more than two people, but really any number is fine. One last thing to add, if you enjoy a spooky, Tim Burton style game, this is definitely for you. But if you prefer FPS games to hardcore indie survival games, go buy PUBG or something instead."

What I mean by this is add more levels to the caves, have a chance to randomly find a pirate ship on the map which would then transport you to the Shipwrecked world (kind of like caves work).

Sitting behind the table and holding one more notebook.I met this day dreamer girl three years ago and I still cannot help myself understand how she changes her endless fairytale so fast.She tells me wonderful stories about the portal and about strange winsome trickster. She tells, that I enter her world through that weird portal. The main rule of the journey: your name should begin on W.Her pictures are colorful, beautiful and grim at the same time. She shows her maps piece by piece and whispers about characters; they used to know each other. Maybe they even saw each other one life before. But now they stucked in this fairy world. One of them is the girl who is haunted by her sister.. the spider boy, the mad scientist, who can create any kind of mysterious stuff… the child with matches - she is addicted to fire.Okay. Now about the main part!This world is aggressive and violent to every protagonist in the game. Everything around wants to kill every character. I am pretty serious. The starvation is not the main option you should afraid. I will repeat it again: you should be afraid of everything but famine, nothing will give up the idea of killing. Nothing but pigs. Of course pigs are the kindest creatures in the world. Who can imagine it? I like the idea of pigs, who can build a friendship with you only because of food. It reminds me someone… but who?Despite I have been playing this game for 3 years, it still can surprise me!I think that vegan rabbits deserve few words. If you want some hot feelings you may go to caves(and dont throw away meat from your pockets) find some bunnies and come closer to that little white sleepy ball of fur…You will be impressed! I promise!The most thing I like in the game - characters speech. Because their speech is full of sarcastic phrases and references. It makes them more interesting and alive.The game worth buying. Really. You should try it!But! Dont forget that your archenemy is your “faithful” and “trusty” companion… His vocabulary usualy consists of the phrases:RESURRECT ME!HELP ME!Give me some food.________________________________________________________________И вот я сижу за столом, держу еще одну тетрадь.Мое знакомство с этой фантазеркой произошло еще три года назад и я до сих пор не могу смириться с тем, как быстро изменяется ее бесконечная история.Она рассказывает мне чудные сказки о портале и о странном, но обаятельным фокуснике. Говорит, что можно проникнуть в тот мир сквозь портал. Главное позаботиться о том, чтобы твоё имя начиналось на букву В.Её рисунки красочны,  прекрасны и зловещи в то же время.  Она открывает карты по частям и шепчет о том, как отдаленно знакомые, возможно даже пересекающиеся в прошлой жизни, персонажи попали в дикий сказочный мир. Среди них есть девочка оберегаемая своей мертвой сестрой...мальчик, которого в детстве сьел паук... безумный ученый, который так легко может создать то, о чем не каждый подумает... ребенок со спичками - она зависит от языков пламени.Лирическое вступление есть, а теперь коротко о главном.Мир жесток и агрессивен ко всем героям. Всё, что есть вокруг изо всех сил пытается каждого персонажа. Голод это совсем не то, чего нужно бояться. Еще раз повторю: бояться нужно всего остального, оно не будет переставать пытаться убить героя/героев. Кроме свиней. Свиньи, конечно, сущие одуванчики. Кто бы мог подумать. Всегда умиляло то, что в этом мире свиньи дружат с тобой только из-за еды. Напоминает кого-то...Хм. кого же?Игра способна удивить не смотря на то, что играю далеко не первый год.Отдельного абзаца заслужили и кролики-веганы: безумно милые твари. Хотите острых ощущений? Зайдите в пещеры наивно подойдя к одному белому спящему комочку, имея мясо в инвентаре - масса положительных эмоций обеспечена.В игре идеально подобраны  каждого  персонажа - их речь часто пестрит отсылками и забавными саркастическими изречениями, что делает их более интересными и живыми.Игра стоит того, чтобы купить ее и залипнуть на долгое время.Кроме того, надо отдать должное KLEI, дополнения к игре выходят часто. Этакий ГИГАНТСКИЙ (смотрите, шутка!) бонус.Главное - не забудьте, что ваш главный противник это ваш ""верный"" и ""надежный"" напарник... словарный запас которого состоит из трех фраз:1) воскреси меня!!!!!!!2) помоги мне!!!3) дай мне еды!!!!"

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I like how many new things they are trying out with this game, like beefalo taming and riding, clothing to customize characters with, and just the fact that you can survive with others or perish in a land that has overcome you. I can't wait to see what is in the next update because you don't really know what could be done next. But I would say that this game is one of the funnest I've played because every time you load up a new map, it feels like a whole new game because of the randomized generation feature this game has in multiplayer and single player. Then having reign of giants come free with the game makes it even funner to survive, because instead of just summer and winter, there's spring, summer, autumn, and winter to survive through along with the other giants that come as the seasons do."

Even though I have not played the original Dont Stave I found that it did not present a steep learning curve however one may want to refer to game guides if you are not familiar with survival based games or when one reaches the more advanced sections in the game such as the winter or crafting  complicated items.Not only is it a constant battle for food, you will need to keep yourself sane as you battle against the elements, fight the savage wilderness and strange creatures that roam the land. Stay out of the dark as Charlie haunts the pitch shroud  at night and one would need to be strategic while preparing for the winter as it only gets tougher to survive. The experience and atmostsphere is only enhanced by the drawn style graphics which closely resemble the works of Tim Burton (Creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas and other movie titles.).One could say that there are elements present that are Minecraft inspired however stating that this game is anything close to Minecraft would be completely incorrect as I believe this game is very original in it's own right.Second of all this game offers so much fun and stability for an early access game it is defintely worth it. To be entirely honest this game does not feel like an early access beta at all. Very little lag is experienced during gameplay, it is well optimized for a beta version and I have not experienced any game breaking bugs nor have I encountered a single game crash as of yet.Pros:+ Runs like a beauty (No need for a beefy computer).+ Huge replayability (With the addition of mods to make it even more interesting or challenging.)+ Many customizable options for maps (Amount of resources, enemies, size, etc.).+ Creating servers is simple and quick.+ Simple controls.Cons:+ When hosting a sever with 6 or more players the game tends to lag slightly. (A dedicated server will probably fix this issue.)+ No in-game tutorial for the begginers to DST who have not played the orignal DS.Unfortunately controller / gamepad is still not available to use in this DST however I cannot classify this as a con as it is a matter of preference wether you prefer to play with a key board and mouse or a gamepad however if you prefer a gamepad then this would be a con.On a final note there is nothing more satisfying than playing this game with a couple of friends, I have found this game to be truely rewarding and can be enjoyed for hours.I am extremely happy with the money I have spent and would recommend this anyone looking for a co-op survival game."

Then Klei gave me a free multiplayer and a bunch of upadates to boot.Why I will fanboy for Don't Starve?1. They actually came out of early access and did it right.2. Klei has given us free updates/content for a game that felt complete years ago.3. The price is great, just look at the hours of some of the reviews.4. It's a binge game that you will binge play time and time again...months, even years later.5. Art diurection and game design are creative and keep you playing.

Gameplay wise, well... hmm, it is good, and there is tons and tons of things you could do, build and loot, but since the game has only one ""mission"" (to survive) I feel like most if it is just to prolong the gameplay experience, I'm not really into that... Once you realize you can make it to day 50 without much of effort you realize that going around a map and trying to loot different stuff is... yea, pretty useless since you have only one goal. I guess this game is good for those who love going around and seraching for stuff and etc, but for people who look for diversity, missions, story or something like that, game is gonna get boring after few hours. 3.5 / 5"

DEATH.The name kinda tells you the base of the games objective but what you don't know is the depth of what you can and have to do to not starve. BUT NOW YOU CAN DO IT WITH FRIENDS!!Find berries. death, carrots or kill animals for various types of meat that will fill your belly and even make you go insane!Depending on what food you eat, or how to prepare and cook it (by mixing it with other food and using a croc pot) it will restore more health, fill your hunger or increase/decrease your sanity bar. If you have the DLC (Reign of Giants) you will also have to deal with overheating and freezing to death (the freezing one is also in the base game)Surviving is what your new life is about in this hellish new world. Find food, fight off monsters and hunger while always trying to keep yourself from going insane. Your food bar is always going down, forcing you to find food to fill your mighty belly. Health goes down when struck by enemies, eating rotten food or depending on your character (will talk about that below) damaged by certain specific events (like rain.) Watch your heat so you don't freeze to death, allowing your temp reach 0 or below will deal damage to you. But when its summer, watch out that the heat so welcomed in the winter will not give you heat stroke, causing the same effects and will cause unwanted damage to your player. Finally, your sanity. Sanity is drained passively while near thingys (objectives in survival mode) being in the darkness, at night in general, being near enemies or eating spoiled food or bad food. In the multiplayer version, you will also have to deal with people killing you and stealing your items. Make sure you focus on a good defense or offense to protect all you have worked for.Many types of food to make, plenty of resources to scavenge for and potentially very massive maps that give you tons of content to explore for weapons, clothing, gadgets and trinkets.Several unique characters make replaying when you die worthwhile, if you hate wilson and his scientific beard, play as the robot who hates rain, or as the strong man, who is a bulldozer on steroids when his hunger is filled but becomes weaker when it is not.Track your progress and ""high scores"" by tallying your days (it will do this by itself and give you exp for new characters this way but more for bragging rights) and try and pass them every attempt.You will die, trust me. The first couple tries will kill you and if by some luck or amazing skill you made it far enough to see your first winter, that will kill you.Modded characters are fun to play, all set with their own pros and cons, and most being very balanced and playable in-game. + most of the mods are very helpful, like tracking your stats better, keeping your items better stacked and allowing for easier travel.Say hello to the shadow beasts for me ;)Personal Rating: 4/5"

The newest patch is great where you have the wild mode, but if you want a normal game, that you won't get angry at, you should add in the option to be able to add resurrection to the server you're currently playing in.  I often play alone since I only have one friend, trying to get more but you know I'm p lonely, and when i'm trying to set up my camp and enjoy the game and actually get to explore the entire map which I've never done it would probably be very beneficial to add that feature.  Really, I'm getting mad because I suck.  That's a personal anger problem, but when you have to redo everything constantly, it's given you're going to get annoyed especially when the game is so fun!"

Its a pretty hard game at first surving a few weeks is a huge challenge as you learn more about the game the way you play improves and you last longer each time. Its amazing to get on and have your own adventure with friends or people you have never met just beware of the willow trolls.

KEEP IN MIND THIS IS EARLY ACCESS AND THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. But personally, i'm  not really fund of having this sensless survival. like, if you played original Don't Starve, there's at least an objective, something you have to do other than survive. but in this game it's simply...survive, or as the game says, Don't Starve. it might change in the future, but currently it hasn't .and something that honestly ruins the experience is the whole ghosts thing. basically when other people die they turn into ghosts and even if they're really far away, it will slowly drain your sanity. and this bothers a lot specially in PvP servers. because what's the point of fighting everyone if after they die their ghosts will drain your sanity. so really, this would be a good idea, but only if ghosts are close to you not when they're 1000 miles away. but keep in mind this might be subject to change.So why give this a good review with this specific cons? because the game's not completely finished. who knows, maybe in the future we will get objectives and the ghosts will be nerfed. but even if that doesn't happen, this game is fun to play from time to time and it can get pretty fun, specially when playing with friends.as it is right now, I give this game 8/10"

76561198080167024,Recommended,322330,30204877,Posted: 26 February,all,Katie,"I'm mainly a solo player, so I don't have much experience with the balance of having many people in one world, but the game itself is extremely well-balanced in my opinion. The more you know, the more creative you get to be with how you deal with things, but everything has a catch. Think you found a great source of food by hunting Koalefants all the time? Well, you might just run into a nasty Varg or Ewecus instead. Built your base around a bunch of Beefalo for protection? I hope you brought your Beefalo hat for disguise so they don't angrily maul you during mating season.The only big imbalance is in the character selection. Some characters are pretty OP compared to others, so you could have a very different game experience depending who you choose and how you use them. Otherwise, you can't really get OP unless you've invested many hours and game-years into your world, and it's easy to fail like a total noob if you don't know what you should be doing, or simply lack knowledge of some readily-available solutions. But at the same time, failing can be totally hilarious and even fun. I highly recommend running around in a new world and just seeing what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.I like to learn by looking things up, since learning the hard way is typically very time consuming (though world-rollback helps a lot) considering how vast an array of experiences and circumstances you can run into and how easy it is to completely fail without a few tidbits of knowledge. You're almost always on your toes, and every idea or option can potentially be a life-ending or life-saving one. Every second counts! However, if you learn too much the easy way, it does become a little less fun, since there is less to discover for yourself.I also just love the art style, and there is a good amount of humor in the game with the designs of creatures, their punny names, behavior, and what each character has to say about them.Overall, this game is one of my all-time favorites. 10/10"

Nothing has changed.They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4.With local co-op.Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.If the developers of the game change their mind in the future, I will recommend this game."

For me, Minecraft is boring. After finding everything like water temples and getting all the achievements, that's it. Maybe some mini-game servers can keep you interested for longer but you'll stop playing it eventually. Don't Starve Together is different. It has an amazing atmosphere and feel to it that I have never experienced. Not only that but the 2D characters in a 3D world is something I have never seen in another games. There is so much to find! Monsters, biomes, bosses, etc! You can be playing this game for years and maybe miss something! Don't Starve Together is the defination of survival and exploration.

It still gets stale pretty fast.Story  - This game has no narrative, so...absent.Sound - Pretty good atmospheric sounds and ambience.Gameplay - There's a minimal sense of progression but all of it can be robbed of you pretty quickly. Without a leveling up system it leaves you feel like most games are a rush to get the best items and to hold out, like a surival game-lite moba.Replayability - Fair, but I'd still prefer Haven and Hearth over this.Positives:+Attractive (if not a meme at this point) art style+Decent entry into the wave of survival-esque games+Cool sound effects+Doesn't require a gaming computer to run+Pick up and play+unlockable loot crate style items are more an ambiguous ""positive"" but it adds replayabilityNegatives:-Very weak combat system-Brutal winters unless you shorten them, thereby playing on a weaker difficulty setting-Griefers and player killers are abound on most non PVE servers-no strong sense of progression-no achievementsFinal Verdict: I don't regret paying for it but I dont see myself playing DST very often with all the other survival type games out there that don't look like they were made in flash."

Overall it's a good game that is worth the time with friends.Pros:-Good combat-Good graphics given that it's only 2D-playable on bad pc (Might just be me)-Alot of content such as gear, weapons, items, ect-Bosses for loot-Seasons for game changing gameplay-Can explore cavesCons:-Sometimes lag (Not sure about now)"

You cant hit anything early on, not even punching you have to craft a weapon for combat. Game could be a lot better with quality fixes. I understand it is a survival game but the combat mechanics are super basic. Maps can be RNG. Game requires a wiki to be open on the side.

,Recommended,322330,32240940,Posted: 7 June,all,The Walking Phallus,"Don't starve together - going day with grafickim unique style, which personally I have been following almost since the very first game. The game puts a simple task - to survive. To do this, we need only that is, to build a fire before dark, which obviously found something bad and not get caught the eye of evil monsters. But it's more complicated than you think. Players are constantly faced with a variety of problems, starting with rain and ending with attack zaskriptovany hounds.You can choose one of the characters, which have both advantages and disadvantages. Playing in the style of Pve (players vs environment) - you can create bundles of good, compensating the weaknesses of each other and facilitate survival. You can create a pvp and a server where players will be aggressive and try to kill you for supplies. For me personally, is the worst option, because the emphasis in the system is disgusting. Or rather - it is not. the axe on mob is different from the felling of trees only what is moving the goal. This greatly complicates the fight, making it uncomfortable.Overall, don't starve together is a wonderful game that really develops, and on which the developers did not score. This is good, because the game is addictive, and every death is more of a challenge to live more next time, which holds in the game. The game has small flaws, but they do not prevent to receive pleasure from the game. Buy this game."

,Recommended,322330,26204890,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,Tittysprinkles,"This game is hilarious.  At times it can be punishing, but through settings can be more manageable for those looking for less of a challenge.  It doesn't do much in the realm of holding your hand, which contributes to the challenge, especially for the puzzle-solving seakers out there.  While I think it's more enjoyable to play the co-op version with a friend, it doesn't mean the single player experience isn't worth checking out.  I haven't experienced co-op through the public roulette of open servers -- so I can't speak to the experience of finding a game and playing it that way.  If you do, just know that you'll need a solid chunk of time to devote toward getting futher in the game.  You can save your co-op progress for future shenanigans if you need to hit the proverbial pause button.  Solid game."

My friends had bugs like clicking a monster to attack it, instead they start walking towards it. Stuff like that put us off a lot. A couple of months later this game is a blast. We had so much fun without all these bugs. It was amazing to just play all afternoon, build a nice big base, have stored enough food and materials to survive the winter, just so a giant can come, destroy out base and kill us. Twice. On two worlds. Even then it was fun and enjoyable. I recommend this game to and survival game fan as this is one pretty hardcore survival and rogue-like game. If you have 2-3 friends to play with, I suggest playing with them instead of joining a random server, but it's up to you.

,Recommended,322330,13841049,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,MilesRayne,"As a fan of survival games, from DayZ to Rust, from 7 Days to Die to Minecraft, I've found the original Don't Starve quite interesting. However I always loved the multiplayer aspect of it all. The enemies, the friends, surviving together and fighting the enemies of the world together. That's why I could never fully enjoy Don't Starve. The game was amazing in every aspect, but I always got bored after an hour or so. I needed friends. I needed someone to share my success with. That's what Don't Starve Together allowed me.As I'm writing this review I've been hosting a server for ~16 hours so far. Mods that you can download allow you to increase the maximum number of players on a server (which is currently 6), so with the mod installed I can now host up to 30 players. I'm hosting a server with 15 players on with almost no lag whatsoever, and the fun I've had I simply cannot describe with words. Surviving the enemies, winter, finding food, sharing things, just chatting and having fun, crafting together, cooking food, etc... The friends I've made in just 16 hours of gameplay...The community is incredibly friendly, with an exception that, as a host, you always have to be ready to ban a Willow or two, cause even though 90% of the community is friendly, the remaining 10% pick Willow and just come to burn your base down. Other than that, the whole experience is amazing, and the addition of multiplayer to Don't Starve is literally the thing I wanted most. If you like Don't Starve, this is a must have!TL;DR The addition of multiplayer to this game is amazing. Buy this thing!"

But if it's a fight for food then the people will need to not starve by finding food by working together. If the people do not have an abundance of food they will starve and die. Don't starve with food would means that the people are just refusing to eat causing starvation which will lead to the stomach eating itself. Don't starve without food means that the people  either can not find food or have to fight for it and end up losing  the food which will also lead to the stomach eating itself. If the people do not wish to starve then the people will have to find food or else it could lead to the death of the people.

Server's are easy to make and easy too find. Ton's of endless fun with friends, but the Workshop Errors get annoying I had a friend look through the error's and it is a Lua Script error and he cannot fix it however I do not think this is a problem with the game more a problem with the Developer of the Mod. But, a way too fix this issue is when you get the error and the Option either Leave the game or Disable Mods on top of it, it shows the list of mods enabled. Replace that with the mod(s) causing the error so the player/owner can delete it or contact the dev who made it too fix it. This is the only problem I find with the game but everything is great!I would give this a Positive score9.2/10"

76561198111550830,Recommended,322330,28890942,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Xiao,"There is Plenty to do in the game, especially when you play with friends. Enough content (and more being added) in the base game, and if you want more, you can change it up how much you want in the workshop by downloading mods for it.I don't die much unless I'm killed by a random player, but when unlucky events do happen, or when you first start the game (Not used to the gameplay), I'd say this is one of those games with a slight Love/Hate relationship. You die over and over yet you can never hate the game. Not nearly as love/hate-ie as the first game though, Don't Starve, the Single Player Only game, as when you died there, heh, sucks for you!The game sticks around Multiplayer gameplay, meaning all Boss HP is increased from the first game, as they're meant to have more people beating on them, I've Noticed that hunting rabbits (expecially with traps) makes it to where they don't respawn the next day or sometimes longer meaning that if there's alot of players eating the same food, you'll run out.  Basically, certain things may be more easy when you play alone, but yet when you play with others you'll get further, Because it IS a multiplayer game and that's what they stuck to.The game isn't very glitchy at all. I have noticed a few here and there, but they're all ""Personal"" glitches as I call them, meaning: Only certain people get them and still have them even after disabling all mods and redownloading the game. (Example: I can't hear certain mobs, I sometimes crash out of the blue, ""Don't Starve Together Has Stopped Responding"")   I wouldn't say that's a problem on the game's part for now, but as some other people have ""Certain glitches"", Maybe not exactly mine, it may be.Over all, this game is REALLY fun. It's a big step from the Single Player version, and (With the Beta) has pretty cute content c;   Though I would recommend more SMALLER mobs, as not everyone fights those raid bosses. Yes, Baby pets and No-eyed Deer have been added to NR Beta, but there's not alot you can do with those...and rabbits, for example, are getting a bit boring."

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

It's 437% (code) better than Multiplayer and also instanly make you a Multiplayer expert.x Pigmen are creepy, but then cute, but then very demonic. You will just have to live with the uneasy feeling being around these creaturex First time playing? A n y t h i n g can kill you. Seasoned survivor? Other people kill you. Mastered the game? You kill the game for other players.Thats about all the first things Popup as I say "" Dont starve Together"" loudly in my Mount and Blade Teamspeak. Then I realize the latter game is better.No. I joke. DST is very fun , and have unlimited potentials, to become any kind of game (try a PvP wilderness game, it's PUBG with more depth more fear less shooting :( )"

If you have a group of friends that enjoy survival games then it should automatically be a must get amongst your list of games.  At first, your first experience can be extremely unforgiving, but as you get through the basics of the game you will find it easier and easier to survive. The game has a nice mechanic that increases the difficulty as you survive longer that includes an increment in ""hound raids"" and boss spawning every season which helps keep up the challenge of survival."

Don't starve is my favorite survival game and most people say its too hard and guess what its supposed to be!  there are so many things to be explored and discovered.  every day you come across some wierd structure or mob that you are clueless about its just so fun find these things and find out what they do or can do, plus a friend or two it makes 10 times better.  I would say though my only critisism for together is that if you are joining not hosting you get kinda laggy but its not that bad and its very not to starve because now you have two mouths to feed (unless your not working together and split up."

Even with everything on the 'low' setting all seasons and enemies are still able to kill you and destroy your month-old base in seconds regardless of any preparation/special clothing/items you had. Too much of my time wasted building bases that just get destroyed because a fire wolf burned them down.Add in a fire extinguisher if you're going to add in wild fires, simple."
76561198183518214,Not Recommended,322330,24927855,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Dolldum,"I was originally bagered by a friend to download this game so we could play together.All I can say is, i'm glad I didn't spend my own money on this game.To sum it up, you run around as different selectable cartoon characters- each with their own strength in ""something"" and each with their own particular weakness.EX: Willow gains sanity points from fire, however if she becomes insane begins to freeze to death.EX 2: Wendy has a ghost sidekick (her sister) who can fight for/with her. She can aggro and tank enemies, and deal damage. However Wendy herself has some of the lowest base attack damage in the game and has a hard time killing without her ghost.The goal is simple: To survive. You must run around and gather food, collect materials, and build items to help you survive through each season or die. (EX: you need to gather items and craft warm clothing for the winter season or risk freezing to death). You also have to fight with the strange creatures that inhabit the land, some friendly but many of which will try to kill you for no reason. There are also boss fights at set intervals in the game, usually one for each season.HOWEVER.Why am I not giving this game a positive review?Honestly this game loses its novelty very quickly. Once you survive through all the seasons at least once, you have gathered basically everything you need to survive those four seasons again. (The seasons loop).The only real task you will have is basically gathering from then on, as you've probably explored 99% of the map by the end of the  four seasons. You'll run around just restocking on food, if you haven't already created your base camp next to the beefalo (some of the best source of meat in the game) and relocated all the tree's, saplings, and berry bushes you need right around your camp. Although you will have to leave to gather ores, as rocks are the only thing unrelocatable for convinence.The only real replay value in this game is if you decide you want to try to survive with a different character, which will require some slight tweaking on how you approach surviving but not by extremely too much unless your the mime guy who basically dies to everything.So sure, feel free to survive until day 100.....day 200.....day 300. It's just gonna be a repeat of all the crap you spent doing the first runthrough of the 4 seasons. Nothing new really occurs.The Caves BETA is a very nice addition to the game, Kudo's to the developers on it. It does add another intresting layer of depth to the game. Instead of trying to survive on the base map you can try to survive underground in the caves, which poses a whole new set of challenges, and different creatures/plants/objects inhabit the caves below. That being said once you conquer the caves your back to the original rinse and reuse and repeat problem as stated above.FINAL VERDICT:First 3-4 playthroughs: 7.5/10Replayability: 3/10S/N: Im serious guys, It got to a point where me and my friend  legit had nothing else to do and conquer in the game that I started arranging berry bushes and tree's for fun for about 2 hours. Save yourself the sanity."

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

Not only is it creative, it truly is an experience that is it's own game, Don't Starve Together, with the New Reign updates, addons, DLC, whatever you call them, they are great.  The normal Don't Starve was meant to be a lonely experience, but this takes something lonely and makes it pleasantly social.  It just works with the abilities of the different Characters interacting with eachother and complementing eachother.  This game is truely an experience you will never forget.  I bought this the literal day it hit open beta and I never, not even once regretted buying it.  And that is how you know that it is truly something magical."

It’s so repetitively boring and predictable with absolutely no real player to player interaction whatsoever. It’s been months and so far nothing, nothing which adds anything productive or enjoyable to the game. The “Together” idea is a complete lie, no real content makes it feel together. I’ve seen mods add more to the game than these recent updates, it’s just another Minecraft.I personally don’t think these developers know what they’re doing with a survival game title, they made it because they know it sells, about all. I don’t know what’s all the hype about, after you survive all the seasons with your friends, it’s useless to play. There are much better survival games out there that add so much more. I was wrong about this game, has no potential.12/4/2016 - Just found out that plants like saplings and grass turfs are not part of the regrow feature. Therefore plants which can be diseased can't be renewed.11/16/2016 - Tried playing a cooperative public server today. Within five minutes of playing, a Willow entered and burned an entire base down. Had this game since alpha and still the developers have not done a single thing to improve public servers by preventing griefing.11/15/2016 - I played the game with friends recently and much more has changed than I thought. It seems like they added many things beyond what has been mentioned within their patch logs. They added features that improve replayability and added ways to recover the world without any intervention. They’ve also made many resources renewable, making multiplayer less stressful for hosts. However, co-op and PvP still hasn’t received any meaningful improvements. Maybe I’ll still be in luck, lets see.Old ReviewDont Starve Together is still being integrated to multiplayer, meaning that there has been very little balance done currently. I'm not sure if this means that proper multiplayer balances will happen, but it seems unlikely. Most of the playerbase just wants to play with their friends while retaining the entire singleplayer experience. This is problematic for public servers, since they’re more succumbed to griefing. For example, fire is imbalanced because a player is allowed to destroy an entire base that's been worked on for hours within just a few seconds and there is very little that you can do about it. Players should not be forced to use mods and admin powers because the developers decided not to properly balance fire for multiplayer.Fire isn’t the only problem, the lack of flint, flowers, and gold are also present and hardly found on a long running servers. This deters and punishes new players from joining, as does the season that the world is currently in. While the game should be bringing players together, its features do the opposite. Even the characters have been brought in from singleplayer and they clearly don’t fit with this cooperate gameplay because these characters are simply random. I admit, this may be fun for a singleplayer, but it’s not very fun for multiplayer especially so when some characters are clearly better than others. For a multiplayer game, there is also no benefit for teamwork and no features that encourage player interaction.PvP is also out of question because there was little to no attempt into making it work. Your best bet is to use a mod for this feature or don't even bother. A new player can just enter your base, burn it down, steal your things, and run off if all you have is a melee weapon. The easiest range weapon you can obtain is a boomerang and the enemy may catch and steal it from you if you throw it at him or her. Traps also don't trigger on enemies, because they are not considered enemies in the game and there is no way of doing it. To top it off, there is no land protection, so while this game is about making a thriving camp, you won’t ever be able to do that on a PvP server without mods.As of now, Don't Starve Together is made for private servers with friends, but nothing more at its current state. It's otherwise a broken game that needs mods for it to work properly. So if you're looking forward into playing a random public server, you're not going to get much out of the game. Thankfully it’s still in early access, so I'm hoping for the game to start changing in the right direction. Caves have been recently implemented and I’m glad I got this content for free. However, I think the team needs to focus more on improving multiplayer rather than implementing new content found in singleplayer. New content is meaningless if multiplayer remains broken.Over the past months, updates have been insignificant and the streak doesn't seem to be ending. Nothing makes me wanna play thus far."

I have played this series a long time, and Don't Starve Together was the iteration it always needed.  Don't Starve was BEGGING for multiplayer.This game should be extremely fun with friends, to the point that I begged and wheedled everyone I knew to get it.  It's going to be amazing, I said.  I put a lot of my credit on the line with them; at my age, you don't have many friends, and about 10% of those still play video games.  I honestly wish I hadn't, because currently, Don't Starve Together is basically unplayable.The rubberbanding gets worse and worse, the lag is atrocious.  Even on home network, playing with my girlfriend, it gets to be that you have to continuously restart the game until you don't feel like playing anymore.  We finally got everyone together online, my friend who more or less owns a supercomputer and 250mb down/50mb up connection hosted the game.  Within an hour, we were restarting the game every few minutes.I am so goddamn embarrassed that I recommended this game to everyone, and we all got together for a night of playing, and couldn't enjoy ourselves, even with only 4 players.  If you read the reviews, this rubberbanding and lag issue has been going on since the release of the game, and the developers don't seem to be doing anything to resolve it.  It's not the mods, it's not our computers, it's not the connection...  the problem lies in the code.Seriously, Klei Entertainment, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together.  Seriously.  This is totally unacceptable."

Playing with friends, on the other hand, makes things a lot more interesting.  Being the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I am, it is always fun to verbally abuse and mess with people.At the moment, I play this game with a friend and some random kid that we have made into our slave, aka b*tch.  He does most of the work, such as gathering and crafting.  He also plays a robot, which are designed to be the slave to man.  Therefore, it is the perfect role for him.  As a man, I do the hunting.  I bring home the bacon, in this case, rabbits.  We also have a woman.  She is pretty useless.  All she does is pms and burn down all the berry bushes the robot worked so hard to tend and grow.  She tells me she didn't do it on purpose, but who can believe the words of a woman?  I know I can't.I always make sure I am well fed and well rested.  The safety and wellness of the others matter very little to me.  With a full belly and rested body,  I do not have to fear anything.I usually start my day with breakfast.  Its usually meatballs.  Who doesn't like meat and balls?  After a hearty unbalanced breakfast, I make my rounds, putting rabbits in chests.  They survive indefinitely with no food or water, until I murder them.  I collect seeds, poop, and materials along the way, but I never venture far.  I have my robot slave for the hard labor.  The woman also like venturing off.  At the end of the day, I come back and eat more meat.  Sometimes, I am nice enough to cook more for the servants.  Sometimes, I don't.  I enjoy it when they rush back as fast as they can, hoping there will be food there, while they are on the verge of death from starvation.  It makes things more interesting.My servants are the best.  Without them, the game is nothing.  Using up materials and leaving them to wonder where all the gold went is hilarious.

Rubber-banding, getting hit by enemies from the opposite side of the screen, clicking something and failing to interact... you name the lag symptom, we've had it. We've tried everything to make it work: ""no lag"" mods, turning our computer settings to maximum power, not using cosmetic items, etc. Nothing works. Sometimes we can play for half an hour before the lag starts. Most of the time it starts within five minutes in the world. All of this even happens when we're on LAN.Also, a small gripe: on the rare occasions we've gotten it to work, we discovered that thermal stones for winter now have durability in this version. Why? That's a horrible decision. It didn't add difficulty to the game, just annoyance.Anyway. Lag. Can't play. Boo."

Our first adventure together we began trotting along the road and decide to make basecamp near a pond,we seen no frogs as it seemed to be deserted we ignored the fact there were two other ponds near by as we gathered supplies on day 3 we returned back to camp to live through the night by our warm fire as the morning soon came,least did we know we were attacked by a frog army,we ran and ran,but they wouldn't quit chasing us as we refused to give up our home! We decided to fight back,but soon did I notice my friend had fallen by the frog meanace! I refused to leave her there as I decided to fight the frogs to the death! I managed to kill one frog,but sadly the frog nation proved to be way more powerful than we could have ever imagined.Our second adventure. Crazed out of our minds about what has just happened with the frogs we decided to play it more carefully and on our toes! Prepared for the frog nation as to whether it would attack again! We made a camp on the edge of the world where it was safe from the devilish frogs! As we remained safe and sound near rabbits.as a few days past we ate through all our supply of food and was forced to explore the world more in to the depths of the unknow,as we saw a few harmless bees we thought nothing of it,until we soon saw about 100 more nests as most of em' turned out to be evil bee nests,we quickly ran through the unknown to try and get away from the evil bees as they kept coming and coming as there were nests everywhere! There was no escape! They murdered my friend in cold blood as I knew I was outmatched with only my axe,as we only came there for some food as peaceful travelers! Least did I know I ran in to a dead end with no escape in sight as I stood there cornered by the evil bees with my axe in hand ready to fight to the death and for the honour of my friend! I swung and swung my axe with no mercy as I managed to murder two of the evil bees,but the rest still managed to over power me as I fell to the ground feeling my body getting cold from the multiple bee stings as the whole world soon turns to black as I awaken as a ghost and see my friend there staring at me as now we spend together forever as peaceful ghosts,but yet did we know,we were enterring in to a whole new world!Adventure ThreeThere isn't much danger in this adventure we managed to build up a camp with a hay wall built all around us with traps for bunnies n a farm growing our food together learning new things through our marvelous science machine,as we have not met anything to fear yet,we are living a pretty good life together surviving day by day,keeping each other sane as we possibly could. We're living the dream for now,everything is going so well for us now,is this really our happy ever after? Or is there something out there in the darkness stalking us? We try not to worry,but we have no idea what is haunting us,but we insure to be prepared for what ever life throws at us now! We musn't fail as this must be our time!That's all of our adventures summed up to a point.So in my opinion I give this game a perfect 10/10 one of the best games I have ever played in a long while that is co-op with a survival aspect. Also hopefully my lil stories didn't leave you a bore."

While actually trying to play with my friends. there is a lot of rubberbanding and item lag. If these  problems weren't so consistent, and didn't just get worse and worse, I could honestly say this could be a great game. It's just the glitchiness kind of makes the game unplayable. I cant exactly reccomend it because of these aspects. The game needs to be fixed. Although I still say it's a fun game. Once the lag issues get better, I would reccomend it. For now, if you wanna plat DS, probably play the single palyer for now. otherwise, buy at your own risk!"

Neither of us played the single player version.There really wasn't anything ""fun"" about this game.  During the day, you feverishly scramble across the landscape grabbing all kinds of stuff that might be useful.  Night is fairly short, and you pretty much sit there by the fire, feverishly cooking food and getting as much crafting done as possible.  Then it's back to feverishly trying to find stuff around the world.There really is no ""calm,"" at least for a relatively new player.  You're always slowly dying from starvation, too fast in my opinion.  A feverish pace is required for survival which, as a n00b, makes it difficult to explore the different, potentially cool stuff you could craft or explore.Combat is terrible, and it's difficult to click on your enemy.  The game discourages fighting and experimentation by making death very punishing.  You have to find a special stone somewhere in the world or craft a relatively advanced meat effigy to resurrect one of you.Nothing about the game is very rewarding.  Collecting stuff is rather mundane.  The traps are whatever.  Crafting something like an umbrella when it rains is just a way to die slower.  You don't build a cool house or anything like that - you're stuck with basic and advanced versions of an outdoor camp site.BUT YOU MUST SURVIVE!!!!! ?? But why? What's the goal?  Survival? Okay, but that by itself isn't very fun.  Can I make a badass mansion or a cart track like in Minecraft?  No...  Do I get a well-designed, dynamic, and intense scavenging/trading experience like in This War of Mine? No........  Okay, do I get varied and interesting weapons, armor, and equipment like in Terraria?  No.....  Do I get a deep sense of human fear and connectedness, like in Day Z, when I'm not sure if someone will help me survive or literally kill me?  No.Play another survival game."

I bought this to play with a bunch of friends, but after hours of playing haven't experienced any enjoyment in the slightest. Traditionally survival games have you build up to a point, but after two evenings of playing with 5 people we have no shelter, no armor, no weapons, nothing. We barely are able to build a science machine before some hostile creature comes and ruins everything. Trying to collect resources is like pulling teeth. You step 100 feet away from your spawn and you get chased down by a pack of 6 hounds, each with 150 health, while you get a measly amount of health and are lucky to do 20 damage on a hit, meanwhile the hounds can kill you in 1-3 hits. And each time you die your max health gets lowered until you can get one hit by a bumblebee. Progression is basically impossible as enemies are vastly more powerful than the player, and theres no progression of difficulty.Im all for a challanging survival game, but when its so horribly lopsided against the player it loses all enjoyment."

There is always stuff that has to be done each day and there simply isn't enough time to get it all done even with extra people helping. There is a constant pressure of everything being required to prevent death.- Need wood constantly because if you are in darkness at night you die. But of course you can't just go out and chop wood all day cause it pisses off the tree guardian then you've gotta spend a bunch of time dealing with that guy.- Need to gather or work on growing/cooking food because without food you'll die and pretty fast. And you've got to cook the food or you get nearly nothing for sustanance from eating it.- Need to search for other resources constantly to build weapons and gear that help ease the burden of your daily tasks. And protect yourself from the elements. Also your tools break so fast that 30% of what you gather goes towards the cost of crafting the items you need for gathering.- Need a stock of weapons and armor (which wear out really fast) because every few days the hounds attack or some other monster.- Have to go out and keep the local spider nests oppressed regularly because if you don't a spider queen will spawn and basically just kill you with ease then next time you try to go get some webs.- Need to also gather matierals for warm clothes and a stock pile of food in time for winter because you can't venture out too far or you will freeze to death unless you have warm cloths or warm rocks (that need to be recharged and replaced regularly).- Need to constantly monitor your sanity. Can't explore too much or see too much action in a short time and you have to sleep enough each day because if you don't you go insane. The only cure is taking a bunch of time to pick flowers, find and eat mushrooms...etc essentially wasting a bunch of time that you don't have cause winter is coming FAST!...and the list goes on. You are constantly under the gun of having to get 24 hours of crap done in 12 and just when you think you're ahead the game throws you a curve ball that completely ruins ya. After a while it just started feeling like work to me and the game was stressing me out more than it was entertaining me.Yes there are lots of mods that allow you to control these aspects but I find that you really need to spend some time finding a good balance because when you stop all the need for the plate spinning you realize how dull the game actually is. The constant plate spinning distracts you from realizing there really isn't anything all that engaging on fun going on in the game - there's no story line or end game and once you've gone through the whole cycle of a year and explored the varied biomes there really isn't anything new to see."

This can't get any better.""This quickly took a turn though.I open the game.*Not responding* I wait for 2 mins until it responds (Mind you, my pc surpasses the recommended system requirments)""Okay, that's a rough start but it's fine""I've played Don't Starve for a while now so I'm pretty used to the mechanics so I thought I'd get right into the multiplayer to witness the ""real fun"".Little did I know1st try:I join apublicserver in excitment and wait for the ""not responding"" for 1 minute. Finally, after the loading, I am greeted by a warm ""You have been kicked off the server""I just try to shake it off and being the game-optimist I am, I go to another server.2nd try:This time I try to join anofficial publicserver. Needless to say, the same thing happened to me from the first try.I just exit the game.Next day, I decide to give it another try.1st try:I join a server and, alas, for I have not been auto-kicked from the first minute. I enjoy my sweet moment of victory because I can actually play the damn game. However, after 30 seconds of playing I discover the mod on the server makes the game almost impossible to play. After 2 days, I die. I see that you can turn into a ghost, so I roam around for a bit trying to see what my powers can do. After around 3 mins of roaming, I get kicked off by some people speaking a foreign language.This is the last straw, I haven't been able to properly play the game for my past 3 hours (I was also expirimenting some stuff in the single player and checking out the guides)Final try:After looking for an official Klei server (Even though I got auto-kicked from one the past day), I find one that has a nice description and seems promising. I join and after the ""not responding"" routine, I spawn normally and enjoy my time playing Don't Starve Together for the first time. I see people in the chat discussing some stuff out of my league, and I'm happy they speak English. After 4 days, I am set to start farming for epic stuff, however I accidentally forget to turn on the light for my rock campfire thing and I can not see anything in the dark. I die. I admit defeat and I'm fine with it. So, after looking for a minute on how to revive yourself as a ghost, I start roaming for the needed supplies. I didn't wanna lose my stuff cuz I didnt really know if I would have any time like this in the future. So, after 1 and a half minutes of being a ghost, they vote to kick me :)I ask why and they answer that cuz I'm dead. I reply asking them for some time and that I'm looking to revive myself. One of them says okay but the others kick me anyway. I get kicked with a 3-1 vote.I quit the game and regret the 4.6 hours I wasted when I could have been masturbating. Never coming back again. As much of an optimist I am, this has beenWAAAAAYtoo much. Sorry Klei, as much as I liked Don't starve (It was the first game I ever bought on steam actually) I have to say that this game, in my opinion, is just terrible."

I'd recommend it, except for one major problem.With multiple people on the server, if you die you turn into a ghost. Somebody must use a Telltale Heart on you to revive you, or you will forever be a ghost and only be able to haunt people.There's one major flaw with this; public servers. If you're in a public server just playing and don't have a friend to communicate with and give you a Telltale Heart, you are forever stuck as a ghost and can only haunt people until somebody decides to give you one. That is a TERRIBLE mechanic; it's a good idea except for the fact that you cannot respawn even if you want to. Maybe if you could respawn and just lose all your stuff versus being given a Telltale Heart and retaining it it would be okay, but the fact that if you, like me, were at 9 health running around in the night-time with a Blue Hound following you like a gay following his boyfriend endlessly until you are killed, and when it kills you you are eternally a ghost, makes it a terrible game.Minus that fact, it's good.... but that is the most stupid thing ever. Don't Starve Together gives you the ability to host a dedicated server that is open for lots of players (who you don't necessarily know) but when you do that it punishes you by making it so if you die you must have another person to be able to revive you to be able to play the game, and if you don't, the world must be reset (for whatever reason) or you are forever Casper's twin.P.S. this was a rage-induced review, so forgive me if I'm incorrect in any way. I'll probably give it a day and edit this to be positive so take it with a grain of salt if you can live with this major flaw in design."

I cannot find much to like about the game other than art and sound.The game itself wouldn't be that bad, if it had some kind of story, or reason for you to do these things. What it gives you is a randomly generated world that has limited reasources, which forces you to move on continuously. Leaving behind all the items you have built. For some people this may be fun. As for me I found it as enjoyable as working in an assembly plant. With all the charm too.I have interacted with the ""community"" for about a month or so and have found them lacking. I have had to edit my review multiple times to hopefully help to them understand why I don't like this game.I even tried again to like this game after the ""community"" bashed on me for writing a negative review. I found myself gazing at the game in a mild hypnosis, grinding away getting resources. I was in a trance for about 2hrs, not because I liked the game, or because I was enjoying myself, but because I was just playing to play.After that I took the time to re-edit my review and again the ""community"" pounced and started hating on me for not like their game. Well too bad, I can't find any more redeeming qualities to the game or its ""community."" I don't feel like being part of a ""communtiy"" that has to defend its like of a game by tearing those who don't like it down.I hope this gives the ""community"" some understanding why I don't like their precious game."

Also want to go over the lag, you can work for a couple hours gathering stuff to get read for pvp then once you enter any kind of combat start rubber banding, which means your character will appear to be moving then dissapear or walk back to the spot you started lagging out on. its a host problem for the deicated servers so if they could update those it would be alot more playable. imagine getting attacked and trying to run away, with everytime you get some distance between you and your enemy and you think you got away, your character appears right back next to the enemy and half your health is gone, repeat until your frusturated and dead. in conclusion the game needs way more content as its way to easy to reach a point where you built everything and your kinda just waiting to die and start over. the dedicated servers need to be completely redone and the lag on those servers needd to be worked on for lag issues."

,Not Recommended,322330,33643292,Posted: 18 July,all,3aek,"TL:DRThis game will kill you endlessly for your ignorance without ever explaining what went wrong or why. Don't play it.Absolutely do not play this game, UNLESS you have played the normal Don't Starve. Why? Because this game expects you to be a master of the original (because adding this feature to the original game was just too hard and making money off people is great).I'm known for enjoying a challenging game with friends. But this game is not a challenge, it's just a constant death sentence. Even after having learned as much as I could from wiki's and friends who love Don't Starve, I always found myself dying. It just isn't fun to die because you're ignorant of something that you can't possibly learn without cheating or using a wiki. Not saying I need my hand held, but just being told that this item is going to vanish from the face of the earth in the next few minutes would have been nice to know.Those of you that enjoyed the original game, play this with random people on public servers or play with other friends that have beaten Don't Starve. Do -not- try to get friends that have never played the normal version to play this unless you plan to force feed them information for 12 solid hours. (That might not even be enough).ProsIt's popular enough to find plenty of random public servers.It's a lot like the original game (so I've been told).It seems simple.The game has an easy interface.ConsEvery character is either brokenly good or dies incredibly easy. (Yes, I did say everyone.)Rogue-like deaths with no rewards. (You die, game over, that's it.) (CORRECTION: You get vanity clothes... Woohoo?)No tutorial, guide, or in game help of any kind. (Get ready to read a lot of wiki's)Difficulty increases dramatically over time, making joining a server a day or more old completely pointless. (Instant death if joining in the summer or winter.)Perma deaths on servers. (Many public servers are forgotten because people spawn in a die on the spot.) (CORRECTION: You can roll back time one day, according to @Egg. Never seen this used though.)Even after tens of hours of gameplay, expect to keep dying after only a few hours in a new world. (Why are you still reading this? Just walk away from this game already)"

I'm sticking with my original opinion that this game isn't meant for casual players. It's serious and merciless. Its really necessary to read guides for this game. Nothing is explained and everything is learned painfully. So avoid any server that's not in endless mode. I wish they have some sort of quick guide for new players. I still can't recommend this game.

For those of you who dont know if you try to download mods with windows 10 all your mods will glitch out and whenever you try to get into a game it will not let you because of your mods making this game unplayable.

We routinely play video games together as a sort of bonding experience. One in particular is the 2d powerhouse Terraria. I really wanted to enjoy Don't Starve. I had seen the Totalbiscuit review of this game ((that part where he hunts for manure LOL!!)), and thought the game had looked interesting at the time. However, I had clearly not had paid too decent attention to the review.. when we fired the game up, my laptop, his pc, we began chosing characters. To which poses the question.. Why are there no african american characters? Is it coicidental that the actual only ""dark"" character happens to be a monster, aka, the spider? It's 2017 now, and in this climate of change, you would think that the indie game scene would be the first to change. I've seen some games take charge in the war against racism and white privelege, but this is a survival game, which strives for REALISM. In an apocalyptic setting, there would be african americans. There would be latinos. There would be muslims, and anyone else.. Not just white people. I saw the available characters and I told him to shut it down. We decided to play l4d2 instead, a survival game with actual minds put behind it. Take some responsibility, you are the face of a generation. You can make the change, if you have an open mind, open heart, and bravery. It's a shame that so many these days do not though."

It always put a smile on my face. It's fun watching them wreck and panicking around while I hide from them.Would do it again 11/10.. Sure why not."

Although there is no straight foward story line, the fact that the whole world is there for exploration is great. Like minecraft, you can explore and craft things, make homes, battle monsters, and much more. though it is 2d, the gameplay itself makes its a great game. Unlike minecraft, you dont have to memorize every recipie, and you cant make EVERYTHING with one thing. You have to learn how to make things that you need to make more things, that you need to make a thing that you can make more things with. The map isnt HUGE or infinite, but its enough to make you want to explore it. Along with tech, there is magic,  and other things. There are more things to do in DST than mine, craft, and build. You can catch animals, grow food, hunt monsters, battle bosses, create tech, become a magic wizard, form a pig empire, and more! I love the fact that you dont have to mine and collect for HOURS on end to get stuff. DST provides many things to do, keeping you busy for hours. Even if you need to mine for a lot of stuff, the game will provide you things to do, like hunt elephants, chop wood, and discover things, so that you dont get bored, even if you have to search for stuff for hours on end. This game is great and I will make a much more detailed review upon request. My final rating for this is 8.5/10."

You will be by yourself since mostly everyone in the server will be long gone from the machine, so be prepared, wait till morning, and most importantly, DONT OPEN UP CHESTS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

(DLC) both games do have a storyline (if you look into it, for not much is expresed in game) with maxwell as the antaganist and willson (or what ever charctar you decide to play as) as the protaganist. back to the ""reign of giants"" DLC, it adds (more) giants as well as an animal or two, new biomes, and (in my opinnoin) over all the fact that they add two new charictars.

Everything about it just really pleases me, the art is adorable, the lore is interesting, there's a lot of different things to do, and it seems to have characters and goals that  cater to whatever play style you prefer. The only thing I would critique are most of the fights are a little boring and involve the same mechanics(run in hit something run out), but they did add a new fight for the winter event which was very very good, I would like to see more fights like that one(this one has adds which use abilities which can be countered with craft able items so it adds a slightly richer fight imo). All and all tho, I've had more fun playing this game than any other, so check it out, watch some videos on the game play(and the lore omg I love the story so much <3), and if you decide to hop into this world, and take on an adventure, just remember... don't starve. ;)Edit: So my only problem with this game was a lot of the fights were sort of boring, they started with one that was more fun in a new reign and then they kept it up THEY ADDED A LOT OF FUN BOSS FIGHTS.

I had watched a few videos before I started to get an idea of basic strategy, and what to expect from my enviroment so I wasn't a complete dead weight to my more experienced partner. This failed.I died twice: first, gathering wood in a haunted forest, and angering a Tree Guardian. I tried to run, and was advised to try lighting it on fire. In the end, my companion came back to find my boney corpse, an irritable tree man, and half our camp burned down.The second time I ventured out once again for wood, but I also needed grass, and food, and flowers, as my crown had long ago wilted, and the use of a Telltale Heart left me in less than desirable conditions mentally. Night fell before I could make it back to our base, so I built a fire, and planned to stake it out for the night. Then, just as night fell, I lost track of all my logs in my inventory, and my fire was going out. Just as I found them and went to add some wood to my fire, it went out, and the shadows consumed me. I headed back to camp, where my pertner had gathered supplies to make yet another Heart. Making it, however, consumed the last of his health and killed him as well. He spent the next 15 minutes chasing my ghost, haunting various objects to send them flying at me, and screaming how much he hated me.10/10 would die again."

It's much more fun to play together with a friend and DST has just about everything needed to play it together. I'm missing 'adventure' mode (or are we just bad at finding the portal?) and I would like the option to locate other online players on the map at a larger range than just nearby. I found that, while 'survival' was just as frustrating in DST as DS, I really liked 'endless' mode because it gave more of a minecraft (oh **** he did not just say that) feel, except I feel it offers much more of an adventure feeling (again, this would be even better with adventure mode).

If you buy the game and see problems with it, like not being able to connect to the over all ""Don't starve together"" server, or any other problem.

Whilst this is seperate from ROG and the maingame, the launcher and setup is incredibly easy (I'm not sure if thats Klei or Steam knowing exactly what players want). I was worried about a DayZ style multiplayer where friends would be scattered and lost without ever managing to work together and build a base. But I was really pleased by the decisions made by Klei to keep the game simple and the focus on the namegoal: Not Starving!The spawn portal was a really nice addition giving players a point of origin and a landmark to meet (""go to the portal, I'll show you where the base is"" has become so common for me to say I might make a hotkey). This does however show one failing, if you see it as a failing; miscommunication and lack of teamwork. Like the forementioned DayZ, players sometimes struggle to trust others to not waste or damage the resources or items in a camp. This is also the case when, in survival mode (where dying means you become a haunting ghost that drains sanity) players will often do harm to the rest of the server by following therm around as a ghost and constantly asking to be revived (acheived through a players sacrificing their own health/sanity to make a 'Telltale heart'). The 'noobs' of Don't Starve don't ruin the game, far from it, but it does prove that a game like this is susceptible to becoming a Rust-like chaos game; with Wilsons and Willows running around burning trees shouting ""NEED FOOD"" and ""SANITY LOW"" whilst setting alight berry bushes and scaring away precious rabbits. But the game gives hosts the tools to defend from game-ruiners and 'noobs' by kicking and banning, as well as being able to whitelist the server by friendlist or by password.The way that the game was made originally meant that making a long term base required hard work and maintaining of food/wood/grass/twigs sources as well as preparing for things like winter or the evergrowing hound packs. With DST they kept this, people will say in chat ""hounds coming"" and people gather, passing spears to one another and grouping (although running around in panic whilst beefalo save you also works). In my by no means extended period of playing I have rarely seen someone actually destory a base, people are often unthinking and take an unneccesary 4 meatballs from an icebox only to disconnect or die, but there is a general 'unspoken law' that what someone earns, they keep; to say, I gather the resources to make a science machine and some farms, another surivivor can by all means use the machine, grow something in the farmplot or add to the base without my permission, especially if it is at spawn (the normal place for a starting camp). But a player who decides it is ok to take from my twigs supply without asking or chop down all my trees only to make a base of their own is seen as, with most survival games; an anchor to moving forward.The game is very enjoyable, even if you are just playing with one extra person. And with the introduction of mods to DST I have hope that this will become a well developed and constantly improving game. If you enjoy games like DayZ, Rust, Minecraft, Terraria, etc... then you should really enjoy what I see as an original take on a newly remade genre, you wont see zombies or creepers, but you will see hounds, treeguards, clockwerk machines and the dreaded deerclops. All of this within a brilliant art style, great music and sound effects and a delightful sense of humour and unlimited witty comments for every object and player.Have fun!"

My own personal expierence with unlocked public multiplayer servers has felt like I'm playing single player - everyone kind of does their own thing. I think a minimap with player locations could help everyone feel a little bit friendlier in non-PVP servers. Just a suggestion.I LOVE that I can play this with friends, though, don't get me wrong.

Cause when beeffalos are in their mating season, they tend to charge anything on the way when they see you.I grieve whenever my Chester or Hutch dies. They're like your pets that help you carry your stuff around. And when they are being attacked, I usually become like a very protective mother fighting back while cursing.The only thing I think this game lacks, is the mode to Pause the game or yourself if possible when you need bathroom breaks. Seriously. Yes its a Survival game, but they should include this option because once you started playing this game I swear you wont be able to stop 'cause it's really fun."

I have put over 300 hours into Don't Starve and I still haven't gone into the sinkholes. (There's an entierly different world there.) I can't compare this to another game really.

There is no reason for this, it already uses Steam DRM and Steam's servers.-Online play is not that great! once you log into the server the first thing you will notice is all of the resources are already taken. There is no way to locate otehr players, so you will probably starve unless you are lucky enough to find another player willing to share with you.-Uses FLASH from Adobe... Not that bad of a thing, but you  will neeed third party software nagging you for manual updates.The game has potential, the artwork and humor are nice.

So in other words they need to get rid of it completely or add ways to actually get sanity back except being lucky enough to find flowers and green mushrooms or spiders so you can make tell tale hearts and revive the ghosts, which is worthless if you have people on your server who constantly die, you shouldnt have to be THAT dependent on other people because they can easily ruin the game for you just by playing and being sub-par at the game."

The game is just as harsh and fun, however, the largest drawback is the lack of permanency in the games. If the server is public, you WILL get griefed. There is nothing you can do about this.The devs don't seem to prioritize the right of property, people work for hours stocking up for winter, log off for work/school/whatever and come back to find everything stolen/smashed. There are keys in the game files, so I assume they will fix this soon. But right now, it's as fun as whatever you can carry in your pack. Which leaves huge swathes of the game basically unplayable, and you can only play the game at its full potential for bursts at a time.7/10, 9/10 if you can find a private server with friends.

,Recommended,322330,21874067,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,OrganizedChaos,"10/10, very fun to starve together, find new pets, strangle rabbits, and compare fashion in this game.I find it's easier to play with people who you're simultaneously skyping with, and if you're in a pvp server its really fun to have a friend skyping you and team up against everyone else.There are a lot of different ways to play;You and your friends can try to survive and work together, you can do pvp and see just how fast you can screw one another over, there are the caves (which i personally haven't tried yet)And within this you can make gamemodes of your own. For example, a group of friends and I got together and we all chose different characters. I was Wilson, friend A was Wigfrid, friend B was Willow... and friend C was Wes. we're all in a skype call, but the catch is that friend C, Wes, can't speak to us in the call or in game chat-- he can only listen. And our challenge was to keep Wes alive with the rest of us.This 'mini game' can increase in difficulty depending on who is playing Wes, as friend C has a tendency to wander off on his own in search of food or supplies.All in all, a really great experience and you'll find that when playing with different friends everyone has their own unique playstyle that will either work very well with your own, or you're going to turn on pvp.

You won't regret it.I'll admit I bought the Don't Starve Frontier Pack under the impression that DST was a sort of sequel to Don't Starve. I was wrong. However, that doesn't mean I regret my decision to purchase the game. I found a person to gift my extra copy to, and we've had a blast trying to make a base only for it to get destroyed by a meteor shower inexplicably, or by my friend accidentally setting everything on fire.Don't Starve Together is an unforgiving survival game, in which you need to move quickly and gather supplies in order to survive. Oddly enough, 90% of the time you won't die of starvation. It'll probably be due to some hostile entity like those stupid frogs or bees (wasps if you're unlucky enough to wander by their hives). Or hounds. The best thing to do in this scenario is to just make sure you set up camp as far away from ponds and beehives as possible. Also, get yourself some armor and weapons.Sure, it can get frustrating dying all the time, but it is a learning experience, and you'll feel great satisfaction upon surviving for a long time. Fortunately, owners of this game have the opportunity to work with other players, as opposed to working by yourself like in Don't Starve. So you should at least have an easier time surviving... unless someone among you is playing as Willow and sets everything on fire.My favorite part is by far being a ghost. When you die, you become a ghost and haunt the land. You can haunt various things, sometimes resulting in amusing events. Like I said at the beginning, haunt a tier 3 spider nest. It's a blast. Or try to haunt a pigman. You might have to do these things multiple times to get anything going. Most of the time whatever you haunted starts glowing or whatever. It's kinda hard to tell because everything becomes monochrome when you die.I'd definitely recommend this game to others, as long as you have patience and/or a friend to help you out on the way."

It's a lot of fun, but having not played the original Don't Starve, my biggest issue with DST is that a practiced group of players can very rapidly reach the point where you have nothing but maintenance to do. Winter isn't an issue, wolves aren't an issue - life simply progresses. It's at this point that the game falls down.It doesn't have the long-term flexibility of play that Minecraft does, so you start struggling to find things to do aside from creating amazingly huge ramparts and road systems.When it has more content and more mods, this game will be amazing.

I wrote the following:""Not sure if I recommend this game or not.First of all, this game really is against you winning. It wants you to die. When you die, you lose health and get weaker, meaning you die even sooner the next time you encounter a strong enemy.Multiplayer isn't fun when playing with strangers. When they find your base, chances are they'll burn it down (freaking trolls) with no way of retrieving your items. Be lucky if you don't catch fire at the same time, cause dying is really a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in this game.I played with two friends on a privately hosted server - which is easy to do, by the way - and that was alright. But even then, the game sometimes feels too hard, at least to me, and thus I'm not looking forward to returning to it any time soon. I like sandbox games in general, but this one is just too hard and frustrating to play for me.Better gamers and people who are up for a big challenge might really enjoy it.The style is super sweet, I totally recommend it for those that like Tim Burton. There's humor in the game too, funny little animations and sounds.Personally, I preferred playing as Webber.In general, I don't recommend it because I think it's a little too expensive for what it is... But as I said, people who really enjoy challenges, sandbox games, and Tim Burton will probably really enjoy it.""Now, however, I do recommend it, after playing it for a 100 hours more.Is the game too hard? Google stuff. Use the wikipedia to your advantage. Watch youtube videos to get better.They also adjusted the multiplayer games. Not only can you now earn outfits for your characters, you can also pick if you want to go on a server where it's about collaboration or pvp or any type of game you like. Trolls are still a part of the game, but not always. Most annoying are the people who die and don't leave the server and instead drain on your sanity or haunt your base (or the hounds when they attack, turning them into fire hounds that burn your♥♥♥♥♥♥)I still find the game hard in some ways, but I suppose that's good. The only thing I miss in Don't Starve Together, is a sort of ending. At a certain point you know the drill, you have your base set up, your food supplies are okay, your weapons and armor is fine, and then it gets a bit dull... And that's usually the part where I start a new game then."

Some servers really lag very hard, so that you are unable to play on them.2. Once a server is running for a longer time and most of the rescources like stones or flints, berry bushes or whatever you can gather are gone, which makes it hard to play on the server, if you do not want to share your base with the others.I played this game for ~ 55hours by now and its still a lot of fun.The mod community is growing endlessly and most of the mods work perfectly even on servers.I really recommend buying this game if you are thinking about it =)Have fun, see you ingame!"

The one thing I love in this game is ""Okay, today I will go (for example) for some wood and you will check if some rabbits get caught"". I think it's one of the best survival games to play with friends so if u are watching for a game to play with friends, Don't Starve Together is a right choice. All the stuff like fights, collecting things, walking around the map and even dying are more funny together. Game is in early acces but even tho I think it's optimized pretty well. Design of menu is nice and there are no stuff like lags or connection errors. I just wish I could play DST with Reign of Giants.So:Optimization: 8/10 - I know some people have issues with connection and stuffMultiplayer option overall: 10/10 - DS just needed itThe game is definitely playable as Don't Starve is and even more so for me 9,5/10 for Don't Starve Together"

,Recommended,322330,15658988,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,ReddChimera,"This game is an overall fun experience, although it can get frustrating with griefers stealling your stuff, but it's a game I enjoy with my friends on many an occasion.Each character you can play is unique with their own pros and cons as well as their own individual stats for play. The worlds you play in are huge with an abundance of resources in many locations (With even more now that Reign of Giants has been added on) and it helps to have friends to explore and gather it all. It requires lots of teamwork and cooperation to be able to last long and managing food and fire is a surefire way to pull my friends together when winter comes along. Issues only come up when one of us doesn't know certain things about the game (That someone is usually me), or when griefers come onto a public server and mess with your items so playing on a private server with friends who have knowhow is the best course of action and actually will introduce you into the world of Don't Starve better than the original.The gameplay is modified from the original in this multiplayer game as options to give and feed things to your friends is an option, there is also the interesting mechanic of death causing issues for more than just the player that died as it lowers the sanity of all the other people in the game. I do recomend that you not treat this like Don't Starve, as playing with real people means food stock or materials could dissappear time in and time out so it adds a bit of difficulty when you need to manage the scarce materials in the harsh weather while fighting back hounds and running from giants.PROS-Characters go beyond design to give a different feel to each when you play them.-Worlds are big and full of resources that often replenish themselves and allow you to survive.-Different scenarios can occur when you play, you never know if you'll survive for four days or fourty on any given play through.-Playing with friends allows you to play each character and make up for eachother's weaknesses.CONS-Starting out can be difficult unless you know what you're doing or have friends who know what they're doing.-More people means materials and food needs to be strategically used and can lead to the session ending prematurely if the proper precautions aren't taken.-Public servers can often grief you by taking important things or distroying your hard work if you aren't careful.I give this game a 8/10 and a recomendation to Play it if not Watch it online (Although watching it isn't as satisfying).It's a fun game that only gets better when you and your friends survive further than last time. Since you can buy bulk packs its easy to draw your friend into this and have them helping you survive too. The minor issues can be solved with communication and trial-and-error, so it's recomended you play with friends over a voice chat to be able to manage everything. Far from perfect, but it's worth playing if only for the hilarity that may insue when problems happen either big or small. A great game to build teamwork and make you feel good about how well you all do when you last through another wave of hounds."

,Recommended,322330,14062379,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,DrunkMagic,"The best way to start describing what is different between Don't Starves single player incarnation and the multi-player release is to probably mention what is similar. The game is of course still the same fist of jam'em up it always has been with the same feeling of dread and despair as you watch your sanity slowly drip away while maniacally picking flowers at midnight like an mdma fueled Alan Titchmarsh. It has everything that the single player pretty much has with a couple of small added new items and bunton to show that it is slightly different. So what is the point in reviewing this game if the only real difference is that it can be played with friends? Right? Well the reason is that by adding multi-player your not simply adding more people in reality your changing the rules of the game in a way. Usually the game is a simulation of everyone's biggest fear of being alone and having to look after yourself made even more scary by the prospect of not having anyone to blame when you inevitably ♥♥♥♥ up and eat the wrong kind of carrot or something. The addition of more players to interact with takes the game to a whole new level of insomniac fun and the main reason is that your now worried even more about the safety of others rather than yourself.The idea of your friend that has only just picked up the game running off to ""find♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is more terrifying than the prospect of slowly dying if you don't eat the weekly intake of a horse on a daily basis. You all begin to create a sort of tiny society like most of these craft heavy (or creavy which no one ♥♥♥♥ing says..) games try to persuade you to. With Don't Starve Together though you realize that its out of necessity rather than friendship and that really all of your are responsible for the health, diet, and mental well-being of each other. This is the real change between the two versions of the game. Your solo quest for food and shelter becomes a mobbed cluster of tall-bird smacking and trying to figure out which left is left cause you hit Q ten minutes prior.  Your every decision seems to become more of a consensus rather than an individual idea. You all being to plan your action for the coming days and weeks that you stupidly believe you will survive and start trying your best to pretend like your happy sharing everything you find. The game feels fresh just because of this it's as if your new friends are your biggest burden but at the same time crucial to your survival. Mulit-player has not made the game easier or harder it has made it social and with this comes a whole new slough of problems for you to address in the game while also giving you more options for tackling the harsh nature of the game. In essence you rely on one another to fill your individual needs while also gathering together in order to build up a sort of community hub. Sort of like a mini communism simulator.The game is as solid as the first and adds a completely new way to go about tasks like collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥to grow food to survive long enough to collect more♥♥♥♥♥♥ The only main game-play flaw is that after a certain distance your friends no longer show up on the map - there is a mod that does this i will link below - and so you spend ten minutes performing something akin to a crystal maze challenge shouting directions at people while you all ♥♥♥♥ up and end up in the wrong place anyway. Changing the map system wouldn't ruin the fear and despair the game causes it would just stop me getting tinnitus from six ♥♥♥♥ing people shouting their co-ordinates at one another through headsets.The best thing about this game is that it brings back a very familiar idea with the same mechanics and gives you a different experience something that is very hard to pull off and is an impressive achievement especially with a game that's premise was really about the isolation to begin with. So buy it. Do not buy it for an almost laughable price of £15.00 though. As much as it is refreshing and fun to play... forking out more money than the original's cost to play with friends is a bit insulting so if possible buy the discounted version for owning the first game or wait until it is free. All in all the game is tight and very deserving of a play with friends. So grab some buddies, ♥♥♥♥ with the settings a bit, download your favorite game breaking mods and enjoy starving together."

I tried uninstalling and reinstaling, and it still crashes every time I try to host a server... even without mods now. Keep in mind this game isn't finished. It's worth buying to support development, and even now it has plenty to make the purchase worthwhile. Controller support exists, but it's still in testing. You will have to hover your mouse over some menu options, like in settings or in the mod menu... but then you can use the Dpad to navigate. The settings menu requires you to hover your mouse over something that won't change value when you press A, in order to SAVE SETTINGS. Had to figure this out the hard way, no big deal... I'm sure they'll fix all these issues later... but even still, a controller feels great with this game, once you get used to the navigation issues. The in-game UI threw me off, but it makes a lot of sense once you feel it. I personally love it, the whole game. Atmosphere, music, controls, menu systems (that work), art style, and mod support!

Characters re-balanced for multiplayer so that everyone is on relatively equal footing when it comes to screwing over their compatriots for resources.Pros: Alien world occupied with fascinating creatures and occult treasures.  Striking style conveyed through the game's unique art, music and presentation.  Active mod community with mods easily incorporated via the Steam workshop.  Special encounters amped up to compensate for increased number of players, challenging groups with more of the giants and other beasties that seek to undo all your hard work.Cons: Brutal, rogue-like gameplay which can be discouraging to those who don't like having all their progress reset from time to time.  Some content in the single player game missing from the multiplayer game.  Slow game, requiring a considerable time investment to fully appreciate.Would Recommend To: Fans of ""Don't Starve.""  Fans of rogue-like survival games.  Fans of games that involve exploring alien landscapes.  Anyone who digs the art style in the screen caps."

After a while I got better and I can easily survive Winter. When I saw this I thought ""Oh this will be too easy. Two people means you can gather twice the resources."" Oh how I was wrong, horribly wrong. You now consome twice the food and twice the materials for winter clothes, armor, weapons, and tools. But, you can get your base together a lot faster, typically having a complete base before winter (my friend and me had complete walls, 6 advanced farms, science and alchemy machine, 16 berry bushes, 11 saplings, 3 drying racks, and multiple chests) built within a savanah, making it easy to get grass, poop, and rabbits. This game is so incredibly fun with a friend and being able to build together is amazing. Worrying about your friend however during the winter when he goes off at night and attracts penguins, not so fun. But all-in-all it is a very good game and if you have Don't Starve I HIGHLY recommend getting this game.

It sucks that you can only get four per week, though, no matter how many hours you play it. The skins servers reset every Thursday around 1 PM, so don't plan on idling or godmodding to try and get skin drops when you've reached the max you can get (which is, again, only four).There's a mode you can play where you don't lose all your progress when you die, given you remember where you died so you can retrieve all your stuff and somebody hasn't already stolen it.

There are a lot of pros, but not as many cons, but they still existA con is that the dragonfly is a legit boss raid, having 27,000 health compared to don't starve which it has 2,500I think that if you pick solo you should have an option to set the Giants to don't starve Heath, since us people who don't have friends that play Don't starve together (or no friends at all)  should have default Don't Starve Heath.A con is that the gameplay can be stale at times, and you may get bored. If you do, you can just start a new world (like I do sometimes) to make stuff much less stale.Another pro is that there are multiple characters to play as, so it can be different every runOne last pro (That I'm currently willing to list since I'm lazy :3) is that there is workshop. They may sound generic, but the workshop can really switch up the gameplay. There are mods for hardcore Don't starve/ Don't starve together players like a mod that requires you to drink water too, which can be very difficult during the winter. There are also some good Mods for newer players, such as always fresh, and tweak those tools."

This game does not have all the features that the original single player game has, but it is to be expected as this game is still in beta.

I got this game on sale and I can say that I would buy this game even in its full price.TL;DRThis game is honestly a multiplayer version of Don't Starve with tons of potential mods. Basically all you have to do in this game is to survive. As simple as that sounds, it's way more entertaining than that and the game has so much to offer.Long VersionLet's start off with the basic content of this game:You have a hunger meter, a sanity meter, and health meter. Every night you have to stay away from complete darkness and provide yourself with light to avoid charlie(the darkness) from getting you.You can play as one of several original characters in the game each having their own merits and demerits. In addition to that, you can also download mods of any character there has been made in the game and you can even make your own in the workshop.One entire day has 3 phases: Day, Dusk, and Night time. You gather twigs, grass, logs, flints and such to survive your first few days and head on to mine some rocks the next all while keeping your hunger level up. There are 4 different seasons (and its implications-- meaning each season changes the world and brings about more things to do) and several biomes in the world you'll be venturing in. All of these you can change and set to what you prefer.Moving on to the 'after getting a hang of it' part:You can craft weapons, armor, build a base, create farms, cook several dishes, tame creatures, fight creatures, prepare for winter, prepare for bossfights, venture out and discover the entire map and it doesnt even stop there. If you are able to juice out all of what the game has to offer(which with 80 hrs I'm not even close to doing yet), you can also try out and discover more creative content from the workshop and mods created by different users which I think is pretty great.And the good part is, what I mentioned is still the 'playing on your own' part. Man, having friends to play with in this game makes it 10x better(imo). Although I don't have anyone to play with anymore. :'(Anecdotes:The first time I started playing, I set fire to a Beefalo and it followed me to a group's base. lmfao their base was set on fire and they couldnt stop it and everyone in the server ragequitted lol. I'm no troll though. :((I've made several monsters fight amongst themselves and loot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything in the process. Survival of the fittest b****es :p9/10 -- I wish there'd be more people to play with :("

,Recommended,322330,23635743,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Bigmac,"Oh man, and I thought playing Don't Starve alone was fun.Don't starve together features the same concept as Don't Starve (Surviving) which can be done with the help of friends, or without the help of friends. While I had the most fun with this game playing with my friends on steam, it really depends which type of person you are to know what you'll have the most fun with.Co-op: Work together with friends to build the ultimate base, fight off monsters, find food and resources, and most importantly, Survive! This is the one I personally by far had the most fun with. While killing your friends and enemies brings a good laugh, I think me and my friends had enough laughs being chased around by other monsters and neutral mobs that we decided it was a good idea to attack.Social: Honestly Theres not a very big difference between this and co-op. Players are supposed to be helpfull and talk to you, but I never thought that was too impressive because I usually talk to whoever i'm playing co-op with anyway. There are still monsters as far as i could tell (however i wasn't playing for very long on this mode so i'm not sure on that), and so the objective is really the exact same. The only reason I would choose this over co-op is because when i played with others they actually did talk to me, help me fight monsters when they were killing me, build a base with me ect which made this gamemode another pleasent expierence.Competitive: This gamemode is all about fighting. You gather matierials, fight monsters, gather resources, build a base and hope that nobody finds it while your not there or offline, and hope that you don't run into anyone more geared than you are. This one was definetly not my favorite. It's hard for new players to join. You could be on the server for an hour, get geared up, build a small base, and think to yourself, man, i'm doing amazing, and then go offline for an hour to eat lunch and come back only to find that your base is destroyed, they took everything they needed, and burned the rest. If your looking to fight, I recommend the next mode.Madness: Exactly what it sounds like. Anything can, and will happen. You can kill, steal, burn a whole forest down, doesn't matter. everything is allowed. Now, the thing is, it's a little hard to find a server on this mode that will actually let you do anything. most servers have rules against certain things to ensure players actually DO have a fun time. After all, logging onto a server only to find out that EVERYTHING is burnt and you can't even get yourself a weapon or tools, Isn't all that fun. And some servers, belive it or not, actually DON'T have pvp enabled on this mode. But I'll get to that in a second. If you wanted to play a gamemode where anything can happen, this is the mode you want. However as mentioned, it takes patients to find the server you'll like, because of all of the servers might not allow something you wanted to be allowed. Just please don't grief in co-op or social because that ruins the game for the rest of us.Now For a few notes. So first of all, just because a gamemode listed above said it enabled killing, or enabled monsters doesn't mean that particulaur server Has it enabled. You should always check first to be sure. Like I said earlier, there could be a madness mode server that doesn't have killing enabled, or even a Competitive server without killing enabled. I'm Just Explaining to you what the servers usually have on for that particular mode and what the game says that mode is supposed to be used for so people can find the perfect server for them easier.EDIT: I Figured I should add a few more notes here so i can discuss How hard the developers are working. I think they are taking the game in an excellent direction. they semi-recently just put up an update that added things to trade and sell on the steam community market, and I am COMPLETELY obsessed with trading. You can also put 9 pieces of the same quality clothing in this machine to make one of a better quality. They aren't just updating this game, but also Don't Starve, (the single player game) and making new dlc.With that out of the way, I highly suggest you pick up this game. Although it helps to have other friends that have it as well just in case you can't find that perfect server, or a server where someone doesn't come along and ruin all of your hard work. while that never really bothered me, because i knew that it was going to happen one way or another, it helps to have friends that you trust not to ruin everything so you can see how far you can get without other people in the way. If ANY of these gamemodes sounds interesting to you then you should definetly pick this game up."

There is a lot more to the game than what initially meets the eye. Very well done. You'd think a game that looks this simplistic would be easy and boring, but this game is exactly the opposite. It kept me on my toes every minute and I was surprised at how deep it got."

Provided you can co-operate with the fact that this has alot of things missing, and a marginally increased difficulity of the overall game, you should go for it.

(but in febuary or january they have a major update)So yes i do belive this game is all it was hyped up to be and i have a blast playing it, i have personaly thought up many cool gamemodes i can do with my friends now thanks to this and i feel this is what dont starve needed. And for all you people who are mad about them saying they wouldnt make multiplayer, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT JEEEEEEZZZ. there is still a COMPLETLY seperate game for single player dont starve so stop whinging.

You can always play a free-mod game (I did for a week). If you are working with other people, commication is key. Give people roles and do work. Do not sit in base. Most likely, you will get kicked. If you eat the group's food, try to put food back in.*Pros:+ A lot of resources. Rocks may run out if you play for a long time but meteors give you rock.+ Learning how to kite monsters is fairly easy. (You may take a few hits before you master some kiting on monsters)+ You can have neutral allies.+ Easy to regain sanity (make new stuff from the machines).+ If you enjoy exploring, then run around the map.+ No censorship.+ Craft new weapons/armor to make fighting easier.+ Able to type in chat or whisper people in the vicinity of your screen.+ Different seasons are implemented into this game.+ Constant updates.*Cons:- Everything you do, may try to kill you/may get you killed. Chop a tree? Awaken a treeguard. Pick grass? May die from beefalo in heat. etc.- Useless moon rocks (for now). Only good for building a wall- No caves yet (without mods).- Easy to grief a server and leave (grief = destroy their base, burn trees, etc).- In PvP, if you kill someone, they become a ghost and lower your sanity.- New players will usually die and become ghosts and drain sanity and haunt everything- You do not share your map with other players.- Hosts can kick/ban you for no reason.- Seasons may get you killed. You may freeze, overheat, die from seasonal monsters, etc.Overall, Good luck. May add more."

Playing with your friends is a great time, but with strangers that randomly lights things on fire because they're nervous, not so much. As if Don't Starve wasn't great enough, playing it with others, and working together to, well, don't starve, is very cool! Building bases, gathering food and resources, hunting down weird giant monsters, or just grabbing poop, it's amazing with your friends. Even if you don't have any, just join a random server,(you probably wanna join a server that has anti-grief), and play with them. So, yes, highly recommended, and so is Don't Starve. This is best for the people who likes survival games, and to co-op with others to survive. Not recommended if you don't like surviving, or if you generally don't like to spend your time gathering resources.-Spheal with It"

Not only do you have to survive through all kinds of biome and creature to survive, but to really get the most out of this game you have to push yourself to go further, explore deeper into caves, research more advanced technology, and of course out-wit the many various styles of offense that this game might throw at you. And the best of it? Do it with the cooperation of others that aid you in your cause; surviving. Even if you play the game ""too long"", become pro and you start to find surviving tedious and/or repetitive, just buy the Single Player version; Don't Starve!

I have yet to make it a full weather cycle with my friends, we always get to the end of Winter or Summer and some giant thing kills us. This game is a lot of fun, and the developers update this game frequently. The best part about this game is the price. For two copies is around 15 dollars, usually 10 or 11 during a sale. The single player version of this game is a lot of fun, but in my opinion it is not nearly as good as playing with your friends, even if sometimes they decide not to cooperate and end up getting you killed (random ice box in the middle of the map). In my opinion, this game is the best multiplayer game on Steam, pick this one up.10/10"

The music is alright, nothing special there. It's certainly creative and with an active modding community the game never goes stale. I enjoy myself on the game.The player base that I've met in my 3 days of playing the game is mostly comprised of casual players with the occasional player or two who actually know what they're doing. Most people are friendly in the game and will make small talk in between completing group tasks. The game relies on coordination, planning and teamwork. You can get a lot more stuff done and at a quicker pace if your group can work quickly and effectively. The drawback is that you need more supplies to get tasks done, so you tax the environment more on needing to eat, make tools and build stations.I should point out that there is a small group who will gripe whenever anything doesn't go their way. There's an even smaller group who actually sets out to screw people over by destroying bases, stealing supplies then logging out. Don't be one of these people. Nobody likes these people."

Doesn't matter if its just two of you or eight, this game is gonne be just as fun to learn and master. Be ready for never ending gaming sessions and a lot of pain when a monster or a well-timed lightning wipes out your whole world progress.

The addition of the skins has also ripped up the feel of the community as most people care more about the skins than the game and with the skins having been made marketable when they were introduced, reduced the feel of being unique to the feel of greed since typical rare stuff go for about a couple dollars on the market. The skins should have been the little costumes originally found in the games files and should not have been random drops, I'm more likely to log in just to get my skins than play since the game is either full of people who don't care what happens to others or have no idea what they are doing. Tired of people who ask how to progress than figure it out themselves because they got the game for multiplayer reasons and not because they were interested in the game. The feel of difficulty this game had has also decreased from the point that the devs made it so easy to undo the punishment for being revived from telltale heart's now that it's no longer important to not die as you can quickly regain your max hp."

The game is simple in design compared to other games I've play yet, there is so much to do with it. The survival aspect is wondrfully done. The darkness and enemies gets me on my toes everytime because if I dont 'play my cards right', I would die and lose everything. The enivorment reacts wonderfully as it would in real life - overheating/freezing depending on the season and/or location, growth of plants overtime, rain make everything in inventory slippery, hail hurts, etc.But we're not here to talk about the solo version of the game, we're here to talk about the co-op version: Don't Starve Together. Right off the bat based on observation: enemies are harder to kill - it actually promotes teamwork to take down enemies, it reflect real-life to some sense such as unable to know where your friends have gone after some distance between, players can either work together or fight among each other to survive, etc. Only issue of this game is that unless the host of the server is on, players (friends) cant go in and out of the said server to help each other or prep things while the host is offline. Other than that, it is quite a challenge to survive in this game and when alone, you will not survive..."

It's such a shame that after hours of building a camp and getting supplies, the game gets progressivly harder to an extent where trying to survive is almost pointless - Werepigs ransack your camp, Wolves murder you time and time again, Insanity beasties ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and when you think you're kinda safe by your campfire, the odd shadow hands come and smite you. Obviously these elements make the game more exciting, but after playing about 50 games, I'm completely sick of the feeling of never being able to clock the game because I get murdered so easily and it's game over too quick.I'd love to be able to get a little closer to the end, or even reach Maxwell's door a couple of times without having to die and have to start completely over.So please consider allowing players to get a little further in the game (i.e. by allowing us to regenarate more lives without it costing us so heavily) - I would absolutely love this and it would make for a far more satisfying game :)Thank you!"

The interface is simple, but the learning curve is steep.  There's a lot to explore, try, regret, and try again but with a real weapon this time.

Plus another disadvantage/ possible advantage could be all non-hostile mobs avoid this shadow creature. For example Beefalo will run away from the character until you attack them, and same with other neutral creatures. Oh, and if they are too close to another player the other player loses sanity.

The developers are kind, charitable, and very greatful, the game's loads of fun, and the art style is incredible. If I had to choose anything I disliked about this game, I would mostly be at a loss for words, but there would still be a few fixable/non fixable things that either will, or won't be fixed, or removed. This probably isn't the developers fault, but the game is extremely laggy. The majority of any multiplayer game will mostly be ruined by the poor movement prediction, or even just a not perfect connection. The other problem, which I believe the good people at Klei will likely fix soon, is the giants either being too common for their difficulty, or dealing too much damage. These guys seem like a rare occurence, but trust me when I say, they'll appear when you least expect it. Other than being crushed by the Dragonfly's immense reach(Which combined with lag, is the work of satan), or the Deerclops' destructive power, or the Goosemoose's absurdly dumb amount of health, this game is easily my favorite game on steam."

I have played the ""alone"" version and both dlcs hundred hours and never enjoy a game as don't starve. So i decided to buy a key for my gf to play together but the game is so laggy that we can't even play. Even if we create a lan server the game is laggy as f*** for the client. After a little research we realized it's a game bug about the map or something like that. Some people says if the host player doesn't explore the map the game works fine. But the most disappointing thing is that some of the post reporting the lag issues are from a year ago and they still release the game without fixing this problem. So if you are thinking to buy this game keep in mind that this issue could happen to you too (there are some people that can play without any trouble. I don't know why. I have a high-end gaming pc so thats not the problem, neither is the internet connection as i said we tried with a lan server).Hope they fix this bug soon.A very dissapointed Don't Starve lover."

What could possibly go wrong?We were doing well, we'd not killed each other yet and it was nearly Winter. We'd stocked up enough food in the chests/ice boxes/drying racks to last the lot of us through Winter, we'd even got enough Spiders to slaughter for Monster meat to make Meatballs with the Crockpot if we got desperate. We'd managed to get enough stone to wall around our camp to stop any monsters getting in and even got a Beefalo farm going in another corner.We'd had Wolves attack the camp before, and when our characters started to hear noises, we got our weapons out and stood our ground. I could hear my friends over Skype saying ""Easy peasy"", ""You take the front pack, we'll get them from the back, so-so you go to the side"".The confidence was oozing from us, we thought we were ready. We thought we had this.Oh dear lord no. We were not ready for this.The ground started shaking, ""what is going on?"" I could hear the confusion in the call, I was confused. Then it happened. The white antlered monstrosity tore through the stone wall of our camp. Icicles appearing with every quaking footstep he took. Our weapons did nothing but bounce off his hairy legs.Panic ensued. ""RUN"" was the general consenus in the call, and we did. Running in circles did nothing, he followed us like it was a game, smashing everything in our camp as he did.""We need to save the camp!"" so we ran into the darkness. We lit trees on fire as we went past to give us some light so we wouldn't be slaughtered by the things that go bump in the dark.One friend down in flames...he kept stomping after us.Another friend crushed...he kept stomping after us.Morning broke, and there was one of us left. We asked what state the camp was in, ""irrepairable"" was the reply. As Ghosts, we couldn't do much, but he was determined to start re-building and see if he could figure out how to kill the unholy demon that was tearing up the world at night, then he froze to death and died.We all sighed in unison, then I asked ""so who's up for another game then?""On another unrelated note: don't hug the Cacti, they aren't your friends."

76561198035474931,Not Recommended,322330,20239814,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Cadash,"I can't say I really enjoy this game very much for a few reasons.1) You die way too easily - starvation, cold, random monster spawns, etc2) The combat is terrible3) You have to run from your corpse to find either a mysterious stone to resurrect or your portal in endless mode - then run back to your corpse to get your stuff - brutal waste of time4) Sometimes you'll die to something stupid like lets say a tentacle which prompts you to return to get your stuff but you can't because the tentacle will one shot you so you have to start all over5) 90% of the time you are looking for food to eat and even if you make a farm you get ONE yes ONE vegetable from the entire farm after like 20 minutes... whoopity doo6) Everything including frogs can seemingly hit you from the side even if they are facing the wrong way - its so frusturating and stupid - its not skill based combat thats for sureBut is there any positive? Yes of course.1) The game is drawn in a beautiful style that is very appealing2) There is plenty to do: upgrade and explore3) Interesting enemy creatures and they are humorous4) Crafting and harvesting are fairly painless and straightforward5) Very creative and fun charactersBottom Line:If you aren't easily frusturated you might enjoy this game. I tried for several hours to really get into this because of the positives but damn the combat is pathetically broken and just awful - god it annoys me to even think about. And the hunger bars drops down faster than a thermometer in Antarctica. The food is fairly scarce and doesnt give you enough of a boost. You can't enjoy other aspects of the game because of how terrible the hunger and combat systems are. Playing with friends is the ONLY way this game becomes tolerable and even then its frusturating.Would I get this game if I were you?No. I'd get Ark or Project Zomboid or Victor Vran or Long Dark or anything else that's worth your time."

Nothing is sacred.Story time.My last save was my best and I was feeling pretty cool. I survived until winter. I had a campfire, tent, a berry farm for spring, alchemy lab, 5 drying racks and a trap line going for rabbits. I was almost through the winter and the days were starting to get a little longer, supplies were lean though. Still I thought if I can push on a few more days spring should be just around the bend.Then came a noise in the dark, a loud deep roar. I prepared my spear for whatever was comming and a torch in case I needed to bug out. From the darkness a massive monster came stomping into my camp, I ran and almost forgot to light my torch. As I fled into the savanna the last thing I saw was my tent being torn to the ground by the beast. I camped in the savanna and survived the cold by lighting grass nubs on fire. When I returned to camp in the morning nothing remained but the drying racks. I spent a night camping out in the woods chopping trees and collecting rocks from the nearby quarry to rebuild, and started to piece together a humble camp the next morning.The night after the hounds came, Abigail was summoned, the hounds slain and I thought my luck was finally turning around. But then the noise came again from the darkness. With Abigail at my side I thought I may as well try to stave off the beast. Abigail fell, and I fled once again. Finally as I returned to my camp the next morning on the verge of insanity and death the beast attacked using a wave of ice and ending my life.WendyDays: 33Cause of death: DeerclopsLesson Learned: Your camp is never safe, keep a bug out bag at all times in order to reestablish quickly.I give this game 10/10"

The whole game is fixed permanently on survival and you have to learn yourself what each and every little thing does and what you can do with them. (Crafting) You also have to learn what you can do to defend yourself from mobs and bosses, how to make medicine to heal yourself after fights, and the best part.... survivng a whole Don't Starve year. Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer all have a different aspect for surviving aswell as a boss who comes every season for said season. You will do alot more of luring creatures away or into traps than fighting them but you can always fight anything if you know what you are doing. You have to keep stocked up on food or starve to death. Thats the name of this game by the way.This is the multiplayer version in which in itself right now has pros and cons. I'm just using the pros. cons. for the multiplayer part.Pros. Players can help build up a camp and survive with each other. (Great way of making friends really)If said players know what to do then progression in the game will go ALOT FASTER than on the SOLO Don't Starve version. All servers comes equipped with a kick/ban/rollback/restart option. (I could be wrong about the [all servers] remark)You can also include a password to your server to keep random people out and your friends in. (until they want to leave then they can exit and can rejoin if the admin is still on with server up)Can setup a dedicated server.Cons. Players who likes obliterating/incinerating items and buildings (Most call them griefers or trolls) can easily craft a torch or hammer and have at it, BUT GOOD players can kick or ban said griefer. They can then rollback the server to before the destruction happened but without the griefer present.This game has a ton of replayability, a huge learning curve, and a great place to meet new people in game that also (hopefully) enjoys this game and the concept of surviving. Whatever you do..... DON'T STARVE!!!!"

This game has a very good learning curve. It has a difficult beginning, but with effort and team work, you get entertained for several hours.This is not a easy game. It is one of those survival games that won't forgive you for any mistake. Eat something bad, fight a group of strong creatures or even get lost; any of those you will be paying with your own life.

The artwork, detail, and care put into the game is really worth the small amount of money it takes to buy the game. While I do enjoy the game, I will say that is is super challenging for beginners. If you mess up on the first go-round of Winter, it's extremely hard to play catch up. I noticed that the difference between experienced players and new players was so different that it almost made a new player's experience seem bad. All I have to say to anyone wanting to try this game should make sure to be patient and build up skill."

,Recommended,322330,26482252,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,Darkros,"I will be brief about this game.When you add co-op to Don't Starve, the game gets a little easier and harder at the same time. You will have more people to help kill mobs or bosses, gather suplies and explore the world. but more people means more mouths to feed.Nevertheless, the game is just so much fun. Its pretty light, meaning you don't need a lot of hardware to run this (i think even toasters can run this game) and there is something i like to say about games: they are always better with friends.The characters are unique. Every single one of them have their goods and bads. Take Weber for example, he's a spider (or Venom drawn by a kid). Because of this, spideys won't harm you. On the other hand, some mobs who would be pacific will turn arms on you, because you're a monster.Wigfrid too, she's a nordic warrior of sorts. She's a fighter, can craft a helmet, is strong and starts with a spear. On the other hand, she can only eat MEAT. No berries, carrots or anything of the sorts: she needs to kill.And if you get bored after playing a while, there are LOTS OF MODS. My friend, for example, instaled some character mods on his server. Now you can play as Geralt of Rivia or even Death.I have yet to see bad points to this game. It's so perfectly done that i am always eager to continue playing with my friends. If you like a good co-op experience, you should give it a chance. =]"

Judging on the world you play in it can be relaxing or utterly terrifying. Treeguards are always ready to mess up your happiness either by killing you themselves or by herding you into the path of a clockwork knight. Stupid trees that don't die when set on fire. I found it to be such a worthy buy that I got it for two of my friends so we could play together. I feel obligated to warn you, you will get frustated and die quite often. If it was easy that would take away some of the adventure and I like the forced cooperation of trying to kill and not have you and your friends be killed that the game inforces. If someone dies it can cause everyone else to fail but that is part of the incentive to cooperate. 10/10 Would die by Treeguard again."

This game is great, and you should really get it!Somewhat small story on how I died:Came back after a while.Many new updates.Wander through worlds in confusion for a bit.Everyone keeps ignoring me when I ask for help, so I change worlds and keep going.The game is still as fun as I remembered!Find one world where people take me in.As a play, the base grows a lot, and people start to come in.One guy suddenly acts like a child, dies, and sits in the base as a ghost.If we revive him, he starves himself or runs into a monster and dies again.He starts spamming questions marks and loudly as possible.After 10-20 minutes, he starts going on about how he can finally talk again.I didn't believe him, but somebody suggested that he somehow got stuck in another lanuage, and could not type anything else.I went along with it and tried to keep him alive.He messed up a lot. Being webber, we tried to teach him how to start spider wars, since he somehow forgot how to do anything.He doesn't eat at all unless we remind him.After learning to tame spiders, he brings an army to the base, which drains sanity even faster than his ghosts did.we have to kill them, but he does it the next night.He eventually leaves in the middle of our first winter, so he left us open.Deerclops would be coming in a few days.I was excited, since this might be my first battle with him if he didn't reach the base from farther away instead.The day he was supposed to come, I heard breathing, kind of like hounds do.I thought it was only him, but somebody is laughing about hounds are coming as well.We all joked, thinking we could take them all on.Around 5 hounds come before the Deerclops.I try to kite a few hounds, and another person runs off with 2 of them.Over 15 more attack me, the rest attack the other person.In total, around 30 hounds attacked. This was confusing since less than 10 came last time.I died from the pack of 15 immediately, and so did the other right as Deerclops came and began to destroy the base during the night.The one person from the neighboring base offers to come rescue us.When they make it over, the hounds are gone doing their own thing.The Deerclops kills our neighbor, and the world resets.The end :DBut really, this game is great. Tons of action everywhere, all kinds of creatures, and a huge world to explore. Maybe you could even get the single-player version, too!"

With its sketch-like art and suitably eerie soundtrack, you play as one of the many characters in a world where traits can be a blessing or a hinderence.

One of them is because you can gain at least one friend each day if you are active on other servers. Another one is that you dont actually have to take forever to build your base because of being alone. But I will warn you that if you start playing it might become the only game you play. Last of all the workshop mods make it the best! You can customize the recipe level, build a huge star, Build a furnace that can explode and kill you...   And of course a bunch of other mods you can get by just searching random things or looking through the Most Popular list. My opinion would be this game is a 10/10!"

If you are familiar with the lore, you will probably agree with me when I say it's a sequel.When this game came out in early access, it was, just an extention of DS, but now that it officially came out, it is so much more. I don't want to spoil anything, so I urge you to look it up yourself.It is a great multiplayer game. Although, there are some flaws. The loading screens can get very long, and I must add that they are not a pleasure to look at. It's probably just me, but the loading screens look very hastily put together. Another thing is that there is a lot of lag on severs where the hosts' internet is bad. Of course, this isn't Klei's fault, but there are things they could do to stabalize it a bit more.I've met so many people on this game, that I'm now friends with. I think there would be a lot more sense of community if Klei added a voice channel, and I know I'm not the only one who wants this.In conlcusion, even if you don't like multiplayer games or haven't played the original Don't Starve; try it out.

It's like an endurance sport, such as running or cycling — opaque, introspective and eventually, powerfully addictive.As with those athletic pursuits, there's a difficult learning curve. Your motivation to participate has to come from within rather than from without, as the rewards are intangible: you progress, get better, last longer. But for the right kind of player — someone who actively likes to compete against him or herself — Klei Entertainment's game is like a drug.Don't Starve puts you in the shoes of Wilson — a gentleman scientist (though you can also opt for another of the game's unlockable Edward Gorey-inspired characters, all with their own unique attributes). You wake up in the wilderness, with the cheeky instruction that you'd better find food before nightfall. That's all you get by means of explanation: Both character and player are left alone to figure out the tricky landscape.You click around the randomly generated scenery, collecting items and raw materials — which you'll turn into more sophisticated tools and gear necessary to survive. Each day is divided into daytime, dusk and night — and you need to create a light source to survive in the dark. You also have to avoid dangerous critters (or craft the right equipment to fight them successfully), forage or hunt for food, and make sure your character's hunger, health and sanity meters are in check at all times."

After many hours of playing it so far i've been really enjoying myself it's basically a dark survival game, the original is single player but as shown in this sequal playing this kind of a game with your friends is not only easier but makes it more enjoyable to group up and survive together as these wonderfully designed wacky characters. The aim here is to survive for as long as you can throughout all the seasons and avoid the darkness. Trust me it will kill you in horrific ways so stay by your fire people!!!!, or you can go endless so even if you do die you can keep playing. You set up camp and well build a home together, and each character brings forth new aid and challenges along the way, whether it be conjuring up magical helpers or turning into a giant werebeaver that eats all the trees near you O_O. And for those of us who might get a little bored with the vanilla gameplay there is a HUGE and extensive modding community for this i mean holy moly you can find mods for just about anything in this, whether it be utility, more monsters to kill or even better modded characters with their own unique stats and complexities, with these added in the game becomes even more vibrant and diverse and can change the game immensley. out of all the games i've seen this has one of the biggest modding communities out there who love this game and i can see why it's very enjoyable. As i've been playing it more and more i've been getting more hooked and even more creative with building and surviving. The devs don't add much content on a regular pace but honestly they don't need to, the game in itself is already packed with wonderful hours of gameplay that it's in no dire need of updates, Servers can get a little laggy for me because i just play non dedicated sessions with my friends so as long as our net holds out we're all good but even then it's not extreme lag so it's nothing horriffic. Would i recomend this game? Well like all games it really depends on what type of games you're into but otherwise hell yes i would. If you love survival games, playing with friends co-op or pvp ;), if you like cute designed games or even extensivley modded gameplay i highly recomend you give this a try and get your friends to join you too for an intense and yet some what relaxing and most importantly, a fun time. I really don't have any quarrels with this game so yeah i would highly recomend you give this game a try ^w^."

This will go down as a simple classic and perhaps especially in my books a Legendary game.

Even on sale, I feel like it still costs too much. I liked the game, but the $15 pricetag is too much. For now, I don't reccomend it.I'm not saying I hate it. I really do like the game.

The collectible gifts are useful for telling who is who when there are three Wendy and two Librarians on the map. It's really fun working with others to make a huge farm, a lovely base, and taking on the hounds. Despite being multi-player, we still have that challenge that comes with Don't Starve in general even if we cooperate to survive."

I can't really think of any other game on the market that is similiar enough to compare it to.  It has a lot of character and distinguishes itself a lot from other games because of this character, you can tell a lot of love and passion has gone into this game.

The most obvious feature of the game is the multiplayer, it is very smooth and handles well with normal internet. There is also single player if you are trying to play alone or you just want to survive alone and don't have the original Don't Starve. Some other things Inside the game is the fact you don't unlock the charecters, this helps with variety in players, one thing they could add is a charecter limit (I.E 1 wilson allowed). All in all I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone who loved the original Don't starve, but wanted to play with a friend."

This game is pretty fun to play in a world by yourself, but loads more fun if playing on a server or with friends. The real appeal to me for this game is trial-and-error; sometimes you might not make it, but eventually you'll figure out that maybe it's not a good idea to fight that tree guard. The first runs may be difficult at first, but then you'll notice that it's actually possible to survive through the game's harsh seasons and create that amazing base you feel so proud of ( And then have a giant come tear it all down :D ).Don't Starve Together has everything the original Don't starve has, but with more content and add-ons such the Reign of Giants DLC and the more recent updates with cave exploring. As it stands now the developers will be adding more updates to the game in the future.All in all an amazing game, should definately give it a try...with friends!"

Much of the play balancing and difficulty seems to have gotten well balanced since the early release days. I played with a couple friends and only made it till day 7, but had a blast. The general feel and controls are easy and I don't know what else to say. A must get for any LAN party.As for support, less than impressed. The setting up of a dedicated server is a NIGHTMARE. You have to own a game copy to run a server which is sort of silly (you figure they'd want people to run servers to support their game). So this involves a head-boggling task of installing steam, installing the server, tons of downloads and back-end (yes, you have to do it all yourself) AND getting the code to run. Then no direct connect so the server may or may not show in the list anyways.Sadly, since Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer game with poor multiplay functions, 2.5/5... the single player is 5/5 but then I may as well just settle with Don't Starve.---------------------PS - Bad game bug where the joystick defaults to primary controller and won't turn off.

It's quite simple, if you do not have play control, you have nothing.  Might as well be watching a movie, really.Upon clicking on certain items and even creatures, it will state the intended action, but that action often is not carried out.  This means if you wish to run and attack a creature, it will merely have you run up to the mob and the even that is to be carried out never happens.  When picking up items, this will result in one staring at the item, often stooped over.  This is my primary complaint; it affects any sort of strategy I use in playing the game.That being said, the game itself is wonderful to play as it is a great survival game noting the crafting, the generated worlds, the unique creatures, the challenge of surviving in a seasonal changing landscape.  However, it takes a good deal of cooperation in order to survive as friends noting that otherwise one will be competing for resources.Noting that there is no middle ground for how to rate the games as a binary ""yes"" or ""no"", I unfortunately have to refer to play control as critical.  Again, it holds up a majority of the time, but it is in those critical times when one needs it, especially noting how unmatched one is."

However, the survival mechanics and setup are all very realistic and engaging, so you'll get hooked pretty fast. There are lots of mods out in the community for you to try if you tire of the vanilla pretty fast, so there's always new content even if Klei doesn't necessarily release them themselves. It's always refreshing to start a world up with friends and strangers alike, since everyone has their own play style and it's always a new learning experience because of that.The only downfall with this game, and any game like this, are griefers and cheaters. Sometimes when you've build an awesome base with some awesome folks a troller comes into the game and sets your camp ablaze. Without mods and non-renewable resources, it can ruin your game experience. However, there are mods released by modders to combat this, so it's nice that there's a way around this.All around, it's a great game and development.

On one hand it has a wonderful UI, and everything that matters for multiplayer. But it's also a Don't starve game, early on it can be fun exploring new things around the randomly generated world, but eventually it does get tiring as you get attacked by the hounds... again. There is no variation in gameplay, even with mods and friends to play with. There is still such little to do until you get demolished by any of the bosses or mini bosses (which have cool designs, but ulitmatly end up being pretty lack luster). Still, for a solid 10-20 hours of fun, I would have to recomend this game. Don't expect a lot of lasting enjoyment."

Like that exact same pants that you already have three of. With all that said, I really can't recommend this game enough.

So let's get into it.Story: Story isn't really the strong suit ofDon't Starve: Together. There's a guy. He put you on an island. [/spoiler]He's trapped by shadows.[/spoiler] Whoops, spoiled the entire story. Not like it's important. Story gets a 6/10, because it's at least a bit original.Gameplay: This game is all about gameplay. With several different characters, each with their own benefits and drawbacks,Don't Starve: Togetheris able to create dynamic gameplay that is truly different every time you play. It's procedurally generated, meaning that the world is different every time. The gameplay revolves around an isometric space in which there are trees and rocks, which you can break down for resources, and then build stuff. There's also combat. That's a cool thing that happens sometimes. Gameplay gets a 9/10, because it's pretty fun and dynamic.Graphics: The graphics of this game are pretty good. It's unique and stylistic and just really stands out. I especially like the way the characters are designed as well. Graphics gets an 8/10 because of style.Other Stuff: The modding community is one of the best out there, especially so short after release.

Thanks to the mod-makers of DST, this game has unlimited possibilities. And this is just a beta version, so some connection problems are waiting to be fixed at the moment. For example the lag of this game sometimes suddenly becomes serious and makes a character out of control. It is hopeful that more content of DS can be moved into DST in the future (e.g. cave) and some new system (like character skin) can be added to make DST among the most popular sandbox games."

It shouldn't be called Don't Starve Together but instead A Million and One Ways to Die in 2d.You really need teamwork in this game if you want to survive.If you get to cold, you die. Which in winter time just consider yourself dead.If you get to hot you die...you can use tree for cover but they catch fire, so yeah. Survivable though unlike winter.Sometimes the resources you need have already been taken by people and you get caught in the dark with no light. You guessed it, YOU'RE DEAD unless of course you find some fireflies BUUT they just fly away when you try to stand in their light.You go too insane and you end up dieing from all the demons in the world that attack you when you lose your sanity.Thankfully sanity isn't too hard to keep up.You don't eat? Yeah, of course you die. Pretty easy to not starve though.Regenerating health after you lose it....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA yeah...right! Getting health back is a pain in the rear.Then you get the occasional greiver who you know...stumbles across your base and just lights EVERYTHING on fire. Which means you have to start ALL OVER.When you die, not if, but WHEN you die a lot of servers you can't respawn. You must wait for someone to revive you. Which, if you aren't a part of the group, good luck having someone revive you. Have fun for that matter trying to group with people.A lot of games you join and ask where the base is or try to group up and no one will answer you.I have managed to stay alive on 2/10 characters and was booted out of both servers that I was surviving on. For no reason at all mind you, I was on my own. Of course it's a team game but when people don't respond to you of course you will play alone.The community sucks.5/10 If you do decide to buy it get it on sale don't spend full price."
