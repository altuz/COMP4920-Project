So you eventually just have to leave the server because no one can kill him and things are getting hostile since it's no fun for anyone but him and now people are raging about hacks that may or may not exist?Well now you can be that guy!________________________________________Just an add on for the top reviews saying the game is too short, I spent 2-3 hours on the story, I've spent 7-8 hours so far on the modes I unlocked after beating story and I've still not gotten to unlocking all the endless arenas or challanges. So I'm just going to respectfully disagree with the price not being worth it.The BULK of the game and its unlockables appears to be after you beat the story line.________________________________________Lots of arguments going on about this game, since I've somehow ended up as a top review I'll go ahead and expand further on why I think the game is worth the price with things I've said in the comments.The story is just a  prelude to the meat of the game, a fabric to wrap the metagame of the arena/arcade shooter in. Why you're doing this seemingly pointless task of killing red guys, the sort of world you're fighting in, etc.The story itself doesn't flat out tell you much either, even after you beat it you still have to piece things together by explore the menus, hidden features, chat logs, and there's also secrets and hidden terminals on each level of the campaign that let you access more lore/chat logs... something to go back and find after you've beaten them once.But in the end much like in a fighting game you're really just here for the mechanics anyway, so buy it for that and you shouldn't be disappointed."

,Not Recommended,322500,21729559,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Dacia Sandero,"First of all and perhaps most importantly - this game is extremely fun.  Certainly the most innovative shooter I've played for quite some time. It's on the level of Portal with it's ingenuity. You will enjoy the time mechanics. I have nothing negative to say about the gameplay - it's superb.Nearly as important, though, is how depressingly short the game is. I beat it in 1.4 hours with a moderate amount of failure and taking the time to enjoy the story.  In an age where we buy games that can take hundreds of hours to complete - a game that only takes 1.4 is simply far too short.  It's not worth the price.  I didn't get $25 worth of play from this game, because it isn't there.  The game ends just as you fall in love with it.  It's an abrupt relationship.This should be your first buy during the next big steam sale. $5-10 would be perfect.  Put it on your wishlist and don't forget about it, but don't buy it right now.  It's not worth your $25.   If it was a proper length then I'd pay $60 for it because the idea is innovative and fresh.   But 1.4 hours is not even close to enough content to justify the price."
,Recommended,322500,21819813,"Posted: 13 March, 2016",all,Emperor Gandhi,"SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. After playing a little over 6 hours, I think it's pretty safe to say that SUPERHOT is one of the most interesting games I've played in a while. There are a few flaws and an intimidating price tag, but it's worth your time if you get it on sale.GraphicsThe visuals have gotten mixed reception, but I'm personally a fan of the art style here. It's simple without feeling lazy, like many other indie games when it comes to their graphics. Plus, I can't help but watch the red guys as they crumple to the ground after they were killed. It makes every kill feel ten times more satisfying. Overall, the art style is simple in a good way.GameplayI'm not going to lie, this game is incredibly fun. It definitely deserves the title as one of the most innovative shooters in years, and surprised me with the amount of content post-campaign. Yes, the main story IS really short, but I'll get in depth with that in the ""Replayability"" section of my review. The gameplay mechanics are unique and really creative. Watching a replay of you after you die/win (depending on the mode) makes you feel really badass. I don't need to explain the gameplay much, as you can just watch a video of it and know what you're in for. I will say, however, that it was executed very well and is about as fun as it looks. Plus, when you beat the game, you unlock endless and challenge modes, which give the game much more to do after you finish the campaign. Let the videos speak for themselves with this section.StoryThe game comes off as a ""kill bad guys"" sort of game, but as you progress through the main storyline, you'll start to notice the game getting increasingly suspicious, without getting into details. It gets increasingly interesting as you go on, and while some people find it kind of absurd or weird, I found it to be pretty good. I'm starting to notice an increase in games that break the fourth wall frequently and try to toy with your mind, examples beingUndertaleandPony Islandas some of the better ones. SUPERHOT doesn't get to levels of those two in terms of mind♥♥♥♥ing, but saying that the plot is boring or underwhelming would be a lie. The ending is one of the most clever endings I've seen in a video game. Once I was brought back to the menu, I stared at the screen, slowly clapping because of how creative it was. To conclude, I am pleasantly surprised with the story here.AudioThere isn't much in terms of audio. Some music, but the game is usually quiet. It relies on sound effects and the constant ""SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT."" to make your ears happy. Not much to say here, to be honest. As I said, the game is pretty quiet, and the sound effects aren't all that noteworthy. The only thing you'd remember here are the two words that you should probably know at this point.ReplayabilityOkay, I understand that the storyline is very short. Some people have finished this game in about an hour or two. I'm not very good at this game, and I did take my time with some parts, so I finished it in around three hours. The story is very interesting, but it didn't leave much else to question. So yes, the main story IS very short and that is a problem with the game. However, with the endless and challenge modes I talked about earlier, you'll probably spend some more time with the game. Rather than feeling like filler content, I actually wanted to play more of the game because of how much fun the mechanics are. No, this isn't like Skyrim and you're probably only going to get a few more hours of content, but at least there's more to do post-game.VerdictOverall, SUPERHOT is very different and I am overall satisified with the experience. There are a few flaws, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons, so I can recommend this game. Just be cautious with that $25 price tag and know what you're getting into if you do decide to buy it at that price.Graphics- 8.5//10Gameplay- 9.5/10Story- 8.0/10Audio- 7.0/10Replayability- 8.0/10.:7.9/10:.+Pretty art style+Interesting story+Unique gameplay mechanics+Endless & challenge modes add replayability+Clever ending-Expensive price tag-Short campaign"

I would estimate that 2 hours were spent on the ""story"" mode, and the other ~30 minutes were spent messing around with the first few ""endless"" levels.By the end of that play session, I was pretty much done with SuperHot. The novelty had worn off, the story mode was complete, and none of the extras or replays were going to keep me around.If you see this game on sale, or get a coupon, I'd say go for it. It's an interesting mechanic to play with. At full price, I'd tell you to save your money. In the meantime, try and track down the original Superhot. It's about the same length, it's free, and I actually preferred the story in that one over this one.It's not a bad game, and it's a game I can honestly say I enjoyed both times I played it, but it's right on the borderline of things I'd recommend.

If you liked the prototype and just wanted more levels, then this is the game for you. However for me, it felt like 2.5 years wasn't worth the wait.1) The gameplay can get repetitive. While anyone will feel like a badass playing this, it can wear off a bit as the guns are just the same 3 types: pistol, smg, shotgun. Melee weapons are pretty much the same except for the katana.2) The story is WAY too meta. It's a game about playing a game and it tries to make you feel like your being sucked in literally. Plus, the ending is a bit indulgent.All in all, if you just wanted more levels, weapons, and a graphical upgrade, that's fine.

I personally think the game is more fun going around punching people in the face, grabbing a gu, finding a guy with a sword, beaming him in the face with the gun and slicing everyone around him.There's so many things you can do in this game if you're willing to sit down and explore. Even the main menu has interesting things to explore. If you're not the kind of person to fight endless waves of RED guys then you might not find the game as fun after the somewhat short campaign. Even after the campaign there are the challenge modes which are pretty neat and trying to beat the RED times are pretty tough and take practice, timing, and a whole lot of frustration.

It is extremely fun to play around with, and can certainly be a game you can play with friends to see who can do the coolest things, but $25 is a bit too much for what is being bought.For one, Superhot's main story is only about 2 hours long. Even with a dozen retries on some levels, I still completed it in under 2 hours. That is quite ridiculous, as the replayable content doesn't go very far after that either. The only modes available following the main story are Endless Mode and some Challenge modes. You can probably squeeze a few extra hours out of those if you're in love with the game, but other than that... you won't be playing this for long, and as such, you definitely won't want to cough up $25 for a 3-4 hour experience in a video game.Is Superhot worth playing? Yes. Like I said, it is exhilarating to play. It's an experience I've never had before, and would love to have again in a different aesthetic. Maybe a more realistic one.

,Not Recommended,322500,21471274,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Neuf,"This was not a decision I made lightly. It's a bit of a shame that Steam reviews only have a thumbs up or thumbs down, not any sort of in-between score.I expect that fans of the game will downvote the hell out of this review for not recommending it.Truth is I'm a huge fan of this game. Despite a couple technical hiccups (which may not be actual bugs, given the nature of the game), the game is ridiculously fun and stylish as hell. Though SUPERHOT has really only one gameplay gimmick, it never grew stale. Killing a room full of red guys in impossible situations never got boring, and the game's narrative actually kept me very engaged.Since time only moves when you do, the game feels very far away from any other first person shooter made before it. It's impossible to run-and-gun, you need to carefully plan your steps to dodge deadly projectiles, while also aiming carefully and lining up those perfect shots; with so little ammo, you can't afford to be careless. It's the freshest breath of air an FPS fan has been able to inhale for the last long while.So why am I not recommending this incredible game?The price.I've defended games like Jazzpunk and McPixel, even Undertale, when faced with the criticism of a game being too short. I truly believe it's about the experience. But SUPERHOT has pushed my limit.$35 Canadian dollars for a game you can potentially beat in a few hours?It's not quite worth it.SUPERHOT is amazing. But $35 is a very steep price for a quick game. I suppose there is replay value in the Endless Mode, trying to do sections more efficiently, and trying to uncover the game's secrets. But really, as excellent and fun as it may be, there is no variation in gameplay.Tons of AAA titles boast campaigns that barely register 6 hours and they cost twice as much, I know this. But, having paid a much smaller price for games I felt carried more weight, I still don't think SUPERHOT has a justifiable price.If it came down in a sale or something I'd push this game onto every person within reach and earshot of me.SUPERHOT is an incredibly creative and well-crafted game.It just costs too much right now."

If you like the demo and would like to play with variations on it on ~25 levels, go for it. An extra gameplay mechanic gets chucked in halfway to spice things up a little.It's a lot like Portal in that it's a small, short puzzlish game with an excellent, original atmosphere and style, but it's nowhere near as polished.Story is compelling and fun, but only 2 hours long. Half of the challenge modes are good, half are garbage, there's about 12 in total. Endless mode is fun but you don't have any rewards or goals. Time-trial mode is the same. What sealed the deal for me continuing to play was the secret-finding exploration mode.It's fun to start up and play one or two levels for 5mins.Add a level editor and proper way to share them and this would be solid gold.~~~ Here's all the problems that should be easily fixed ~~~Endless modes and time-trial modes are lack-luster; it doesn't compare scores against friends or give rankings/grades. Stupidly, the first ~1.5 seconds of in-game time occur with the loading screen still up, so you have to begin blindly to get the best times, not that there is anything motivating you to improve your time past the single goal they give. Endless mode is fun, but the game gives you no milestones to aim for - all of the unlockables (timed endless modes) are unlocked by total kills ever rather than top score.Irredeemable bugs:There's a minigame that doesn't stop the music on exiting, leaving it looping over itself and forcing a restart. Some achievements are bugged, including giving me the ""complete all time trials"" achievement when I only did 5 of them. Worst of all, completion of the last level you do before quitting IS RANDOMLY NOT SAVED SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.Graphics:The brightness can be a bit difficult to look at sometimes.Animations are janky, which is a bit weird because they literally only have one animated model.It is also somehow jittery at times? VSync is broken and doesn't lock to 60fps. Level 21 is very laggy for no apparent reason.Settings menu is pitiful, you have about 3 graphics options and can't change key bindings.Gameplay:Thrown objects will very occasionally bounce off or pass through enemies for no apparent reason.Thrown objects move faster than bullets. If you shoot and immediately throw a gun, the bullet hits the gun.I don't know why they don't have time completely stop, it makes for a much more precise experience.When you land from a jump the screen gets a pointless and annoying/disorienting shock effect.You can't really tell how much ammo your gun has left, reducing your ability to plan stuff.The gun reload animation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you can't tell how long it has left until you can fire again.The end-of-level replays aren't quite satisfying enough, they're still too slow.If an enemy breaks something too close to themselves they get stunned, which is a bit lame."

This game relies solely on gameplay and doesn't have realistic high tech visuals, nor any particular interesting storyline. It's just you in different white environments with red dudes as villain. Weapons are shotgun, pistol, rifle, katana, bat.Time moves only when you moves. You can jump, stun enemies by throwing weapons or objects against them.The story mode is short, like 2 hours or so and if it was only that it would certainly be overpriced. Endless mode is a bit grindy and the goal is to get a certain kills on a map before you unlock the next map. Fun is trying to get as many kills as possible before getting overwhelmed and killed.Now the best stuff are the challenges, which make you complete all levels on certain criteria, like with katana or throwables only, time based, or completing all levels in one go without dying. Had real fun going for those. There's one specific level that is hard, called Elevator and that one really gave me some irritation when going for the norestart challenge.

,Not Recommended,322500,22126306,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,TＯＭＭＹ ＷＩＳＥAu,"Superhot is possibly the most disappointing game I’ve played so far this year. It’s got a great premise with it’s time bending matrix style mechanics, but to be perfectly honest with you that’s all it’s got going for it.Now for those of you unfamiliar with the title, Superhot is a first person shooter where time moves only as you do… remember those fight sequences in 300… now imagine them with guns and you’ve got superhot – a never before seen melting pot of both strategic and twitch based shooting.Now of course bullet time isn’t really a new thing and over the years we’ve been inundated with enough Max Payne and F.E.A.R clones to be sick of the concept. However, it’s never really had any use beyond doing John Woo’esque dives to look cool and break up the otherwise monotonous game loop. Heck if you’re name’s Dereck and you enjoy filing tax returns you could probably get through Max Payne without using bullet time once.The difference with superhot is that the games mechanics actually force you to choreograph some really impressive stunts just to stay alive. It’s a bit like hotline Miami where getting hit once causes instant death forcing the player to make split second decisions to stand a chance in a firefight. Infact it’s a lot like hotline Miami with throwable objects used to stun enemies and block bullets, and very similar melee and projectile weapons.The only real difference in terms of gameplay is hotline’s top down all-seeing perspective compared with Superhot’s much more limited first person view, a limitation in theory meant to balance out the bullet time… In practice I’ve been shot in the back countless times by enemies behind me. It feels cheap and annoying and it’s one of the major problems I have with the gameplay.It also feels like the dev’s either didn’t know or didn’t care about this problem when they created their replay system, kilstagram. The idea behind it is that, after you’ve cleared each level, you get to watch a replay of you dispatching your enemies in real time which you get the option to upload to various social media sites. You know because all those nightclub photographs you got tagged in weren’t enough to show people how much fun you were having without them.Anyway on paper it sounds like a pretty cool idea – the chance for you to show off your Wachowskii’esque bullet time skills but in reality the played back footage looks more like that of a twitchy counterstrike player as you keep glancing behind you to make sure you don’t get flanked causing the camera to spin back and forth making it headache inducing to watch… actually that does sound a lot like a wachowskii film.Aaaand that’s it… well at least in terms of mechanics… and to be honest with you it all feels very lackluster. For all it borrows from Hotline Miami, I kinda wish they’d taken more. At the moment there simply isn’t any reward for combos or difficult kills like headshots, there isn’t even any music in the background which makes it feel more like an early access title than anything else. But I guess that’s the kind of aesthetic they were going for – everything in the game is made up of plain textures with a really minimalist color scheme.  And it also ties in with the story the dev’s wanted to tell… that’s right the dev’s actually managed to come up with a story to tie all of this together, though as you’ll see it’s so phoned in and half-arsed it feels more like it’s there for the sake of having a story.Remember Pony island? Good Neither does the guy that wrote this drivel.  Instead of being a story within Superhot’s universe, it’s a story about playing superhot. You start off the game looking at a dos style operating system when suddenly you get an instant message from a friend sending you a file titled “superhot.exe”. After playing a few levels, the system detects you and it pans out exactly as you’d expect it to be with the system trying to stop the player and the player finding loopholes and backdoor routes to evade the system.  The problem with the narrative is that it does not compliment the gameplay – you could replace the shooting segments with Tetris and the story would still work.It’s a prime example of what people who like to use big words to sound clever call Ludonarative Dissonance, where the gameplay and story don’t match and the exposition just feels like a hindrance to the actual meat of the game.Whilst I can kind of get over the mediocre storyline, the thing I find unforgivable is the 2-hour campaign length. That’s right, you can beat the game in a single sitting! Now I’m not saying all short games are bad, in fact titles like Portal have been praised for not overstaying their welcome with their shot length. The problem with Superhot being so short is that instead of leaving me wanting more, I just feel unsatisfied by the finished product.To rub it in, the dev’s have had a working prototype since 2013 which featured quite a few of the levels that ended up in the full game, most of which was made in a few days at a game jam. It can’t be so hard to make a level that the team could only pump out 20 or so short levels in 3 years! Especially with backing and e3 coverage by both Sony and Microsoft. To have the balls to demand 17 quid (that’s the equivalent of 3 copies of Undertale) for a game that can be beaten in an afternoon is a little bit insulting. Granted there’s more to it than just the campaign, there’s also the arena mode where you have to fend off endless waves of enemies which gets boring after about an hour and there’s the challenge mode where you’ll have to play the campaign meeting certain conditions (for example only using the katana). Like the story, both these additional modes feel last minute and tacked on.The best analogy I have for the game as a whole is to imagine the first chapter of id software’s doom being sold full price. Back in its heyday in the 90’s nobody had ever seen anything like DOOM and I can safely say the gameplay of superhot is just as innovative. However, whilst the game that’s there is relatively enjoyable, albeit flawed, it just ends before the more interesting experimental stages (like in the 3rd act of doom) get to be shown. Ultimately I can’t really recommend picking up the game unless it’s heavily discounted and, to go with the analogy, the game receives a John Romero out of 10. It showed a lot of promise in it’s early days as a prototype, started getting full of itself at e3 and then ultimately♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed with one fell daikatanaesque swoop."

Throughout the day, and through running arguments with fans of the game, I have come to ask ""Was I wrong about SuperHot? Did I simply not appreciate its genius? Have I been letting a bad experience partially related to mobile hardware ruin my opinion of an otherwise sound game?""The answer is no.The reason I cannot reccomend superhot is simple. It is a lazy product, especially at its base pricetag of 25 dollars.- Combat is one dimensional. Your arsenal consists of 3 samey guns and a melee attack, to be used on one basic enemy type, using two AI scripts. All guns shoot slow bullets with overlarge hitboxes that kill enemies wherever they hit them. Combat itself just boils down ""click on the nearest enemy."" There's no strategy, risk/reward, or anything else, because the only thing that makes enemies remotely dangerous is proximity.- The presentation is bland and empty. While visually functional, which is extremely important and should be lauded, there was zero meaningful artistic effort put into this game. Yes, the polygon men shatter and ragdoll nicely, but what does this mean to the narrative, the world? Nothing. The story as well is a vapid copypasta of late 90's cyber-angst so lazy I quit 60% of the way through the game and just looked it up on wikipedia. I was still disappointed.- The playtesting was lackluster. Bullet on bullet collissions, a cool idea on paper, happen so often they become a frustration. I didn't even play a full hour and had it happen to me 5 times. It happened so often that I started to hate it happening, and that's too often. If enemies were actively shooting my bullets down, I might credit it as some modicum of AI intelligence, but no, all were just stupid accidents resulting from center-of-mass shots on enemies that were shooting back. But if this is bad, then level hitboxing is even worse. I had a bullet disappear in midair because it hit an invisible corner, and it was a perfect shot too. You're telling me they spent two and a half years on barely 150 minutes worth of content and couldn't polish the collision?Really, at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like SuperHotTeam even tried when they made this game. Two and a half years ago, SuperHot was a proof-of-concept demo being debuted at 7 day FPS Challenge. Today, it is still a proof-of-concept demo that now goes for 25 dollars. Maybe when they decide to make an actual game it'll be worth it, but for now take your money and go buy a game from a developer who cares."

It's available for free on the Superhot website, and really is an accurate reflection of the final game. I tried it, and disliked it, but bought the game anyway, thinking maybe the final version would be better.The hitbox for the player is very misleading, and makes it very difficult to judge where you can move to avoid a bullet. Enemy ai is bland and predictable. The real problem of the game comes in with how enemies spawn. If you have yet to memorize where they'll come from, then when they spawn in already shooting, they WILL kill you.The game's short length, of around 2 hours + challenges, is perfect for its awful story, but is lackluster for a $20 release. There is little variety in weapons and opportunities during gameplay.In addition, there may be a small amount of bugs, but it's difficult to tell when the game's presentation is the glitchy style.If you like the prototype, you really will like the full game (maybe wait for a sale, though).If you expect another Hotline Miami, don't buy this.

I wasn't super hyped for this game so I went in with what I'd say fairly low expectations. But now that I've fully completed the game, obviously barring challenges and endless mode, I can confidently say this game is the worst waste of time and money ever. About half way through my 2 hour absolute thrill ride (/s) I was already totally fed up of the text simulator that half the game basically is. If I took out all mandatory text scenes in this game it'd be little more than an hour long glorified flash game. Now, the game does offer neat little stuff like 'secrets' hidden in what I presume to be every level, but this has not interested me enough at all to keep me playing, or keep it in my library for that matter.Gunplay is exactly how you'd expect. The whole 'time moves when you move thing' is pretty neat at times. I'm not going to lie, the game definitely has it's entertaining moments, for about 30 minutes, then it becomes frustrating. Hotswitching is fun for the what 5? 6? levels I was allowed to use it in, shame it was introduced too late. The level design is either sixty or total nought, with some levels making you purposefully die so you can play it again or some levels making you make mistakes because you just want it to be over.The story is not particularly engaging, no spoilers, but it becomes GLARINGLY obvious what you're going to have to end up doing very early on in the game. The story is only advanced by compulsory text sections, which can range from short interactions to taking way, WAY too long. The large flashing text is an effective ""cool"" little feature for a while, then it starts to try way too hard to become intimidating and overbearing, which it fails at by being too frequent and 'obvious'? I guess?Right, one more thing. I'm almost certain this is intentional, and somehow the secrets may be involved? Or maybe I missed things. BUT, the game has an OVERBEARING AWFUL LACK OF CHOICE. I seriously get the vibe the devs were going for, but man, is this game linear. It's painfully restrictive, if you're the curious type who tries to look for every way out of being told what to do, this game will be little more than a masochistic experience for you. Again, this may be all irrelevant with game elements which I have not explored.Ultimately, not a good experience. Forgive my ignorance, but I honestly don't know what the devs were doing all those years. If you're a big fan of short games, and LOVE the mechanic of time moving when you do and are willing to play the game well into the challenges and endless mode, go right ahead, seriously, you will have a blast. But to the average player? I wouldn't. The game is good, but very slow paced, and the (unskippable!) text sections go on way too long."
,Not Recommended,322500,26364146,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,TheGhostThatWas,"When I say""SUPERHOT IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS!""I mean that. However, before you purchase the game, I should warn you about the numerous problems that the game has. YouSHOULDget SUPERHOT, but let me give you a few warnings first.SUPERHOT's defining feature is that time only moves when you do. This isn't entirely true, astime still moves slowly when you're not moving.This isn't exactly a problem, because if you're taking that long to think which way to dodge a bullet, chances are you deserve to get hit anyway.Short StoryThe game's campaign is very interesting and spooky, but can be beaten inbetween 2-3 hours depending on how well you do, and somevariables. The variables I'll cover in the next section.VariablesIn slow motion, you can almost always tell when you are going to die, and from where. However, some levels contain randomly generated enemies which actually determine whether or not you're going to win. For example, level15HOSPIT.lvlis easily one of the hardest levels to beat simply because after you kill the wave of red guys, several red guys spawn with random guns, ranging from bare handed to shotgun, all in a tight little room. It's unfortunate to say this, but winning some levels like this,especiallyduring challenges and time trials, might only depend on if you're lucky enough to play when all the red guys spawn with only pistols.It is incredibly frustrating that the only way to beat a level is based on whether or not certain enemies spawn, and winning has less to nothing to do with the players skill.The other variable is shotgun fire. Those guns are impossible to predict.The Game BreakersSUPERHOT has a few bugs which can make the game a bit more challenging, to occasionally stopping you from winning a level.Going back to the level15HOSPIT.lvl, there's a good example of a challenging bug. After you enter the first room from the balcony-catwalk-thing, your in the line of fire of a shotgunner and a machine gunner. Your options include running straight at them, or backing up around the corner. However, backing up is a problem because there's a small height difference between the ledge and the room, which prevents you from backing up. And as long as you hold the ""S"" key, the bullets move closer and closer. Jumping over this is out of the question, because as long as your in the air, time continues to move as gravity pulls on you. Little details like this become major problems in Challenge modes. And this isn't the only example of bad world geometry, as some levels have invisible barriers that prevent you from exiting the line of fire altogether.Another good example is the broken Time Trial mode. In at least one level (there may be others, I don't know yet), the timer starts counting before you even finish loading in, resulting in you starting with roughly .97 seconds already passed. This sounds minor, but when the goal is set at 4 seconds, losing that time is almost a quarter of what you should have. On that level, which is03CORRID.lvl, the best possible time I've managed is 4.07, and that was after nearly 20 minutes of retries, on what is only the third level in the game.ConclusionSUPERHOT is very unique and memorable for it's mechanics. It could have been improved during development by adding more levels to the story, but that's only an issue if you don't want to pay full price for that much.The only thing that keeps SUPERHOT from being ""super cool"" is the obvious missed steps taken in testing the game, but development is still semi-active so the game might be fixed in the future.I only hope that the developers are listening to bug reports, and are willing to fix the small stuff. After the game isn't broken enough that I stop raging at trying to complete it 100%, I'll give it my thumbs up.Plus I hope this game gets a Steam Workshop. That would be pretty neat."

,Recommended,322500,21831206,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,Dinoracha,"I’m all for innovation when it comes to blending genres to create something new and noteworthy, and SuperHot’s early prototype certainly had me intrigued when I first saw it. Never mind the strange, unseen narrator who references the game’s title ad nauseum or the shattering of red people like panes of glass, it was the nature of having a partial control of time while dodging bullets and dispensing your own in a slick, effortlessly stylish manner that sold me. The final product does deliver on its original proof of concept, but not without a few issues making things needlessly bothersome near the end.Stand still and time moves at a crawl. Move or attack and time moves normally. This is the fundamental gimmick of SuperHot; making your character feel like a nigh-godly action hero who dispatches enemies effortlessly… Except your character is made of even more fragile glass than the enemies. Enemies are killed instantly when they’re hit by a bullet, struck with a melee weapon or in seldom cases meet their demise via the environment, the exception being a three hit punch combo. You on the other hand can’t even take one punch without falling to the ground and dying horribly. Thus each level requires a chaotic ballet to avoid all sources of damage, otherwise you’re sent right back to the start of the level. Dying and restarting only takes a few seconds which is good since you’re likely to die on a constant basis while trying to figure out just the right way to tackle the opposition in front of you. Levels can be completed in multiple ways and styles, like throwing your empty gun at an enemy to stun him and grab the gun he drops so you can turn around and shoot down someone chasing you, then throw the new gun and beat the original enemy to death. Completing a level will have the game replay your endeavours in real time, making your assault look like one seamless act of quick thinking and fancy moves.Often times there is a -lot- going on in SuperHot to track and manage in terms of threat to your livelihood, so thankfully the visuals have been designed to give players the best chance at survival. The world is shades of white and grey, enemies and their bullets trails are unmistakable red while weapons and bullets are an easily noticeable black. Even with the visuals being so clear on what’s a viable item for self-defense and what’s going to end you, it’s easy to move around or try to take a shot and get blindsided by a baseball bat upside the head or take a bullet in the back. Enemies have set spawns in the levels, so part of the challenge comes from knowing where to look and when - Spawn camping has never felt more justified. Of course there’s an incredible satisfaction in turning around quickly enough to see a bullet getting ready to pierce your ear only to calmly shuffle out of the way to avoid it, or being suppressed by an enemy with an assault rifle only to bob and weave past his stream of bullets and bop him in the mouth to disarm him.While intercepting incoming bullets with your own or throwing a weapon at a slug to save yourself is a neat trick and all, there is a -very- rare but very bizarre case of your fired bullets and thrown weapons outright despawning when you look away. If you toss an empty pistol at an enemy only to look away to punch another, there’s a faint chance that the pistol will have completely disappeared by the time you look back. Combine this with slightly spotty hit detection when it comes to your character taking a fatal bullet or the range for melee strikes being unreliable with respect to whether you can actually strike even when the visual cue is active and later levels end up becoming far more tense and consequence ridden than I would’ve liked. Despite there being a visual notification on enemies when you’re in melee range, attacking can end up with an embarrassing whiff and your character eating whatever punishment they have in mind, which is quite bad when you’re up against multiple enemies armed only with your fists and them with firearms.The main campaign won’t take all that long even with repeated deaths, and the story that goes along with it can largely be discarded, but there are a few clever elements to the plot and how it interacts with the main menu, which emulates a DOS-style home computer that the player character is seated at. Completing the game unlocks speed run and survival modes along with special challenges which throw a wrench into the equation like having only a sword and no other weapons, or having your teleport ability (unlocked in the campaign) available from the start but  have your weapons limited to your fists which now instantly kill enemies. Although the majority of these modes take place in the campaign levels, being able to tackle old challenges with new tricks or handicaps can force new, clever strategies out of the player.SuperHot doesn’t last all that long which is a shame for a game that uses such a great, slick gimmick. I’d argue that the game is a puzzler that just so happens to have guns in it, and after 3 hours I was disappointed that there wasn’t much else to solve excluding the unlocked bonus modes. Credit where due, the developer even decided to make a series of extra modes to extend game time and enjoyment of SuperHot, which would’ve been a short one-trick-pony experience without. It’s a very cool game with a great series of mechanics that ends all too soon, but beyond that I can certainly recommend SuperHot for anyone who wants a combination of shooter and puzzle games that still brings something of its own to the table."

To kill red dudes you can use your fists, pistol, katana, shotgun, rifle and you can also throw stuff at them to kill them. Main story is pretty short, took me about 4 hours to complete. Even though main story is pretty short it offers you really well made story and some nice plots. In endless mode you can play in different levels and you have to kill red dudes as long as you can survive. In challenge mode you are given a mission, for example kill 2 red dudes with katana.

If you are buying into the hype, do your research.I want to want this game. I LOVED the browser version so damn much when this idea was just a demo. I made melee only challenges for my friends and I, and I think even one of the devs gave me a suggestion. I was as hyped as anyone else for this game, but unfortunately I'm not sure about putting the money down right now. At a $25 asking price, it's only a couple of hours of linear campaign, involving, for the most part, shooting down hallways or hardly complicated areas. Not that it's meant to be in-depth, but it really could have gone far. Would I have an interest in finishing, then playing through again? Perhaps, but the second playthrough would likely involve a handicap to keep it interesting.I'm also surprised it's not more fluid than the browser game; in fact, I don't know if there's much of a difference. All weapons have one lightning quick animation, then you wait to use it again. Once you finish the level and view the realtime, it looks more like you're using an aimbot and wall hacks more than being Neo from the Matrix. The only ""That's cool!"" bits from the replays were when I would purposefully do a turn or unnecessary jump to see it played back, but even then it was underwhelming.As excited as I was for this game, I ended up refunding it after 71 minutes of play. I'll watch the rest of the story, and hope that this game either gets some new content, or a map editor. It's quite a shame to see a game that had such massively positive feedback come back in as small of a package as this is. I could see myself buying it again if things improve."

On top of being short, the content that's there is so bare bones and at times frustrating (in partiuclar the nearly endless waves in the final level).The narrative is cryptic and insulting, prompting me to alt tab out of the game for spite alone. They cleverly saved a bunch of money and effort by not coloring in any textures and not putting in any music aside from the credits. Mooks are equipped with one of three guns, though the strategy for effectively dealing with them all is the same regardless. Just hide behind a corner and pick them off as they come into view.The absolute worst♥♥♥♥♥♥is when an enemy spawns through a portal and shoots you dead before he's finished rendering. Instant death from the other side of the mook spawner, bullets from a gun that aren't even visible. Sure it glows pink to warn you in general that someone's gonna spawn, but you need more precision in a game focused around one hit kills. It's impossible to be fully aware of your surroundings, so enjoy getting shot from behind. Turning around eats up time too, so when you look behind yourself enjoy being shot from what was just a second ago in front of you.This game got hyped beyond the stars when it came out. Probably related to the prenatal shill campaign embedded right before the credits. That's right, this game shamelessly goads the player into shilling for it on social media and to their friends, all under the flimsy pretense of it being tangentally related to the plot.I should have steered clear of this game, but my morbid curiosity got the better of me. Despite what the game would have the playerbase say, an fps that runs entirely in ZED time doesn't make for the most innovative shooter in years, nor do FPS games benefit from being innovative so much as being visceral and loaded with action.

No, time is very slow when you don't move.With that out of the way, superhot is absolutely awesome. I don't need to explain anything more for you to realise that this game turns you into Neo from the Matrix. Just watch somefootage on the internet!Generally all of the things you'll be doing in the game is playing, killing, dying, repeating, win, a cycle which has only previously really been applied to Hotline Miami, Super Hexagon,One Finger Death Punch; those kind of games.And to answer the questions all of you had, Yes, you respawn in a fraction of a second.I can also praise just how beautiful this game looks. It is phenominal seeing that this game is one of the prettiest looking games I've ever played, seeing it next to Big budget games withtonnes of staff working on the graphics quality alone. When you stand still, you can see just how pretty this game can look at times. It's kind of astonishing. I'd much rather look at howpretty this game is, more than the latest Call Of Duty. Truth is, video games need graphics that stand out now, especially with Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 being some of themost popular and most colourful games being played right now. You think dark green and brown graphics would've gotten old by now (Well, they have) but people still say that it lookswonderful, and ""next gen"". I'd rather look at the flying reflective red shards, shattered guns and bullets flying than fast paced flashing guns firing at enemies who drop dead in 2seconds with no skill and then scream at you in voice chat. That seems a little obvious.I do have to say though, I wish that certain entities reflected more than light, if they reflected enemies, bullets, or even me. But that's a nitpick. And nitpicks are good. Once you startnitpicking, you show that the item you're nitpicking about is good enough and has too little content to critisise more than your average item to critisise.And what else is there to really nitpick? The game looks pretty enough. But why settle for nitpicking? Surely there's a huge bloody problem in this game, a problem which I am veryangry over and wish I wasn't angry over because I could probably fix this myself over the weekend and the developers aren't going to spend 12 minutes to fix this problem? But, whatif I told you, that... THERE IS A PROBLEM LIKE THAT!Yes, believe it or not Superhot has one gaping flaw. It sucks on controller. I tried playing this with my Xbox 360 controller recently, and it was infuriating to the point of regretting anyonebuying this on console. This is one of the worst button layouts I've ever seen, by the way. It controls fine, if not perfectly on keyboard and mouse, but once you start using a controller...Oh boy.Get this, to pick things up, you press the [A]/[x] button. Kinda annoying, but fine.To shoot guns, you press the [A]/[x] button. What? Ok, that's really annoying, but whatever.To throw things, you press the [A]/[x] button.WHATTHEACTUALFAMILYFRIENDLYSWEARWORDSUBSTITUTE?!?!This means, that to throw a melee weapon, you have to be standing out of range of hitting someone with it, even if there are 2 people, both with double barrelled shotguns in your face.Which, I just want to point out; HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. To make matters worse, its a first person shooter, so you'll have one thumb on the left analog stick, and another on the rightanalog stick, and you expect most buttons to be the bumper and trigger buttons. But they're not.So to do anything, you have to awkwardly take your thumb off of the bloody right analog stick, move it up to the buttons, press them (Which by the way has around 1 second of input lag,because of course if does) press it several times because input lag, and then move it back, which will take ages so your target may have been moved, or shot you dead.Woah.I think we've all learned a valuable lesson here. That lesson being, if a game is released first on PC, and designed for PC, assume it WON'T or will have REALLY BAD controllersupport.And if it's released first on console, and designed for console, never get it on PC. I remember the Batman: Arkham Knight PC port like yesterday.I still really wanna play that.But they did patch it, so it's fixed.Continuing with the tide of negetive things, there's also a severe problem that everyone who bought this game will have. A lack of content. There's only around 20 hours of game here,if you wanna complete it, but they are adding new things! Soon! Free content patches galore, god these Devs care about us! (Except it took this game around 2 years to be developed,and this content patch coming soon around 1year and a 1/2 to even get announced. And the maps look so easy to make, just white rooms with black props, windows and red enemies.Give this game mod support already!And we've also learned a valuable lesson just now!That being, this game gets a good 7.5/10.Because it's awesome, but that controller support really sucks, and so does that lack of content. I've gotten more content out of this: [Show One Finger Death Punch]And that's really how you should describe superhot. It's awesome, but it does have flaws. Big ones. But that's just me, I didn't get much content out of the game, but I had a blast with it.If you like this style of game, you'll keep playing, it's the same things I keep saying about One Finger Death Punch, Super Hexagon, Nidhogg, Downwell and now; Superhot. Then again,that price tag is very asky. At least all the ones I just listed were all under £5."

Each time you move, your foes and their shots do, likewise – yet in the event that you stop, so will time. It's an extraordinary felt that makes a savvy, tense inquiries where, attempting to reloading and engineering a shot, you can once in a while avoid each individual slug in the shower of a burst rifle by moving one little walk - and thusly a little measure of a second.Certainly, even as you find that astonishing lesson, close moment respawns keep Superhot's pace feeling addictive, as opposed to baffling. The levels are additionally made in a way that compliments both replayability and experimentation: they're about nothing, independent battle occasions that would be a minor part of a level in various preoccupations. The reliable playback you get when you finish a level may basically be five seconds in length, however Superhot's certifiable gameplay exists in those minutes where time has ceased and you need to intentionally find your next change in light of a lifted situational awareness of what the foes around you are in all probability going to do while they can move, as well.Remarkable choices happen in those minutes: Is it worth understanding that question heave, understanding that lifting something up is the most grim move you can make, and your foe may have moved three feet to the opposite side when it lands? Something that an activity legend would need to do by intuition in a brief minute is, in Superhot, a precisely totally considered move.While the burden fabricates all through the 32 levels by acquainting conditions with less cover with hole up behind, different region communities for foes, and for the most part in a general sense more enemies equipped with shotguns and rifles instead of clubs or weapons (fundamentally like various shooters), Superhot correspondingly shows conditions that would likely be unfathomable without the capacity to direct time. One of the later levels, for instance, makes them stand unarmed in to some degree live with three prepared enemies. You're not Batman - there aren't any bolster takedown moves, so you have a couple of incredible seconds to depend confined watchful consideration, and make little strolls that let you see which enemy may raise their firearm in the first place, whether one of their shots will be inside your head in the following second, or whether the one you basically injured has recouped behind you and is set up to punch you out before you can shoot the others.None of my passings in Superhot understood of line, however - with white, plain conditions that starkly meander from shining red adversaries that pulverize when they're dead, with a sound impact that ensures you know they're incredible and gone, each bit of its visual course of action is obliged your prospering, seeing that you're demanding.Regardless, while each condition offers a one of a kind test, and each level is absolutely worth playing, there's a significantly basic nonappearance of them - Superhot just takes around four hours to complete, and never essentially develops its idea in that measure of time. Not in any manner like an astound redirection like Gateway or Twist, which reliably show new turns on their advantage mechanics, Superhot always works in light of equivalent time-halting rule, just in various conditions. It doesn't endeavor to acquaint new weapons or contacts with ace, close to an ""ownership"" style activity that you're never clearly instigated to use in light of the way that no levels are laid out around it. In its nonappearance of accumulation and brief length, Superhot feels energetic – a mind boggling basic move toward a remarkable beguilement, however not unequivocally there yet.Completing the key story will open some to an extraordinary degree focal test modes in equivalent levels, additionally an ""unending"" mode that is truly addictive stuck in an awful circumstance. Ideally we'll finally observe some leaderboards, yet they weren't accessible at the time of audit - the hard to-unravel menu is to a great degree of openings and affiliations that affect nothing, or things that aren't cleared up well.That is whether you can comprehend how to move past the story without hoping to stop, however - what begins as an incredibly gooey 90s-style designer story changes into an annoyingly soft block in the midst of the beguiling gameplay. While it utilizes its present as a bit of some creative ways - like instructing you to stop however rendering your ""esc"" get vain - it's, figuratively speaking, only freakish in its insane programming engineer frivolity, for instance, letting you know your body is unimportant, and you ought to submit to the thing. The whole experience correspondingly feels extraordinarily skewed towards the outstanding VR headsets, instead of the 2D screens it's playable on right now, recalling it's certainly not hard to envision playing these levels and encountering a bundle of the pixelated programming energized cutscenes in VR, I question it would make the story any more impactful or splendid.Superhot's smarts time-control thought goes on reliably satisfying difficulties by changing squint of-an-eye activity into intentionally considered and vigilant crucial choices. It keeps up a fundamental partition from potential one-hit passing disillusionment with lively respawns and passings that always feel earned and avoidable recollecting. Its uncommon picture of problems are supplemented by audacious however kindly high-isolate workmanship and sound outline, yet undermined by a dull, nosy story and a hesitance to put new preoccupation changing turns on its thoughts to expand their lives.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

It's the simplicity that makes SUPERHOT so fascinating. I'd even go as far to say that a more realistic art style would have obscured the core elements that make this game so great.The game is certainly not suited for people who crave for deep character development or complex interlocking mechanics.

In most of the levels, the most effective strategy is simply to back yourself into a corner so that nobody can spawn behind you, and then dodge left and right as you get shot at; this is especially effective if you can find a pillar to stand behind.

At a stand still everything is in slow motion, allowing you to plan out your approach. ""Time moves when you move"" That being said every movement and action causes time to run normally, which makes it important for you to think before going into action. While dodging pass zooming bullets you'll be given different tools to dispatch the foes that stand in your way. Some of those tools being: Fire-arms, melee weapons, and even the work-phone in your cubicle.The gameplay is great, but the game itself does not contain a lotYou're given a short, not so compelling story; with a few interesting twists. There are other side modes you can play, but sadly not enough content to keep you hooked.The gameplay is great, but with the small amount of content it contains it's not worth the high price the game is running onGet the game during a sale, where it's cheaper than it's current price."

Apparently nobody told the developers that the ""time moves as you do"" concept is nothing new. The first time I've encountered this mechanics was in 1997, in the game called ""Faery Tale Adventure II: Halls of the Dead "". If you do the math, it's been around for at least 20 years now!What p****d me off the most were all the pathetic attempts by the developers to turn it into a cultural phenomenon. In the end it tries to ""programme"" the player to ""spread the word"" in telling their friends how ""awesome"" the game was. Give me a f****n break. Honestly, that alone is insulting enough to my intelligence to give it a negative score. Now a days it's almost impossible to find an honest developer that isn't willing to sink to the deepest lows just to sell their game.In short: don't bother, unless it's on a 75% off sale. I wouldn't pay anything more than that for it. Luckily it was on sale and I bought it for 14€, which was way too much for it nevertheless. In the end, if that doesn't convince you: the game is rediculously short: I've finished it in two hours or so and as a rule of thumb in gaming: if it costs more than 2 bucks per hour, it isn't worth it.

But the entire game is designed as a twitch shooter, and without sensory cues of where enemies are like footsteps and voices due to the entire game being drowned out by a ""wind tunnel"" effect apparently caused by the slow motion, and the entire color pallet being black, white, and red you're constantly being snuck up on by people and getting killed with a single shot that grazes your shoulder. And of course, despite every other ""twitch shooter"" in existence, the game requires you to (for some reason) lead every single one of your shots and determine where your enemy is moving. This would be all well and good if you had a sniper rifle a few hundred yards away, but this is handguns and assault rifles with enemies no more than thirty to fifty feet away.So it's a twitch shooter that requires you to precisely aim shots and know where your enemies are while you're lacking one of your basic human senses. And to top it all off, the plot is only about an hour and a half long, so congratulations, if you purchased SuperHot you spent $20 for a two-hour long frustrationfest with clunky gameplay and a useless ""gimmick"" that tries to sell itself as innovative. And the plot, which I will not spoil (just watch a Lets Play or walkthrough) is INCREDIBLY pretentious, to Matrix levels, throwing out random bits of plot that just shove the message of the game right in your face, a message we've seen a million times since computers became a mainstream appliance, and the game acts like it's so smart. And the ending literally tells you to tell your friends the game is ""the most innovative shooter you've ever played."" No, I'm serious, it tells you, to your face after the ending, to try to sell the game to your friends by saying it's innovative and awesome. Don't buy this game, put the $20 towards something with ACTUAL innovation and gameplay that wasn't designed by someone trying to be artsy and ""deep."""

They even introduce a new concept in the later levels, but the last level of the game practically negates that concept. Seems a little odd.I don't mean to back-seat developer here, but I feel like they overcame the hard part of making a worthwhile game, but then didn't spend any time making worthwhile content. Yeah, everyone loved the SUPERHOT demo because it was a demo. When I played that 30 minute splice, I was excited because I thought ""What if this was in a full game?""

The overall aesthetic is quite eye catching, the minimalistic art style actually helps with the gameplay.- The weapons feel really nice and lethal, each one is unique in it's own way.- YOU CAN SLICE BULLETS IN MID AIR WITH A SWORD!- Check out the Games folder, I wont spoil it :DThe Bad- The story while interesting only took about 2 hours (it's all challenges afterwards) and it feels like there should have been more (future DLC perhaps?), the world seems to be very interesting, so I'd love to see more of it.- The hitboxes can be imprecise, there were numerous times when I was sure that the bullet would fly past, only to see it smash on an invisible wall.- The price is a bit steep. If the story was longer, I'd have no issues paying 23 euros for the game, but as it stands I am a bit disappointed.Overall I feel like the game is great, especially if you don't care about the story and just want to kill the red guys, the endless mode is great and offers a lot of neat challenges."

,Recommended,322500,22014631,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Satire is Dead,"[Encourage Memes]I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT SUPER HOT.It's an intro in TO cyberpunk. It gives players of any skill level a unique action-puzzle experience that ends up being a blend of The Matrix meets MKultra if M.K. stood for Manchurian Killer.It's better as an arcade game, and you'll unlock that mode following the completion of the short story campaign. I thought it was a tensionless, droll experience up until about the point where the story began to end, when the levels become much more difficult (when it became fun).There's a lot to get into in too many words, so here was my experience.Spoilers will not be tagged, but I'll try to avoid blatantly spelling it out.Super Hot is all about glamour and if you're a playful gamer, you'll have plenty to do. The campaign is presented very well, but I always felt three steps ahead of the cyberpunk story. It ended at about the point where I thought it should've continued on, but damn it was it ever presented in a visually exciting way. I went on to discover all the game's secrets and that's where the story started to really lose me.""You aren't actually going to reveal anything, I get it, Super Hot."" And then Super Hot's mysterious Red Voice continued on and on with its attitude. I continued to find the secrets because it did answer some of its questions, only for it to conclude with a reward for my dedication, and while I appreciate that it fits back in with the hypnosis/brainwashing angle, I felt as insulted by the game as if it asked me if I wanted to buy more energy, like a freemium game would.The ""secrets"" were ultimately unecessary, since like I said, the majority of the """"secret"""" """"""""answers"""""""" were questions that I'm confident most players solved themselves in the campaign.What a strange path the story took though. I was really into it up until the point where it was clear that the secrets were bunk, and then it got all capitalist on me and threw the punk part of the cyberpunk out the window with the coupon.Still, tho, the game's themes and presentation are intertwined, and I actually do like Killstagram because it ties back into the boldness of their compulsion to make you part of their viral marketing, and even the warez angle feeds into the viral edginess. That stuff is fantastic. Moreover, Killstagram feeds into the playfulness and how much fun you can have by learning that juggling guns and banking thrown objects off walls is the most hilarious and cool looking fun you can have. Killstagram, if you're into it, changes the way you approach the game, turning it into something more creative than clearing the mission.The story is an intro to cyberpunk and posthuman themes though, and its style and tone are its own. I just wish they excluded the ""secrets"" which ruined it pretty handily.So, yes. It's true. The game really starts after the campaign ends. This game is so much more engaging as an arcade game with rules and restrictions. The puzzle aspect really shines when the game becomes challenging, forcing you to think creatively, and even reactively...So yeah, I keep bouncing back and forth on whether or not this game is Super Hot or Over Rated because I keep thinking back to the F.E.A.R. series as one of the big games to use slo-mo in a glamorous way  but I think you'll probably enjoy the game of Super Hot, and if you didn't find it very challenging, keep playing and the intensity will increase through later modes."

,Recommended,322500,21931589,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,Misery,"Obligatory line:  This is the most innovative shooter I've played in years!There, now that I've done as the game clearly orders me to (literally), I can get to the actual review.SUPERHOT (no, I dont know why it's always capitalized, just roll with it) is basically ""Bullet Time: The Game"".  The core mechanic is that time only moves when you do.  When you're just turning your view around, it'll move kinda slowly, but when you're actually MOVING, it'll be real-time. But the instant you stop... back to time-stop.  When combined with the fact that bullets dont move at the speed they do IRL... and are slowed down just enough that even in real-time, you can follow their path (they are still very quick though), you can watch enemy shots, and dodge out of the way, just like in the Matrix!  But if that were the only mechanic this offered, it wouldnt be nearly as interesting.Needless to say, the other core mechanic is, well, the weapons.  There are only a few of these... pistol, shotgun, machinegun, katana, bat.  Not much, you say?  Believe me, it's enough.  Learning all of the properties of these weapons is key, not just for using them yourself, but for dealing with enemies.  With the game's bright, stark graphics, it's super easy to see at a glance what each enemy is carrying, and plan accordingly.  But shooting and slashing isnt your only trick.  You can also fling weapons or objects at enemies; hit them with one, and they'll be stunned, and their weapon will go flying... and you can grab it right out of the air, if you are in position.  Then let 'em have it!  Just as fun as it sounds.That's not all though:  The game's other mechanic is the HotSwitch, the ability to instantly, and from any distance, switch into the body of any enemy you can see.  Did a guy with a shotgun just fire an unavoidable wall of bullets at you?  Take him over before they hit.  The only downside is that when you take someone over, the weapon they are holding will break; but you can bypass this by smacking them with an object so they drop it, taking them over, and then grabbing the gun that'll be hanging in the air right next to you.Oh, and you can slash, or even SHOOT, enemy bullets out of the air.Combine all of these things, and, well... it cant get much more awesome than this.Be warned though:  This is NOT a story-focused game.  Oh, it has one, and it's interesting, but it's very short.  This is more of an arcade-style score-attack game, as the meat of the game's content... and there's alot of it... is in the ""endless"" mode.  Dont think this makes the game not worth the cost though, because it is.Also:  This game is HARD.  You're going to die.  A lot.  Enemies are extremely numerous, fast, aggressive, smart, and can grab weapons off of the ground. And you have to really pay attention, as they just... keep... coming.  You have to constantly check the doors for the tell-tale red glow that signifies an enemy about to spawn from one (and they can act *instantly* after they spawn, so dont think you have a safe moment while they're doing so!). But this just makes all of your awesome actions even more amazing, when you're successful against them.  But yeah, if you're after a challenge... you'll find it here.Really, I cant recommend this one enough.  An FPS that rewards careful, tactical play, yet still requires LOTS of real skill to do well in, with awesome mechanics that let you do ridiculously awesome moves, and never any true unfairness... really, it doesnt get much better than this.  I'll be playing this one alot, myself.Oh, and one more thing:  After any run, you can view, edit, and even upload a real-time replay of everything that just happened.  I honestly just never get tired of watching these."

Why?- Loading times:DEMO: Press R and your back in start as fast as in ex. Angry Birds.FULL GAME: Press R and watch annoying white/black screen few seconds and then start.How this is bad? Well, you die many times so that white/black screen get's very annouing.- Replay camera (shows your playtrough of that mission in normal time)FULL GAME: Why it need's to be all the time saying ""SUPER HOT"" so big letters that I can't even see the replay. Wtf SUPERHOT-compayny?- Time waste ""cutscenes""FULL GAME: Text conversations which just forces you to stand still just so this game would be 2 hours long to be so you can't refund it on Steam.- With only playing content from SUPER HOT developers this game potential is too small to be proud of.Yes, if Kickstarter would have reached 300k dollars they would have made mission editor but it never reached it so have fun with 26 missions and endless mode (yea....).If SUPER HOT game would've wanted to gain it's place in known famous shooters it should've added editor or mod support.

A typical sequence of events will see you decapitate an enemy with your katana, throw the katana at another enemy, catch his gun in mid air, turn around, see a bullet slowly inching towards your head, side step the bullet and shoot the next guy, throw your gun at someone else to stun them, catch their gun and kill them with it ... all in the space of about 10 seconds of ""real time"".Its almost like a turn based strategy game. When you're surrounded by multiple enemies and feeling like ""oh crap, I'm about to die"", you can slow the action right down and take a few moments to devise a plan to survive. You feel like such a powerful badass, like Neo in The Matrix (the first one, not the terrible sequels).Its just a shame that the game is really short.

Its really just a collection of around 30 short levels where your only goal is to kill all the enemies. The bulk of the game requires you to replay the same levels over and over and over again in various endless and challenge modes, chasing high scores. Having got most of the achievements in about 8 hours, I'm already feeling a lack of motivation to continue.The graphics are very stylish, the environments are all white and grey, enemies are bright red, and weapons are dark black. This also has a positive impact on the gameplay - important objects are immediately visible, which helps you make split second tactical decisions. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and I didn't encounter any bugs, but there is a noticeable lack of music. And the AI isn't particularly smart. Enemies mostly just run straight towards you, and if you find some good cover, you can totally exploit their stupidity (I have scores of 55 and 80 on a couple of endless levels).I'd definitely recommend playing Superhot, but I think its best to wait for a sale. I bought it for 40% off, which feels like a fair price. I also hope the developers will make a sequel that takes the core gameplay and expands on it with more weapons, enemy types, levels, etc"

The concept is great and at times it plays fantastic but it has so many annoyances built in with it that I can't recomend it.The audio design is just plain bad; I see it's trying to bring in a minimalist tech vibe but it is often just annoying and rarely can you determine where you are being fired upon through sound, on harder levels the horrible buzz it plays when respawning gets migrane inducing. I found a good relief for this by playing Ave Maria over the audio and basking in the blisful slow motion with memories of Hitman.The story is the blandest attempt at meta-narratives I have ever seen; this would be okay if the game played that with tounge in cheek but it feels like its constantly trying really hard and failing every step of the way. One moment tries to pull the ""oh no you can't turn off the game!"" move to which I laughed and killed it through task manager; I would have felt that was just a silly chuckle worthy moment if I didn't then have to wait through the entire self-agrandising moment again upon loading.All in all it's basically Hotline Miami without the smart desgin and usually not as fun."

It's a massive game and the only content you could argue it is lacking is a massive story mode, but the gameplay itself is compelling enough to not require it.

I completed it in about 2 hours, with messing around in the campaign (Trying dumb stuff, no slow mo, etc). While it is a pretty dark and good story (If you want to call it a story, more like a stretched plotline to a story), there really isn't much to it.After beating the story you get Challenge Mode, and Endless Mode. Challenge Mode being the single player campaign with certain restrictions or objectives to meet, Endless Mode being exactly that. endless enemies spawning in an arena. The more you play, the more arenas you unlock. It can get boring after a while but I can see myself always coming back for at least a little fun for quite some time in the future.The game itself, however, is fantastic. It even came with it's own website, where you can upload your own clips and replays. While even that may not be handling all the traffic it's been getting, not many games have that. I do wish there were more edit options, however.Time moving only when you move is a great concept. Any action, even rotating, allows things to move. You can chain together kills in a very satisfying way and put together combos that make you look like you've played shooters every day for your entire life. The game flows extremely smooth and I can't help but say the only reason it wasn't worth the 20 dollars is because the story is so short. But I'm sure more content will be added in future patches, so eventually it will be worth the 20. 15? Sure, but personally I think 10 is too low.With the popularity this has gotten in only a few days time, there is bound to be more content added (hopefully some *background music*) and eventually, I would hope, mod support. Community levels I would imagine is the minimum that will come into play.Play this game, tell people to play this game, share it with your friends.But don't talk too much about it, don't let them know what the system is about."

The base gameplay feels like nothing else I've ever played.  This is action that has all kinds of craziness to it at a pace that is slowed down a little bit more than enough to barely be able to deal with it all.  Time only moves when you do, but you're still under constant pressure and constant fire.  Throwing guns at people to take their other guns from them, dodging bullets, grabbing a telephone and whipping it at the incoming bullets to destroy that oncoming shotgun blast, switching bodies to the guy behind the machine gunner giving you trouble and punching him in the head, etc etc etc..The campaign is great, but it's just the warm-up.  Once it is completed there are Endless modes and Challenges to complete and unlock.  The first to unlock is a Katana-Only set of what you already know, but you're unable to use anything but the Katana you started with.  Switches up every strategy I had formed prior.  I found myself learning new tricks the whole way.  My friends and I have been switching off every couple runs in an attempt to unlock everything and even after 13 hours we still haven't unlocked it all yet.There's a couple minigames hiding in here, like Tree Dude, which can be fun if you're in the mood for something simple.I don't think the price is too high, and I don't think the campaign is too short (since it's really just at tutorial, sort of).

One that is solved by appropriately leading enemies and making efficient use of the items within your immediate vicinity whilst dodging bullets.You can punch or throw items to knock weapons out of enemies hands and then use them or use the ones found on the ground. I'll never understand why they left out being able to crouch or simply bend your neck.

Once again, I had to restart.The game takes place inside the EXTREMELY tired notion of being inside a computer. The setup is as such: Dude instant messages you, gets you into early access build of a game. Things are not what they seem. Between stages you must speak to him and tell him you what you think, these sections are obviously contrived but it makes you hit a bunch of keys on the keyboard anyways. Very... 'Cibele'-- 'Emily Is Away' of it. Of course with the added twist of something reminiscent of 'Pony Island'. The story is very mundane if a little disconcerting.The main issue is the game is it's not consistent. Grabbing items can be finicky and cost you too much time to get out of the way of bullet spray.  Not once did I feel as though I was triumphant for overcoming a great obstacle or challenge. I felt as though I had efficientlygamedmy way through a section to checkmark the next set ofgamingthe systems. You gain knowledge in each level if you're able to recall when enemy spawns are so as to be prepared. Throwing the weapon is often more useful than shooting it as it takes too long to ready the next shot. I just did not have fun figuring out the stages or feel I had accomplished anything. I simply felt relief when it was over.THE GISTLike I said, this is likely to be very polarizing. I think this game is unique for certain. But I cannot recommend. Maybe pick it up on sale should the premise still interest you. All that being said, it is indeed very unique but it just doesn't feel special; Far too frustrating for anyone not already very dedicated.Follow my curation page for more."

So this is a rework of a review that I did almost 2 years ago.ENJOY!Superhot is a title that at first, is unique and innovative from many other shooters.However after playing it for around 7 hours,I enjoyed the game, but there were lots of major problems with it, and through my playtime I managed to pin down 5 major problems1. Lack of contentThe game has 3 different modes, campaign, endless, and challenge.Endless and challenge are modes that are cool and fun at first, but get boring and can only keep you on for about 1 or 2 hours AT THE MOST for each mode.Campaign here is probably the main mode of the game and you should probably get it just for that.And speaking about the campaign...2. The campaign is WWAAYYYYYYYY to shortThe campaign, the main staying point of the game, took me 3 HOURS to FINISHAnd I experimented with different things and messed around a lot too!Most people if they are trying can finish this in 2 OR EVEN 1!!!!!!And the worst part about it is...3.The game gets really repetitveThis game gets WAYYY to repetitve after long amounts of time, especially near the end.And since the game is slow paced, depending if you are good or not, you will repeat levels CONSTANTLY, to where it isn't fun anymore, and you just give up TBH.4.The story here is GARBAGEWhile I don't usually care about stories in games, the story here is AWFUL. PERIOD.The game tries to be cool with different sections trying to be ""Disturbing"" Or try to have spooky moments equivelent to a creepypasta written by a 12 year old who has no idea how to make a good horror story, and thinks that sonic.exe is the spookiest thing he has ever seen.But the biggest problem with this game is.....5.The priceAfter all I have shown you, all I have talked to you about, EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING HERE.The game costs 24.99With only 3-4 hours of worthwhile content with a premise that has been done better by other games, a cookie cutter ""Spooky"" story, Repetitve Gameplay, and only three different things to play.It costs 24.99Welcome to the games industrySynopsis: Overall, Superhot is a game that has a unique and innovative concept that hasn't been done very notably in almost half a decade, and takes what could have been awesome and throws it in the trash with a huge lack of content, that content only lasting you for about 6 to 7 hours, A story that is equivelent to a creepypasta made by a 12 year old, repetitive gameplay, and a outragous price tag of almost 30 dollars, which I could use to buy shadow of mordor, game of the year edition, for 20 DOLLARS, and use that other 5 dollars to buy another great title.Overall if you are thinking about buying this game, Don't do itIf you want to buy it really bad, wait for it to go on saleOverall Score?The game costs 24.99And is really worth $ 5 dollarsIf you find it at that price and are still interested, then go right ahead.EDIT:If i have to be honest though, don't buy this game. There are much better games out there that have done this concept so much better in execution and have done it so much more justice than this game.If you want to see this game done right, buy max pagne three if you haven't yet bought it."

While it is fun at times there are a lot of things about the game that are just bland, monotonous, raw combat calculation.  You can count on gratification after trying to figure out some of the challenges but overal your in for feeling numb while stimulated.Otherwise there are many annoyances within the game:Target leading is an aggrevating learning curb you have to painstakingly discover.Discerning between a near miss and lethal hit is cause for irritating discovery of your many miscalculations as there is no way, beside your field of view, to determine your avatar's actual width.There is no: crouching, reloading, aiming down the sights, or a way to know how many shots are in a gun other than guessing the pattern which is random; just like some of the game modes where your spawn location is random.The way it spams the same audio recording of the game's name gets really obnoxious rather quick.It's not ""'super' 'hot'"" anymore it's ""'kinda' 'lame'"" and empty and boring yet I keep playing even though I'm not really enjoying myself.  It's like meeting someone online who used the best picture they've ever had of themselves, taken a few years ago when they were actually attractive, they aren't really what you'd call ♥♥♥♥able at this point but you end up going back to their place anyway because you're not about to be able to find anyone else tonight so you just go with it and you don't really enjoy the sex but it gets off anyway and you just leave in a daze slightly ashamed of yourself and really hungry.That is SUPERHOT.

Now the downside to stealing a body is that if they have a weapon, they discard it, however, if you plan your movements with the time stop, this shouldn't be a problem, throw a weapon, it hits them, they drop theres and body steal, boom, you have there body and there weapons.Now the last thing I would like to talk about is the Campaign as well as the different gamemodes. The campaign is the most amazing campaign i've ever played, the way its starts out as just a friend basically saying ""Hey dude, play this game,"" and ending with, well I won't spoil it, but its brilliant, and in completing the campaign, you get to do the different gamemodes, my favorite being the endless game mode, with maps such as Office and Warehause, in which you're put into a room and just kill hoards and hoards of the red guys, using everything to stop or in this case, delay, your inevitable death.In conclusion, Superhot, even though i've played I think at this time around 20 hours, maybe less, this is my all-time favorite game I've ever played, its a unique experience, very basic but beautiful graphics and a game full of rage quits (I've had my fair share). I would definetly recommend buying this game, or if you are still unsure, watch some YouTubers such as Nerd3 or VineSauce Joel play it and you be the judge of it :)."

,Recommended,322500,33239138,Posted: 4 July,all,daletfours,"SUPERHOT is a pretty mixed bag. It has the base for what potentially could have been a truly revolutionary first person shooter, but somehow fell short; SUPERHOT is a totally stellar idea with frustratingly underwhelming executiuon, resulting in another one of those niche indie titles that's pretty dang fun, but mindlessly so.Let's start with the good. SUPERHOT's main gimmick is that time will only move normally when you move. When you stand still, time will drop into very slow motion (but it will not stop) allowing you to plan your next move. Everything in the game, including both enemies and yourself, will die from one bullet, or from several consecutive melee attacks. Combining the concepts of time manipulation and swift, quick death, SUPERHOT straddles the line between frantic action and slow, strategic planning. This mix is largely satisfying, and the short levels combined with quick respawn times encourages experimentation and variation. Enemy AI is simple, and the game's difficulty relies more on throwing a bunch of people at you at once rather than clever tactics, but it doesn't detract from SUPERHOT as much as it would in other games. Later in the game you'll pick up the ability to switch bodies, keeping the gameplay fresh for a little while longer. At the end of every level, you can watch your replay at full speed to see what it would look like if SUPERHOT was a regular shooter and you just happened to have superhuman reflexes. The presentation is great too; with a minimalistic artstyle and a story that gets pretty meta on you multiple times over, SUPERHOT leaves you longing for more.Which becomes the game's biggest downfall. It's just too. Damn. Short. I finished the game in 115 minutes, 5 minutes short of Steam's 2 hour limit on refunds. You can play the whole game from start to finish and then get all your money back if you wanted to. And, understandably, had they just added more levels then people probably would have labeled the game as too repetitive. This is the problem with any game that revolves around one simple gimmick. You can only milk it for so long before it gets boring. SUPERHOT is as short as it is because, other than its main gimmick, the game has nothing interesting or unique to offer. Again, it's a fantastic idea...but that's all it is. SUPERHOT probably would have done better if it was labeled as a tech demo for something rather than a full blown game. Completing the game will unlock endless mode, but that doesn't stay fresh for very long. SUPERHOT is an amazing game until it isn't anymore, and then you'll move on to something else. With a playtime of less than 2 hours for the main part of the game, SUPERHOT remains (as of the time of this writing) the same price that it did when it first came out over a year ago: a steep, unfairly priced $25. What I'm about to say is something I haven't really said in any of my other reviews...SUPERHOT is pretty much objectively not worth its current price of $25.I bought this game during Steam's 2017 Summer Sale, for $14.99. That should have been the game's regular price. At full price, you are paying almost half the price of a fully fledged AAA title for a game so short you can easily burn through almost all the content in one sitting. I think that's unacceptable. I am giving SUPERHOT a positive review because its a fun game; very unique in what it offers. But I cannot stress enough thatyou should not pay full price for this game.SUPERHOT is enjoyable, but there is no way in hell that it is worth $25. Not even close."
,Recommended,322500,33218759,Posted: 4 July,all,Infamous,"This is a great game, a blast all the way through, but I don't think it's a fully realized idea quite yet. You see the 1.8 hours I have on record? That's the entire campaign all the way through. That's pretty bad for 25$, but I think the unique experience is worth it IF IT'S ON SALE! The puzzle fps is a fun concept, and the game does so much stuff really well it's hard not to have a blast going through it for the first time.The gameplay is always really fresh and exciting, the punches and headshots and throws feel so satisfying as you learn to lead enemies and have them move into it. You feel like a super hacker badass when you are just gunning and slicing right and left, and the levels are varied and complement the mechanics fantastically. Also, it isn't very linear either, there are a ton of different ways you can go about dispatching your foes, and I feel like it would be interesting to revisit the game later for another playthrough.The ""story"" or fragmented bits that are fed to you is intriguing, and while there isn't a total payoff in the end, it is fun and interesting enough to string you along for the ride. The game takes control of your menu and game at certain points, and ""glitches"" and screws up your graphics for a surreal, drug like experience (never taken drugs, it seems that way though).Overall, this game is fresh, and fun, and interesting, and I felt like if they have another few hours of gameplay with some new abilities gained along the way, this game would be way more worth it. I still recommend it, but DEFINITELY wait for a sale unless you are made of money."

It will take you back to when first person shooters were less about simulating real life combat and more about destroying the nameless opposition.The game is visually stunning with its basic black, white, and red minimalist colour scheme. The slow motion effect makes the game all that more artistically satisfying; SUPERHOT is more about the art of sniping than it is about run-and-gun chaos. Imagine a gun fight in which you can take in all the information around you before making the right move. By the end of the game, my aiming accuracy improved so dramatically that I was completing missions much more swiftly à la James Bond.I also appreciated the metanarrative where one is playing a game as one is stuck inside a game. In that sense, SUPERHOT shares something with Pony Island. The game is also replayable since beating it only unlocks more material. You'll want to beat your personal best in these new levels, which makes SUPERHOT a great game for the highscore-obsessed gamer--it reminds me of N++ that way.In short, buy this unique game; it's simple and complex, simultaneously. You'll be left repeating SUPERHOT! SUPERHOT! for hours once you start. Trust me on this..."

Wouldn't recommend paying more than 15 bucks.The gameplay obviously is brilliant. It's a puzzle game disguised as a shooter where time only moves when you do. Well actually, that isn't entirely true, it does move, just very, very slowly. What surprised me most was how incredibly challenging this game actually is. You'd think that being able to stop time and plan out every action would make every level a breeze, but the developers did a great job of making you really work for it. I didn't beat a single room on my first try.There is a bit of an attempt at some sort of plot/intrigue and its sort of interesting, but ends up being too vague to really be compelling. I would describe it as ""mildly interesting"" and nothing more. But hey, at least they tried.All in all, SuperHot feels like a very polished concept of something that could be so much bigger. I could definitely see a big triple A title being developed around the SuperHot time mechanic but with more realistic graphics and longer, more developed plot."

The best thing about this game is how badass it feels to complete a level and to then watch your replay.Quite some people seem to complain about the length of the game compared to the price. And even though I agree it should be a longer game considering the price, I don't mind at all! The replayability is definately there, especially because the developers added over ten challenge modes. These challenge modes are pretty interesting and most definately add a new challenge to the game! There also is an endless mode which is just as fun aswell. The game also has a lot of easter eggs which quite fun to discover. They are pretty rewarding aswell.I completely recommend this game, but it does have it's minor issues. The story mode is not all that interesting, and even though that wouldn't normally mind me, the fact that most of the 'cutscenes' are unskippable is very annoying. But this isn't that much of a problem, because after you finished the story mode once, you will never have any cutscenes again. And the majority of the fun I have had was after I completed the story.As for bugs, I have played this game a lot (like a LOT) and I have not been bothered with any bugs ever. Except for one bug, which is that the killstagram doesn't work (for me). The game allows you to save your replays and it is supposed to automatically upload your replay to killstagram, which is a website. But this isn't too big of a deal, because all the replays that you saved are still stored on your computer.In conclusion, the game is amazingly fun, maybe just a bit short, but that's only if you don't consider the great replayability. The unskippable cutscenes are annoying, but there aren't that many, so that's not a big deal.If you ask me, it would be a dream come true if Valve bought the game and created a SUPERHOT2, which would be just as amazing as Portal2!"

It focuses on careful planning and situational awareness rather than the modern run 'n gun trend.After you've finished a level you will get a replay (which you can save) in real time which makes you feel even more awesome.Pros:Makes you feel like a badassLet's you review your play in real timeAddictingFun mechanicsCons:Limited FOVUnpredictable hitreg (sometimes you'll be fine, other times you will die)Very limited modsWay too shortConclusion:The game is fun and unique, but unfortunately the devs left it for dead. It's incredibly limited in terms of settings and just overpriced. I wouldn't buy this game unless it was on at least a 50% sale.SUPERHOT VR:I actually got this one for free because I backed the other one. Don't know if everyone who backed it got it for free or if it's because I didn't get the ""2D"" version for free.This was played on the HTC Vive usingReVivewhich emulates the Oculus Rift (and Touch) so that you can play Oculus exclusive games on the Vive.SUPERHOT VR surprised me with the quality. The price is 25€ and it's not available on Steam yet (they are working on a Vive version, no ETA yet) so they didn't go too crazy on the pricing (VR games have a tendency to be incredibly expensive for the quality, limited audience and all), that being said it's still a bit pricy given the content offered.The VR version is a lot more polished than the 2D version. The controls are really buggy where the grip sometimes isn't registered and you drop an item too soon, but that might be a bug with ReVive since the game isn't designed for the Vive controllers. Other than that it's very stable.Pros:ImmersiveGreat teleportation systemAddictingBetter than the original in every wayCons:Way too shortPricyOculus exclusive (can get around with ReVive, wouldn't buy it either way)No moddingConclusion:This is the way SUPERHOT was meant to be played. Right there in the game (which is a game in a game, oh right there's a story in this as well) with full control of your movement. It's not as ""free"" as the 2D version was since VR is still in the awkward movement system where you pretty much have to use teleportation to keep the immersion, but SUPERHOT VR does this really well by having each level have small sections. The teleportation isn't as instant as most other VR games, instead it will fade the world in and out in a pace taht doesn't screw with your mind. You don't get sick from it and you still have enough room to walk around a bit (depending on your setup of course)."

As the conversation in the game said, you can easliy indulge yourself in it for hours. To be precise, its fast pace and obvious objections are real time killers which would bewitch you for some time. I played it until the forced exit plot..........didn't expected that coming but i guess it did so for the atmosphere thatyou were being controled by the game rather than contorled the game.Of course this game is not immaculate, you got a prretty small arsenal to choose form and all you can do in the game is moving, jumping and shooting. However, this game is not some big blockbuster but a novelty for casual gamers or some of the hardcore gamers who feel a little bored by today's highly homogenous FPS shooters. As for me, I like this game and I will recommend it to my friends. And finally, best wishes to the developers who made this game!"

Just 3 varieties - shotgun, assault rifle and pistol which all compliment each others strengths and weaknesses and are as different as primary colours themselves.To summarise? I can't think of any other game I've EVER played (and I'm an old git of 43) where getting 1 or 2 kills in a round is just as satisfying as getting over 100 and, to be honest, I can't think of a better compliment for the moment to moment gameplay than that.Slinky"

I do know that 30 minutes into the game, I can feel that tell that the game is set up against you.You can only implement trial and error if you can figure out where and when enemies will spawn.  However, it's completely random except for the initial spawns, then it's a crap shoot.  I shoot and kill a guy, turn around because I know there's one coming from the other direction and I'm suddenly shot in the back.  How is that fair?It's trial and error without the trial, it's just error.  Too much luck is needed to complete levels.Not to mention, the action to pick up weapons is a pain because you have to be like inches away from it to pick it up, but if it's at your feet, you need to back up to pick it up, meanwhile you're dead.Then there's the level restart function that apparently starts the level before you can even see anything so if you push ANYTHING while the static is still going and the level requires immediate action or you die, you die because the level decided to go before you have a chance.I like the idea, but some of the execution is flawed.

The extended hours of fun come from completing the challenge levels (katana-only, fists-only, fullstop, real-time, etc.) and going for speed records (speed run challenges). You will often find games like this in the following categories: shumps/shooting games, so-called rogue likes, and indie platformers. As an aside, I saw similar negative reviews for ""House of the Dying Sun,"" a tactics/space FPS game, criticizing the length, but neglecting the challenges.SUPERHOT is graphically simple, which helps to make important things pop out (enemies, bullets, and weapons), but is stylish enough to be interesting to look at.Sound is slowed down with time, which provides an indicator of enemies and bullets outside of your view. The glass shattering sounds are fairly satisfying as well.Overall, I enjoy this simple yet challenging game."

To be honest, I wouldn't have minded if the entire game was just a series of stereotypical shootout situations (IT WAS A SETUP).

Convinced I would not enjoy playing challenge modes enough to justify the cost, I held off for a couple weeks. However, my desire to actually play with the mechanics that had peaked my interest in the first place won out and I found myself emptying my Steam wallet.Contrary to my presumptions, I thoroughly enjoy the various modes this game has to offer, with plans on playing them periodically till the day I feel the icy grip of Death around me. Where the real payoff lain, though, was in the compaign, brief as it is. While I unabashedly indulge in AAA titles, I found myself more fulfilled by the one or two hours it took to complete the story mode of SUPERHOT, due to its uniqueness, and felt I had gotten my money's worth.If one enjoys classic sci-fi stories that breach the fringe of reality and implicitly ask philosophical questions, then this game is worth your time for the story alone.

It tries too hard to be clever and deconstructive, like many other games before it has successfully pulled off (The Stanley Parable, Hotline Miami, Undertale). There's some interesting meta-commentary there, but the writing fails to draw you in and instead comes across as annoying and pretentious. There's a great game hiding here, but the story completely ruins the flow of the game.Might be worth picking up on a sale for the gameplay alone, it is a novel concept and it does feature an endless mode which won't suffer from the story."

I quickly got to a point where I stopped thinking how cool the concept was and started using the time and movement mechanics to pull off moves that were satisfying and surprising as I did them.Some people might dismiss the stuff found inside the OS/Menu as irrelevant or super sidelined, but I thought there was a lot there that was strange and warm and human in a very appealing way, so I got a huge kick out of that stuff, as well as the violent bits.The game definitely has a surface that is short, and could leave somebody wanting more. There is a whole lot of stuff underneath though, if you are the type of person who likes to scratch deeper. Immediately after beating the final stage of the main game I played some more of the extra stuff, and I definitely plan on going back in and giving a lot more time to this game. If you are the type of person who doesn't tend to care about that stuff and would rather finish a main story and then drop a game, you might come away from SUPERHOT disappointed.I 100% did not, though.

,Not Recommended,322500,33388790,Posted: 8 July,all,Naxza,"Two hours worth of content- if that- to be told ""hey, get your friends to buy this game,"" an endless mode (that you've probably exhausted in twenty minutes trying to exert the illusion of choice on the final level), the ability to replay levels (prolly take you half the time to do this time around) and some challenge mode.Don't get me wrong, the game is neat. The aesthetic is nice, gameplay handles well, replays look cool when done right. But every level is about the size of a small apartment unit, there's maybe only four ways to handle any conflict, the plot's kind of spastic (and a little abusive), and any sense of closure you get is actually, and I kid you not, literally telling you to tell your friends to buy the game.I was perhaps a little harsh in my first assessment, though- Levels are fun enough to repeat a few times, there's a few secret this-and-thats to find and/or unlock, the extra widgets outside of the main game itself are marginally neat if you're not expecting anything, yadda yadda. You can milk the two hours of content pretty far if you're a completionist or achievement hunter.I'd say buy it for ten bucks max, but I don't think SuperHOT's ever gone on sale that far. I don't think there's any promises for extra content or a level editor at this rate anyways. It's worth a romp if money's no object, I suppose. But not like this."

I have only had time to try out the first few levels which are pretty much tutorials, but holy crap is it awesome. There are lots of FPS puzzle games, but not like this. There isn't a puzzle in the level that you solve to move forward, the whole level is a puzzle and you're one of the pieces, so are all of the bullets and mobs. The time mechanic is great, it reminds me of an old game I used to play as a kid called ""Robots"" on Linux. You had a level which was a grid, nothing moves until you do, and the object of the game was to use the level to destroy the robots, as every time you move, they close in on you. SUPERHOT's a bit different as the mobs are closing in, but they are shooting at you which means that you have to dodge them, their bullets, and compesnate your aim so that your bullets find their mark too (since the mobs will try to dodge them). Obviously there's also the major difference of SUPERHOT being an FPS as well as having an awesome even if simple art style. An excellent job all around on this one!The menu system and interaction is great too. When I saw the retro terminal interface I was immediately transported back to my early childhood where the command line was your only interface to the system.Great job SUPERHOT Team!"

SUPERHOT is not for those who are looking forward to an adventurous storyline, since there isn't much. But if you are dying for a fresh new take on the fps genre, then SUPERHOT well worth the price.

I'm not even going to complain about the pricing, frankly the game is not fleshed out enough to justify a purchase at all. Even on a sale. You'll play the single player, maybe dabble in some of the challenge or endless modes and then you'll realize you won't really want to play it anymore.If you're really interested, buy it, play it for under 2 hours and return. It's definitely worth trying but don't let the cheap meta story hook you into playing past the return time limit. There's a vague, tacked on narrative here that really feels like it's in place to take advantage of your curiousity so that you'll think there's something worth playing towards but there really isn't. Nothing satisfying at least and by that point it'll probably be past the point of steam returns, so don't fall for that trap.There's likely some community based ARG that helps unveil ""THE TRUE STORY"" but I don't know. I guess if you're into that then this is for you. To me it just seems like they're deceiving customers into being okay with any kind of quality gameplay running dry after only a couple hours.Tl;drIt's original, so it'll feel fun at first, but you'll very quickly realize it's shallow and boring."

You'll be restarting levels a lot, and restarting takes enough time not just to be annoying, but to disrupt the rhythm of trial and error evinced so well in, say, Hotline Miami.Come to think of it, just use your money to buy Hotline Miami.

There is nothing more satifiying than watching all the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥you did during a level in real time and getting to easily save and upload it to view over and over again. The improvements to the game with the Throwable weaponry and varied weapons add more depth to the game and once the Switch Mechanic comes into play you can do some very clever stuff.The challenges range from enjoyable nostalgia romps to frantic perfection to pure agonising frustration and give a nice depth of post game. The endless modes can be a barrel of fun to just casually slaughter everything and overall all the little details really make the game stand out. On top of that the fact that you can give friends discount codes for the game when you beat it is a very nice touchPersonally I think that maybe £17.99 is a bit of a steep asking price and the main story being a bit short is a shame but if you have enough money to consider it I'd honestly say it's worth the experience.

If this game had depth and varied gameplay, then the challenge and endless modes could keep one motivated for a longer time, but honestly the game isn't much fun in my opinion. ""The most innovative shooter I've played in years"" is a clever marketing gag at best, but it definitly isn't what this game is. The gameplay idea is neat, but nothing amazing and considering the demo version of this game and the time between that and the final release, not much has happened since then.I expected this game to have a very fluid combat system, where the player gets into a flow and rythm and feels cool and badass, but in reality the gameplay just drags on and feels clonky. To play optimally, you have to stop and move very small distances all the time, it is not easy to describe for me, but it feels like playing a racing simulator with the keyboard.It doesn't help that the animations look and feel clonky too and are of bad quality.That is even more apparent when the game shows you your completed mission at normal speed, where you can clearly see the poor animation quality, which results in poor player feedback and controls that feel unresponsive. The game has a cool artstyle and there are moments which are spectacular, but even the death animation of the enemies gets old really fast, partly because I think they aren't actually physics based, but pre-made animations, so they look the same all the time, but maybe that's just me.It is not that fun to shoot the weapons, it is definitly not fun to use melee weapons or throwables. Another factor for that is the TERRIBLE sound design. Weapons and melee weapons sound terrible, especially the sound when you punch an enemy is just weird. All these factors hurt the flow and rythm of the game, which makes it not very enjoyable for me. Yes, I could play in a way where I have more ""flow"", but then I'm intentionally playing worse to make the game more fun to play, which is stupid.I don't know what the developers could do to improve the problems I have, except having more budget and time, and higher production value, but after completing the game I lost all motivation to do anything further. The story was interesting, but doesn't gave me anything, it was just an excuse for playing random levels. And again, that would be okay, if the gameplay wasn't so dull and unresponsive."

It's more of puzzle game than a FPS though because you need to have patience to plan your movements. If you rush in, you will likely die. When you stop moving, time nearly haults as well. You can use this time manipulation to dodge bullets, narrowly avoiding death as you destroy all of the enemies in each level. Throw weapons or various objects to block bullets and disarm your enemies, hot switch to change places with one of your enemies, leaving them to die instead of you.Pros:interesting and intriguing story (it took me about 3.5 hours for the main story)awesome, fun, and unique gameplaylots of content after the main story (different challenges, time trials, endless modes)easy to upload and share your replays to Superhot'skillstagram.comright in the gameCons:not a whole lot of menu options (lacks fullscreen windows, controls)SUPER HOT repeating voice gets annoying after each levelConclusion:Overall, the story was well done, and the gameplay was very enjoyable. This game has a lot to offer, and you can pull off some really crazy plays. If you enjoy challenge modes, timed modes, and/or endless modes, this game is certainly worth the full price. However, if you intend to play ONLY the main story, I suggest waiting for a sale.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

I don't want to spoil anything, but it is pretty scary when you play it a little. My personal favorite is that you can cut bullets using a katana. This game is pretty hard so you might have to play a few levels again and again. Overall i'd say that this game is worth my 78 yuan (i live in china).

Because the first person perspective prevents you from being able to get a good look at your surroundings, this is more or less how the game goes. You have to die again and again to figure out the puzzle. The wait time between deaths isn't terribly long, but to me it was just long enough to be annoying.I love the concept, but I find the way it's executed here to be more annoying than fun.

The game runs incredibly smoothly, and it is extremely staisfying to hear the glass breaking sound and seeing the red enemies break into tens of pieces. The game is also able to run quite well on lower end laptops (Macbook Pro 13 inch mid 2014 with no graphics card) however, for the best experience I suggest a proper PC.The idea of the game is why most people are going to be interested in it, if you dont move time doesnt move. Simple, right? At the start you can run around the map like in any other shooter just for the bants, but as you go further on the game becomes more challenging, and you begin to need more concentration. The maps also vary nicely as there are some on trains, subways and offices.The story was very interesting in my opinion. [SPOILERS AHEAD ----- YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED _ If you dont want spoilers on the story skip down to where it says ending of spoilers]. Your friend invites you to play a game, you play the game, the game tries to get you to not play the game, the game takes over your life, the game destroys your friendship, and in the end the game tells you that you are worthless and has you kill yourself. Now I know that that is very basic, but I dont want to ruin the whole story.In addition to this rather simple story, I believe that it has a deeper meaning. By attempting to kill the in-game you the red enemies were attemptint to protect you from having the game control your mind, through telling you that your body is holding you back. So are the red men your enemies in the game, or are you your own enemy. Its up to you to decide this, but I found this an interesting perspective to look at the game.[SPOILERS END HERE][SPOILERS END HERE][SPOILERS END HERE][SPOILERS END HERE]Overall, SUPERHOT is a fantastic first person shooter, with a unique idea and a plot that leaves you thinking. I would defineatly recomennd this game to anyone who plays on Steam, and would say that its almost a must play game.The only reason this game doesnt receive a 10/10 is because the price is simply too high. I finished the game in three hours and I took my time with it, returning to a few levels to retry different ways to beat the level.If the game is on sale, everyone should defineatly atleast try it.:)"

It's just not a $25 game. Seing as the campaign shouldn't be conisidered the main aspect, really the only other things that are left are endless and challenges. The main reason I say the game isn't worth it is because it's too much of an arcade game. The rounds just seem way too repetativeto me... The challenges were quite entertaining and started to change my opinion towards the positive side of things. However, the whole game just feels too short.In ConclusionIf $25 means nothing to you go ahead, buy it. But I strongly suggest waiting for a sale in the future if you don't want to feel like you wasted your money a little bit.PSThis game runs very well. My crappy ""PC"" can get decent frames most of the time."

Blending an FPS and puzzle game together so well in this amazing Matrix like style. Unfortunatly, the price is quite steep, and the story is only about two hours long. One thing that helps with that last mark is you can unlock modes where you play the game with preset modifiers. While this might not sound fun, it is very fun and adds many more hours to it. Plus there is an endless mode, which also helps keep things interesting a bit longer. All and all, get it on sale because of the price, but it really is a great game."

(About 40 minutes each) So in conclusion i would say that it it not worth what it is, and i believe they should lower the price or even extend the playtime by implementing custom levels or a second storyline."

You should check this game out, it is the most innovative shooter I have played in years....Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's get real here.Getting the elephant in the room out of the way here: Yes, SUPERHOT is a short game. I completed the campaign mode in about 2 hours. For a game that is regularly $25 (I picked it up when it was on sale for $20), I can see that being a hard sale. If you are the type who wants to get some playtime out of their buck, then your enjoyment of this game will heavily rely some post-game stuff, namely Endless mode and Challenges. If neither of those sound like your cup of tea, then you may want to wait for SUPERHOT to drop in price a bit more.That out of the way, I had a lot of fun with SUPERHOT. The ""time moves when you do"" mechanic works great. With that giving you the time you need to plan moves, this game does a great job of making you feel like a complete badass. Shooting one guy, throwing your gun into another dude so he drops his gun, grabbing that gun out of mid-air and blasting him with it never gets old. I enjoyed the graphics, and the enemy models shatter in an extremely satisfying fashion. Around the game-play is an weird little story layer. Dare I say it...it feels somewhat ""artsy"". But unlike most games that fall into that category, SUPERHOT gets that the weird story stuff is there to spice up solid game-play.All told, I give a thumbs up to SUPERHOT. I can see myself coming back to it every now and then to screw around in the Endless modes and whatnot, so I figure sooner or later I'll get my money's worth out of it."

They couldn't even patch in rebinding the controls... (not that it is that important (wasd,e and space), but it is standard and not that difficult to implement). They should have added more levels by now, instead they just recycled all existing maps for challenges and made a handful of new (I think) for endless mode. I don't see that creating more content would be that time consuming. The levels are small anyway and randomly placed into the story most of the time and the difficulty is defined by the positioning and equipment of the enemies. They could have easily added more weapons or enemy types and even a co op mode or a level editor would be possible, just some more features to justify the price...Edit: So now I got a Rift and should buy the game again for VR mode!?

,Not Recommended,322500,23422078,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,Pungent Raindeer King,"I'll open the review by stating plainly: I quite enjoyed my time with this game (though got bored with it after about 17 hours, YMMV). I am giving the game a ""not recommended"" rating specifically because the developer has chosen to make the VR version of the game Oculus exclusive. Hardware exclusivity of the sort console gamers have long since accepted as ""normal"" is NOT ok. It does NOT belong on PC. And I will NOT be supporting this game, any offshoots of it, or the developer unless they change their policy. It's extremely disappointing to see a promising and yes, quite innovative, indie developer take such a consumer-unfriendly route.That said, I should try to give at least a passing review of the game. SUPERHOT is the most innovative shooter I've played in years (truly). The ""story"" or ""campaign"" is odd, and quite short - the real meat of the game lies in the challenge modes. As you probably know if you're reading this review, the central conceit of this game is that time only moves when you move. That's mostly true - time moves at a crawl when you're not moving. As a gameplay gimmick it works quite well. Using the slomo mechanic, you can chain together improbably amazing feats such as throwing a cup at a dude to disarm him, punching a gun out of another dude's hand, grabbing that gun out of midair to shoot the first guy, then dodging three shotgun blasts from another guy so you can grab the katana from the wall (where you threw it a earlier) to cut him in half. Gameplay is really solid and a lot of fun, is what I'm saying.Aesthetically, the game knows what its trying to do and achieves it. The art style is more about making information easily visible and creating a cool-looking world than maximizing visual fidelity, but it works. Look at the screenshots or gameplay video if you want to know more about the art style. I dig it, personally.Performance-wise, I'm somewhat mixed. I run a GTX 760, which is a bit old but should still have zero problems maintaining 60 fps on a game with graphics such as these. Most of the time, that is the case - unless I'm using more than one monitor. For some reason, even though only one of my monitors (the one I'm running the game on) is even plugged into the graphics card, I get very low FPS and stutter whenever I try to play the game with secondary monitors enabled. This doesn't happen often, but I have noticed it in other games such as Enter the Gungeon. In any case, just know that you could run into that problem. Game seems to run fine (for me at least) if I stay in single monitor configuration.All that said - I'd encourage you to look elsewhere for your purchasing decisions as this developer has shown themselves to be more concerned with making a quick buck than doing what is right for consumers. Hardware exclusivity does not belong on the PC platform. Period. I won't lie, it's a good game - but I'd encourage you to not support these kinds of practices. I'll edit this part out if the dev changes their policy on exclusivity, of course."

The claustraphobic stages don't let you use your bullet dodging potential, and it seems often you're just stuck hoping the bullets spread a certain way.It's a trial and error puzzle game.

,Recommended,322500,21504120,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,TheManko,"Superhot is a nicely polished game, with a cool concept, and striking visual style. But it’s worse than I thought it would be.I don’t have anything against shorter games, but in the case of Superhot there needed to be more to it. Not in the sense of “providing more value for money”, rather it’s because it didn’t fully exploit the mechanics it had on hand. For example, one hour into the game you’re introduced to a new cool mechanic that has a huge impact on how you play the game. For the next few levels you learn how to use it. But then before the potential of the mechanic has been exhausted, you hit the end of the game. The result is a feeling of “wait, that’s it?”.There are also other details that I feel were a mistake. Enemies don’t make any sound, which resulted in them shooting me in the back or the side without warning. You could see this as part of the challenge, but to me this felt like a detriment, as many deaths felt unfair, like they were out of my control. With better situational awareness the deaths would’ve felt like they were in my responsibility, and not random chance, or malicious level design screwing me over. In something like Hotline Miami the top down perspective gave you enough sense of control that the 100 retries on any level felt alright, because you blamed yourself and not the game. It’s the same for Serious Sam, where you gain a remarkable 360 view of the combat arenas thanks to how every enemy is constantly emitting sound. Superhot is too stripped down in this regard, so you have to go through a trial and error cycle to learn where enemies are. This diminishes the sense of skill involved, and is a contributing factor to why I didn’t have as much fun as I expect from the genre.As a result, my recommendation is lukewarm. It’s not bad, but it isn’t enough. I saw other reviews describe it as “short but sweet”. I don’t agree. It’s “short but eh it’s alright, you should probably play something else”."

The campaign is also only around an hour to an hour and a half in length, which doesn't matter that much in the grand scheme of things since the core of the game is endless mode and the challenges.Overall, it's a solid game.

The controls are very responsive and all the mechanics work as intended. You will easily spend a few hours being sucked into it.That said though the story mode is incredibly short only being 2-3 hours in length, a shame really when you consider the $25 price tag. Another gripe I have is the lack of weapons. There's only a pistol, shotgun, and an assault rifle for the guns, while melee consists of just a katana, baseball bat, and a lead pipe.Nonetheless, it was very well made game that kept me entertained from beginning to the end and there was hardly a dull moment.

And once you make it through the campaign, many challenges will be unlocked that turn the levels from the campaign on their head.**The story would have been much more... well I don't wan't to spoil anything, but I wish I would have played through on a VR headseat... the story would have sent chills down my spine if I had.**"

SUPER HOT! ❗🔥SUPER HOT! ❗🔥SUPER HOT! ❗ᵗʳᵉᵉ🎄ᵈᵘᵈᵉ🔥SUPER HOT! ❗🔥 ❗❗❗❗🔥🔥🔥❗❗🔥👍🔫💥🎮🎄🎮 🎮 ☠✔✔ ✔✔ innovativeUPDATE: So Superhot has some problemsProblem 1: In the latest patch they changed the movement speed to what feels almost 2x as fast as it used to be. This makes basic movement and dodging much more difficult and way less satisfying in general. Enemies can now move much more within even a brief key tap. This can be somewhat avoided by using a controller (since you can push the thumbstick forward a tiny amount to move slowly.Problem 2: What's even worse is that it feels like they increased the time that passes when you turn. In the old version you could do a quick 360 to get some situational awareness and plan your next move, even while being attacked. Now turning even 90 degrees is enough time for a guy to shoot you from halfway across the map it seems. Suspect a guy is behind you? Turning around is enough time for him to kill you, and ignoring him means he will kill you. Tough luck.The combination of these two changes (mistakes, honestly) ruins the flow of the game. It's more difficult, and while difficult does not = bad it also makes the game less fun, which IS bad. It feels like the only way to get a high score in the endless mode anymore is to hunker down somewhere where the enemies can only come at you from one direction and can't see you until they are close. That's right, they turned a game about acrobatics, style, strategy, and movement into a game about ...camping. Superhot was supposed to be DIFFERENT from normal shooters, and now it just feels more like them, and not in a good way.Let me show you what I mean:This first clip was captured by me before the changeshttps://killstagram.com/s/QuixoticSociableRazzmatazzIguanaThis second clip was also captured by me, on the exact same level, after the changeshttps://killstagram.com/s/OnlyCaringFernHorseSee the difference? Running around like in the first clip just isn't possible anymore, or is at least much more difficult to pull off. The amount of time it takes to do anything now, even simply looking around to understand what you're dealing with, is too much time.Now, I'm not gonna lie: That second clip was still pretty fun.And that's the thing. After all this, I still can't dislike this game. The 12+ hours I put into it before this patch got me more than my money's worth, and other than these two changes the game is unchanged.But it isn't as fun as it used to be.At the moment, I still recommend the game. The idea is fresh, the art fits perfectly, the story is great, the map designs are varied, the challenge modes change the game in neat ways, and the endless mode is a fun way to casually game while listening to a podcast. If you're a new player you probably won't even have any problems with the new changes since you don't know what it was like before.But for me, THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS was the old Superhot, not this new one, and I hope they change it back.Edit: Additonal pre-patch footage of mine, again on the same level:https://killstagram.com/s/NeighboringExhaustedDeerKoalaUPDATE UPDATE: Most recent patch seems to have fixed the problems, game is great again. Hopefully it stays that way. I'm excited to see how the game will change in the future. Again- disregard what I said above, those problems no longer exist."

I definitely will play both because of how much I like the game. I think a really good game comparison to the style of this game is Hotline Miami, with fast paced (although time is slowed) levels that you memorize until you complete them.Also, you can get this game for just under $20 by having a friend give you a coupon.

Where other vehicle-obsessed devs seem to take player motivation for granted, Czech studio SCS understand that a pleasingly modelled steed needs a pleasingly modelled environment to shine.On this occasion that environment is a swathe of Europe stretching from Plymouth in the west to Wroclaw in the east, from Aberdeen in the north to Milan in the South. The tangle of motorways and major roads is stylised and condensed, but feels massive. After a splendid week of non-stop trucking the stats screen tells me I've still only seen 50% of it.There's satisfaction in exploring new routes, seeing new golden been-there-done-that squiggles appearing on the in-game map, but it tends to be the promise of cold, hard cash that gets you out of bed in the morning. Like Farming Simulator, ETS2 has a simple yet resonant economic sandbox at its centre.You start as a low-skilled, truckless lorry jockey, forced to take work from established haulage companies. Slowly (or rapidly if you go to a bank) you amass the funds to buy your first rig and rent your first yard. Then the fun really begins. Contract perusing, truck pimping, skill upgrading, driver hiring... this is Eddie Stobart: The Game in all but name.Spending 90 minutes ferrying a tank of propane from Sheffield to Prague could (should?) be tedious. The fact that it isn't is largely down to good-if-not-quite-OMSI-standard physics, and varied road layouts and scenery. Periods of smooth, almost soporific motorway motoring nestle between passages of edgier wheelwork. One minute you're cruising along contemplating the sunset over the central reservation, the next you're on a rain-lashed country road at night, waiting for the right moment to pass a painfully slow pantechnicon. Tiredness can't kill in ETS2, but it can leave you jack-knifed in a ditch, feeling awful with a substantial repair bill to pay.The only time when the game itself loses concentration is when attempting to evoke certain regions and sounds. The further you get from central Europe the less convincing the landscapes become. No one seems to have told SCS's countryside crafters that rural Britain features long green things called hedges. Cities are often depicted with the shortest of visual shorthand – a few warehouses, the odd landmark if you're lucky. Don't expect to see a favourite local roundabout, slip-road, or speed camera in this highly-recommended HGV-driver RPG."

With, at a push, 2 hours of story mode with no real characters it is a lacklustre excuse for any real edgy grit however the gameplay is marvellous and almost erotic. The breaking of the fourth wall, the basis of the ""story"", gets pretty tedious pretty quick however the story is supplemented by challenges and so-called endless levels, which in fact end when you die.Gameplay makes this game completely, would recommend if you're looking for something casual but the lack of story is unacceptable at the price it is marketed.

I'm not one to write reviews (I believe this is my first), but I do feel somewhat ripped off. I read the favorable RPS review and was impressed that its only a few hundred MB. Despite that, loading times aren't great. That's a big reason I go for indie titles above big studio releases.My biggeest gripe is that this game seems to take itself and its aesthetic way too seriously. A simple menu that doesn't flash static with every transition would be just fine, I don't need THAT much immersion. (I think playing this game on a VR headset would give me brain damage.)The principal mechanic--time moves when you move--actually diminishes the FPS tactics of cover and ambush, since you're rewarded for dodging bullets and your ""plan"" is really just weaving through slow-motion projectiles. I got bored with that after a few levels, and don't foresee any desire to pick it up again. If the interface were a bit more standardized, where I could mess around a bit on each level, I think it might be a fine diversion, but I can't be bothered to wade through the arcane interface to find a playstyle that suits me, instead of playing the shooter on rails that bored me so quickly. All flash and no camera."

The claim here, however, is false. When one here decides they wish to stop in the face bullets, these bullets continue to move. Men with guns will continue to aim, and brutes oozing to bruise will still turning around after you've decided to jump over them, but very very slowly. So it is then needed to predict not only where everything will end up once time flows normally, but also weither these minor changes will affect your next action.This is inline with the biggest part of the game, which is mental eyeballing of distances of bullets relative to your exterior. An exterior that you don't know the limits of, however. There's no way to judge your own hitbox, other than the idea that if it's not under you or towards the center of your view then you're probably safe, but this is not always the case. This might not seem important, I mean most FPS don't have or need full body awareness, but this game is about Spacial Awareness and I am not aware of my own space. Not to mention most other games I can tank a bullet.One hit kill games need to stop, just saying. Being a slow time badass isn't that fun when in psuedo-stopped time that's a bullet in your face with nothing you can do about it and the grim reapear laughing in your♥♥♥♥♥The deceivingly simple and pretty graphics of the game are amazing, although due to preformance issues I have must feel that something is very taxing in this area. Lastly, the worst thing, and the most deal breaking problem with the entire game is the sound design. There is no music. Straight up, nothing. With some sort of system that either had a time slowed to time not slowed fade in, or a song that sounded good but sped up and slow, this would've been godly. Sadly though without music at times everything feels same-ish and rather tedious as the game occupies only one sense.Pros:-Unique-Pretty-Feel like a badassCons:-Preformance Issues-Short af-No music-Not actual stopped timeIs it worth 25 dollars, no, not at all.

And when it does it's job at making you feel cool it does it REALLY WELL.However, the game doesn't support it's instant death very well in terms of giving you enough information. Turning around to check your surroundings for people causes time to speed up and likely kill you in later levels where there's around 5 people attacking you at once, and there's no indicators other than where you're looking as to where enemies are going to be.Now dying isn't usually a problem in that many video games, but SUPERHOT is not your average video game, SUPERHOT thrives off of having flowing gameplay, and anything whatsoever breaking that flow turns it's incredibly fun gameplay into a quick slog of a game that you just want to get to the next level and really hate restarting over and over.One of the biggest problems is the assault rifle in the game. The Assault Rifle allows enemies to turn the game into a bullet hell that must be carefully navigated, instead of the early games ""do what you think is coolest"" gameplay the massive amounts of bullets makes you walk on eggshells trying not to be cool, but to just survive.In short: SUPERHOT turns from a game about being cool, into a game about being pixel perfect just to avoid dying, you will die over and over again trying to figure out just what the hell you are supposed to be doing and it stops being fun."

,Not Recommended,322500,21577031,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,𝓹𝓲𝔃𝔃𝓪𝓹𝓪𝓽,"Superhot is very unique and offers some fun moments, but it's far from a complete game. The story is 2 hours long, and frankly, very boring. I shrugged that off thinking it wouldn't matter much because the combat mechanics are interesting (time stands still when you're not moving, cool right!?), but sadly, the gameplay started to spread thin after a few levels.I guess this fits the plot of the Superhot, since the protasgonist is supposed to be playing a VR game that a friend hacked into before it even hit the alpha phase of development.Here's a short list of my gripes:1) The AI is terrible. The majority of the levels have ""waves"" of enemies, so you'll start a level, clear the room, and wait for another wave or two of enemies to appear. I imagine they implemented this because the level designs are tiny and there isn't really a whole lot of room for a significant amount of enemies to patrol. The only thing indicating that a wave of enemies is approaching is a red glow that appears on doors and doorways. Most of the time you won't notice the red glow, so you're going to die a lot, and only progress through trial and error. This gets very tiring after a while.Enemies either stand still and take a position to shoot at you from afar, or they enter a ""chase mode"" where they run after you, turn corners willy nilly, and find you and shoot you point blank if you're behind cover. After a while you'll learn to expect the AI to do this, and your playstyle will adapt accordingly. This causes the gameplay to stagnate and become incredibly predictable.2) The half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥implementation of a story is terrible, but this is just my creative opinion. If you played this game and the story didn't come off as something a 9th grader wrote in a creative fiction class, then lucky you. I happen to think it completely ruins the aesthetic of Superhot.3) There is no real progression. You unlock the ability to switch into enemies' bodies toward the end of the game, but you'll only use it 5-10 times before the story ends. That's it. You're going to beat every level in the same fashion you did with the last.4) There is no replayabiity. It could benefit from a level timer, level scores and objectives, and a general high score counter. At least with those types of mechanics, players have a reason to return to levels and take different routes.Conclusion:Superhot is cool but it's not worth the price tage of $20+The hype is riding on ONE gimmick: Time stands still when you stand still. It's a really ♥♥♥♥ing cool premise, but it's not very fun if it's implemented in an incomplete game. I personally think each and every one of us is entitled to ask for more from the devs. We don't deserve to have♥♥♥♥♥♥like this released for $20+, get insanely good reviews on reputable review boards, and then turn out to be a load of half-assery once you finally give it a play. I never thought I'd jump on this bandwagon, but I truly believe games these days are theld at lower standards. This should change.."

,Not Recommended,322500,21518901,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,Constable Poppycock,"I really wanted to like this game. The aesthetic looked really cool and the gameplay I saw looked awesome.Honestly though, it's really underwhelming. I finished the story in like 2 hours, maybe less. It's very, very pretentious. I'll explain at the bottom if you care about spoilers in a 2-hour game.The gameplay is alright, I guess. It gets very tedious, and it's often difficult to determine which bullets will actually hit you and which will not. I do somewhat enjoy the bullet travel time and having to calculate what you're going to hit, but some might dislike that.My biggest gripe with the gameplay is that the 'not moving unless you are' is actually an outright lie. Everything is moving, just very, very slowly. To the point where you can be shot while you're thinking because bullets move rather quick. There's also no crouch, so if someone fires a shotgun at shoulder height, there's actually no way to dodge if you're a little close. The best way I found of moving, since actually moving and shooting advances time very quickly was to jump and hold space wherever I went. Everyone responds at a proper speed in this manner, giving you time and ability to properly dodge bullets which you absolutely can't do on the ground.Cutting bullets in half with a katana also barely works. You can do one, maybe? But if someone has a machine gun or even a second person with a handgun behind them the swing time of the katana will guarantee you'll get hit by someone or something else.The endless mode is broken, too. Unless you wait 1-3 seconds after dying to see the 'your score' screen, the game won't actually store your score which is really, really obnoxious.The game actually feels kind of unfinished. I would've liked a more multidimensional story and more items--I understand the limitations of an indie team, but with what's in here doesn't feel like a $20 product. I have 6 hours clocked and I feel mostly done with the game. Maybe if I wanted to listen to a podcast I'd play, but if the selling point of the game is that it's a great time-waster while you're listening to a podcast, you're putting yourself in the same boat as free flash games.The biggest problem of all, is the COMPLETE LACK OF MUSIC. Everything feels dead and extremely uninteresting. The most lively thing in the game is a minigame where you chop a tree--because it actually has MUSIC. The absolute silence save for a robotic voice screaming SUPER HOT SUPER HOT when you finish a level and watch the replay is atrociously obnoxious. And the GIGANTIC ♥♥♥♥ING TEXT covering ANY AND ALL REPLAYS is, AGAIN, very, VERY annoying. Also, how do you edit replays? How do you upload them? Neither really worked for me. And there's no way to just download them as a file.TLDR;The game is rather pretentious, boring, and one dimensional, and definitely not worth $20. There is no music through 90% of the above advertised game, there are a rather limited set of maps, the 'campaign' is extremely short, and everything after that is 'challenges' and 'endless mode' which are on largely the same set of maps. And, lastly, it's hard to tell when you'll get shot.Game's got a little spirit though, I guess.Spoilers:I find the story very pretentious. For example, Spec Ops the Line handles the idea of 'stop playing, you're doing horrible violence' very very well. There's a decent story, and a lot of slow buildup to the twist. SUPERHOT basically tells you the twist in the first five minutes. And then it beats you over the head with it. You're told, basically from the start, to 'stop playing', in one form or another, and actually directly at the 1-hour mark, when the mysterious red text makes your proxy type 'I will not run SUPERHOT.exe again'. You can do that in a game that has a longer story. But when I paid $20 for your game LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, the concept isn't that interesting, even if you tell me that the red people are real and 'bodies are disposable'."

And that it does, you'll feel like you're in the god damn matrix movies, the adrenaline rush is great, it's not the best thing ever and could be improved in multiple ways (THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS A LEVEL EDITOR AND MODDING) but for the most part? It's awesome, it's a great proof of concept and it does its job really well.Oh also: in case you didn't notice it's a fast-paced (as fast paced as slow mo can be) fps based on shooting at the right place in the right time, it's difficulty is actually really high because you have ONE LIFE, as in a single shot is all it takes to drop you, so you have to be really careful, it's almost more of a puzzle game than an action game, and a really cool one at that. I include this here because this means it's probably not for everyone, if you're of the MMS school of thought you probably won't like it, because it's not that much of a power trip when you're literaly made out of glass, but seriously if you like oldschool shooters (that were based on dodging) or puzzle games, then this is the game for you, AND IT'S ALSO COOL AS ALL HELL. You don't know how cool it looks to throw a box at someone, catch their gun, headshot the guy running at you with a katana, launch his katana at the shotgun guy as you jump backwards, snatch another guys body just as yours is getting shot, punch the guy that shot your old body and use his pistol to kill the last guy until you've done it at least once... It's just freaking cool."

,Not Recommended,322500,21879296,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Loli Gagging,"The same review as the rest; this game is short. But more annoyingly, it's shallow. Since all enemies die in one hit, there's no point in skill shots. Since time moves when you do, there's no urgency in killing them, either. The katana is fun, I have to admit, but the rest of the time you'll just be frustrated at your inability to shoot anyone more than 10 feet away.At the end of the day, you fall into an incredibly dull routine of 'shoot guy, throw gun, grab gun, shoot guy', and the only time you'll die is when an enemy spawns in mere feet away and kills you because you weren't looking in that direction for all of a half a second.The bonus levels are just the main campaign, exactly, with some new rule, like 'only use katana' or 'only pistols', but the levels are exactly the same, featuring the exact same enemy spawn pattern. Being forced to use a specific weapon does very, very little to the gameplay- there wasn't variety to begin with; how is less helping? Do you really want to beat the same 25 levels OVER and OVER again with an even more limited arsenal? Even the endless levels are just copy-pasted from the main campaign."

So basically the devs thought it would be a great idea to throw painfully long and unskippable cutscenes/text at the player every 2-3 missions in a game where you can beat a mission in only a few min. It completely ruins the pace of the game and literally made me curse at the screen I was so annoyed. If this game was nothing but the combat and had zero horsecrap story that nobody cares about it would be 10x more fun.

I am not hooked by the premise, and the game is truly just one big rage fest to me. Do I think it has an artistic form? Sure. Is it something dynamic or out of this world? Hell no, nothing that hasn't been done before in other games, just a bit differently. Do I think the mechanics are interesting? Sure...if you want to rage over a simple f*cking level that you end up spending almost an hour to beat...yeah. Me? I do not play games to get mad at them: I play them to have fun. This, although has its moments, has a lot of fixing to do, particularly throwing objects around corners.Overall, I rate this game 5/10...a -1 from a 6/10 only because the slow-time thing is not all that impressive, really...Its so dumb that the premise behind the game states that ""Time Moves When You Move"", and yet when I want to take a sec to analyze the scene, I am literally taken away from it because time does NOT move when I move, rather, time speeds up to NORMAL pace when you move...not stopping it completely...perhaps adding a new mode would fix this? A difficulty setting? Idk...it's thoroughly frustrating when I am let down from such a well-spoken title from other peeps who liked this game. All I see is a super-simplistic game lacking any real reason to make me play this again if all I do is get mad when I die everytime. Now, maybe if I take more time and play more, get the better ryhthm of the game, I may find a different opinion on the game, but for now: I am thoroughly unsatisfied that I spent 25 bucks on a game that makes me nothing but mad.On the bright side, I do like the implementation of a clever ""Killstagram"", and hope they add more features to the replay sections, such as replaying a level to try and make an even cooler clip, and playing with the timecode/timeline more, adding music, and so on...If they improve this mechanic, this will definitely make me want to play this more, and ignore all ragefests...even bump my rating up to a 8/10. But sadly for now, I can only give this a 5/10...its nothing too crazy, but definitely challenging to play, which is both inconsiderate to people new to FPSs, but smart to those who really want to have a blast and challenge back-to-back.Edit: After going back and playing through this all the way, and being patient, I found this game to be suprisingly addictive, and acceptionally challenging. Initially, I was frustrated beyond understanding with the mechanics, and some bugs, but once you understand fully how to engage the enemy, you can safely call this a simple, yet interesting shooter!I still think it has some improvements to make, but overall a solid game. Not really worth 25 dollars, IMO, but I am still content with my purchase.Also, something else to suggest: allow a sandbox/level creator! THIS WOULD INITIALIZE SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT, AND SO MUCH CREATIVITY, IT'D BE MIND-F*CKING-BLOWING TO THE FANS, MYSELF INCLUDED!!! :D"

So i went into this game with high hopes, ignoring the reviews saying it was worth $10, not $25, and without having yet seen those, my thoughts were ""This was worth every cent!"". After looking at the reviews however, I realized something. It needs more. More features. Longer story. But honestly, Its an amazing time waster, and the game even mentions this. Saying ""it feels like it's only a few minutes"" was such an interesting thing to see. I started the game at 5pm, and when I finally realized my surroundings, I noticed it was 9pm. what I had thought of as merely a half hour turned out to be four hours. I was so amazed at the game. In two days I had managed to have played eight hours. I had such a constant want to top my high scores on endless mode, to unlock the next endless arena, and even just getting all achievements. All in all, I loved every moment of this game, trying out tricks and personal bits of parkour to post on killstagram was great. It felt so much better than what I was hoping for in so many ways.

,Recommended,322500,21543371,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,InsaneFox (InsaneFox),"After a good 7 hours of playtime, I must say, the gameplay is phenoenal and unlike anything I've ever seen before, it's done well, there are verry few times that you'll die and say ""Now that was just bull.""  Even when it's an enemy that comes out of nowhere, this game makes you feel like you are ultimately responsible.  The only problem with the game mechanics is that some of the walls and corners seem to have inflated hitboxes, so bullets will strike against corners they wouldn't have hit.HOWEVER, this game's story almost convinced me to give the game a negative review for two broad reasons:1:  The story is out of place, slow, and interupts the fast paced action.2:  The type of story was very poorly executed.Before you read this rant, the story only covers about 2 hours of gameplay at most, so the other five hours I played at the time of writing this review was spent slicing through bullets with a katana, throwning katanas through people and catching them on the other side, and punching red dudes in the face.  Those first two hours were actually the tutorial.As for the story:  You're playing some game you're not supposed to be playing on an old DOS terminal, you pretend to type into a box, and then press buttons you're asked to press, and occasionally you're rewarded with the sweet gameplay.  Think of the broad concept of Pony Island, except strip down all the interactive elements of the actual story and replace the pony jumping game with Super Hot's bullet hell, and make the game as condecending as physically possible.  For that type of story to work, the gameplay cannot be more engaging than the story, it doesn't have to be terrible, but it needs to be the means to the end and not the center focus of the game's value.  Not to mention that you need to let the player try to resist the system/overlord/condescending story that interrupted the awesome gameplay, or else the story is just boring.Now, all that doesn't sound too bad, right, not nearly bad enough to bring down an otherwise amazing game and earn a negative review?  Well, it was one line in particular that nearly convinced me to write a negative review.  When I thought that this story couldn't get any more condescending, that it's tone of ""We own you now, do whatever we say, slave,"" it uttered this line and ended the tutorial ""Now go tell all your friends to play this game, tell them it's an innovative shooter and it's amazing."" as ""recruting.""  This might work in a game about the story part of it, if it's delivered when I feel like I've won, when I feel like I've finished the game, or at the very least, have experienced the most fun part of the game and WASN'T TALKED DOWN TO BY A CONDESCENDING SYSTEM/OVERLORD/ADMINISTRATOR, but after having sat through what is by far the worst story in a game I otherwise enjoy, I really wanted to click no, I really wanted to tell people it wasn't worth their time, just to say ""Hey, ♥♥♥♥ you"" to the system/overlord/admin who thinks that their constant interruptons are somehow better than the act of slicing through bullets with a katana, and has the balls to not just ask me recomend it to my friends, but to say it's ""innovative.""  (Yeah, the game is pretty innovative, but really, don't tell me what words to use when describing it to my friends.)So, is the game still good despite having the most condescending and pretentious story I've ever dealt with?  Do not underestimate the amount of fun you can have with a katana.Yeah, this game is worth $15, maybe $20... but I've had more fun with this thing than most $60 games that are out now, so, not complaining about the price."

And if it is not then ask for a refund! This way you have atleast tried the game for yourself and can make a more solid standing point on how you see the issue.Keep in mind also that I got this game at the promotional sale at the price of about 20€ while the original price is a bit higher."

,Recommended,322500,21508530,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,RolanDecoy,"I'm not much of an FPS player, but I really enjoyed this single player game.The story-line, in a nutshell, is about a software pirate whos life gets turned upside down after download something that at first glance seems to be a game. Playing this game, this...virtual environment... becomes more and more addictive.Like I said, this is a first person shooter, and it really is nothing more than that. But it focuses on that little nugget unlike any other game. Imagine a game where you are in a constant bullet time mode; Where the speed of the game is determined solely by you mouse moving or keyboard input. You are the one that decides the pace of the action, by combining melee and ranged combat, switching between the 2 in a split second.As much as this game looks and feels like an FPS, the strategy you employ and your ability to switch strategies whilst retaining your situational awareness will prove an interesting experience to say the least.If I had to compare this to other games, the ones that come to mind are Ronin, Max Payne and The Matrix, with a twist of The Stanley Parable.It looks good, although don't expect too much texture and model detail; It serves a purpose and it serves it well, and like most games that put mechanics ahead of graphical quality one shouldn't expect too much. I really love what they did with the menu system though ;-)There are some problems I have noticed in similar games though. For instance, you have the ability to throw an (empty) gun or melee weapon at your enemy to stagger or even kill them, but I found myself in situations where I saw my katana fly through my enemy without doing either, as if they didn't have a body (collision detection problems). In other situations my weapon would bounce off into some random direction, again without affecting them. Enemies firing their weapons AFTER you've punched it out of their hands, killing you by 'magically' spawning bullets out of thin air, weapons falling apart in mid-air because invisible wall (collision detection, once again).Nothing game-breaking, but annoying at times. The game is actually nicely split in small levels and that makes up more than enough from my perspective. This kind of fine collision detection, which seems to be the cause of the majority of these problems plagued Ronin as well and I'll take it as a symptom of the genre.All in all I highly recommend giving this addictive and unique shooter a try. Although, I must admit the price of 20 Euro's may be a bit steep for most."

Unique mechanics combined with... with... alright it's the unique mechanics.It's a lot of fun, it feels like a cross between a shooter w/ travel (i.e. Battlefield instead of COD where the bullets and projectiles have travel time) and a puzzle game/bullet hell. It's engaging and just hard enough to challenge yet not hard enough for me to rage since, even if I die, I ♥♥♥♥ing died in fashion and a blaze of glory! The gameplay is utterly satisfying, especially the killcam at the end when you can see your entire spree of murder! It's awe-inspiring how 10 minutes of meticulous planning and work ends up being a mere 10-12 seconds ""IRL"".Graphics: It's own geometry style graphics. Nothing to write home about it's very minimalistic so I'll say this is a neutral whether it is a pro or con. You decide. For me I felt it was perfect simply due to the fact that your enemies crumble into pieces before you in a way ""real world"" like graphics can't convey. For me this was slightly positive but I can understand if such a simple graphical style isn't to your liking.Gameplay: Mostly positive as I've stated. What would I change? More weapon variety in my opinion. With a game that literally slows time to a crawl, different guns with miniscule differences would feel completely different and completely change how you go about beating a mission. Touch up the killcams at the end. The animations feel too... flitty since they were designed for bullet-time I feel like the camera at the end sometimes does not feel as epic as it could. A small complaint since it still feels fricken awesome!Story: Simple story, nothing to write home about but it is captivating. It is only 2-3 hours long, shorter if you're actually good at the game unlike me. Is this a con? To many, yes. To me? Not so much... I didn't care about the story all too much, I just wanted to kill people in bullet-time with a computer monitor and coffee mugs. The story detracted me from these awesome moments. I just wanted to go from corpse to corpse, gun to gun, coffee mug to katana. I was relieved, personally, when I reached the end and unlocked challenges and endless mode. THAT's what I wanted to play.Price: It's  20 some dollars for a unique, fun experience. I think it's worth it. I've gotten more enjoyment so far (only 2 or 3 hours in so far) than I have from many 60 dollar titles.♥♥♥♥ I love this game..."

,Recommended,322500,21494023,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,camycamera,"SUPERHOT is a game where time moves only when you do. It is an action FPS/puzzler game that first started out as a prototype that a lot of people played a few years ago (and you can still play it to this day) and loved so much that the developers of SUPERHOT released a kickstarter for it, and now, this is that game.And just like the original demo/prototype, it's damn awesome, and it takes what made the original prototype great and expands on it to prefection. The aesthetic, while simple, is quite pleasing, especially when you punch/hit/slice/shoot the red glass men and watch them shatter against the white background behind them. The videos on the store page do quite a good job of showing off what the game looks like, and in short, It makes you feel badass.This is the game you want if you want to dodge bullets matrix style from a guy point blank, punch him, take his gun while he is reacting from the punch, blow his head off, shoot the guy next to him while still doging bullets, throw your gun at the next guy, pick up a katana, slice an oncomming bullet in half (yes you can do that and more, I'll put a few tips down below), cut the guy you threw the gun at  in half, and then throw the katana at the last guy behind you. All that, in just a couple of seconds.It's just great, and in fact it is one of the few games that I have bought on day 1. Yes, I'm one of those (sensible and patient) people who buys games way after they've been released at 50 or 75% off.Now with those such game mechanics, you might think this game is easy, but, at least in my experience, it's not. You're gonna die a lot, especially on the challenge modes which change up the gameplay rules and freshen up the experience, as bullets/melee weapons kill you in one hit. Or maybe its because I am too zealous when playing this game sometimes and forget to stand still and get shot in the back in the process a lot of the time. The game makes you think back to other shooters and what we take for granted these days in those games.So it really saddens me to see a couple of ""most helpful"" reviews being negative, pointing out how short the campaign is (I beat it in about 2-3 hours), and thus saying that the game is not worth the asking price of 25 bucks (at the time of writing it is 10% off at $22.50). And I'm going to adress that. First off, this isn't a game that you play the campaign and put it down forever, and that's it. The campaign is not even HALF of the game. It might as well be the tutorial for the rest of the game, I'd even argue. As you can probably see from those negative reviews, they've only played 2-3 hours (the length of the campaign), then come here and post a negative review without bothering to try anything else that the game has to offer.As I said, this isn't the game you play only for the campaign, this is the type of game you play for the core gameplay experience, and you won't get all of that core experience from the campaign alone, not by a long shot. After you beat the campaign, you unlock various endless and challenge modes. Endless modes are self explanatory, and within those endless modes there are variations such as time limits and stuff like that, and then there's challenges. Challenges put a spin on top of the core gameplay. There's modes to unlock from Katana only, to a ""Ghost"" mode where you can only hotswitch (possess enemies by teleporting into them) and one hit kill enemies with punches but can't pick up any weapons or objects. There is so much variety in these challenge and endless modes alone, you can get countless of hours into the game, to make it well worth the asking price.I got 2-3 hours out of the game's campaign, but I have gotten a further 8 or so hours from the challenge modes alone, and I plan to put in even more hours into it.There's even loads of secrets to find throughout the game if that's your type of thing. This game is packed full of content, it's just a shame that it presented itself with the campaign first, and people thought ""is that it?"" and then went on to spread negative reviews of it as a result.But anyway, now that's out of the way, here's some actual criticism (sorta) that will hopefully be sorted out with time:The ""Killstagram"" website where you can quickly record and upload your gameplay while in the game to show off your mad skillz or because it just looked cool, is in beta, and so it doesn't work properly. I've used the in-game record function alot, and I can't find my countless recordings. Once they are recorded, they are sent off to the website under some random name rather than mine. You can make an account but that doesn't work yet, nor does the option to view your own replays. I did manage to find one of mind though randomly,Here it is. I believe they have switched over to GIF rather than youtube now, which is why mine's on youtube, I'm not entirely sure. But for now, the site is a bit broken right now and could use some tweaks.It would be awesome if this game had a map editor, apparently it was on the kickstarter goals but they didn't reach it. Hopefully, with this game's success, we'll see it patched in somehow, because right now we've only got the game's vanilla maps. There's quite a few of them, but it would be awesome to see more, not just from the community but from the developers themselves. It would make this game's replay value skyrocket.Basically more stuff: There aren't a lot of weapon/enemy types etc, I don't think that's a bad thing and some even argue that the simplicity of that is fine, which I can agree with, but it would be cool to have a lot more variation on things to use. Hopefully modders will be able to add in a bunch of stuff if this game gets that support from modders and the developers. Mind you, I'm not saying that what the game offers in terms of stuff is bad, not by any stretch, but in the case of this game, I think more stuff would do nothing but benefit this game greatly I think. Maybe we'll get that in the sequel, like with DOOM 2 that went insane and expanded DOOM 1 greatly.It would be cool to have a crouch button, so we can properly do a Matrix-stlye dodge and watch bullets fly above our heads as we duck.Tips/things to note when playing:As you might have read above, you can cut bullets in half with the Katana. Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. And there's an achievement for it.On top of that, you can shoot bullets with your own bullets. It is more trickier to bull of then you think, mind you. And yes, there's an achievement for that too.Pressing space will make you jump, of course. But HOLDING space will make you jump, AND slow down time while you are in the air (also holding space while falling will slow down time as well). The game tells you this in the campaign, but I didn't figure this out until after beating the campaign. It completely changed the way I played, Jumping on and over obsticals and enemies, shooting and dodging bullets in mid air, all that great stuff.You can jump on people's head to kill them. And of course, there's a Mario-themed achievement for that as well.You can kill two dudes with one Katana if you throw them at two people standing in front of eachother. And at this point I'm just telling you how to get achievements, sorry about that.You can get the red guys to shoot their own guys (on accident, of course). It is useful when you need a body shield, or just need to kill two birds with one stone. It is hard though, and there's no achievement for it.So there we have it. Buy this game if you like this sort of stuff or just vaguely like the idea, and it'll be a steal on sale. And like I said before, don't just play the campaign and drop it and then complain about it, because that's not the sort of game that this is and is not what all the game has to offer."

My only problem is that this is more of a 5 dollar game or 10 dollar game not a 22 dollar game as of now, later that might change.Why? well here are the ""cons"" and then the ""pros""""Cons""1. It lasted only about 2 hours for me2. there's barely any content3. The scenarios are pretty random4. it is still just a killing game with dodging bullets and swapping bodies5. not a lot of enemies and not a lot of guns (although the enemies is understandable due to the close combat)""Pros""1. you can stop time by not moving (literally you can go out to dinner with friends family or even take the whole freaking day off and go on a date or take a♥♥♥♥♥♥break or something and then come back to the game and it still would not have moved a single bit)2. You can mario stomp your enemies in some sense3. THEY HAVE A F****** KATANA4. YOU CAN CUT BULLETS IN MID AIR AND SHOOT OTHER BULLETS!!!5. The story is a little interesting yet far fetched, somewhat of a matrix storyline in a weird sense except you want to join the computers not stay human.6. You can record and edit your gameplay and upload them to the website.7. This game shows no blood so this is a clean shooter which is nice.8. you can swap bodies (for instance a guy comes up and shoots his shotgun 5 feet from you, you swap to his body and then your old/ original body will shred to peices with that shotgun blast)9. In the end there is an endless mode and you can also select from all the missions10. This game looks great and I highly recommend you try it.From the looks of it they will be updating it with a lot more content down the road, you have to realise that they need money for more content and well since I think it was a great game i think you should spend the money. Might be a little dissapointed at first but you will get around to it. Hope my review helped and please if you have any questions feel free to contact me.Sincerely,Brandon Gonnella (A.K.A.

Its simple and not complciated, yet there are some weak points and significant ones. There is a lack of weapons (for a 25 dollar game) as there is only 3 ranged weapons (there are melee weapons but they all feel the same excluding the kitana, that weapon is fun as hell). Even though there is a small number of ranged weapons, they all feel distinct in their own way. The game is also pretty short, at least the story mode, I was able to finish it in 2 hours. Even though most of the content is unlocked after the sotry has been completed, it would be nice to have a longer story as it was quite a fun one, nothing groundbreaking story wise, but it kept me interested. To conclude my thoughts, I think that the game is great, really great, I do recommend it but I would recommend if the price was a bit cheaper, I do not regret getting this game at 22 dollars but I still do not think it should be that expensive. Price out of the way, if you are tired of the same games, same mechanics and same concepts in games, SUPERHOT, is the game you have been waiting for. ONE OF US ONE OF US ONE OF US ONE OF US"

In that case any game with an endless mode has in theory hundreds of play time but I don't think this games offers enough beyond the ideas expressed in the ""story mode"" to be interesting or worth while.To set your expectations on the story, it is a basic narrative the developers seem to have ""transplanted"" after they built the game, because the game is set of unrelated situations and I think towards the end the devs must have wondered how they could weave in a story.My playtime is 107 minutes at the time of writing, that is how long it has taken me to complete the main game.I am not saying it is a bad game or anything, hence the thumbs up, just it needed to be longer and offer more for your money."

No, thats not the system telling me to say that, those are my honest thoughts.There are a whole lot of complaints about the game being to short, but they dont understand the main story and levels are not the bulk of the game. The game has a lot of replay value with challenges, endless mode, and the upcoming FREE DLC. So that must be changing peoples minds who think it is overpriced. I honestly have a blast every time I play. I've gotten all of the acheivement, discovered tricks and strategies, and put a lot of thought into the story of the game. The story doesnt tell a whole lot, but tells just enough for you to theorize about what is going on within the world of SUPERHOT.Back to the dlc, they will be adding procedurally generated levels, new game machanics, and some form of in game currency for buying modifiers. And again, it is free. I would 100% reccomend this game to anyone. especially if you like somewhat cryptic storytelling, killing endless waves of enemies with time manipulating super(hot)powers, slinglead, dodging bullets, mind control, or if you like the sound of breaking glass, because be ready for that A LOT."

Not fun: Not being able to accurately lead shots because time is stopped, so you can't see whether any enemy is moving or how fast.Fun: Shooting things. Not fun: having to start a bunch of levels with no gun, and having to use frustrating melee attacks that aren't one hit kills.Fun: Quick Try-Fail-Repeat cycles. Not fun: Hearing a screeching modem noise for a few seconds every time you have to restart.Fun: Seeing a real time replay of what you did when you beat the level. Not Fun: Having the words SUPER HOT be flashed on screen over the action, with a stupid distorted voice repeating it.Fun: Triumphing over a bunch of foes when you're totally outnumbered. Not Fun: having enemies constantly spawning from places you've already cleared, so you're always surrounded, and have no way of knowing when you're in danger, can't see what's coming, can't plan ahead without dying repeatedly first, and have no possible way of knowing how close you are to the end of a level.I tried to play this game on two separate occasions, and both times it was just too frustrating and sensorily unpleasant for me to play for more than 15 minutes."

I'm not sure whether it's because these kind of slow games don't appeal to me, or for some other reason.

After downloading it, I instantly opened it and was astonished by how flawless the game is. Yes, there are probably some bugs here and there, but that's not the point. The story is so simple, yet so complex at the same time, and is assisted with amazing gameplay. The game's ""campaign"" isn't very long, one to three hours I would guess, but it is one the best I have ever played. While the game might seem repetative in some aspects, it manages to change how you approach your goal because you can't just run into a room with an assault rifle and mow every one down; the AI will shoot you before you can. Anyways, after you finish the story, you can play levels from the game and an endless mode, which is just endless waves of enemies (my record at the time of this post being writen is 90, which took forever to get). There are also tons of other parts of the game that I have not even touched yet, because there are so many of them. While people may say that this game is like a one-day thing, meaning that after a day you'll be bored of it, but I think that it is so much more than even a week of five hour sessions. My rating of the game is a 10/10; a masterpiece for a lack of better words."

It feels like a bullet time gun-fu movie and a Kojima game all at once. Some people feel like it's lacking in content, but I disagree. The story mode is short, no doubt, but the game hardly ends there. There are tons of challenge modes, endless horde maps and so on, and it actually doesn't need much more to it than that because the mechanics are just so darn brilliant. Would you criticise chess for being feature poor because the boards are always an eight by eight grid? No, because that's not the point. Superhot is so original and well crafted that it doesn't need any extra padding to be worth your time and money.The devs focused on what really mattered. But as if to make sure nobody could accuse their game of being feature poor, the devs have snuck in loads of goodies. There are a lot of smaller mini-features which add immensely to the character of the game. So much creativity and love has been put into superhot, as evidenced by loads of extra goodies that I don't want to spoil for you - for a start, just explore the options below the primary buttons in the main menu.TL;DR The mechanics are so brilliant that it does not need any extra feature padding to be worth your money.

Fortunately you don't have to re-watch the story elements, so combined with the extremely short load times its almost non-stop gameplay (well, apart from stopping time).Watch people playing it on youtube to get the gist of it, and if you're really worried about value-for-money then wait for a sale or price drop."
,Recommended,322500,21492209,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Quelandoris,"Most Innovative Shooter I've played since the SUPERHOT Demo nearly 3 years ago.Pros:Gameplay is amazing, all the guns are highly responsive, levels are tightly and smartly designed (With the exception of the last part of the final level, which has a few too many blind corners)Slo-mo that actually makes you feel like Neo from the Matrix.There is a katana.There is a game mode for nothing but katanas.Interesting, if slightly underdeveloped plot and setting.Lovely spartan aesthetics.Metric Tons of replayability. There's something about this slo-mo gameplay that really lets you get creative with how you kill things.Mehs:Plot is PAINFULLY short, especially considering what an interesting cyberpunk world it creates. Its almost depressing that the devs did nothing with the setting aside for ""SAO VR Woaaaah""Visuals can get a little repetitive if you marathon the game for too long.There seems to be a lot of secrets in this game. Like A LOT A LOT. An ARG's worth, if I had to guess. I'm not great at that kind of stuff though, but it's something interesting to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.Cons:The game is SHORT. It only took me about 2 hours to beat the main campaign, and that's considering I was stuck on one level for around 30 minutes. This game is banking heavily off replay value to meet its $25 value. IMHO, it has more than enough additional content to merit the value, but if you're worried about it, get in on a deep sale, or ask a friend if they have a coupon (We all do.)Plot is a little meta. New gamers or people just not very into computers will likely not understand the themes of the plot.I'm willing to bet a lot of work went into the Secrets/ARG aspect of the game. Best to buy in quick if you want to be a part of that.Overall: IT LIVED UP TO 3 YEARS OF HYPE. 9/10. Great game, some flaws to be ironed out. If they make a sequel, and they adds some more mechanics and content to the sequel, SUPERHOT 2 could easily enter intothe best of the best for the puzzle genre."

I love the interface the game is presented with and the overall style of the gameplay itself. The story mode is short, but in reality is the few hours-long tutorial for the endless modes and challenges that unlock upon completion. That's where the real game begins.As far as the story mode goes, it's actually quite interesting and engaging for a game that I was expecting to be just about slicing red dudes with katanas and matrix-style bullet dodges. It's just thought-provoking enough to provide a layer of abstract substance on a game that would otherwise be just fine if it was pure action and no story. Icing on the cake, if you will.The post singleplayer features range between endless survival modes and extra challenges on top of the single player levels. The endless mode is incredibly fun and the variations on it, including limits of in-game time or limits on real-world time are also very interesting from a puzzle perspective.SUPERHOT is a great game. Some might think that the game is too short to warrant a higher than $20 pricetag, but that's not where the core of the gameplay is. I can see myself spending so many more hours on the endless and challenge modes than the singleplayer campaign. It's worth every second and every penny."

Under most circumstancances Half Life 2 is considered the crowning jewl of innovative FPSs but this game definatly takes it from a diffrent perspective. Perhaps i am getting off topic, Superhot has a lot of really good ideas. Every level is almost like a puzzle, you have to learn what to do and when to do it. Rarely can you win a level by simply going in without thinking. However, this is not simply a puzzle game, it is an extreamly cinimatic shooter.

The big question people seem to ask is, is it worth the asking price?To me, yes.  If you are someone who gauges their dollar spent on games based upon hours, maybe not.  It cost me $20, but for me, there will be plenty of replayability here.  Maybe not for you -- it is completely subjective.The story is very ""meta"" and is of course short.  Now you do unlock modes.  But it might be worth waiting for a sale, if you think 20 bucks or so is too much to ask for your time.  I don't judge that and I understand it.However, I will say that I got a TON of enjoyment out of the ~2 hour story mode, and know that I can spend quite a bit of time in the unlimited mode.  You can play slow and methodical, taking advantage of the time stop, or try to go full on twitch FPS.  The very simple, but highly polished mechanics mean that you can get a lot out of each level.Do yourself a favor, if you really want to play this, avoid letsplays and twitches.I completely understand why some folks would not recommend this title at price.  No argument, that's a reasonable and subjective opinion.  I however think it is easily worth the asking price, especially given other games at that asking price.  I think I'll be able to pick this up a few times a week just to fart around and see different ways of completing levels.  That is TOTALLY DEPENDENT upon what kind of gamer you are.  If you want an epic, well written story for your dollar - no, stay away.  If you want something along the lines of THEY LIVE in a video game, that reminds you constantly you are playing a game, you might enjoy it.  And again, the mechanics are ROCK SOLID.If you like shooters, but also like turned based games where you can weigh your  options, this is an awesome little hybrid with some very cool mechanics.  It runs smooth.  If you want a 40+ hour adventure for your dollar, with a polished story, no, I'd say wait for a sale.  But overall I recommend it.I mean, the game makes you literally exit to windows and restart to continue the story, it is so ""meta"".  Contrived?  Sure.  But it adds to the immersion (whatever that really means).  It's a solid title.  I'd really like to see more from these guys,It's farily unique and might surprise you.  If you have any doubts, *wait for a sale*!!!  But otherwise, dive in."

This game isn't skyrim, I wasn't expecting to explore open worlds. People complain when a $20 game is 2 hours long, but a $15 movie ticket to see a 1.5 hr movie is okay?

,Recommended,322500,21480282,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Dirtyplatinum,"Its the most innovative shooter Ive seen in years.Now that we have that out of the way, lets actually get to it. SUPERHOT is a shooter/puzzle game. Its very short story tasks you with shooting red dudes. Its not a very interesting story, but they do with it what they can to make it an enjoyable hour and a half to 2 hours. The game is pretty stylish, and its simple look actually underplays how cool the action can be sometimes. The red dudes shatter in an almost glasslike way, making it pretty satifying to kill them in all sorts of ways.While that doesnt sound to interesting its the games ""puzzle"" elements that make it enjoyable. When you are not moving time moves at a snails pace. Giving you time to enjoy the mayhem around you. As glass shatters and bullets wiz by your head, you do a dance between machine gun fire to smack a dude in the face with a bat, before throwing it at another guy, and grabbing the machine gun from out of the air to riddle their friends with bullets.While the story is rather uninteresting and doesnt offer much replayability, it does have an Endless Mode and a Challenge Mode. These are honestly where you are going to spend most of your game time, with Endless Mode having several maps to hone your skills and even a type of challenge mode on those as well, tasking you with killing everyone in a timely fasion as one example. Challenge Mode will also take away some time while you plink away at the story mode with such things as Katanaonly Challange, which in my opinion is a standout among the other challenges.Other then the actually rather amazing ability to switch bodies with people there isnt much more to the game. But take it from me thats more then enough. I got through the story pretty fast, introducing me to the abilities I would need to master. And then I ran through the Katanaonly Challenge in about an hour, having already ran through the story. Now Endless Mode seems to be the thing for now.I completely recommend it, and think the $25 price tag is more then justifiable. Its has already given me 4-5 hours of enjoyment and can totally see Endless Mode sucking up quite a bit more time. Just dont expect the story mode to carry the game."

The reason I put the quotes on puzzle is because this is not a puzzle/platform game, it is an FPS, but it makes you think on your every move and figure out what to do next.When I bought this, I thought I was going to regret my decision. I was so wrong. This game is about thinking before acting and unleashes that idea quite nicely. It is completely unique and is nothing like other FPS games.

I was beyond happy to see it had finally made it to Steam. Time only moving when you move makes the game simultaniously fast paced and gives you the ability to plan ahead.Honestly I think it's worth more than the asking price.
,Recommended,322500,21508380,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,Comrade Beaglsky,"SUPERHOT was born of a game-jam, and much of the focus and simplicity that comes with time constraints has carried over to this commercial reimagining. The game is streamlined, focusing on its one major mechanic (time effectively stops when you stop) over a variety of increasingly difficult levels. Its distinct graphical aesthetic and endearingly DOS-like user interface make the game instantly recognisable and memorable.It's only a shame then that, for the price, SUPERHOT doesn't contain much content. The campaign can be completed in 2 hours easily and while the additional gamemode mutators are interesting, they don't really make up the price.SUPERHOT would've really benefited from a level editor and some way to share them amongst the community (Steam Workshop?)The game itself is great, and I recommend it - but if you're tight on cash maybe wait for a price drop."

I was hyped for this game. Very much.When the prototype came out, I was astonished. Heck, when they said that the game would have a full release, I went and got a gtx 660,JUST FOR THIS GAME.And I was not disappointed.As people have been yelling about, time moves when you move. Simple, yet it is innovative in a gaming field that needs innovation to appeal to audiences. The creators certainly refined many, many things since that prototype came out 2-3 years ago.The gameplay, is, well, great! Ain't got anymore words to say, its just great.Time stopping is just the icing on the cake, what I like about this game is how the A.I functions. TheA.I.They pick up dropped weapons when they are unarmed. They anticipate your move (only for your move to be unanticipated), by aimming where they think you are going to. And combat, is just supurb. It's now like Hotline Miami, where you can throw your weapon to disable enemies, beat them to crap, or just take their weapon and kill them off.I have my own opinions on the story. I mean, it's a shooter. Stories don't really matter that much in shooters.It's so-so, ok? There, that's my opinion.Sure it is not worth its price tag, but that does smeer out by how much other ""un-Superhot"" content they have: apps in the game, random chatroom hacking, etc. It gets meta about it, and that's pretty good, I guess.All and all, it is a solid game that is worth picking up when a sale rolls by.Just get it.Ok?"
,Recommended,322500,21488951,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Patrician,"SuperHot a great little game that'll take you 2-3 hours to beat the main campaign. While I recommend it, if you're not sure you'll love this game already I'd wait for a sale. It's absolutely worth $15, but $25 may be a bit much if you don't have much cash to spend.While it's true that the campaign is 2-3 hours long, the truth is that it's more of a tutorial. After you beat the story, plenty of new challenge modes unlock for you to play. While I'd prefer they be unlocked from the beginning, this means that, if you enjoy the base gameplay gimmick enough, this game has PLENTY of content to justify its initial asking price. Just because it isn't narrative-focused or considered part of the campaign doesn't mean that it isn't worthwhile content. If you enjoy the time-stopping gameplay of SuperHot, you will find a lot of content here.As for the story, it really isn't anything special. It really does come off as pretentious (if you've played Pony Island, it really gives off that same exact vibe), and frankly I was just waiting for the sections of story to be over so I can go back to playing. It serves as a good preamble for the hours I plan on investing into the challenges and endless mode. A lot of people seem rather irate that the game doesn't have many weapons to play with, and while more would have been appreciated, the weapons we do have serve themselves well. They all have a learning curve to use, and they all work well enough to keep things fresh.If I did have one suggestion for the devs, it would be to enable the game for modding support or provide a level editor. I can see glorious fan-made levels being made here, and it would be a shame to see that potential squandered. It would also help people swallow the $25 asking price.The gameplay is tricky, super satisfying, and rewarding to master. It really does feel like playing a scene in The Matrix. It's a super unique gimmick that I'd love to see expanded in a sequel. As for right now, though, SuperHot still remains a game I recommend, if only to experience what people claim to be the most innovative FPS ever."

,Recommended,322500,21486681,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Sanny,"For more reviews, and a link to a short gameplay video, head over here:https://probablysanny.wordpress.com/The concept behind this game is simple; You kill red guys, and time only moves when you do. Actually, time still moves very slowly when you stay still, but whatever. There are very few weapons in the game, but it doesn't feel like any more need to be added. Each weapon has it's own role: pistols are slow but reliable, rifles are dangerous to use, but powerful (they fire multiple bullets per trigger pull, and time speeds up while firing), shotguns act as you would expect, and melee weapons are good for hitting things with. This simplicity of design permeates SUPERHOT; the game never tries to do more than it needs to, and this works to its benefit. The simple acting of shooting things feels incredibly good. You can shoot bullets out of the air with other bullets, and if the shrapnel is close enough to an enemy, they will be stunned and drop their weapon. That is pretty damn cool.You wouldn't notice it at first glance, but as you play through the game, you will quickly realize that it's actually a series of real-time puzzles, in a similar vein to Hotline Miami. The game requires you to make quick decisions and pay close attention to your environment, especially sound. In later levels, you will probably need to play multiple times to figure out the best way to deal with a situation.I only have two real issues with the gameplay. Sometimes it can be hard to discern whether a bullet is going to hit you or not, which is especially frustrating knowing that you can only take one hit. And the game has punch and pick-up bound to the same key. Sometimes you will go to grab a weapon out of the air, only to find you clicked a few pixels to the left, punch an enemy, and die because you wasted a few precious seconds. The second problem doesn't come up very often, but it is very frustrating when it does. The reason these problems are so annoying is that they are the only problems I noticed; if they weren't present, the gameplay would be perfect, as far as I'm concerned.There isn't a lot to say about the visuals in SUPERHOT, its very minimalist. If you've seen one screenshot of the game, you pretty much know whether you like the look or not.The music isn't really worth mentioning either, as it doesn't stand out too much, so I'll just breeze past that.The menus in SUPERHOT are presented in the form of a DOS-esque interface. There are plenty of interesting things to find, and little hidden jokes; I think I spent the first 30 minutes of playtime just exploring the menu.I thought the story was a little predictable, but it was interesting enough for what it was. I can't talk too much about it without spoiling, however, so I'll just leave it there.The game automatically records your playthrough of every level for later viewing. This seems like a cool idea at first, but I felt the execution was a bit lacking. Although the game looks fine in slow motion, it doesn't feel quite right in real time. And the game constantly chants and covers half the screen with the words SUPER-HOT, seemingly to distract from the weird looking animations and general lack of any other audio. You can disable this by pressing 7 on the Numpad, which is useful, but makes the lack of polish on the replays painfully obvious.SUPERHOT's story is fairly short, but it has and endless mode, and several challenge modes to complete. If you're the sort of player that is concerned about longevity, they've got you covered.Although the game has a lot of flaws, I'd still recommend it to almost anyone. The only real issue might be the pricetag but, after playing, I don't feel that its acutally that far off the mark. It's such a unique experience-and the core gameplay is almost perfect-, that it still managed to impress me."

Something was holding me back, but now im free.Definitely worth the $30 but,The story mode is underwhelming. It's a really cool concept and a good story but they could have easily dragged it on longer and still made a good story out of it, this must have been a time restraint because the only thing holding it back from being a 5 hour (at least) story is lack of more levels. My first play through took over 2 hours, I'd say roughly 2.5 hours which is comparable to portal 1 which suffered from most likely the same lack of maps with most likely a time restraint. Over-all I came out of it with a smile on my face.Graphics aren't anything next gen, but they are going for a dos era type game style (works hand in hand with the story delivery)Putting that aside, there seems to be a lot of replayability with challenge and endless mode. So far I've sunk close to 2 hours into endless mode and I was just about to go back in when I decided to update my review.Endless mode has 9 different maps with 4 different options to play on them including 2 kinds of time trials.Challenge mode I haven't tried yet but it basically speaks for itself. Most likely things like: ""get this many kills in this time"" or ""kill 6 enemies with less than 3 shots"" (these are completely fabrication used as an example as I don't actually know)a few things I would prefer would be to have a reminder pop up on the screen like the commentaries that you can body switch, because I always forget I can do that and removing the annoying ""Super Hot"" repeating message through your replays in story mode, once or twice would get the same point across but let you actually enjoy your replay (this is disabled in endless mode)The replay editor is very rudimentary but gets the job done, just annoys me that it has to play the entire replay in order to ""capture"" it so you can upload it.All in all great game, especially for people who like games where you challenge yourself to constantly beat your records in a slightly repetitive but extremely fashionable way. There's some good moments that end up happening when you just stop and go ""Oh s***, that crazy thing just happened!""TLDRPros:Good story delivered in a cool fresh wayCool new way to use time as the basis for a normally saturated shooter market that so far has me only want to return for moreLots of replayability with challenges and endless modereplay editor lets you show your friends how fancy you areCons:Short story modefairly bland graphics (was intended but could have a little more flash)menu delivery may confuse some people (again is all part of the era style)9/10 would shoot myself in the head again."

I've paid $20 for a meal that lasted 15 minutes before. This is a very fun game with an interesting story mode. It took me 4 hours to complete the story mode but enjoyed it throughout. It did get a little repetitive at times only due to me having to try the same level over and over. If you're better at the game this may not happen. I haven't tried endless or challenge modes but that Tree Guy game is fun. It's a cool concept that came through well and it is presented with a very aesthetically pleasing art style.

Some you dont really do anything because its part of this plot. I was honestly shocked to find out I made it so quickly to the final level but its just really short. I remember playing the beta of this game a long time ago thinking it would be the best game but it really falls short of even coming close to that title. I would rate 5.5/10 for shortness of the game, lack of replay value (besides endless mode or achievements both are bland) and the fact it was a huge opportunity that was just missed.

However this game is quite expensive for the content in it (if you don't play any challenges). The main campain only takes about two hours to complete. At the time I am writting this review I have five hours on record and I haven't even finished three challenges yet. This is because the challenges can be very unforgiving and make you feel like you are sitting on a porcupine. The challenges can be very frustrating. To get a feel of the game I recomend that you play the online demo because this game is an extremely polished and finished version of the demo. I would recomend this game however it would be best to put this game on your wishlist and wait for a steam sale for the best experience because you won't be constantly thinking if you spent to much money on the game. I would give it a 8/10 because the gameplay is amazing however the challenges (which you will spend the most time on) can be extreamily frustrating."

I've had a lot of fun with this game and it also makes for a fun game to play with a bunch of people over. Many people complain about the lack of content in this game. If you play beyond the base story mode then I have to disagree, there are many challenge modes that are pretty fun to do as well as endless modes where you jsut keep fighting red dudes. I'd say Endless Mode: Bridge alone is worth the $25. So if you're looking into buying this game, so for it, you will have a lot of fun."

And bad one. The story solely exists just to exist. All the 'plot' happens as text, some of it is not skippable and you just feel like the game is wasting your time when you just want to kill some red dudes.What I picked up from various reviews of this game were the replays and these seemed like they could feel well but the weapons in the game don't feel well so on a replay everything looks rather static.The game in the end urges you not to tell your friends much about it and that feels silly. You should absolutely tell them that if they want a similar topic handled better, they should play Pony Island.I am quite disapointed and even though the endless mode is a bit interesting to unwind I don't think I will stay with it more than for another hour or so. I feel ripped off and that never pans out well in the review."

,Recommended,322500,34670452,Posted: 1 September,all,tagenar,"I really wish steam had a neutral rating.  This isn't a bad game, but at just 2 hours it is incredibly small for the price.  It has one concept (time only moves when you move, which isn't actually true; enemies and bullets still move even when standing still, just very slowly), but it doesn't do much with it.  The campaign levels are short, and the challenge levels all happen in the same arena.  The tiny story tries to be artsy and profound but comes across as just vague nonsense.  I have a feeling it was made for the VR platform and a lot is lost when playing on PC.The game is also headache-inducing because the environment is predominately white, and there is very little to break that up.  Movement is slow and herky-jerky, which makes manuvering painfully frustrating, but it's required because levels are designed so you can't take two steps without being in someone's line of fire, and the game requires precision movement to dodge enemies and bullets.  The levels are disconnected and have nothing to do with one another, which doesn't help the story at all because it doesn't feel like a coherent whole.The developers had a decent idea, and I think it could have been better if the story mode had been better.  Without that, everything is kinda pointless.  It's not bad as a proof-of-concept, as the gameplay is challenging, satisfying, and stands on its own, but a single gimmick can only take a game so far."

It's certainly in contention for my game of the year and the amount of time that I have spent thusfar and will likely spend into the future on SUPERHOT make it well worth such an amount of money to me.It's a high concept idea for a game - time moves when you move. But it elevates this fairly simple element with its stark visual presentation, its sinister narrative, and its sense of style that it maintains throughout the campaign, such as it is.It took me around two and a half hours or so to finish what comprises the 'story', with some levels taking more tries than others. Since that time, though, I've been combing through the other modes. The Katana-only Challenge, for instance, poses an interesting break in the flow that the game has reinforced up until that point, thereby forcing you to rethink your approaches with a certain amount of caution that you might not have considered if you happened to be predisposed as I was to stealing guns from people and blowing up their friends.Additionally, there are time-attack and endless modes, and possibly yet more that I have yet to unlock, so I think I'll be spending a bit more time yet on it.In the end, you're going to have to decide whether the price is worth it or not, but it's not relevent to the content of the game and, as such, it can only be seen as disappointing that people are so willing to disparage something not because it isn't good, but because it isn't goodenough.There should be no place for such a thing in this review system. The craft and time that were put into this game, stretching all the way back to when it was first conceived during the 7DFPS jam, are incredibly apparent—immanent with the cracking sound of every bullet and shattering cluster of red polygons."

There is a free demo out there that was made for an indie game jam years ago. Find that and play it first, then if you enjoy the mechanics of that demo, you'll enjoy the full game.Story-wise, it is akin to games like Pony Island, so if you enjoy the sort of meta-game that game has, you'll appreciate the story as well, even though it's pretty short.Hopefully they add more maps and challenges in the future to further expand replayability."

That explains the relatively short campaign, which actually suggests such replayability.All in all, it's a good game, and was worth my 2-3 years of wait. Not like I was ""OOOOOOOOOOOOMG SUPER HOT SUPER HOT,"" but I was waiting.There's still plenty to do after the campaign, with the ENDLESS Mode and the CHALLENGES, composed of several kinds with apparently 25 levels each, which gives you quite a lot of stuff to do.Gameplay is smooth. Only two detectable bugs, as of now:1-) Phantom walls, especially around corners of narrow obstacles;2-) Punching will occasionally result in an instant kill, especially if you face framerate drop at the moment of the punch.Summary:+Gameplay is what we expected: plan ahead, dodge, disarm, kill, etc., in the best bullet-time fashion.+Game is difficult, but fair. Expect occasional yelling.+Simplistic, almost-monochromatic graphics and absence of musical soundtrack fit the game perfectly.+After the campaign, gives you a series of challenges and an endless mode to keep the glass skull-cracking going.+Makes you feel pretty badass.+Well polished.+There's the Hotswitch resource that really adds umph.-Bullet collision can be somewhat disappointing, since a shotgun shell fragment can stop your 5.56mm round. Happens.-Very tiny bugs.-Short campaign that surely could use a continuing.?Low variety of weapons, but what more could we ask for? A crossbow? Shuriken?

It is like an FPS and a puzzle game that uses a pretty unique take on the bullet time mechanic that verterans of games such as Max Payne will fully appreciate.  It is amazing amounts of fun, it has a strange but compelling story mode and it is a bit of a mindfu$k but I loved it. Once you complete the main story various new gameplay modes, including an endless mode, open up that can keep you going for hours more.Let me try and explain why you should play this game whether you are a fan of FPS games or otherwise. This is a game where you can face 2 enemies at the same time, one firing an assualt rifle the other a double-barrelled shotgun. You see the bullets coming at you in super slo-mo. They are about 15 feet away and you are standing in a corridor with no exits and nowhere to hide while you have just a katana in your hands. You dodge their initial shots, turning to watch the individual bullets as they race slowly past you. You throw the katana in between the two of them body swap into the guy with the assault rifle, catch the katana in mid air and cut the other guy in half before he has time to point his shotgun at you. If you dont think that sounds like something you want to do. Then give this a miss. Otherwise buy it. I dont think you'll be disappointed."

One thing that I was frustrated with was how impossibly hard it was on the level(s) in which you are supposed to, ""superswitch with the core."" It isn't exactly skill that drives you down on those levels, its simply a lack of impatience. IF any of you want to download this game for the $24 dollars, sure do whatever you please. It's not my steam account, keep in mind the frustration you'll have to endure and... Sometimes, ONLY, sometimes, does SUPERHOT crash during a level. Usually during a level, or sometime like when the game is loading. So for the most part, good game, but they should change it so its not so dang hard. It REALLY is impossible. Good luck winning!

What res ETC. Pretty normal stuff. I have it windowed at about 1600x900. I boot up the game, got into the first mission. Tried to look around and take in the bright whites and reds. And oh, Whats this? My first enemy. I go to shoot him in the head only to have it interrupted by my mouse going out of the boarder of the window. Making it so that every time I click, it will ""exit"" out of the game, going onto my desktop. It may just be me,  But surely this problem would of happened to ANYONE else that has more than a single screen.( I have two.)Also as a side note to add onto this. You aren't allowed to change which screen it will start up on either.(if you are, it isn't apparently clear) That has caused quite a few problems at least with me, as how I like to most things on my second, larger screen.(The first one being a much smaller, side screen) And as you might of guessed. It will always start up on the first screen, in windowed or fullscreen.The game itself, feels over priced for the amount of content it has; coming in at around £17.99 ($25) As you might of read from others. This seems to be in on going problem. I don't blame the creators for this too much as it is their blood, sweat and tears going into this. The game is very stylized and unique. But those bugs mentioned previously shouldn't have even been there in the first place, from my point of view. Seeing that as of right now I'm most likely going to have to find an alternative way to get the game to be playable.TL;DR•Game minimises if your cursor goes out of the boards of the window. (PATCHED)•It doesn't let you pick which screen you want it to start on. (PATCHED)•Very stylized, and unique•feels a bit over priced for the amount of content in said game.•extremely satisfyingAgain these problems might seem small, but you will never realize how much it matters until it happens.So as of right now, it's going to be a NO from me. Until these issues are fixed I wouldn't recommend buying this game currentlyEdit: This is around four or so hours after the creation of this review. The devs have done a day one patch. Resulting in the section of screens. Along with a few other fixes here and there. I'm glad to see they're still working hard even after the initial release on steam.Past this, I've completed the game. I'd say it takes around two hours to complete the story. But afterward you get a bunch of other modes. Adding some replay ability. I wont spoil any of them, but so far I've enjoyed it. The only actual complaint I would have at the given moment is the lack of versatility in maps. maybe a level editor would do the trick. Allowing players to theoretically create Infinite maps for the game. As of right now I'm not entirely sure how easy that would be. But one thing for sure, it would be a much welcomed edition.As the game stands right now, I would definitely buy it if it was on sale. but if you have the money to spare I'd pick it up also.The time I've had with the game after completion has been great. There is nothing quite as satisfying  as when a plan comes together."

A quick look left shows an assault rifle on the table, but another Red Dude is coming through the doorway just across ther room with a drawn pistol. You judge the distance, and race for the AR. As the weapon comes to rest in your hands, you hear Red Dude fire a shot. You come to a stop and turn towards the oncoming bullet.Time suddenly slows to a crawl.You take careful aim, pull the trigger, and fire three precise shots. As time again begins to flow forward, your first bullet impacts the oncoming pistol bullet, casuing them both to shatter and deflect. The other two shells go flying into the chest and upper arm of the last Red Dude, causing him to crumple to the floor.SUPER! HOT! SUPER! HOT!Time only moves when you move. This unique mechanic transforms this unique shooting game into a problem solving strategy game which would be perfectly in place as a Matrix training scenario for Neo.The graphics are simple, but striking.

Wait for a price drop if things such as challenges and things such as endless mode don't entice you enough to play this game more.The gameplay itself is still really really enjoyable. Superhot definitely has done something different and innovative with the FPS genre and it does make this game a blast to play. The ability to focus on time only when you move sets yourself up for some unique gameplay experiences and almost a puzzle-like experience as you have to figure out and plan what your next move will be so you don't wind up dead. That is something that I really enjoyed and I hope more future games begin to try new and innovative things like Superhot was able to accomplish.Campaign: The campaign is short, and I do mean short. I will say this,if you were able to play the beta or watch someone play the beta all the way through; you've seen about half of the entire campaign already. There are some new things that came from the beta and new abilities, but even with all the new things that happened with it, I was still actually able to beat the entire campaign in about an hour. That hour was even with a few amount of deaths as well.  Now I usually go a little faster through  my games than others, but even so; it shouldn't take me only one hour to beat an entire campaign. The campaign was fun though while  it did last, so at least I can say I don't regret my hour that I did spend playing it.Extras: Now here's where a lot of people are saying where the game is worth it, and honestly I can kind of half agree. Starting up, you alone get a bunch of mini games in the form of ASCII art and the such, which is really neat to sit around and toy with for some time if you're frustrated with the main story or extras, or you just want to really check everything out. It really is fun to sit and mess with those while you explore the menus and find new things hidden in the game. Now, also after you beat the game you get tons of new challenges such as Endless Mode, Speedrun mode, Katana mode and many more just to name a few. While these challenges can be fun, it also relies on the fact that you enjoyed the game enough to replay the same levels over and over, as that's all you can really do  for some of these modes (I haven't tried endless mode, but I do know that the challenges such as speedrun and katana mode just replay the same levels  from the campaign.) They do bring a nice challenge and a score attack-esque theme to the game, but they're only  worth your time if you personally can repeat and replay the levels again. A level editor would be very nice here, and I hope they support it enough  to add one in, which will definitely increase it's playtime.Other: There were a few parts where FPS would drop significantly. Having a GTX 950, 16gb of ram, and an FX-6100 processor, it was odd to have a lot of dropped frames, but it only happens when there's a significant amount of stuff happening. Hopefully this gets tweaked a bit, especially for some users with lower-end computers can handle it better becuase this game is a lot more harder when you're not playing at a smooth framerate.Conclusion: Despite how short the game was, I still had a blast playing it.  The gameplay is fun and innovative in a time where we need some games like this to spread out and show other developers (indie and AAA) to really break outside of the box and try something new. Albeit a short campaign, the amount of challenges and extras that are there are enough to give any time attack fanatic or the game spelunker a bunch of aspects to go and looking for with completing challenges, finding secrets, etc. However, based on it's 25 dollar price tag (or 22.49 up until March  3rd), unless you think you really  are going to love and enjoy every little aspect of the game, I'd suggest holding off a little bit until the price drops or a sale, or until there's maybe other things added to the game that will make it more worth the price that they're asking for. Hopefully, they'll add in new things such as a level editor for challenge modes, mod support maybe, and many other things that will continue to make this game even better.Final Rating:Gameplay: 9/10Campaign: 7/10Extras: 8/10Overall Rating: 8/10"

I have no regrets on purchasing this game (except that I could have been focusing more on my projects instead of playing).This game is like The Matrix, and I mean in more ways than just the awesome gameplay. The concept of time moving only when you do is executed really well here and the mechanics the games gives you are fun to mess around with and it feels like a puzzle/strategy games rather that the twitch shooter its playing in slow-motion. It's so much fun.The story itself is around 2-3 hours longs, which is pretty short (plus I wish they incorporated digging around in you in-game computer would be mandatory to progress the game but apparently that was a missed opportunity) but you'll probably spend most of your time in the endless mode just mowing down enemies. Also, that measly 2 hours of story can be multiplied if you try to do all the challenges (like the speedruns and katana-only) and also try to find all the secret terminals in the levels (seriously, try to find 'em all without a guide; I almost did except for 3) that turn out to be more screwed up that you would realize playing normally.I have been enjoying this game way more than I probably should have and I hope that there will be updates in the future that would add more levels or weapons (3 melee weapons and 3 guns seems bare-bones and I totally disagree with Totalbiscut that other guns wouldn't be fluff like having a true full-auto assault rifle, a pump-shotgun that'll hold more than 2 rounds, a rifle whose bullet would travel faster, etc.)In the end, this is a really fun game but if you want to wait it out and get it when the price lowers, that's understandable. This has been in production for a long while now but it seems to come up short.

That was enough to get the game and play through the entire campaign and a couple of challenges.For what they are trying to do with this game its actually pretty neat, the whole puzzles with guns aspect is neat and a couple of the levels are really challenging. Having said that I was able to figure out how to beat all of them within a couple of tries. Really just basic trial and error techniques will get you there it doesn't require anything super intense to figure out where the enemies are spawning and which ones have which guns. The only level I felt I sort of squeaked by on was the melee one where you're in the cage. That one took about 5 or 6 tries for me to figure out who needed to die first and how to move to avoid them while still hitting them.Its not game of the year or anything and I really think the price tag is a little bit steep for what is offered here. About an hour and a half of a campaign maybe two or three hours if you're just not getting it. The value does come up some with the endless mode and challenges unlocked at the end of the campaign so thats sure to add some time onto the game for me.The whole replay sharing thing from killstagram is neat but I don't really see myself using it. I just uploaded one to get the achievement for doing it.If you're looking for a fun little game that has a bit of a unique twist on a first person shooter and don't mind some mild frustration while you learn to deal with situations that seem incredibly unfair (none of them really are its just a matter of understanding the way they want you to move) its a good game. I'd suggest waiting for a bit more of a steam sale, 20 bucks is a bit much id say when you see it down in the 10 dollar range or lower its worth it."

If the latter is more down your alley, by all means, get this game ASAP. if, on the other end, you want a deep story that'll last long, look elsewhere, the story mode lasts for about an hour and a half and you then unlock endless mode (where you try to survive and kill as many red dudes as possible before eventually dying) and challenges, which recycles the main story levels and adds a twist to them, like only using the Katana or AD2013 mode where it's only guns + punches.All in all, if you're still unsure about the game, try to play it at a friend's if you can to make up your mind.

Much like what this game is about (This is going to be a really indepth review for those actually considering purchasing this game, so hold on)At it's core, SUPERHOT wants you to believe it's a real game, not a short indie game. To be fair, it is essentially an indie game but there's so much more to it.What would you do if you had an innovative game mechanic and a great physics engine? You would create a game like SUPERHOT. The game, if you take aside all it's other mechanics, is basically an innovate shooter where time only moves when you move. It's straightforward and could make a great, CHEAP game (Unfortunately this game is a bit below compared to its price), but the devs made it much more. Here's how:- THE DIFFICULTY: Holy crap is this game hard! You will be frustrated within your first 30 minutes into this game! I almost refunded the game because of Level 5, but Googled a tutorial instead.- STORY: The story, is honestly one of the best I've seen in previous years. Without spoiling much, it had an innocent non-complex, arcady tone to it, but it becomes much more of a conspiracy as the game goes on...

Endless is exactly what it says on the tin: survive as many enemies for as long as possible. Challenges are going through story mode, but with added twists: Can only use certain weapons the entire time, or revert to ""2013"" Mode, I.E the prototype. While these are fun game modes, and they are capable of padding out the game for a bit, they simply don't add enough.

However, there are some aspects of this game that I don't like.-I beat the main story mode in just under 2 hours.-The game breaks the 4th wall at various points.  Normally I love this kind of attention to detail and mastermind work, but in Superhot, I kinda hate it.-At the end of every round it shows you a replay of what you did.  I really like the replay feature, except the announcer voice keeps repeating ""SUPERHOT"" over and over again.  It gets REALLY annoying and makes me not want to watch replays.  If the announcer said SUPERHOT 1x and then showed the replay, then I'd be ok with it.-The game can get laggy when multiple objects are rendered (glass breaking/falling, bullets, death particles... etc)Aside from these few glaring issues (imo) the game is really fun and I will continue to play it for the challenges, endless modes, and (hopefully) continued release of content."

I just beat the main story (~2.5 hrs) and have to say I was thrilled to find that after you beat it, it unlocks challenge modes (katana only, speedrun, etc) as well as an endless mode meant for high-score runs.These unlocked modes add TONS of replayability and defintely add some value to the game.I would consider the price tag a little high still, but damn is this game fun.8.5/10 would recommend."

,Recommended,322500,21475137,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Calcographer,"Not to spoil too much, I'll simply lay out the mechanics...Everytime you move, time advances. You'll see and be able to dodge bullets midflight. Weapons fly out of enemy hands (of which if you're close enough, you can grab), and an aesthetic that is incredibly unique. You'll be running, punching, jumping, throwing, and shooting. You'll create some rad combos, and then watch them occur in real time via the replay once the level is complete.Here's a couple tips:Mentioned previously, time advances when you advance. This includes ANY movement, even if you're just turning your head to look at an incoming projectile or to grab a weapon, time is moving. Albeit slowly with head turns and the like, but it is moving.Also, get familiar with each gun and how many shots are fired from each. You'll find yourself strategizing mid shootout when to throw your weapon into an enemy to continue your combo. Later in the game, most enemies have a weapon later in the game. Priortize! Nothing is more satisfying than chaining together a handful of actions moving from one enemy to the next, all while using their weapons against them.There is controversy regarding the length versus the price. I spent 4.6 hours on the main campaign. Don't be fooled by this. There is much more content in challenges, modes, and other various quirks in the ""computer"" you're operating, both during the main campaign, and post campaign.Either way, let me know what you think. I greatly enjoyed it, and applaud the devs on creating an awesome experience.Cheers."

First, I love the slow-motion feature, particularly because time's not truly ""stopped"" when you're not moving.Second, I love the fact that there are a LOT of references to some obscure movies, like Oldboy. The game is, in large part, a number of different set pieces from various action movies that you play out in bullet-time. Is it fun? Oh yeah. So much fun. I love the feeling of satisfaction I get from solving the ""puzzle"" of how to move around the levels and in what order to kill the red dudes. I also love that you can cut bullets with a katana. And the fact that you can beat an entire level by throwing bottles at guys (it takes a while). Oh, also wanted to mention the fact that you can save your runs so that when you do pull off that perfect action movie combo, you can record it and put it up on Killstagram! :DYou might be questioning the price, but from what I've seen, they plan to be very active as developers, and release content in a lot of small packages, rather than just nickel-and-dime you with DLC every couple months. So, if you enjoy FPS and the ability to fight in slow motion,  I'd say the whole thing is definitely worth the money. I suppose one way to put it is... if you're in it to just beat a game, nah, you're better off waiting for a sale. But if you're wanting to be creative with your kills and gameplay, and want to be a part of something bigger than yourself, it's very worth it."

Superhot's hook mechanic of time moving only when you move is not itself a new idea, but it's expertly applied here.As time stops for you in between every shot, step and punch, your enemies have moved and every time you slow to plan your next move, you must reevaluate the scene over again. Allowing the player time to think in this kind of 'one and you're done' action setting is a golden idea, and the execution doesn't fall into the pitfall of 'bullet time' that many other games do. You have all the same faculties as your enemies, you can't move faster than them, and they'll predict your movements to shoot or flank to your predicted position, the advantage you have is planning time, while still giving you the feeling that your reactions are instantaneous and fluid.Superhot has a nice balanced bite to it's difficulty as well- it isn't the manic 50% luck of hotline miami but it will still push you to be quick on the uptake as enemies are no slouches when it comes to trying to put you out.The aesthetic of the game suits the mood- everything is colour-washed and minimalist, with an eerie, sometimes calm feeling throughout, much to a counterpoint of hotline miami's neon insanity.Sound effects are crisp and defined, a shot from any weapons sounds and feels weighty, and all sound effects distort to the tune of your time-warping excellently.Recommended for those who like their lethal action with a bit of brainwork involved."

Let's get this out of the way first: the pricing is a little steep. If this game went of about £10 or so, it would be just right, but even so, the game is utterly brilliant and beautiful that you probably won't care. SUPERHOT's main game mechanic allows you to control time; in a sense. There is no button to pause it or anything like that, but it's only when you move that time does as well. This allows for amazing crazy fights, plus all of the combined fighting equipment, ranging from pistols and shotguns, to crowbars and bats; even everyday obejcts like TVs, pool balls and power drills. Of course, there had to be a katana, which you can slice bullets in half with by the way.The game's plot and overall story is short but sweet. After you have taken the couple of hours to complete it, endless levels and challenges are unlocked, which are the best part of SUPERHOT. There are lots of different main menu easter eggs and extras that are somewhat fun to browse through. but they are merely a distraction.If you want it in simple terms, here:Pros:-Beautiful game in both gameplay and art design-Original and awesome game mechanics-Addicting and exhiliratingCons:-Somewhat steep on pricing for what's in the game so it is recommended you get it on sale if you are unsure about itOverall, brilliant and magical; a strange homage to Martix styled fighting and Quentin Tarantino paced action."

The campaign is about 2-3 hours long depending on how good you are, and a lot of that time will be spent trying to finish the last level which was almost as painful as some of the flooding missions in Ori: The Blind Forest. Anyways, the story was really interesting and good, but this game isn't supposed to be something you are interested in for the campaign, it's the concept and the many modes that come after beating the story that set it apart. So the basic concept is time pratically stands still until you start moving. Tiny movements (such as turning your head) speed time up slightly while big movements (such as walking) speed time up to regular speed. I would honestly say this is almost more puzzle than FPS similarly to how some stealth games are more puzzler than it is an FPS or third person shooter. This game has tons of replayablitity because there are a ton of modes/challenges that you can unlock after finishing the story.I would have to say this is definetly one of the most innovative shooters I've played in years! super fun and highly reccommend if you are looking for a ""dumb fun"" type game with a little bit of a puzzle twist.I do have some complaints 1) sometimes it's hard to tell where you get hit from, or wheather or not something should have hit you which can be annoying. and 2) I saw a shotgun blast go through a pillard and then kill me a couple times on the last level (unfortunatly I didn't get time to screenshot it before I died). Lastly I know some people are mad that it is Oculus exculsive and I get that but I'm not interested in getting VR anytime soon so it doesn't bother me in any way and I'd still reccommend it."

Even if you haven't played many FPS games, you'll know instantly what's going on, allowing you to focus on the puzzle side of the game - the puzzle of how you kill those red dudes. And even then, the game manages to pull out some novel takes on its formula - the Elevator Pitch level is a ♥♥♥♥ing great take on using your fists to get the upper hand on three people with guns pointed at you point-blank.Some whiners say that the three-hour campaign is too little story for $25. But they're also ignoring the wealth of challenges, the Endless mode, and the various secrets built into the game. And even if we're judging the game entirely by its entire campaign - SUPERHOT has a really well done, solid campaign, one that hits its mark, never misses a beat, and knows exactly where to start and when to quit. I'd rather have a campaign that is three hours long, artfully paced, knowing how best to deliver its thrills, and is concluded properly rather than a campaign that takes fifteen hours, wears out its welcome, and farts out a conclusion that makes me never want to play the game again after I'm done. Have we learned nothing from ♥♥♥♥ing Portal, a game that is almost flawless and just two hours long? Meeting an arbitrary goal of how much time your game consumes does not make a game good.The only real complaint I have is that I don't know if the stuff between the campaign levels is going to hold up for me down the line? I imagine myself old and toothless, and I'll scream WHAT IS THIS DOS♥♥♥♥♥♥ I NEED TO KILL THE RED PEOPLE. And then I'll throw my cellphone at the TV and have to be sent to work in the salt mines on the Plutonian Asteroid and Old Folks' Home. Being old is going to suck, but at least I'll always have Superhot!"

That and the loading screen between levels (the sound is mostly the issue) is very off putting, to the point where I will request a refund on the game.I can see where they are going with it, but whatever story they are trying to pursue is simply ruined by these elements. It's a real shame because were it not for these things I would happily keep playing. But it's so intrusive it ruins the immersion and gave me headache.Also, I can't find any way of changing the default keys from WASD. So if you're used to this it's fine I guess.

Ontop of that, the meta-style plot was very well done and borders on hypnotic, which is something I've never really seen before, even in games that have tried similar things.My biggest and only problem with the game is the price tag. I beat the entire game inn 2 hours, and it's not like I was good at it, I failed tons. For a game this length I'm used to seeing pricetags closer to 5 dollars, seeing the price tag of 30CDN, I was expecting at least 10-15 hours of game, but the main story lasted a mere two, and really I COULD have done it much faster if I was rushing.Regardless of how fun I found the game I find it hard to justify considering this was more expensive per time spent than any other game I've ever played. It's basically $15/hour for the base game. Compared to say, Left4Dead2, which cost a similar amount, and I spent 10-15 hours to get through the base game.If this game were cheaper, I'd recommend it 100%, but honestly, the pricetag is just too damn high. So I recommend it, if it goes on sale for half price or cheaper."

The devs have stated that it will come to ALL VR headsets with hand tracking controllers eventually, and this will not effect regular SUPERHOT. Calm the ♥♥♥♥ down. Reviewing the game poorly because of the devs descision regarding the VR experience and not on the gameplay itself is completely ridiculous. This review will be based off of the gameplay and my personal experience with SUPERHOT and not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery that is the rest of these reviews.SUPERHOT is one of the most innnovative first person shooters i have ever experienced in my gaming life. It provides A new challenge to the average Gamer to think differently about how they approach a battle using a rarely used mechanic, time. The story in the main part of the game is amazing, it makes you feel as though the game is really comeing alive and there is something sinister about what your doing and why your killing these red guys. With the endless and challenge modes the player is able to extend their experience with SUPERHOT and challenge thier friends in time trail like challenges and test their SUPERHOT skills in a variety of challenges. With soon to come FREE DLC, i can see myself spending alot more time in the world of SUPERHOT.In conclusion, great game, would definetly reccomend it to my mates, 25 bucks may seem a bit expensive but for me it was worth it.

I feel the best way sell how good this game is, is by telling you firsthand instead of trying to describe it.To put it bluntly, Superhot is probably the only game that lets you jump around the corner of an office cubicle in slow motion, then launch a katana from your hand while sailing through the air to pierce two people straight through the chest and literally turn them into a f'king kebab.Superhot is probably the only game where I can kill a large group of heavily armed enemies just by throwing bottles and glasses at them.Superhot is probably the only game where I can throw my weapon at somebody to make them drop their weapon, then sail through the air, grab their weapon in slow motion, fly directly out a nearby window, turn in a full 180 and then fire back at the person I stole the weapon from while sailing out a window to my death.Superhot allows for so much freedom in how you play. Whether you sit back and slowly and methodically kite each enemy towards you while you whittle them down slowly, or you go cartwheeling through a big maze of bullets defending yourself with random clutter items left on the floor and impaling everyone with a katana, it's pretty strategic. Each level pits you against a certain amount of ""Red Dudes"", who you fight. You can use whatever you want to in order to defeat them, and it's that freedom to dive around the room, dodging bullets in slow motion that makes Superhot so hectic and fun.It's also got a story, and quite a trippy one at that. The main game only lasts about 2 hours, which is hardly worth the 20 euro price tag, but Superhot also comes with two other modes, both of which are filled with extra content. So far, I'm over 10 hours into the game and still nowhere near bored, and keep in mind, I'm only playing this at 20 frames. If I can play a fast paced game that requires a high framerate at 20 frames and it keeps drawing me back into it every time I try to do something more productive, you can assume the game is addictive.The only cons of Superhot are the hit detection. Man, the hit detection. For a game that requires such surgical precision, it's surprisingly bad. I can't seemingly fit between two bullets, even though the gap between them is definitely big enough. I throw a katana at someone but it goes right through them. I throw a clutter item at someone to stun them and it just bounces off them without having any effect. The hit detection needs an improvment.Other than that, the spawn points on Endless mode are very messy. When an enemy spawns, they'll go through a short ""fade-in"" animation. The problem is, you can't see them during the animation but they can still fire at you. To add to this, enemies can spawn directly behind you, and there's nothing worse than losing a killstreak because someone suddenly appeared behind you with no warning, and then just filled your back with lead.Other than those two small gripes, the game is perfect for anyone who enjoys bullet time, shooters and fast-paced, hectic gameplay.*SUPERHOT IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS!"

A quote from the game ""you are treating the system like a toy. It is not a toy. It is a tool"" (except in all capital letters)sorry developers, you're not sending a message through a first person shooter, a first person shooter is a toy, it is a game.  the only tool here is you guys, who came up with a great mechanic, and interesting gameplay, then went and found the most inane ""message"" you could send and ran with it.  this ""tool"" is trying too hard to be art, it should just be a game, games are enjoyable, there is A LOT of enjoyability here, but the developers went out of the way to try to ""control the experience so [the user] is just a pawn that we move around"" a message that's been delivered in a lot better ways a hundred times over already.I get it, you control the horizontal and the vertical, its a huge surprise.  In the meantime the game lasts ~3 hours, (when it could've gone for so much longer if they pulled their heads out of their asses and gave the community any amount of control, instead what replayability is there are the same levels designed by the same thickskulled developers, no community support even though the community is obviously there and ready to make contributions) and once you've played it for an hour you can probably finish the last 2 just off of common tropes.the mechanic is AWESOME, and it will be re-created someday by a developer who cares more about creating an awesome platform for other people to build off of, rather than these knuckleheads who want an entirely closed system to send their own [[very generic]] message.I was soooo excited when I first saw this game on youtube many years ago, but I could never justify the price based off of what I saw.  It finally went on sale and I honestly feel like I paid too much for it even at sale price.  Especially with the lack of content.  I'm not mad, just really disappointed with the potential this game had, and after however many years its been in development to see this little content, and nixxed community support, its just really meh.great gameplay, but it could've been so much more.half of the time in game (if you are quick about the actual gameplay elements) will be spent not with the game you see in the videos, but on a ""chat screen"" with, well the generic antagonist, or being railroaded through ""interactive cutscenes""...  really there was so much potential!!"

So as a backer i would feel a bit betrayed after i gave so much money for this project only to see, that a lot of things that were promised are not there.Next Point is, that the game is SUPERSHORT. The main story is made out of 26 level or so. And the level are short, really short. I finished the main story, which i won´t spoiler here, in about 112 Minutes.After the main story there isn´t much to do. There are 9 arena maps or so and some challanges, where you have to complete the main story with some different conditions, and 2 mingames. So there isn´t much to do.Also the game is getting boring after a short amount of time because the whole game is made out of ONE game mechanic, not more. ""Time moves only when you move."" That is the only feature that the developers could create in two years. And the idea of this mechanic is really cool, and i liked it, but you can´t build a game out of one mechanic, which is getting boring after 90 minutes.On Top of that, the story i mentioned earlier is a short and meaningless story, of a guy who is playing SUPERHOT.At least there is a Replay feature. But this feature is a mess and hard to use. it takes a huge amount of time to record your run. Maybe im just stupid, but it took me about 15 minutes to figure out, how to upload my replays to this weird SUPERHOT Instagramm Rip-off.And here a nice hint for the developers. Don´t use a white Color for the letters, when the whole background of the game, basically the whole game is white too.So, my final statement is, i would not recommend this game for this price. 22 Euros is way too much for this short and tiny game. The things, that are there are cool, but there are so many things missing, like a level editor, which is necessary for a game with only 26 level, better graphics, more level, more game mechanics. In my opinion the game is not worth its 22 Euros, 5 to 7 Euros would be a much better price.After the first short demo and two years of developement, the developers came out with this unfinished game. It is a shame, that people backed so much, and got ""betrayed"".I could have easily get a refund for this game after its main story, cause it is so short, but i didn´t because the game has potential. I really hope, that the developers will step up and update this game with a level ediot, maybe a graphics update, or maybe they will add more level by themselves, but in this state i would not recommend this game"

The main story, FOR THOSE WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILERS of course, follows a friend giving you a program called Superhot.exe, which appears to be a VR video game, but the further you play it, the further it shows that's not just a really cool puzzle with a neat mechanic. The group behind Superhot.exe goes out of their way to try and stop you from continuing with the 'game', but you find yourself addicted to the point where you keep trying to play it anyway, leading up to the climax of the game, where you kill your physical body in order to become one with the system, and be able to play Superhot as long as you want to.

,Recommended,322500,29427631,Posted: 22 January,all,Gun Tech.,"These guys are smart and skilled ;) Simple idea, short game, but well made, and very fresh!Let's say you were roughed up and now you all you think about is what you could have done, how it should have gone down beating up everybody. This game lets you do that :)I finished it and did most of the achievements which was fun, took 6 hours. For me it doesn't last long after that (maybe I'll play the unlocks more later), but I still say it's totally worth $20.I think most gamers would enjoy the short and sweet stay. If you're good at shooters, you will get a new way to play them, if you're bad at shooters you'll still be able to finish it, the challenges are pretty short and it's most about figuring out a different way to complete them. That's my favorite part of the game and there's tons of ways to finish them, it's not linear in that way.Short, sweet singleplayer gem, top quality. It just can't be faulted, so 10/10. Anyone can play this and enjoy it I think."

,Not Recommended,322500,34075003,Posted: 6 August,all,General Kass,"SUPERHOT proves that innovative and fun are not mutually exclusive.I’m sure you already know the premise here. A first person shooter where time moves as you do. You may notice that 90% of reviews of this game use the exact phrase “the most innovate shooter I’ve played in years.” It’s hard to say if those are sincere opinions since you'll learn that line is synonymous with classics like “would you kindly” and “the cake is a lie.” It’s a disingenuous meme that halts actual discussion about the game.As I vaguely allude to the story, I’ll say this: I thought it was really predictable. Here’s a challenge: Play the game up until you get thrown back to the main menu for the first time. Then write down what you think the story is. Odds are, you’re probably very close if not on the nose.So here’s where we get into the gameplay itself. The gameplay is OK. It’s very very ok. Although the entire game relies on a time mechanic, SUPERHOT isn’t as good as other games’ time mechanics. A number of needless pain points arise because of the time mechanic. For example, doing an action (like picking up a weapon) jumps time forward 0.30 seconds, while normal walking moves time 0.10 seconds a step. Bending over to pick up that pistol can have you immediately killed because not only does it move time forward 0.30 seconds, you're also moving the camera down and then back up and then on an enemy, all of which waste time. To put all this into context, a lot of speedrun missions have a par time of 4.00 seconds. Just picking up a weapon uses 1/13th of that total time.This should not have been a first person shooter. Neither the art style or the gameplay complement a first person shooter. Why? First of all, your hitbox is bigger than your screen. Bullets will clearly whiz above your head and then immediately kill you. There’s no crouch button and no way to know if you actually dodged the bullet until it kills you. This could have been solved with a third person shooter where you can see your hitbox.Another pain point of the FPS is that a lot of missions in the second half drop you in the center of the action. This means that enemies will spawn from all directions. But wait a second, time moves as you do. So spinning the camera 180 degrees moves time forward 4-5 seconds. Again, there’s no crouch feature; you can’t take cover behind that pool table. Add to this that enemies make a sound when they die and when they fire their guns, but they don’t make a sound when they appear. Due to the game’s minimalist style, there’s almost no sound at all. This means that you often won’t know enemies spawned behind you until your corpse hits the floor.SUPERHOT isn’t a puzzle game as many would have you believe. It’s more like Hotline Miami if you died every time you looked behind you. Yet every single problem in the last two paragraphs could be solved if this game was third person. With a third person camera we could see the enemies coming without breaking the flow and you could still have a minimalist and mostly soundless art direction BUT allow players to inform themselves about the environment.Also, I have to laugh and laugh and laugh that the game's description calls itself ""polished."" Bullets, especially from shotguns will often go through walls. Don't believe me? Try the train level. If the hitboxes on the PC are poorly defined and the hitboxes on the buildings are poorly definied, then the devs still have a lot of work to do, even a 1.5 years after release.I won’t spoil, but the game doesn’t even properly use its full arsenal. Toward the end of the game, you’re granted a game-changing feature. The problem is that they take it away for the finale. To understand what an objectively bad piece of game design that is, think about how most games teach. You learn how to play and you’re tested on that element. Then you learn some more and you use what you learned before with the new. SUPERHOT’s finale is like spending a week studying for a math test. The assigned homework is ¾ multiplication and ¼ division. Then the day of the test comes and none of the questions mention division. That’s SUPERHOT.For a $20 game with a 2-hour run time, I can’t recommend SUPERHOT to anyone, despite it’s positive reputation. The gunplay is more irritating than innovate due to the previously mentioned design choices that make the game more trial and error than puzzle. The story kept me going, but ultimately disappointed. But hey, at least we got some memes.If you like paying too much for too little, by all means, buy SUPERHOT."

If you enjoyed the prototype from a few years back, you'll definitely enjoy the final product. It's the same basic concept, with more options available.The levels are all tightly designed. I felt smart when I discovered a new way to 'solve' a level.

From a technical point, the campaign is very well structured – a mix of tutorial and difficulty curve that proves that the developers know what they’re doing, but oh man, that narrative!It's one of those rare instances of Sci-Fi done well – dark; intelligent; futuristic but rooted in the modern world.  It takes 2-4 hours to complete, depending on your skill level and how solidly you play, but that doesn’t mean it's lacking in any way. People will be discussing this for years.Replay ValueOnce you've completed the main game, there's also a whole bunch of challenges - they're levels lifted directly from the main campaign, but with a tweaked rule set, such as completing the level in the least amount of steps, or having more portalable surfac- Wait. No, I'm reviewing the wrong game here.Look, i'm not saying SUPER HOT is the new Portal, but I find it very hard to agree with reviews that put it down for being too expensive or not having enough content. The story length and quality are comprable, and even the price isn't too different when you consider the companies involved. The wealth of challenge modes put Portal to shame, and reddit is already pouring over the game for hidden material.Don't dismiss it just yet, okay?summaryIf you like dark sci-fi, and I mean actually dark, you’ll love the story, and you should get on it before the spoilers come out.If you like speed-running or ARGs, there's a whole swathe of goodies for you here.If you like unique games with strong mechanics, and want to see more risks being taken by smaller companies, then you should totally consider paying full price."

However, as you progress through the game, the cutscenes become longer and longer and the missions becomes shorter and shorter. This first person shooter increasingly becomes an iChat hack outlining today's issues ranging from government surveliance to technological advances to even media escapism. Furthermore, I gave it the rating that I did because the game now doesn't play for more than a few minutes before freezing. I must say that I am using a Mac Mini from several years ago (updated periodically noless though). To reiterate, the game is exciting, but it eventually exhausts the player as you progress by shoving down your throat its conspiracy ideals - and it's a real shame."

Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. SUPERHOT nailed it.The game overall is based around its gameplay, and more specifically its gameplay mechanics. Time only moves when you move. You use this to your advantage to plan out the fight and make intricate dodges or shots. Honestly this mechanic IS the game, so if you're looking for groundbreaking multiplayer experiance or story you're not going to be satisfyed with SUPERHOT.That being said, I think most every game should get this game as it is unique and very enjoyable. I can already tell I will be spending many hours on this game trying to get perfect runs, testing my limits and challenging myself. It has amazing replayablity and is well worth the price.Overall Rating 8/10Story - 4/10As I said before this game was not based off of story. However it does have some inside of it that drew me in to some degree. It kept things mildly intresting though it wasn't what made me keep booting up the game after leaving for work in the morning.Game play - 9/10I am really hesitant to give this game a full 10 for its gameplay. The only two things that are holding it back is two very small things that most probably don't care about. This game has no ability to run, keeping your movement at a crawl when you are trying to move around a map. Most of the time this plays into your favor, other times it can be a slight annoyance. The other thing is the inability to crouch, which would give you the ability to dodge more attacks and help with the overall game in my oppion. Either way the gameplay of SUPERHOT is phenominal and the mechaincs of it are amazing. Like i said before, this game is built around its gameplay.Replayability - 8/10This game will pull you back to it undoubtably. You feel like a badass and want to get that run perfect and feel a sense of satisfaction when you do. I personally found myself up much later than I usually am just becasuse I was so engrossed in the game. The next day at work it was on my mine frequently and I found myself booting it up as soon as I got home.Style - 9/10I am weird and judge a game highly by how it looks. If something is ugly I am not going to spend more than a few minutes looking at it, and thats only if it's an intresting ugly. Superhot is a minimalistic art style that plays extreamly well into its gameplay and its performance. I would be suprised to find a computer that couldn't run this and have it look good. The game's art style is simple, yet functional and elegant.Depth - ?/10Unfortunatly I cannot say as to how deep this game will go with its progression system. While it is already very good and offers quite a few rewards for completeing certian challenges or getting so far in endless ect. There has been hints are more to come. Right now I would give it a 6/10 just because it seems like there is only small modifications to gameplay and new maps. However there is no really unique enemies or weapons to experiment with, which isn't terrible, thoguh it would add another layer to the game to make it more intresting.Anyways those are my thoghts on SUPERHOT. I would recomend this game to anyone in a heartbeat, so if you're still reading this review, scroll up, click add to cart, and buy the game already!"

Pricetag vs content wise, there are 33ish levels, each of which is pretty damn good. Each level is playable in both an initial story mode, and a series of pretty consistently entertaining challenge modes. One of the challenge modes forces you to play through the whole game with only a katana. The katana can cut bullets in half. There's also a speedrun mode, for people who like that kind of thing. If you've played the demo and absolutely loved it, or you thought ""This was fun, but it needs the ability to cut through enemy bullets as you dodge and weave toward them and cut their head off,"" this is probably worth the money. If you've played the demo and you don't immediately feel the need to own the full thing, wait for a sale.

,Recommended,322500,21530417,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,Mayo,"I've been following SUPERHOT for a while now. Played the demo countless times.While I applaud the developers for their innovative ideas in gameplay and the fact that the game was released as a completed title I have mixed feelings for recommending this title. My original post was going to be a NO but I changed it at the last minute. So, this YES review will likely read as a NO.The largest overwhelming issue is the length of the game. Not only is the whole game easily beaten in a single two or three hour sitting but the levels themselves are small and short. You spend as much time in the menus and 'cut scenes' as you do fighting. Some of the beginning levels are so basic and short that they take less than a minute to finish.Difficulty was also a bit of a let down. Unlimited mode gets a bit more exciting but the story itself (which you have to finish to get unlimited mode) was extremely easy for me.While some may like the visual aesthetics I can't help but wonder what this game would have been like with a graphical overall. This is minor as the game did not pretend to be something it wasn't, but I can't help but feel a little frustrated that I built a powerful gaming PC to play 'indie' titles. Again, this is more of a personal complaint though.Speaking of difficulty and personal complaints, I really disliked the 'hot switching' function in the game. This single handedly made the game insanely easy for me. So much so I just decided not to use it. I understand it's reasoning within the game's story but I just wasn't a huge fan of it.Lastly, the biggest reason I can't suggest this game, is the price. At nearly $25 (or $22.49 as of right now) it's just not meaty enough. The levels are short. The mechanics are amazing, but simple and not really explored much throughout the game.However, after typing all of this up and thinking of the experience I had and that fact I've been playing it on and off as a quick fun game on breaks and inbetween work, I have to say I enjoy it quite a bit. Yes, it's kind of shallow in a lot of ways, and it's probably not worth the money for the amount of content it has in it, but I would recommend people at least look into it. So, I'm going to go back to the beginning and change it from a NO to a YES."

I definitely plan on playing through the other challenges because the gameplay is just that good. Even though the game slows movement to a crawl, waiting for your next move, there is a frenetic undercurrent that pushes you to do better and make more stylistic kills each time you play a level. There's something so satisfying about watching your replay in realtime and seeing if your moves looked as good as you had hoped. Hotline Miami is the only game I can think of that gives the same sense of satisfaction when you complete a level. Superhot is great."

I was excited to play since I've been waiting for the full game since the first one came out online a few years ago. I loved the game. Even though the story was short, it was interesting and I find the other gamemodes to be pretty entertaining. The main problem I have is that the game crashes all. The. Time. It crashes almost every other game on endless mode and sometimes on other gamemodes it'll turn this weird gradient color and I have to restart. Overall, it's really intuitive and creative, but the crashes are so frustrating that it's hard for me to give it a positive review. If these bugs were fixed, I'd say it's 10/10."

SUPER HOT.Joking aside, SUPERHOT has a really cool mechanic allowing time to flow only when you move, making this unlike traditional FPS games. It's great because anyone can play this with ease, and is especially nice for first-time FPS players. It's more of a strategy game in the fact that instead of just running around just killing red dudes, you have to analyze the environment to see what you can do to beat the levels. The best thing about this is: you (almost) have all the time in the world to figure this plan out. Watch where they run, what weapons they're using, and dodge the bullets flying past you. Plan the assult as you go.Other than that, the visual and art style is amazing, and it's so satisfying to see the replay of what you did in real time once you complete a level. You feel like neo from the matrix, or the most badass soldier ever. To top it all of, it has a computer sim aspect to it (which is a personal favorite theme of mine when it come to games), which really emphasizes the techicality of the gameplay and the story plot.If you're looking for a shooter that is basic, easy, and feels so satisfying to play, this is your game.SUPERHOT.

I really like the concept of time moving at regular speed only when you move. Turning yourself around makes time flow a little bit while idling makes time move probably at Unity Engine's slowest rate. This is a slow strategic shooter, not a fast-paced on-your-toes shooter.There is a frustration factor because you can die with just one hit, but it mostly tolerable because the levels are short enough where that won't be the case for long after some practice. For low end machines, this game could become quickly unplayable. I have a guide that should explain better:http://www.steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails?id=824619568The campaign is pretty short, but most of your fun will come from trying the endless and challenge modes. This is where the mechanics really get interesting because this is where you can try some insane maneuvers and rack up some kills.The only thing that can make this game better is maybe a rewind feature. Can't have it all the time so maybe like the ""switch bodies"" mechanic, have similar limitations.Overall, definitely recommend, although the game is a bit too pricy for what it has to offer."

Worse than shallow gameplay mechanics, worse than shallow level design, and a pretty much nonexistent or nonsensical at best plot. And you are done with it in 4 to 5 hours. That's basically it. I'm not even talking about graphics neither, which is not important but I'm kinda not surprised that they chose such a lazy style as well, it's like cherry on top all things considered. And they have the nerve to sell this for more than twice the price of a common indie game of the same scale, this dev team of ours apparently saw their own product to be ""too special"" to lower the price to the common small indie game price. ""Hah, we are not common peasants, we've got a gamejam award and youtubers played our demo! Nope, we'll be selling a brand here""And the only thing they've marketed is just an unique idea. It's not even a game that ""redefines FPS"" or ""changes the game market forever"". It doesn't change the scene, it didn't affect anything. If it were, there would have been thousands of clones by now. It's just an unique idea, and developers decided to make an♥♥♥♥♥out of themselves with it. All things considered, this game is not even worth to buy even in sale anyways. You just pay that much money, and what? Experience that time only moves faster than what it is while you were standing? And you shoot some guys and see they shatter like a glass panel while you cannot even see how much ammo you've left in your UI? Play for 2 hours, and then throw away, never to be visited again, lol. No but, no thanks. If you agree with what I said, you shouldn't be supporting devs who are overpricing their games as well anyways.This is nothing short of developer arrogance in my point of view. This game doesn't deserve nowhere near what it's priced versus what it's contents are. It deserves 9.99, at best! Yeah, you can be popular, but don't think that you'll avoid my negative review if you go over your head and overprice your product. Yeah that's what you should get."

The story is short, but it's an interesting mind-flip sandwiched with an interesting core-mechanic (in that, time only moves when you do). The core mechanic, though, is what's being sold and it should be noted that - aside from the mind-flip - it's what you should base your $20.If you had a date, and they cancelled on you, and you now have $20, go ahead and spend it on SuperHot. Or, wait until it goes on sale for $10. There is likely enough content here for you to spend many hours on, but you should be sure you really enjoy the core mechanic first."

The level design and weapons complement the mechanics very nicely. It's like they turned a FPS directly into a puzzle game where the puzzle is how to kill everyone. The storyline is great also. It starts off mysterious, and you unlock secrets and knowledge as it goes along making it very entertaining. I had played the original Demo that they made. So I've been waiting for this game for a long time. And I am glad to report, that I am not disappointed."

However this  game gives you the ability to dodge bullets throw cups and smack people with bats. This game is one of the most incredible game i have played. If i still haven't convinced you to buy this game then what if i told you that in this game you could...Throw a katana at a man with a shotgun grab his gun spin around the shoot his friend in the head spin around again throw the shotgun at someone else grab their pistol shoot them throw your gun in the air and just start punching people.So if this doesn't sound like your kind of game then i would like to recomend that you go and play something like gamedev tycoon.

Steam's refund policy ""will refund for any reason if purchased within 14 days and has been played less than 2 hours."" BTW I did not stop at 119min on purpose, it just happened. I wasn't even rushing through the game at all, and didn't even know the refund policy until I was done, because $15 for <2 hours is not okay.P.S. Steam might show 2.0 hours, but in my library it says 119min, so they're rounding, which is making the refund not instant (unless they're usually not instant; I've never refunded on Steam before)."

It plays more like a puzzle game, with each level presenting a unique situation and multiple solutions to progressing. Death is frequent, but the rapid respawn means it doesn't get frustrating.While the campaign itself is short, about twelve other modes unlock, all allowing for score or challenge based replayability. Rather, the short story feels like a tutorial for the rest of the game.SUPERHOT manages to always make you feel like the star of a John Woo movie, and the amount of depth hidden in challenges is staggering.NOTE: I played the game before VR support happened. Since the base price didn't change, I so no reason to complain about VR exclusivity as a free addition to the product. The base experience of SUPERHOT is still stellar enough to recommend."

Challenges cut away a lot of the fluff of the story mode and focus entirely on gameplay, with each challenge requiring you to follow a set of forced rules (katana only or one bullet per gun) and are really fun. Endless mode is basically survival and can be a lot of fun when stringing together 5 or 6 kills in a few seconds.It still feels like the movement and animation are unfinished, and I've come undone thanks to a few infrequent bugs (thrown items passing through enemies, sword range changing from swing to swing) but those issues are rare and I've enjoyed most of the time I've spent with the game."

Which is saying something, because it looks like a cool idea from the very beginning. It starts out like the advertisments say it will be; a FPS where time stops when you stop moving. Which in itself is pretty cool; it makes the game kind of like a crossover between an FPS and a puzzle game, like Portal, except a lot more tactical and less physics-based. It also is slightly challenging, and gives you the same sense of ""no fair, I need to try again"" that you get from Risk of Rain. And then beyond this amazing exterior lies something... quite different. I won't spoil anything, all I will say is that it gets very, very trippy at points. All in all, it's definitely worth it!"

This is one of the most innovative shooters of our time and I was overjoyed when I saw that it had finally made it to steam. I had played the early online version of this game many years ago when it was just an idea, and was blown away at the concept. The premise of the game is that you have to kill a bunch of red dudes through a variety of different settings in a world where time only moves when you do. This makes for some seriously epic and fun slow-motion gameplay. You may not think there would be a story to this game, but there is, and it's a creepy one at that. (The ending is also fantastic) The art style is also something to note here: the red glass-like bad guys on top of the simplistic white background makes this game feel like a work of art.

While there's some truth to this (I finished it in about three hours myself, give or take some minutes), I think a big part of that criticism comes from differing expectations of what someone hopes to find in a game like this. If you're the sort of gamer who plays through the campeign mode of the games they purchase and then moves on to the next one, you'll probably be disappointed. If however you're the kind of gamer who focuses heavily on mastering the games they play, always seeking to best their previous time or get the next high score, then superhot has a lot to offer that sort of mindset."

,Recommended,322500,21831163,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,Chuckle Butt,"SUPERHOT is essentially a first-person shooter in which you combat faceless, nude men who are made entirely out of glass and Hot Cheetos and live in a digital dimension in the sky where all non-static objects are white and all static objects are black and made of glass. The unique bullet-time mechanic only allows time to flow when you move your character. Weapons include pistols, shotguns, and rifles with finite ammo which can be thrown to stun an enemy as well as baseball bats and katanas. The katana is by far the most powerful weapon because it can kill an enemy with one hit and it doesn't break, even when thrown. You can also use random objects in the game as melee and/or thrown weapons. Following a fairly short story mode, you can unlock Endless Mode and Challenge Mode which offer several levels of addtional content. But yeah, for the most part, you're just going to be killing some Red Guys. This game is a very refreshing, challenging, unique, and innovative shooter that also offers room for strategy, a good buy for it's full price but if you don't want to splurge, you should definitely get it when it's on sale if you're interested."

The twist to it, is that time only moves when you move. If you are standing completely still, time will move at an extremely slow pace. Turn your head, and time will move at half speed. Walk or jump, and time moves at full speed. You may think that this would make the game much too easy, however you are always outnumbered, and a single shot or punch kills you. That's right, no health bars, no health pack, just one life. The game itself is fantastic, runs smoothly, and has a neat art style, which makes its con all the more painful. It only has two hours of content. You could stretch it to three, but you would have to play slowly. I am almost finished with my second playthrough, and only 5 hours was put into it.

As much as I agree and also would have liked to see more levels in Story Mode a level editor seems like a much more needed addition to this game. The story introduces the most innovative shooter mechanics you will have ever seen in years in a (close to becoming stale) fourth-wall-braking-Unity-engine-kind of way rather than really trying to tell a story. But unlocking, mastering and completing the additional challenges is what it really seems to be about, if you actually care to open those folders and click on them. Do that and it will keep you occupied for at least 15-20 or more hours and to me that's perfectly worth the full price.Nevertheless this game does feel somewhat incomplete because of the lack of a level editor, preferably with a Steam Workshop page as well. With the way the story is told, game aesthetics like folder structure, fake chat-implementation etc the game implies a degree of connection to community and user-creativity that remains unfulfilled right now. Implement such a feature and there's enough meat (and veggies) on the menu for everyone, probably."

However, I'm assuming everyone already knows this, so instead in this review I am going to address the price point.For a game that costs a quarter of $100, many people are complaining about how it has way too short of a story to justify its price. Now, it is entirely true that the story is short (it took me ~3 hours to complete and that's mainlly because I'm kinda bad at shooters in general), but the story was quite unique though quite frankly the story is not the reason you should buy this game. This game is about slicing red dudes in slow motion, not about spending hours on some sort of plot!For $25 you get:- A 2+ hour story mode- 15+ endless arenas (which you unlock after story)- 8+ challenge modes which let you replay the story in a UNIQUE way (I've unlocked the first few and they reall change things up)- Incredibly fun and unique gameplay- Basic replay editor- Speedrun modesIn all, this is a great game to pick up and play, especially if you're a completionist, and is totally worth $25 if you're looking for a game that is simply entertaining and highly replayable.

I couldn't wait to dig into this. The first few levels were beautiful. I was finally getting the full SUPERHOT expereince. And then it just freezes. At first I thought it was just a feature of the game, maybe I had just hit a button and froze time or something. Nope. It crashed. I started it up again, got past another level, and it crashed. Tried it again, etc. etc., crash crash crash. A few hours of google searches gave me nothing other than the repetitive, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ advice the devs are giving out, ""Just make sure you have your antivirus disabled, make sure you have .NET 4, launch SH.exe, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, etc."". I don't want to give this a bad review for something that is potentially just me being a ♥♥♥♥ing moron, but it seems as though A LOT of other people have been having the same problem.

This review is mainly based from my experience from the story mode. Also, a minor disclaimer. I have been waiting for this game for three years, ever since the 7DFPS challenge. So some bias is to be expected.SUPERHOT is an FPS where time moves when you move (though you still breathe, so you can't completely stop time), and as of right now; is my favorite game of this year. SUPERHOT's main mechanic of time manipulation leads to what is easy and fun to get into, but is hard and challenging to master. But outside of the mechanic itself, the level design is also very well done (at least in the story mode). The weapons have just enough variety for it to feel different, and with the addition of the time manipulation mechanic; the difference becomes more noticeable. There are a few subtle things they added that really helped how much better the game plays, but I'll just leave them be to cut short on time.The story of SUPERHOT itself isn't exactly very impressive, if not a bit lackluster. Some of the things it pulled simply did not work because of some pacing issues, but it honestly isn't worth dwelling on. If anything, the lack of length in SUPERHOT is a bit of a mixed issue for me. It's as short as it should be, sure; but there's this feeling that the game is too short. The length may raise a few eyebrows here and there, however for those who would like a strong new innovation; SUPERHOT wins a strong recommendation.So in short, SUPERHOT is a game with some strong innovations (and a very beautiful aesthetic), with a somewhat lackluster length. And with the current price tag, there's obviously going to be some people who are against buying SUPERHOT."

Basically you just have to kill all the red guys in the level. But get hit once, you have to restart the level. Once you complete the story mode, you unlock endless mode and challenge mode and can also start up a particular level from the story. The challenges add to the game's replayability by making you rethink a map you already completed.With that being said, the only thing I didn't like about the game was the story. I honestly could have cared less for it and the game would be no different if you removed the story entirely from the game.I'd give this game a solid 4/5"

Story wise, the game is short, but for the completionist inside of you (or if you want the game just because of the cool time mechanic), you may be looking at quite a few hours of gameplay. The Challenge, Endless, and Arena Modes are unlocked once you finish the story.There is one thing that bugs me about some of the negative reviews, to the point where I have to say something. You may have read from them that the game is pretentious, saying that at the end it wants you to ""spam your friends about the game."" At the end of the game, yes, they do want you to do that, but if you pay attention to what's happening in the story, you'd understand why. It's not so much that it's pretentious, it's just a finale to the story. If you did pay attention to the story and still don't understand what's happening, then read this MAJOR SPOILER:When your computer crashes because your character's system got nuked or whatever which is what happens after you kill yourself(?), the system starts to take over your mind. This is what's happening when the screen flashes ""MIND IS SOFTWARE"" and ""THE SYSTEM WILL SET YOU FREE."" When your character's mind has been completely taken over and uploaded to the system, the system then instructs you to spread the game in order to upload more minds to the system.Overall, a great game, if a bit on the pricey side. Plus, VR support soon. So that'll be awesome."
,Recommended,322500,22719726,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,Ryno,"SUPERHOT is a first-person shooter with a unique twist, time in the game only moves when you move around as the player. So if an enemy shoots at you, you can move out of the way to shoot them. It emphasizes thinking out your plan of attack instead of rushing in guns blazing. After completing a level in slow-motion you'll get to see your actions play out at normal speed.Pros:+The game has a unique mechanic that works really well+The aesthetics of the game are minimal, but they work really well+The main campaign is short and sweet, and you unlock 2 new modes for beating the game.+ The new modes you unlock allow you to explore the mechanics more and challenge yourself with different limitations (including limiting what weapon you can use or forcing you to beat the game w/o dying)+The levels are short and when you die you can retry them almost immediatelyCons:-If you don't care for challenge modes, the main game is only 2 hours long.-Cheap deaths resulting from enemies that pop out of nowhere with no way to prepare against them-The game costs 25$ for a 2 hour campaign and 2 challenge modes, which is WAY overpriced-The story is pretenious, and the theme has been overdone in the past several years.Nitpicks:=The game repeats the phrase SUPERHOT like a million times and I wanted to shoot myself near the endI'd wait for the game to go on sale for about 15$ and then pick it up, the core mechanics are solid enough to warrant trying it out and it's unique."

In game allows you to decapitate, cut, smack, blow stuff up and shoot your enemies as well as other things in seconds, at least in the game time which only really moves when you're moving It's a really interesting idea and works well. The game feels awesome and really is super fun for at least 6 hours at the time, and for me 25 hours on the challenges.Price of this game is very reliable and when you get into it brings so many awesome impacts of gameplay, however the main story is quiet short and the game lacks on content, such as weapons, enemy types, maps, length of story as well as what some games have a few other things.

Endless is about what you expect, but i adore the way they did the challenges. your basicly replaying the game, (take away some levels  and all the story stuff) although, they always got a twist! For example theres the katana only challenge where, as the name states, you can only use the katana! Theres also a ton of other challenges.9/10 Great game!"

,Recommended,322500,30853842,Posted: 31 March,all,XXXLil Notorious A$AP O.L.E :),"My experience with this game can be summed as thus: every update I found myself testing the changes, nodding in satisfaction, then quitting the game to await the next update.Arkane knows how to make a good game. No question. But if you film an Oscar-worthy movie and the lens is smudged while filming, you can't judge what's underneath without acknowledging what's been marring your experience the entire time.=============================PERFORMANCEEveryone is aware of the performance issues, and these still persist to this day. It runs much better than at launch, where it was literally unplayable, but that's because the game looks worse than before - the most noticeable change being the extremely aggressive LOD scaling. Out of the corner of your eye you notice the shapes of window frames and posters on distant buildings morphing in shape, or the furniture at the opposite end of a long hallway suddenly blinking into existence. FPS dropped to 15 when stabbing a gravehound, so they simply removed the inky visual effect that was causing the problem instead of optimizing it.Also, Denuvo authentication is one of the longest ""loading screens"" of the game. Around half a minute to a full minute or more every startup.=============================GAMEPLAYFor the most part, gameplay is excellent and is Dishonored's strongest suit.Dark Vision was changed to a blurry short range sonar so unlike Dishonored 1 you aren't constantly seeing blue and yellow because you had no reason not toAI is much smarterNonlethal combat options are a blastBonecharm crafting system allows for player flexibility and ""builds""Each level feels lived-in while maintaining the duality of directive flow and open options that made the first game so good.Emily and Corvo have distinct animations and final weapon upgrades. The animations are supremely cool.Each level is fairly distinct, some with extremely interesting central ""gimmicks."" I do, however, wish the game relied less on them and had more ""regular"" areas.However, under the hood lie other problems. Most of them are quality-of-life issues:Gone are the hotkeys for journal, inventory, bonecharms, powers. Only one ""journal"" exists now, despite still having separate subsections.It took months for the power wheel to be fixed. It took almost a full second after activating to pop up and be usable, breaking flow so badly I almost never used it in the first place. It's finally fixed now, but this issue was glaring and it took so long to be addressed most of us played through without it fixed.Thrown objects don't always go exactly where your crosshair is. While this adds a layer of difficulty, it feels noticeably more clunky than in the first game.Mana regen is pitifully slow. From using a power to fully regenerating, Dishonored 1's time is 4.7 seconds -> 3.1 seconds with Spiritual Pool. Dishonored 2's time with 4x Spiritual Pool is 6.3s -> 5.5s. The devs said they fixed this effect, but it was only made worse.Bugs. Street speakers not playing. Dying after possessing gravehounds. An arc pylon never shutting down after pulling out its power, leaving it to either be dangerous to you to dangerous to your nonlethal playthrough. Some of these still aren't fixed.=============================STORY AND ATMOSPHEREReactivityGreat. My favorite part of Dishonored. You need to hide from a gang member to access a certain black market shop, and there are different scenarios and dialogue for if you hide, if you run into him outside, kill him outside, or kill him inside.Emily and CorvoEmily and Corvo are voiced. And... they don't talk enough. It's good that they're silent for most of the game, but there are times when you come across a portrait or photograph with an ""Inspect"" prompt. I'd love to hear Emily's thoughts on the High Overseer as see how that compares to Corvo's, or if it changes based on whether or not you accept the Outsider's Mark. Instead, all I get is the protagonist muttering the name of the person pictured. What's the point? Might as well keep them silent.It made sense to me to play Emily first, but her story felt lackluster, like people at every turn were saying ""check your royal privilege"" despite my efforts to resolve everyone's problems without drawing blood. Corvo's is MUCH more interesting as a veteran of Dishonored 1.The Outsider and The VoidI hate the new Outsider and his new voice. He felt threatening and malicious in the first game due to how calm and composed he was, and the Void felt like a strange and otherworldly place. The vignettes of Dunwall made it feel both unnatural and unnerving yet fundamentally woven into the universe. In Dishonored 2, it's just smoky blackness and sharp rocks. The Outsider is much jollier and moves around erratically, making grandiose hand gestures. They actually had a plot plot that could explain this change, but it was never addressed, so it just seems like a pointless retcon to me.Main PlotDishonored's worldbuilding was always one of its appeals, and that remains true in Dishonored 2. However, the villains felt lackluster. Only the main villain has a real presence throughout the game, whereas everyone else feels introduced abruptly only to fall by your hand, all within the same mission. In Dishonored 1 everything felt personal and real. Perhaps it was because of the long intro where you interacted with most of them, or the Hound Pits's cast of characters all having different connections to your targets.=============================As you can see, I've played this game a LOT and have put a lot of thought into it. It was definitely worth all those hours and all that money, but the condition it was at launch and the sluggish drip-feed of support we barely get now is unacceptable. To set a precedent for future games, I can't recommend buying this unless they manage to fix all the performance issues and bugs, which doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon."

If you pay $30, you are going to be disappointed. Most of the bad reviews I've read seem to be from a position of overpriced instead of not being fun. I love it.First of all, time never stands still (except in one challenge mode.) Time always churns at a snail pace and the more character movement you have, the more time speeds up to normal. So when you move your mouse around, you are moving and time does speed up. Some people call this a super annoying flaw. We call those people ♥♥♥♥♥ gamers. But before I digress...There are no graphics to speak of. The lackluster screenshots do it accurate justice. It is not a beautiful game by any stretch. For what the game is, however, they work. The stark contrasts and geometric simplicity are kind of refreshing when many games over-saturate backgrounds. It started as a design constraint and turned into a legitamate style.The gameplay is hectic. And loads of fun. I will say there exist ways to exploit the AI, which I have used to my advantage more than once. You hide behind a corner and run into the wall until someone comes. Then you clober them.There really isnt a story to the game. Something about a hacker game that sucks people into the computer and turns them into hitmen or something. I dunno. You really don't need it though. The main 'campaign' doesn't take exceptionally long to beat, but it does unlock endless mode. And at heart this is an arcade style game.Once I stopped trying to ""win,"" I began to have massive amounts of fun just trying to pull off ridiculous feats and failing over and over and over (there are no load times btw.) Its when you pull off a brutal combo thats fluid and technically magnificent, you can get a lot of satisfaction seeing it replayed at regular time.Pros-Insanely fun-No load times-Lots of replayability-You can cut bullets with a swordCons-If you pay more than $15 you are overpaying.-No modability in a platform that begs for it.-""Graphics suck"" if thats your position on things. (Trying to be unbiased here)Bottom Line: 6/10If the regular price were $15 bucks I would bump it up to a seven.

It is a gimmick and does not get wgere far with it. Try thr demo if you like it go ahead and buy it. There is a lot of content introduced later like endless mode and so on.

This is nothing more than an extended tutorial.This game has an interesting mechanic, and that's pretty much all there is to it.  It is absurdly short, where I played it through to completion in under two hours, and beat a bunch of other challenges under an hour thereafter.  Not all of them, mind you, but enough to say that I've played most of what this game has to offer, and it's not much.If you watched the videos of this game, you've probably seen a full quarter of the gameplay available.  The levels are very short and confined.  Despite this, some levels are actually very fun - one where you start off surrounded by three people in an elevator and you have to figure out how to best all of them without one of the others shooting you first, or the elevator doors opening and revealing two more dudes shooting at you.There's also a pretty, ahem, bad*** moment early on where you start a level with a demand ""Come with us"".  Then a few seconds later, the screen flashed, ""HOW.  ABOUT.  NO!"", and you start the level with a gun pointed at your head and you have to fight your way through a bunch of dudes.  It's a moment that made me grin and fistpump in the air, but that was the only such moment this entire game provided.I think a more experienced development team could have hashed out a much, much longer campaign, and perhaps gave more nuance to the game, more mechanics, and so forth.  About halfway through the game you get a body-switching power, and it's almost entirely optional to use.  It's useful, yes, but a creative dev team could have dreamed up a level where you had to body switch with a guy on a balcony to keep fighting, because there was no other way to get up there (for example).  But really, the mechanics in this game are never fully realized.I said in the beginning that this game is an extended tutorial.  A cool mechanic like this is akin to things in other, more developed games, where they grant you a new power and some easy time to mess around with it, before flinging you back into the main game to use it in a dozen different ways.  This game never gets past the tutorial phase with it.  Too short, too easy, too simplistic, a waste of an awesome pair of concepts (bullet-time as a norm, and body-switching), and a waste of money.If you get a chance to get the game for free, it's definitely worth playing then.  But that's the problem here - this game is a neat and quick diversion but nothing worth paying for."

Gameplay is fun but there's so little of it, I can't reccomend.small personal gripe aswell, the story isn't well told. that is to say, for a fourthwall story to work, you need to have some option other than doing what the voice says, if I've got no option other than to punch myself in the face, how in the hell can I care about the game, there's nothing I can do otherwise.There's a part where the voice traps you in a cage and gives you orders like a dog, if you don't follow those orders, almost like you don't want to be ordered around like a dog, the game just repeats the orders over and over again, with no new reactions. and there are alot of moments like that.""Hahaha, you can't escape, try pressing escape""Well, no. it's clear that I can't escape, so skip to the point.""Press it, Press it, Press it, Press it""ok fine,""Muwahahaha, You're completely at my mercy""For ♥♥♥♥ sake.Moments like that were just wasted annoyance, doesn't even end good either, You don't find these mysterious puppeteers, get revenge then take your freewill back.

,Recommended,322500,25999973,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Blackhat,"I played the free flash version of Superhot before it was a real game. Just that small taste seared the extreme amounts of potential into my head, and the mind-blowing opprotunities of the mechanics.And the full game delivers. The few glitches from the free version have been polished out, and the white with bright red astetic gives the game a clean and professional look. The brilliant mechanic, in which time slows down and speeds up relative to the players movement speed, is used to the fullest, and combined with the 1 shot 1 kill, the game makes gun battles tense and exciting, while offering a playstyle geared towards planning and thoughtful placement. The sound design is very well done, and the levels are quite varied, giving a health amount of variety in terrain.As good as this game was, I still have a few quarrels with it. The campaign is very short, and took me around 3 hours, knocking it out in an afternoon. I also feel that ammo counters on the weapons would have been a good idea. You also get an ability later on which allows you to possess an enemy, and a recharge meter or bar would have been very useful. While the level are varied, the enemies are not. Yes, they will ocassionally use different weapons, but they are all red, crystaline mannequins at the end of it all. I hoped for enemies with say, different body types, or sepcial weaknesses, or specialized abilities. The same goes for the weapons. You have a pistol, a shotgun, and a burst fire assault rifle. You also have some melee weapons, and a katana. The throwables are all basically reskins of one object, and I feel that more variety would have helped. Possibly a sniper rifle, or a minigun of some sort, or just more types of weapons. The player character feels quite bulky at times, as bullets you were sure missed still manage to hit you, making the player feel like they're wearing a cardboard box. When you finish a level,The plot is quite interesting, being about virtual reality and the like, but I felt that they designed the game, then bashed the plot about with a hammer until it fit together, which I feel is the wrong way to do things. I feel that the plot should be written, then events connected with levels and fights.When a level is completed, a video plays of you doing the level in real time, which would have been great, but the video is obscured by the phrase, ""Super...Hot!"" flashing infront of the clip.After the campaign is finished, endless modes and challenge levels, which is the campaign with a certain twist added, or removed, are added.I must say that I quite recocmend Superhot, it's great bloody fun, and it really breaks up the monatany of the twatting about in modern war shooters. It's wonderful, has a few issues, but it's very worth it, and is still great.Highly reccomend"

For me, it goes beyond the gimmicky feel I expected characteristic of games emphasizing a single unique play mechanic. I found the story, while skimpy on details, thought-provoking and unique. It left me musing on the nature of self and filling in the blanks as to what I actually whitnessed in the story.However, this strength neighbors its shortcomings. Even at $15 when I bought it on sale, the game leaves me wanting more for its asking price. There is just one enemy type. About four distinct weapons. It took me about three hours to play the story mode. It's a good game, but I don't feel that it belongs at its asking price even discounted to $15! In my opinion, I would value it at about $8-$10 worth of game. $15 is a bit steep. $25 is just too much.The game didn't launch on my Mac through Steam on the Halloween update. I had to use Show Package Contents on the actual game app file and run the executable in the terminal. The game stutters at Fast settings on my very capable graphics card. A little better testing for performance on multiple platforms would have been nice.I greatly enjoyed this unique game, but I feel that the game lacks content for its price point at the time of writing. The authors have indicated that they will be releasing a free DLC in the future. If and when they do, the game could become a better deal overall."

Read the reviews and learn to filter out the haters. Is it a shorter game than most $60 titles? yea, it's about 30% of the content a full AAA title at this point, Thus the ~$20 price. Beating this game in under 2 hours and asking for a refund is like going to a steakhouse and horking down a filet without savoring it and claiming it was tasteless so you deserve your money back.Also, there is some huge replayability in the end... I will not reveal the nature of the system, but it is worth it."

The mechanics may not be technically new, but they are done better than ever before. The replayability is also very high, since you can go back and replay the campaign with different modifiers, such as only using a katana, or having a time limit on each level.

I thought the story mode was great, although very short. What kept me coming back, however, was endless mode. Taking turns playing endless mode is a great deal of fun, and has kept me playing the game longer than I expected to. I also really love the aesthetic and the PC performance is great. I do have a couple negative points, though. I found the story mode to be extremely short, but what may turn more people off is the fact that this game has the potential to get really stale.

,Recommended,322500,26573236,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Ptolemy I (#2 was a loser),"Let me first start off by asking why, if full-dive VR exists in this world, DO PEOPLE USE FREAKING TEXT BASED TERMINAL STYLE GRAPHICS FOR EVERYTHING!!!???? ok. There. Just needed to get that out there. Anyway, the gameplay of SUPERHOT is by far it's strongest point. It is some of the best and most innovative gameplay I've ever seen, being that time only moves when you move, so you can litterally dodge bullets, shoot bullets out of the air, or cut them in half with swords. Also, the minimalistic graphics add to the gameplay of killing everything that is red, and picking up stuff that's black. However, SUPERHOT's upsides are undercut by it's downsides. The story is rather cliche and predictable, and the lore is nonexistant. And, in all honesty, lore and story is what makes a good game great, so the fact that both are just barely passable in some places and God-awful in others really destroy's this game's potential. Because of the fact that it attepmpts to have a serious story that is really, really bad, it ends up worse off than DOOM, which had practically no story in the original version. What I'm saying is, it's a fun game, but it's story can ruin it in some parts, so don't buy it for that."

It brings original mechanics, notably its ""bullet time"" system to freshen up a genre that has simply become: ""guy get gun, go blow things up, BOOM"". Its plot, like its graphics, seems simple at first, but as the player advances through the various ""cracked"" levels, a more far more interesting, layered, and sinister plot begins to show itself.The graphics themselves are pretty... They're simple polygons of red, black, and white, but they are utilized extremely well . The game flows smoothly, and I don't once find myself wishing for something more ""realistic.""The gameplay itself is easy to pick up, but hard to master, particularly as more and more mechanics are added, and there are even a few mechanics hidden, just waiting to be discovered by accident, or by particularly creative players (It's a me! Mario!).If I had any gripe... it would be that the game mechanics feel almost TOO simple I love bullet time, and I love being able to pull off matrix-like moves, but let me do more of it. Let me run on walls. Let me crouch and lean to avoid bullets. Let me do what I'm accustomed to doing in an FPS, but do it with more style.The variety of weapons could also use a bit of work. Maybe add in an explosive or two... rather than either every gun having bullets or every melee object simply being there to throw... This game is amazing, and it has TONS of room to grow.

In a game that thrives on control and precision, it is a bit of a downer. I don't like my chances of beating the 'no restarts' challenge with the sloppy controls.edit- yes, the no restart challenge is a lot harder with the sloppy controls and occasional random movement.edit- oh and I forgot to mention that the physics is buggy.

In endless mode, its exactly wow it sounds, just survive. In the early access version that some youtubers were able to play they showed ""mods"" (like big head mode) that could be added to make endless more fun, but they removed that and addded challenges to the campaign instead.

Bullets hitting me through walls.2. Red dudes firing their guns before they were even 1/4 the way thru pick up animation3. Getting shot and seeing the bullet trails come from a direction where no red dude spawns.Then there were more consistent things that need to be tweaked1. The hitboxes of throwables are totally non realistic ex. Every time you attempt to move around a corner and throw something, unless you are standing about a meter away from the wall, the object will shatter despite not touching anything.2. The hitboxes on the playable character's head is screwed up. A bullet can be 30cm away, and obviously not at the right angle to hit me, and then it will. It feels like I'm playing a hammerhead shark.3. In the elevator level, when I hotswitched with the left shotgun dude through the crack in the opening doors, his friend already had a shotgun pointed at his head, before even seeing me or moving, this seemed to happen 5+ timesOverall, very fun and satisfying once you become skilled, but even before then the game is excellent to learn.

With the ability to dodge bullets, cut them down with a katana or simply teleport and take over the shooter matrix-style, the possibilities for defeating your foes are endless. And from long, narrow corrdidors to offices to city streets, there are a wide variety of environments as well. The game itself is only a few hours long, but there are enough gameplay variants upon completing the main storyline to ensure replayability. As an added bonus, there is no blood or gore, so it's friendlier for kids than the AAA shooters out there. It'll also challenge and develop problem solving skills. Thus, from numerous angles, it's a must own in my book.10/10"

It's got challenge, not excessive, but enough that you can stumble and have a few tries for levels. And the 'time' mechanic and variety of the levels means you have some replayability. It's worth a buy on sale, certainly, just for a few hours of fun. I'll repeat: IT'S FUN.So why does the story always but in demanding attention like the most annoying, wailing baby on an airplane? I haven't finished the game, and the constant reminders by the weird person flashing text across your screen, telling you that you're not in control and have to do whatever they want, feels an awful lot like the writers were just having a laugh. Like: ""Haha, we made an interesting and fun game with a unique mechanic, but we still own you and get to mete out your fun in small intervals then drag you back to pay attention to us because our mothers didn't love us enough."" Seriously, I could be paraphrasing the actual text that is shown, and you'd barely notice.It's crazy annoying, so much so that when the (Spoilers *eyes rolling here*) mysterious red text monster told me to stop playing and not to launch 'superhot.exe again', that's exactly what I did, followed quickly by writing this review.So, in conclusion, IT'S A FUN GAME, as long as you can ignore the writer's repeated attempts to make you quit (an irony so obvious I have to believe it was a development choice meant to make the game more challenging)."

Just as a comparison, I paid only 401 INR (about 6 USD) for Mad Max during a weekend sale and that game has around 35 hours of content (main story + side quests) and this game has only about 4 or 5. I understand it isn't fair to compare an AAA game with an Indie game, but when the prices are similar, you've gotta ask yourself ""how much content am I getting for the price that I am paying?""I am not saying that I regret buying it, because I don't. This is a really different FPS game unlike any others and we need developers who are willing to take the risk and experiment. It is important to support developers like them and I am glad I bought the game. I want to see more games like this. I would like to see more of this.

The moment I read this line at the very beginning, I knew this was going to be an unique experience.I wasn't disappointed.  At first, I was just 'going through the motions' and observing as the game got increasingly difficult.  But somewhere around the halfway mark, I realized I was hooked, and ended up finishing the main story in about 6 hours, give or take.That doesn't sound like much, granted, but this one is truly unique and more than returns to you what you paid for it in my opinion. It had quite a few ""What the...."" moments and anyone remotely curious will find themselves progressing just to find out what is going on.  It's....not quite what I predicted either, but won't say anything else as this is another title that is much better ""playing blindly"".9/10 is my final rating. The only reason I took a notch off the perfect score was because at times the game did feel like it was dragging on almost mindlessly and did feel somewhat repetitive.  That is partly my fault for playing it all in one sitting, but I also feel like some would've lost interest before it really got intriguing.Adding in the secrets to be found in the main story, the challenge modes and the 'endless' modes were a nice touch though. My favorite so far is the Katana Challenge: the whole ""bringing a knife (sword, whatever) to a gunfight"" thing. :)"

The red contrasts with the white to giv a clear picture of what's important.  The game feels satisfying to play, and the story, was quite interesting and gave a feeling of anticipation at the end.  However, I should probably list everything.-POSITIVES--Great Sound design-Feels satisfying to play-The fact that levels are re played in real time is a great touch-Story is intriguing-NEGATIVES--The last couple of levels in the game were frustrating for me-The assault rifle weapon is broken beyond belief in the hand of enemies-VERY short for its price tag of 25 DOLLARSOverall, I would say SUPERHOT is in my top ten games of 2016.

SUPERHOT is a gem that not many people recognize, it can get repetitive at times but that is mainly because of the players choice to make it that way. There are many different ways to go about obsticles and get to the end of the wave. The gameplay with VERY smooth and feels unique and crisp. I love the fact that the charecter models are made out of gemstones, it gives the game a amazing feel of being so fragile and yet so unstopable at the same time. I might also add that if you do not think that you can run this game, give it a try. I did not think I would be able to run this game because I do not have the required specs but I can run the game at full res and play at 60 FPS. I give this game a 10\10.Happy gaming!"

Now, i don't hate this game. I actually quite like it in the way that it makes you feel badass but i for 35$ i was expecting a whole lot more.The game is almost no different than the beta or the demo flash game except a few more levels that seem very repetitive and the game overall is very short. I mean i was able to finish the campaign in less than 4 hours and that being said i am not anywhere close to be the best player at this game i actually had to retry some levels quite a lot of times.Even tho the story is not that bad, it actually feels that you the player is part of it, it doesn't make up for the rest. I know there is challenges and an endless mode but it always ends up being you shooting red guys for no real reason. the VR mode tho does seem pretty interesting. I've never tried it myself since i don't a VR headset but from the people that have actually tried it, it does pretty cool.So in short, for 35$, you get a game that feels way too short and redundant. unless you are a very big fan of this game or there is a pretty big discount on it, i wouldn't recommend it. There is a lot more games out there that are even cheaper and will give you a lot more hours of entertainment."

I would like to see more done with the story -- the ""tutorial"" blended right into the game and I did not realize I had already started. I got to a hard part that I retried 10 or more times without success.

The main innovation is that time only moves when you, the player, moves. It works well and doesn't overstay its entertaining but short single player campaign, after which a wealth of single player challenge content is unlocked which is where the meat of this game lies.It's not everyday where you can throw a vase at a villains head, catch his dropped gun mid-air, spin round on a dime and headshot an approaching enemy charging towards you with a sword.

I mean, did i actually need to restartthe game to progress? And speaking of randomly smashingyour keyboard: I feel like the devs missed a massiveopportunity to implement some great text based puzzleygoodness here. It would not only proloning the short playtime,but t would also feel a hell of a lot more seamless and interesting.As of now, the time in between the levels is just frustratingand unececary.Gameplay wise it is good fun though.It punishes any attemt to just go for it. You really needto plan many moves ahead. A single bullet can mess up eveything.And even when you ♥♥♥♥ up multiple times, The ""i am gonna do this""mentalilty keeps you retrying without getting bored or wanting to give up.So much so that it makes time in the real world fly by. And that is what this gamefundamentally feels like; A time killer. And a fun one at that.So in conclusion:The physics are spot on, the graphical styles suits the gameplay very well and it performeslike a dream. The challenges and endless mode is ultimatly what makes me recommendthis game. If you just get through the story and unlock these, you will have many manyhours of red dude killing fun."

I believe that for the price this game is as long as it needs to be, just look at the playtime I've had and make your own judgement on whether it is worth it (I like to compare it to the price of films). This game is great and works well on medium and high-spec pc's. Some low end pcs may even be able to play it but I can not say for certain. I highly recomend this game.

That won't be an issue for most people, because it makes for some of the best shooter gameplay i've played in a while, and it really makes you feel like a badass. I give a solid 10/10StoryThe narritive is so heavy on the meta, you could cut it with a knife (or a katana in slow-motion). The game starts with a fictional 'player' (the guy you're playing as) getting a hacked alpha for a game, from a different 'player'. What ensues is a series of fun levels, interconnected by segments of conversations with the other 'player' andthe evil AI controlling the game.Overall, the plot should be interesting enough to hold your attention for the 1-2 hours the campaign lasts.The badThe lengthYou read that right, 1-2 hours. That's pretty much the most the campaign will last anyone. Of course, there are numerous challenges to attempt, but they all invovle doing the same levels in the campaign, but to certain modifiyers and parameters. I enjoy them, but they won't be for most people. For some reason, I have the achievement for completing all the challenges, but this is not true. It'll probably take at least 30 hours to complete all of these, but that's just an estimation. This content is pretty repetitive, and certainly isn't worth the price.Speaking of which....The priceAt the moment, SUPERHOT is £17.99, which is roughly $22. I don't know how much it's being sold for in USA, but it's probably around the same price. This is too much for what we got, and with the reallocation of the VR gameplay to a seperate game, that'll be a turnoff to those proud few owners of VR headsets.SummaryThe price vs length is the only real turnoff for me, so if you can get it on sale, it's a must-buy. If you can't find a good discount, here's a code that I promise won't give you a virus. ;)https://superhotgame.com/discount/If you can find it at a good price (closer to $10 rather than $20) then you must get this game. If it wasn't for the large pricetag, I'd give this game a 9/10."

That's when it really comes to life. I'd definitely bring this out at parties or something, but boy am I glad I waited for a sale. Not worth full price, but I payed around $16 and that's not an unfair price, I think. Nice relaxing shooter with almost a puzzle feel to it, and certainly holds the interest well enough.

,Recommended,322500,30109938,Posted: 22 February,all,nO_d3N1AL,"IT'S THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS.SUPERHOT is one of those games that only a passionate team of indie developers could create. The concept of the game is simple but ingenious: time moves as fast as you do. This leads to a surprisingly tactical game which is almost like a turn-based real-time FPS. Every time you complete a level, it feels very satisfying and seeing the replay in real-time looks cool. Dodging bullets, switching into other enemies, grabbing guns, getting headshots etc. are all basic and rpetitive yet it never gets tiring because there's an element of tactical deliberation to your every move. Unlike a ""constant-time"" shooter, you really think about what you're doing and it's interesting how dynamic levels can feel. It's by no means an easy game, and much of the skill comes from being able to anticipate where enemies are going to be so that when you fire, your bullets will hit them. It's also about judging the timing. In most shooters, reloading, accuracy and positioning are instinctive - you don't think, you just do it. In SuperHot, due to the non-constant passage of time, you actually NEED to analyse the situation frame by frame; - a level of perfection which cannot possibly happen in other shooters.Aside from the excellent gameplay concept, I have to admire both the art style and the lore of the game. It's a very minimalistic yet distinctive style: weapons are black, enemies are red, environment is white and any objects you can interact with are striped blue. This is not because the game is made using Unity or the lack of talent from artists. It's clearly a deliberate decision which makes the game more pure and, from a practical aspect, easier to play. If there was complex geometry and lots of colours and objects, it would be difficult to analyse the environment and react accordingly.The game is presented as an old DOS-style terminal and includes many nice additions, including incredible ASCII art and implementations of ""0-player games"" such as Conway's game of life, Langdon's Ant and more. Once you're done with the game, you have plenty to keep you busy, including an endless survival mode, challenges (completing levels with certain restrictions), speedrun and even a real-time speed run mode, and even more things which I haven't unlocked yet.Even though there are around 34 levels in the game, it'll only take you a couple of hours to finish it. However, given the unique concept and brilliant execution, I have to credit this game and recommend it; though not at full price. I got it on sale and don't regret it. It's also a game that works surprisingly well with a gamepad. I've had no performance issues with it on my Alienware Alpha R1 on highest graphics settings at 1080p, and the game looks great despite its minimalistic design. The only criticisms I have are the lack of variety in weapons and enemies and the lack of cloud saves. The save game is located in your user profile AppData\LocalLow folder and I have lost my save before; though luckily the game is so good I ddn't mind replaying the first two hours."

It only takes one bullet to kill you, in the same way it only takes one bullet to kill the red guys. If you die, you start again.SUPERHOT does try and add some uncessary Matrix-esque metagame to what is a fun shooter experience, and this could be considered appropriate given the bullet-time theme of the game. I wouldn't rate the metagame very highly, or not at least its delivery.The reason why you play this game is for the ""replay"", the result of a successful run, played back to you in real-time.  Which means a 30 second replay is the culmination of about ten minutes of gameplay. This replay is somewhat marred by the words ""SUPERHOT"" flashing across the screen while being chanted with computerised montony, but is still satisfying to watch.SUPERHOT does let you pull off some incredibly fun, action-movie style fight scenes. Like jumping over an incoming car in a car garage; punching someone, causing them to let go of their gun; grabbing their gun and shooting them in the head; doing a quick 360 spin around to take out a read guy approaching from behind; running forward towards two more red guys, weaving between bullets; shooting one of them, throwing your empty gun at the other; punching the guy who just appeared out of nowhere from between two parked cars; grabbing the gun from the man who received your old gun to the chest; shooting the out-of-nowhere man; and then- ah♥♥♥♥♥♥ just took a katana to the chest... start again.SUPERHOT is a lot of fun and an interesting and unique concept for a game. It does come with some associated fluff that sometimes accompanies indie games, but is ignored easily enough for the experience."

I think the real draw of the game is in it's endless mode though. The devs seem cool and overall the game is really fun. Easy to get tired of though. I play an hour or so every now and then. I hope if there is a Superhot 2 they add more weapons. The kind of game you start out loving but get tired of really fast. Still fun game nonetheless."

I haven't bought a Oculus Rift VR Headset yet so then I can play Superhot in VR , but I know that Superhot VR's gonna be great! But the one thing I don't like about Superhot is that the mods were taken out , and the mods were so much fun! (especially the big heads mod , that was kinda funny to just kill red guys with oversized heads).One thing I wonder is why are there weapons in Superhot VR that aren't in Superhot ""Normal""?

The story is incredibly short only taking 2 hours to finish it. The story is mysterious and interesting but nothing mind blowing. I enjoy the minimalist art style it really lets you focus on the gameplay. This is where the game is actaully unique and fun. Being able to control time to lineup shots and dodge bullets is a lot of fun. IMO the hitbox seemed random at times but doesn't take away from the game too much. The main story does not have any replay value but endless mode and challenge mode which are unlocked after beating the game adds replay value. This game is probably better on VR.

With the one shot kill from both the player and the enemies it adds a sense of risk however the risk is often ignored due the instant respawn. The instant respawn allows for player to continuous change their approach without much thinking.Killing enemies feel so satisfying due to them falling apart. Completing the level allows the player to watch themselves without the slow down effect creating a sense of accomplishment.

The style ranges from sterile enclosed environments with great ambiance which sometimes almost feels like a surreal crime movie, which I think is pretty cool and an interface based off of old computers with slightly annoying transitions and choices.The story starts off intriguing at first and you're genuinely interested in it, but it tries to impress you with fourth-wall breaks and aggressive story telling which consists of nothing but ackamarackus. Even though the story was advertised to not be in your face, (similar to Half-Life's environmental story telling), it ironically became too overbearing and annoying.Unfortuanetely, the game's length still seems short and ends suddenly, which is a shame because the gameplay is worth going through the bad story. But, it is better to have a short competent game than a bloated, messy game of many hours. There are challenges to extend replay value which are fine like using katanas only, but for the length, the asking price is too high.Get it while its low in price. $10 or lower seems reasonable to me."

76561198145160690,Recommended,322500,33905997,Posted: 30 July,all,VirtualOwl14,"Superhot is an FPS game that revolves around the concept of time moving when you do, and is good fun. You are tossed into one of many arenas in the game that resemble the real world, with monochrome visuals. Your only enemies are red characters weilding 1 of 4 weapons, a machine gun, shotgun, pistol, and sword. Each takes one hit to kill. It becomes somewhat puzzle like at times, as you have to prioritize your enemies, and know how to use the time mechanic to your advantage. Another mechanic is hot-switching, which lets you take the spot of enemies while disposing of your body, though it does have a cooldown. The story, while found pretentious by some, is pretty okay. It's relatively simple and doesn't get in the way of the game TOO much. My only gripes with the game is that it's relatively short, and somewhat unforgiving at times. I reccomend this game, however, not for the price it's at. Get this game on sale."

I know it's $25 for a 2 hour game, which is pretty bad alone, but once you get about half way through the storyline it just gets boring, the levels feel repetative and when you get it handed to you by that one shotgunner who spawned right behind you, you get pretty bored of doing the same thing over and over until finally you kill that guy. But let me make it straight, I DO NOT recommend this game, the first half of the storyline is fun, you have poly graphics with an awesome Kill Bill thing going on, but then you start getting to the (Spoiler alert) Core Levels which is just a more annoying and game-slowing filler. Not to mention how sometimes shotgun rounds that hit wont actually kill your enemy, and other times shotgun rounds from enemies can go straight through corners of walls and objects, the (spoiler alert again) body switch or HotSwitch is pretty fun at first but then they start all the core crap and basically hang the abilty over your head like a parent buying their kid a present only to take it out of the box and dangle it over them just far enough out of reach, and after a while the actual story becomes a joke and you dont even know why superhot.exe is telling you to HotSwitch the core, and the access is denied, not to mention why other options in the menu show that superhot.exe is a game made in 2015, but the ""system"" tells you that your not playing a game, then you punch yourself in the face while in game and it actually hurts your 'real self' which is a guy in a VR Headset playing superhot, like I said, it becomes a joke. The ability to punch a guy, take his gun, shoot his friend, then smash his face in with it is cool, but I feel the potential was wasted here, they came up with a whole new concept which I loved at first, but it feels like they just came up with a lazy, unorganized trailer of ideas, smashed them together then put the Kill Bill style in like a cherry on top. A cherry that sadly sunk to the bottom of the crap sundae."

Unlike some games with a great concept, this uses it well to create a godly brawl that makes you feel like a esports champion while watching the replays back in fast motion. You bend time at will and the simple yet elegant polygonal characters and objects make you drop your jaw because you have plently of time to plan out how you will take care of the next wave. 9/10 Sadly story mode is short and challenges leave more to be desired, but definitely worth every cent.Jump on enemies for an insta kill and say it with me: ""feel my♥♥♥♥♥ on your head bro!""

While it is that at first, the game is rather short and the levels never really get that difficult. Aside from this, any fun I may have found in the gameplay is overshadowed by a forced-in story that starts as an intriguing side narrative as you play through levels and becomes an intrusive, disjointed, bizarre tale that's more like a virtual walk through someone's bizarre, existential, horror fantasy. (The plot of this story itself seems to switch halfway through as if two different people wrote it...).Overall, the game tries harder to be a meta, psychological story than a challenging game.If you like entertainment that just tries to screw with your mind, then you might like this game. But if you were looking to play a challenging shooter with bullet time based puzzles you may find yourself disappointed."

The game should have just been a series of levels back to back and more of them. Overall for $25 it is hard to recommend this game. Like the levels are fun but after you play about 3 of them you get to go through another 2 minute cut scene and the game is just a cycle of a few levels and then a long cut scene about you beening in a white room.
