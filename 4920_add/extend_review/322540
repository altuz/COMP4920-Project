76561198106013105,Recommended,322540,18166642,"Posted: 23 September, 2015",all,Galactic Origins,"This is a pretty slick game. It is not as Epic as other space games, but it is fun. Turn based. The game is rather simple on some levels and a little complex on others.Moving ships is easy - just select the fleet and right click to your destination.You need to Explore a star system before you can colonize it. Enemy star systems that you conquer you can immediately colonize. To find resources you need to explore a second time, and then activate the resource with an explorer ship which uses up the ship. Once activated resources will increase that area of the star system by one resource.Battles are hands off. The fleets will 'fight' on the strategic map and you will see the results. There are no graphics for the battles except ship losses.Handling Colonies and Fleets is really easy because there is a spread sheet type display for both. Also, there is a message sheet every turn. All of these sheets really help the player to handle the Empire.Diplomacy is simple yet a little involved. First, there is only War and Peace. And why not? Many games have trade and alliances but Galactic Inheritors does not. To declare war you first have to convince your population that the enemy empire is evil. You use Media propoganda to do this over time. It is also possible to stall the other empires this way. So you have to prepare for war as it takes time to move the slider from Peace to War.Building ships is really neat and novel for this game. You order the ships from one of three military companies that will build them. You can order up to three ships from each company at a time, so a total of nine ships can be building at once. As a company builds ships over time it gains experiance and skill points which can then be spent on improving that company's production. I found this aspect of the game rather neat. (Note: Colony ships and explorers are built at star systems and not by the ship companies.)Also, there are Empire bonuses you can earn. Net commerce will add funds to the Empire bonus level each turn. Once a new level is reached you can buy an Empire bonus, such as better manuevering ships for the entire Empire. The amount of funds needed to gain a level is based on how many star systems you have.Ordering ships will lower your net commerce amount. It can go negative with no problems accept = no funds will go toward your Empire bonus level. As a matter of fact the Empire bonus level amount will also go negative and can be 'paid off' once you finish building ships.Overalll this is a fun game. It is not too in depth and is one of the easier Space 4X games to play. Probably good to pick up on sale. I liked it.One negative I had was the music would stop playing after a short while. I liked the in game music. So I played a CD instead but had to lower all sound levels in the game or my own music would not repeat. No big deal really."

The rubbish ones usualy have redeeming features for genre fans like me. Not this one. This may have been fun in the early 90s but not now. This is soooo basic and not in the awesome sense like the classic Stars! it is basic in that it feels incomplete and or was not thought through.The sound is basic.The mechanics are basic.It is not compelling at all.I left a postive review for Lords of the Black Sun and I even found some joy in Apollo 4x. That should tell you something about how low my standards are. I can't say anything good about the game apart from that it works. I'm sorry Crispon Games, please do better next time."
76561198012219450,Recommended,322540,15566170,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,nosavynada,"Galactic Inheritors is exactly what the game summary says it is. So if you like that summary and you do not apply your own ideas of what else it might be, implied or otherwise, then this game will suit you and I recommend the game for you.If you are invisioning great dynasties and story side events to occur similar to CK2 or EU then although that may be the inferal you are most likely to take from the dev shop, it is not what they are drawing on for this game and in that you will be dissappointed.  Like CK2 and EU you must work to gain the option / ability to declar war.  From that stand point it is a nice turn to space based 4x games.  It also means there are no suprises out there.  No enemy bound, determined and soon to spring upon you without warning.  There is always a lead up and you have some time to prepare.Many will like this aspect I think.The expansion, the tech tree and the ship management are all pretty simple and work for achieving the stated goals of the game description.  There are not bad systems to colonize, only those that will be less good than others.  With no penalty for colonizing even systems with only a 1 of 4 or so starting value in each of 3 catagories (commerce ($), production and research this is reduced to colonize each system as fast as you can with the exception of find your choke points to nearby races quickly and colonize them and thus prevent them from colonizing or moving even further into your space.The most developed and it seems the focus of the game is the media. It is the mechanic most unique to the game and displaces diplomacy.  In this game much like in the minds of many European states today conflict is purely a response driven by the media.  Convince your audience the enemy is bad and preventing you from your greatness and you can get the populace opinion poll to get you enough over to the fear, hate, greed scale of your enemy is bad that you can declare war and war you shall have until it swings enough to the other side that peace may be signed.  This is a war of attrition to an extent.There are many wish to expand, build and reach the end of the tech tree and for whom combat and war are bothersome and when they can come at a moments notice seem unfair.  For those in particular this game I recommend this game.As for those who look for satisfaction in quickly balancing the factors of income, expansion and military might to overwhelm and achieve victory I think you will be less than satisfied.If you are expecting some of the witty, interesting and twists from CK that keep that game well above watching paint, that ingredient is missing.I enjoy CK but to be fair it is the dynastics, the awarding of titles, and the pop up events (not necessarily because they are historical) that keep the game from being very dry.  The same applies to EU series though its potential for dry and mechanical even more relies on the events (for me.)  This game is like them in that it is based more on an overlay of a database and mechanics that allow for challenges from the AI as the paths for behavior are more stringent.  A game does not have to have great or even good graphics to be a good and challenging game.I can not in fairness not recommend this game as it does exactly what the description says, not a whole lot more but does it well and there are many who play 4x games who will like this direction.  So I can recommend it for that crowd."

Sure, it's a slow begining (but like all 4X almost) and the graphical elements have much room for improvement (but if I can tell from the screenies around, it's upcoming)... but the most interesting thing is the key concepts in the game, that are a welcome change for once.No need to worry like crazy about war and early aggression (although 'Si vis Pacem, Para Bellum' ) but better build a few warships, and the interesting idea of the private enterprises in the military industrial complex doing that task for you (yes, I am the kind who hates design every single part of spaceships). But the most curious, and quite interesting, is the media thing.I have only play 200 turns right now, but I am keen on seeing a game where I may win (hoepfully) without behving like a space version of the Scourge of God...I tried the humans for start (I know, not original) and I like the faces of the other races...especially the frogs (hope they can win, unless the Crispon hold a grunge against batracians)...I'll keep on playing and, if i may, input some ideas and suggestions. There is a jewel here..."

They cleaned up the UI a bit and fixed a plethora of bugs and glitches. However, there still just isn't enough here to justify 20 dollars. When I first joined early access with this game, I was expecting something much... more. The 2 things that make this game stand out is the Military Industrial Complex (which is how you build your military ships) and the media-focused Diplomacy system (essentially by using the media, you control how your population views another faction) which again are both really cool features. Everything else is kind of watered down as far as 4X Turn-based strategy games go. I still recommend the game for people unfamiliar with the genre because it's very easy to pick up but for anyone who has played SotS, GalCiv, or Sins, then you've pretty much tread this territory before.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCRnefNUFDAEarly Access Review:""The usual 4X Strategy game. Similar to GalCiv or MOO yet with less personality. However, what it lacks in aesthetic, it makes up for in functionality and straightforwardness. For example, it ignores the technobabble of say... Sword of the Stars and tells you exactly what building something does. The Military Industrial Complex is a cool idea too... but you know what the best part is? Space Frogs. You can play as Space Frogs. The universe is my pond and my enemies are but flies!""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vVLmJXxaV0"

76561198026721511,Not Recommended,322540,20687495,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,Bloodsmack,"I like the game, but there some serious annoyances.  First the good.  I love how the exploration ships are used for more than just exploration.  That idea alone is brilliant.The thought of purchasing your war ships through private companies and performing research through those companies is a great idea, but I do not feel it was implemented well.  Perhaps if each company specialized in something or gave you a patented technology that only they could provide, or some incentive to pick one company over the other then it would be outstanding.The game has that ""Just one more turn"" feeling to it, I did find myself wanting to see how something would improve my situation once it was finished being (built or researched).That is pretty much the end of the good for me.When I first read the description of the game where it described how you have to use media against your enemies and for your friends, I thought that is a great idea.  Unfortunately, it is horribly implemented in this game.  First the concept of how it works is pretty vague.  I pictured it my mind that I would run some negative propaganda against my foe, and he would do the same and a short while later we would be at war, but the reality is the opposite.  In my game every time I ran negative media against someone, they responded with positive media, which pretty much negates my negative media, which ends in neither of us going to war.As a sidenote, I find it ironically funny that I can run a propaganda item that says my enemy has been crossing our border illegally, but I can't actually cross my enemies border to attempt to start a war because we are not at war.Unfortunately, I was unable to experience any combat in my game as I could not declare war on anyone and could not start a war no matter how hard I tried.  The media idea needs to be rethought in my opinion, or just scrapped all together.  If there is one good thing about the media portion of the game it is that you can influence your own population to provide research bonuses, or defense bonuses, etc.Five races seems to be a bit slim, perhaps the developer is planning on adding more in an expansion pack.It seems to be pretty stable, I did not run into any gameplay issues, no crashes.I really hope the developer can make the game better, there are some great ideas here, but I feel it just needs more playtesting to iron out the wrinkles in the gameplay."

The interface is horribly clunky, taking too many clicks to do simple things. For instance, if you have a production queue, you should be able to rearrange the queue instead of deleting items (and clicking confirmation) and then readding. Also, AI heaps a zillion ships everywhere and no way to make borders safe because fleet size is very limited (reminds me of Endless Space), while AI seems able to put its entire fleet on your border.Also, turns take too long. I don't want to sit and watch every ship movement be resolved.Some innovative ideas with this one, but it fell WELL short of my hopes. Sadly, this one is yet another 4x game should be passed over."

But making a good ui is an art in itself!The game doesn't have any bugs that i noticed. It seems it was fixed pretty much since starting sales.The devs don't seem to support the game anymore. I can see the 'producer' answering a question once every few months, but no patches and nothing more.I got the game below 10$, so i played 1 game and it was worth it. Above that price, the game is too expensive. And as it is right now, it is extremely repetitive with no variety in the 5 races you play or the galaxy you conquer. Gets boring fast!"

There's a couple of interesting mechanics with the explorer units and exploiting resources, and the diplomacy portion could be interesting in terms of holding off people attacking you. This definitely can change based on what options become available, and I will keep my eye out on this one.But the game is FAR too slow. Missing keyboard shortcuts is brutal, as everything is mouse driven. A hundred turns in, no one has attacked each other: no one can. The first 50 turns is slow going yet essential. There's missing information to know exactly what you're building. Missing UI elements to know what your status is. You feel disconnected from the experience. Lack of additoinal sounds loses immersion.For more gameplay and Impressions/Details, look at the video here:http://youtu.be/fhxTq1VSwis"

Much of the game mechanics are cumbersome. The tech tree is predictable and short.3. The computer AI is not aggressive even though at times while I was playing it clearly had advantages.4. Some of the special tech advantages are not detailed in any manner and so as the player you will have no idea what you should do.5. Upgrading manufacturing companies is not at all detailed so its hard to decide what to do and how it will affect your fleet.Positives:1. One of the interesting mechanics is that you need to create negative ""attitudes"" against a prospective opponent.  By that I mean, you cannot attack a neighboring civ unless you first begin a negative attitude campaign and get it to a high enough level to be able to declare war. It's a cool idea but like the rest of the game its poorly executed.I would forgive this game if it was an Alpha or Beta but that is not the case with this game.So 5 negative comments vs 1 positive comment = poorly made game.DONT BUY IT"
