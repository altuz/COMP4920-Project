,Not Recommended,322630,21719774,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Travis.touchdown,"The art style by KYO Kuroichigo looked gorgeous, and the setting appeared promising from the trailer, so I gave ""Mind Zero"" a shot. I'm a huge fan of visual novels and anime, and usually, I don't particularly mind if a port is a little rough around the edges. However, with ""Mind Zero"", Aksys Games don't even have the bare basics down. The game is locked at the internal PS Vita resolution, with no option to adjust it. You can run it in full screen, but that will just scale it, making it quite a blurry mess. Moreover, some people on the forums have been complaining about their controllers not being recognized -- meaning you will eventually have to resort to third-party tools (e.g. Xpadder) to fix that.Also, if you're like me and prefer to play most games via -- God forbid -- KB + mouse setup, don't even bother, as Aksys have failed to implement even basic mouse functionality. By default, you need to control analog stick movement via some arbitrarily assigned keys. If that doesn't float your boat: Hey, no problem, youcan, as I randomly found out, use the mouse to navigate the map and menus, you just need tohold downthe left mouse button the entire time. Sounds like fun, right? Of course (this is a port 'classic'), the game willALWAYSshow controller button prompts, regardless of your input method. Which means you're in for fun times, when the game asks for ""A"", but means ""Y"", asks for ""Y"", but means ""S"", and so forth.Overall, the game itself looks interesting enough, so if you own a PS Vita you may want to track down a copy for cheap. But stay away from this port --especiallyif you plan to play via KB + mouse.If you're looking for a visual novel boasting great art style and story, which is also competently ported, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc""! ""Xblaze Code: Embryo"" is entertaining, too and a surprisingly solid port, considering that it's also published by Aksys."

It seems similar to Persona, and there seems to be some promise there, but there is so much getting in the way.I had to randomly hit keys to figure out how to get to the settings menu (the Z key is your A button, btw) where I could find the rest of the keys.  The fullscreen option did not apply right away, and only showed up after a restart.The 'transitions' between scenes are just a fade out and fade in on the same bg way too often, there is way too little context for what is going on in the scenes so that it's really hard to picture what is going on.On the plus side, it seems decently voice acted.  Woo.My no vote comes from the fact that once I was ready to quit, I couldn't.  It was stuck in fullscreen mode, to the point that ctl-alt-del did just about nothing.  More random key mashing led to steam eventually launching one of my other games that didn't have focus.  So yeah, that's an issue.  I don't want to have to hold down my power button every time I want to quit.tl;dr  Even $15 feels a bit much for this game.  It's really bare bones."

Whilst the mechanics aren't staggeringly original, there's a nice balance in how much you're prepared to spend for the bigger skills, and each fight can reward you with bonuses depending on how you fought, which can encourage certain tactical choices you'd otherwise dismiss.  The character art is good, in a Visual Novel style, and the splash CGs are well done.  Voice acting is very good and there's a lot of it, and the story is intriguing even if you have to suspend your disbelief significantly.However....The negatives are too much.  First and foremost, this is a dreadful, lazy port.  I feel bad for giving money to something that shows such little evidence of any effort.  Resolution is locked at the original PSVita resolution as far as I can tell (960x544) even in full screen, making it look like an PS2-era game, full of jagged edges and obvious pixels.  Textures are blurred and low-res, especially in the dungeon corridors.  Sound quality is a hit-and-miss affair, with odd stereo placement and volume issues abounding, and the title song sounds like it was recorded onto an old magnetic cassette tape by sticking a microphone next to a radio speaker. Load times are excessive and make *zero* use of the memory that PCs can provide over the Vita.  Dungeon exploration involves significant and inexplicable lag and input-delay.  Elements of the touch-screen interface of the original remain, such as slashing barriers or pushing levers, and are replaced - without informing you - with mouse interactions.  However, no other aspect of the game will be controlled with the mouse... you have to use the awkward keyboard controls. They've replaced the Vita original button icons with Xbox Gamepad button icons, and then failed to implement a way to use the XBox Gamepad to actually play the game!Honestly, it's just shocking.I want to like it.  I really do.  There's a solid dungeon-crawl experience in there that's trying to claw it's way out.  But as it stands, unless Zerodiv/Aksys are prepared to listen to people and make the necessary changes to this port, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game."
76561198061606765,Not Recommended,322630,24381897,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,brian_gillispie,"Mind Zero is a game that revolves around a bunch of high school kids and their powers called MIND's. I decided to give the game a go as the idea looked interesting, but after 11 hours in I'm calling it quits. I made it to the end of dungeon 4 before I stopped, which will be reflected in this review.Game World: The world of Mind Zero is interesting, minds are causing problems, police are investigating it, and you have been roped into things. Sadly, after the first hour or so introduction, you will get stuck in an endless grind that seems to never let you learn more about the game world. Still, what I got to see was interesting: 7/10Character Creation and Development: The characters in the game seemed interesting from the beginning, but nothing had changed by dungeon 4 with them. They were still the same ol'. 1/10NPC Interaction: Very limited. You get to interact with your party and have a few scenes with them outside of the dungeons, but that is about it. 4/10Foes: Battles are against the same ol' foes, and by later dungeons its just a bunch of pallete swaps. Oh, look, this sheep is blue this time! Occasionally an interesting foe comes along, but it is too rare. Also, I felt foes were poorly balanced against the reward to fight them. For example, in dungeon 4 there is this @^&@ lion that takes forever to kill, and gives less experience than foes I found easier to kill later on. And this is a constant problem in the game, where the expereince reward is disproptionate to how hard it is to kill the foe: 2/10Combat: Combat is poor in this game. You have TP/HP/MP, MP works as a shield as long as your MIND is up, but the only way to regenerate it is to drop your MIND and defend, or use an item (which also requires you to drop your MIND). Also, you never get any more TP than 10 in the entire game, which starts to seriously hinder your strategies as the game moves on, especially when the spells get more expensive. Plus, why do I have to spend HP to cast spells and the foes do not? That tactic of foes don't pay costs the players do was old back when FF8 was new in the 90's, and there is NO reason to still use it now: 1/10Equpiment: Seemed promising, but I never found much to equip there and the stores never seemed to have much either. Can't upgrade your weapons: 1/10Economy: Broken. By dungeon 3 I had all the stores carried, and there was nothing to spend my money on. That changed a little when I got to dungeon 4, but I was able to buy all of that with what I had been saving to this point. 1/10Quests: Well. there's a main quest. But prepare to grind for hours to see anything. What little I saw seemed interesting, I just wish there had been more of it to see: 1/10Graphics/sound/interface: This is a PS Vita port, no bells and whistles. Keys are mapped to 1/2/a/s/z/x and one other I forgot which is start (and good luck figuring it out). No attempt to explain the keys either, prepare to smash your keyboard to find it: 3/10Gameplay: The game is nothing but a slog through a bunch of dungeons, nothing to keep it interesting. Eventually I got bored of it: 1/10Total: 22/100. However, I have to apply some score penalies now. First, this port seems to have been abandoned by the publisher, which is a no/no in my book. Second, the game is just HORRIBLY balanced. Bosses will get 2 turns a round at random (and I mean at random. Sometimes they go once, sometimes twice). Also, the HP of the bosses is ridiculous! I finally gave up at boss 4 because I was at the point where I was winning regular fights in my sleep, but couldn't beat tha boss because it was cheating the system. Look developers, us game players are TIRED of games where the bosses do not follow the same rules the players do! The makers of this game need to go back to school and learn how to balance a game, or at least play and learn from the classics. Old school Wizardry games have better balance than this game does!-10 for atrocious balance and abandoned support = 12/100 final score, which is in the stay far away category. Play anything else than this game."

When you get hit, it is literally the enemy attacking you characters picture.Skills seem wonky and explanations even more so.In short I got this game in hopes of it being a sort of Persona for PC, however calling it a 'Persona clone' is thus far feeling like an insult to Persona and for the price tag, i must admit I am feeling somewhat jipped. I understand its a port but looking at P3 portable....this could have been better. WAY better. I use the SCP wrapper in order to use my ps3 controller with the game so it feels a little more fluent....until you get to dungeon 'navigation' if you want to call it that. That being said im not knocking the game, the story is very rich and it is whats so far driving me to play the game. If you dont care for graphics which i know alot of people dont and just want a persona like visual novel if give it a try. But eh....wait for a steam sale. It isnt worth 20 bucks. Or even 15 at the 20% off in my very personal opinion. I would like to hope there would be patches to make this PC worthy and not for it to remain a port but....it's more than likely a dream that will be forever embedded in my Sad little mind. If you want Persona.....just....Play persona."

Outside of the resolution stuff that others have brought up, this is a fine port. The game itself is super underrated, unfortunately (and unfairly) being compared to Persona. If you're looking for a visual novel with DRPG gameplay, with a solid--albeit it somewhat formulaic--story and characters, a great soundtrack, and a really, REALLY excellent dub, then you'll probably really enjoy the game."

You can see small fragments around them, Jesus.You can tell the developers did not care about the quality of this game, and just wanted to quickly make something to cash grab. I wanted to play a game at least somewhat similar to Persona, but this is garbage. I've seen a lot of other negative reviews about the horrible pc port, which can quickly be resolved with xpadder, but what really makes this game so bad is how the story telling was designed.There is no narration or 3D models to explain what the hell is going on. It's easy to get lost what is happening to the characters or what they're doing, and the out of sync sound effects doesn't help.Also, the actual gameplay is horrible. The tutorial is a bunch of text. Some gameplay designs are pointless. And the dungeon crawler looks like it was made from 1990.Overall: 3/10F you lazy Japanese game developers. This is just another example of a dissappointing game that resulted from lazy and inconsiderate game design because they just wanted to quickly gain money.

Story gets boring after awhile, you cannot change weapons or upgrade, every enemy are almost the same thing. The grind. Request refund.------------I am not the type of person to write reviews... Espeically public ones but I just had to write my own opinion on this.A game... Where you spam your keyboard just to find which key is what.... and.... To FINALLY find out how to acess the key config and set it to your preference(and spamming buttons and start button on the logitech controller just to find out that the controller doesn't work for this game...)I started playing this game without going to the config first. So basically I was just clicking away until I got to the battle scene that asked me to press L on my controller.... now... which frickin' key on my keyboard is the L? *Spams keys and it does something* well... what key did I press? I don't know but it worked! *Another scene where I have to press L* *Second try and finally finds out its the number 1 on the keyboard* I got fed up and got to a save point and just had to go to the key config and boy that was fun also. So when it ask me to press L... I will literally press L on my keyboard.So far I'm recommending it only the fact that I bought it for $8 on special, it is not worth $20. haven't fully played it yet. I am only recommending it if your controller works and able to change the key config and of course, on special. Though I'm on the verge to not recommend it but it might change after I play it a bit.Pros:The art is niceFull screen works.... (For me that is... After playing around with the config first >.>)Choice of Japanese and English audioCons:The English voice acting... they all act... so bored... not surprised their situation they are in. -- Haven't tried Japanese yet.Grinding.Story.The port in general.I highly suggest to buy Persona series instead of this game if you have a vita.~Sorry for bad English and grammar~"

More things unlocked as you progress.Dungeons are ok, battle system takes a little bit of getting used to.Cons: This game was abandoned by the devs on steam. It has the worst keyboard mapping I've ever seen, no controller support, My logitech controller is useless with this game. You can remap the bindings but they don't stick. No quit option in full screen. I am forced to play in windowed mode and X out the game when i'm done.My advice, go to game settings and look at the keymap options, write down the bindings of each key, that way, you won't have to play guess that key taking up your time instead of playing the game.Any good dev knows that easy game navigation is essential to enjoy a game. This game fails in that respect. It's like trying to pilot a 747 without a pilot's license.The game is actually fun to play once you can get over it's glaring flaws. But due to it's lack of completeness, I am on the fence for this one, 50/50So if you're smart and can figure out the keys and the game, it's playable. So I recommend it, barely."

The game is so earily similar to the Persona series, that I would definitely believe it to be made by the same people if you told me that.But from what I can say, the port of this game from Vita to PC seems to be a bit rushed, having a few minor issues graphically, and only one resolution. Also the game starts in windowed mode, which is extremely unexpected, and the whole game was made to be played with an xbox controller, so all of the prompts are for xbox controls, but of course, you CAN play with keyboard as I am.From what I can see, this game may be interesting if you like the first person dungeon crawling of Persona, but so far I haven't seen that much of a unique reason to go for it.

I'm 80% through the game and here are my thoughts.I originally greenlite this game because I hoped to feel the rollercoaster of emotions that I experienced when I first played  Persona 3. Sadly, Mind Zero pales in comparison to any game of the Shin Megami Tensei series.My problem with this game is that they tried hard to copy the Persona series but failed to emulate its writing, character development, and gameplay. In short, the story is rather a blander version of P3, with the MC gathering a crew to fight a evil gang of Minders. There's even a small sub plot in which a character overcomes her fears to accept the mind she formed a contract with, just like in the Persona series. Each character is hastily developed and the story jumps around a lot. The protagonist literally meets some random dude and immediatley forms an alliance with him to close doorways that spawn monsters. I think I read less than a hour of plot for the 20 hours of grinding I needed to do to fight the bosses.Gameplay  revolves around first-person dungeon crawling that is iconic to traditional RPGs, with the player finding loot in chests and fighting a boss in each dungeon. Plot is usually advanced after defeating each dungeon boss and the player has opportunities to accept requests (side quests) and view side plots. Requests are mostly pointless unless you want the steam achievement. Most of the challenges have you fighting weaker enemies that yield lower exp due to level scaling. The rewards, with the ex skills exception, are usually weaker than your current equipment.The tp mechanic (mana subsitute) in this game punishes upgrading and enhancing skills, which was the only unique customization aspect of this game. Since each character is stuck with a max of 10 tp and earns 2 tp per turn if he/she defends, it takes a long time to cast high level skills, which can cost 6-8. I can use 3 t2 spells  and do 900 damage or use 2 t3 spells and do 800 in the same amount of turns. When you defend, your also without the protection of your mind (is that what those things are called?) so you take direct damage to your health. Late game, bosses and some mobs can easily one-shot you through the bonus defence you recieve.Music and sfx has promise but is ruined in the port. Everything is too loud and low qualility. Voice-acting somehow survived and is excellent.Overall I don't recommend this game unless your really into traditional RPGs. You'll probably quickly tire of the endless grinding and generic gameplay."

It doesn't get interesting as time goes on either- It simply gets worse. The graphics are very nice, and the fight mechanics are fairly interesting. However, the story and voice acting (mainly English voice acting) isn't really good at all. I would try a different approach to the story line. That might help."
