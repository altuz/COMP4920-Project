,Not Recommended,322750,32210191,Posted: 5 June,all,Asmor,"It's not a bad game, but... it's just not very good.The combat (at least in the first few levels) is very slow. More importantly, the weapons and skills just don't have any oomph. This game needs some juice in its combat. Even with skills that cause explosions and instantly vaporize the smaller enemies, it just felt... blah.The UI is serviceable but obnoxious. In particular, the game says it plays best with a controller, but then forces you to use a cursor even with the controller. It also doesn't give you much feedback on how weapons behave. For example, I couldn't find any way to tell the fire rate of a weapon besides equipping it and going on a mission. This was a nasty surprise when the first thing I equipped turned out to be a powerful, but very slow, cannon.This has potential to be a good game. It's not a fundamentally bad idea. Most of its problems are fairly superficial and it just needs to spend a bit more time baking."
,Recommended,322750,32219236,Posted: 6 June,all,TomBoss,"The game is exactly what is promises to be - a mix between a Shoot 'Em Up and an Action RPG.This game is for you if you like SHMUPs and Diablo-like loot systems.This game probably isn't for you if you dislike grinding and/or fighting a lot of the same enemy types.The soundtrack is top notch, the art style is appealing.The movement might take a little time getting used to - some might say it's a bit sluggish or slow. I think it works fine - it's a matter of taste really. Your weapons lack a little punch (visually), but that doesn't change my recommendation.Play the demo if you're unsure. I personally like it a lot - 15-20€ is totally worth it."

The only colorful post-apocalyptic ARPG you'll ever play that's not ugly shades of puke green, sand colored, or rainbow.You're the pilot of a ship under one of the last groups of humanity fighting for resources on a newly shattered planet. You mass murder waves of enemies who likely have families and stuff of their own - but you get sweet loot, can customize your ship, get money, and cause more mayhem than nuking the hell out of anyone in your path.Pros:+ VERY neat art style. Graphically incredibly pleasing on the eyes+ the UI is clean, very user friendly and never confusing on what's what and where to click for what+ You can use a huge amount of skills in any configuration you want+ ship upgrades to give you an RPG feeling along with collecting loot such as weapons, thrusters, hull pieces, CPUs, etc.+ leaderboards for those of you who love competition+ tight, responsive controls+ For $13.99 you WILL get your money's worth out of the game+ OST is AMAZING. Will keep you entertained while blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up+ Three traditional kinds of ships or ""classes"": The Marauder, which is a balanced 50/50 ship between resistences to magnetic/plasma damage and power; The Sentinel, which is your tank - low fire power but high resistence; and finally, the Interceptor; which has the highest fire power between the two but is also the lightest and most nimble but also the most fragile+ No weapons restrictions! Like that laser on one ship and want it on the maurader to increase its fire power capabilites? Go for it! Want a true tank? Stick on a railgun to your Sentinel! Want an even more nimble ship? Go hunt down an engine or thrusters that increase movement speed! Every ship is completely customizable and even those ships have three variants (so far) that are an upgrade from your base model.+ Missions carry on the plot.  Unlike the EA missions, there are missions that you can do that tie into the plot.  Choose your missions carefully!Cons:- Not many xD10/10: Would blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up again"

,Recommended,322750,29495610,Posted: 25 January,all,Lord Trent Kelto,"So far, I'm really quite enjoying this game.  I'd say that the first boss is a very noteworthy difficulty step up, but even so, I find the 'grind' enjoyable thus far, and I'm not a grind-loving person.Pros:+Beautiful, interesting looking and feeling game.  Good art.+Fun side scrolling shooter gameplay, strong ability to mix and match different ships/guns/skills to tailor your own personal preferences.+Interesting enemies and mix-ups throughout different levels.+Frequent and interesting rewards for your time.+A retreat option that lets you keep your rewards you earned thus far through the current mission IF you are smart enough to know when to use it and can stay alive for the short time it takes to activate.  Useful when you get in over your head.+Nice menu design that feels more like a part of the world than just a simple menu setup.+RPG mechanics for raising stats, equiping better equipment, buying skills, and rewards in general.Cons:-No mouse control mode.  This means those without mechanical keyboards have added difficulty unless they tailor their keybindings; I could not, on the default settings, shoot and go diagonal at the same time because of this.  This is my biggest issue with the entire game especially since it allows joysticks, but not the use of mice.(EDIT: not valid:) -Absolutely no keybinding changes, at least no where I could find. (There IS a way, but it's not in game.  It's in the ""Launch Configuration"" option when you start the game under ""Input"".)-Input alterations do not stay unless you launch the configuration through steam before opening the game.  Any keybindings changed will reset to normal unless launched through the configuration.  The desktop shortcut does not open the configuration but the main game itself.  This seems like a bug that will hopefully be fixed.Neutral:=Some degree of grind may be required to get a good/powerful enough equipment setup.I'd recommend it, but I plead with the developers to give us a mouse control mode."

Flying around shooting stuff feels great and their different ship classes have slightly different score systems which is very cool. That being said, the current progression and loot systems make the game incredibly frustrating. There are too many stats with few explanations that make comparing gear very difficult. A lot of the higher quality gear drops with negative aspects that aren't made incredibly obvious. Some flaws will even cause you to lose equipment if you fail a mission. Good luck beating that boss after having equipment destroyed.I can't recommend Drifting Lands to anyone until the loot system and related punishments are smoothed out."

They are either boring in execution or painfully lacking in effectiveness. I've played a great variety of shmups of different sorts and I really expect the weapons to be more impressive in general. For the weapons in this game to do the job I need them to do requires excessive grinding which I don't appreciate in a single player game.Without weapons being retuned I can't see myself playing anymore, let alone completing the game.Edit: Just a quick note for anyone wondering. My personal preference for a really good shmup would be something like R-Type Final if you've had the chance to play it. Really good replayability, and plenty of options for unique ship choices. That's the yardstick by which I measure my side scrollin' shooters."

There is a nice loot system that allows for loot metagaming, something an ARPG fan will appreciate.  Production values are good (other than text and UI being diffiuclt on big screen mode) considering youll spend a lot of time in the hangar squinting at stats and navigating tiny UI windows and buttons...not a huge deal but could use improvement for those of us not playing on a monitor 1 foot from your face.The biggest drawback i see, is what i guess the developers call inertia.  In laymens terms there are delays in movement when controlling your ship.  Given the pace of the game is slow for a schmup, the trash ships you fight are tanky, your controls of the ship feel sluggish, floaty, and well...boring/unfun.  Sloppy controls is what i call interia.  Problem is the developer is hard set on keeping this as if it adds something to gameplay, which it doesnt.  It will not change ever.  Im the only one who dislikes sloppy schmup controls as well, according to the devs.Given the firm stance on the fact that controls will be sloppy as a feature, im not sure i can really reccomend the game as it wont ever improve the one thing that i feel makes the game unpleasant to play... and it make the gameplay more of a chore than schmup action with a fantastic loot system.If you are not into schmups, or are unfamilair, it might not be a problem.  Im assured ""skills"" can create faster gameplay though movement skills...which is great...but bottom line the gameplay just feels icky with the sloppy controls, which is amplified by tanky trash mobs, and the already slow pace of action.If you imagined a schump where you are ripping through screen fulls of enemy ships, in a high action enviroment....this isnt it....when i complete a mission (missions are extremely short btw which isnt a negative tbh) i dont feel the urge to keep playing because the controls are sloppy by design, the pace is slow, and the enemies are tanky.This game is on the verge of being a great and unique game (ok so upgrades and schmups are not unique...though i feel the loot aspect adds a level of uniqueness)Really hate to see a game in EA where the developers are hard set on the game they are making...like whats the point of feedback if one of the more common complaints (from what i can see) is something they refuse to address?Ill keep popping in the game and update if things change for me over time.  Right now i cant seem to do more than one or two missions in a row without wanting to exit out, not because the game sucks, but because it just doesnt feel fun to play...and im not farming for loot and grinding  (which i love to do in games) when the controls and combat are not entertaining.Thumbs down for gameplay, though id rate the game maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10...not a bad game...just dont expect schmup action, crisp gameplay, or heart pounding adrenaline while farming for loot...sleepy time combat/pace/controls."

So far i haven't gotten that far into the game but i already like where the story is going.Also, you can customise your vehicle which i really love.The ingame economy is fairly good. At first you think, what? I just get 10%? I made like 10k credits and now im left with 1k? Blasphemy.But if you keep playing you'll realise how easy it is to make credits, one mission can give you 2k credits easily and you can replay some missions.Yes, a controller is definitely better for this game.The only cons i can come up with right now is the controls, i used the default controls but it didn't register my fire button so i just changed it. ( i am new to controller on pc so theres that.. )Conclusion: Have you played these kind of games before? Yes? Buy it, this is a must have.Do you have little to no experience with these games but you are interested? Consider getting this game, its quite casual and friendly to new players."
76561198009341087,Recommended,322750,32406235,Posted: 14 June,all,Avarre,"This game gives me mixed emotions, but they're ultimately positive.First off, the game looks and plays great. Overall the game has a feeling of polish in just about everything. So keep that in mind while I gripe about things that may or may not put you off from it.Anyhow, the biggest complaint I have is weapon variety and feel. Even with the skills you're given, the ways you have to attack something start to feel very same-y. Thus far I've only really encountered a couple of ""types"" of primary weapons. You've got your bullet types and your laser types. The bullet type weapons consist of a handful of spread options for spewing bullets in various directions and patterns. Laser types shoot a beam in various directions and duration. And they all feel very similar. For example, the ""minigun"" and ""autocannon"" weapon types both go ""pew-pew-pew"" and deal damage. The only real difference is the angle of attack and frequency. Any of those types can be dealing different elements of damage, but it's going to feel the same regardless. There's no visceral feedback at all. There's no blood thirsty rush from keeping the trigger down and rushing almost into a collision with a minigun. Almost everything has a plinky feel to it. Even the railgun, a slow single shot laser type weapon, somehow manages to feel kind of like a flashlight.Which is a bummer since everything else in this game is very pleasant. And maybe that's part of the problem? The smoothness present in everything almost seems to have seeped into the combat. Combat gets fast and hectic, but never carnal like Steredenn, for example. No matter what is happening, it's all very smooth.All that said, it's a good time. I just wish the primary weapons had a little more personality."

It is not. Your weapons and abilities lack power, it just feels like your poking things once you get past the first few missions. The most disapointing part is that the objective of 95% of the rounds is to simply survive, you don't have to kill anything (not that your weapons are powerful enough to take them down anyway) even ""mini-bosses"" after a certain period just fly away and the mission just ends anticlimactically.As far as RPG goes, I wouldn't say it is one, the story line is boring and linear."

They're just segments composed of different ennemy formation. There's some variations but once you know them, they get old. And you have to do a ton of them to progress.The loot doesn't seem that great either. It's basically ""equipement type (level)"", with different colors defining rarity. Problem is the level is a lot more important than the rarity, so instead of hunting for rare stuff, you can do with whatever comes to you.The game flow is constantly interrupted by making the player returns to the base between stages. Sometimes for briefings and story, sometimes for subplot, and sometimes for nothing. Sure that's where you equip stuff and sell / buy ship parts but it's not like you have to do that every two minutes.So, yeah.If there was a ""meh"" button, I would give the game that.Since there isn't, I'll go with a thumb up, because the game is overall competently made, and there's an interesting active and passive skills system. But don't buy that game expecting something action packed, especially from the start."

This game incorporates many different traits of many different genres that I all happen to enjoy in a very pleasing package. The only thing I can say is I wish it could be multiplayer; I would love to play this game with a friend or my spouse.edit: One thing that I believe would make this great game more even more enjoyable is if there were more variety in the attack skills to try to speed up the cadence for short bursts."

I am completely convinced this game is already one of the better shmups to come out in the past few years.The only thing I feel this game really needs is some LIFE. Everything in this game is great except the enemies, worlds, bullets, animations are a little empty. Take for example flying patterns, when the ships float in and out of the screen it just feels like they drop into place at an even speed. It makes it hard to understand exactly when they are actually on screen. Animations should be more aggressive, enemies need more variety not only in bullets (which seem to be static) but ship styles too.There needs to be more visual queues and symbols for the player to be able to more easily read patterns and trends. Some types of shaking would be welcome but more importantly for things like damage impact, explosions, contact, item pickup. Text on the screen (in gameplay) should also be more visible and dynamic. If you pick up some currency then the number should float off while getting larger and fading out. These are really just some suggestions and at this point I'm rambling.I literally haven't commented on the gameplay because it's already great. And the stuff Im talking about is really polish.

You know what makes a game fun? How about practical progression? What about engaging mechanics? An immersive storyline? Or even an effective way to play this game? Your game has NONE OF THAT. There are a few bugs that are very annoying in this game as well. Your auto equip function is not intelligent as it completely ignores any 2nd, 3rd, or 4th item slots. Additionally, the voice over sound in the command center makes me feel as if I am going insane. Change it or cut out all sound in that stupid tab. Finally, I am on like level...um 30 something...and it is simply impossible to even come close to killing anything to even get a LOOT drop! How fun is that?! Also if I do manage to hunt a target down to kill it I am destroyed by the hail of bullets from ignoring swarms of other small units as well as taking death damage/impossible to hit before the target even leaves damage then I die.The game has potential but as of now this is far from what an RTYPE/GRADIUS/DIABLO game should feel like.

The artist's touch is felt everywhere: from beautiful backgrounds, to hand-drawn cutscenes, to modern clean UI. Presentation in this game is just top-notch, this is what top-quality shmup should look in 2017.The gameplay is also interesting. Diablo-like loot system adds variety and forces you to switch between weapon types, and bosses require you to optimize both loadout and skill usage. In a welcome difference from ARPGs, you don't need character skill to use a different weapon, so you can experiment with different guns to your heart's content. And the weapons are quite different, requiring varying tactics to use well. I must admit I found some weapons less useful than others, but maybe I'm just not good enough to learn to use them efficiently.With Diablo-like loot comes Diablo-like grind, where you re-do a level many times to get an unique weapon or just enough money for upgrades. Unlike Steel Rain or Revolution Ace, grinding here isn't very painful. It is helped by random level generation, so each playthrough is a bit different, even if you replay the same level.Storyline feels a bit incomplete, as it ends on Grade 4, releasing the player to continue adventures in endless mode where you can replay previous levels at a higher difficulty and fight bosses to unlock the rest of the Grades.The game offers different approaches which make it accessible both for casual player like me, who just want to play through the story with some challenge, and for achievers and perfectionists. This is done by providing 3 different ships and skills that trade between ease of play and resulting scores. For example, very useful Single Impact skill, which can save you in many hairy situations, also halves your Focus score, which is importany for some high-end skills (which you won't get until afther the storyline's end) and scores. So you can chose to use that skill, and make the game easier, or replace it, say, with Perfectionist skill, which provider greater rewards, but require you to avoid taking any damage at all, if possible.Sound is solid, but one can complain about repetitive voice condfirmations of skill activations and Focus level changes, which grow stale after a while.All in all, Drifting Lands is a ver good game, and a worthy competitor to Xenoraid for the title of the best shoot-em-up of the year. Play it, you won't regret it!"

76561197992644752,Recommended,322750,34117252,Posted: 8 August,all,Cestia,"Drifting Lands is a well executed fusion between the Shoot 'em Up (SHMUP) and Action Roleyplaying Game (ARPG) genres. It blends elements found in old school games like Tyrian with design elements of games like Diablo 3 seamlessly into a new and fresh experience.Difficulty levels are split into grades and the first five grades encompass the story mode. There are three general types of enemies within the game, a third of them just reskins. Content wise there is not that much variety, but the story mode will give players a solid 20 hours of gameplay, with additional options of running through levels and increasing leaderboard scores.The style and aesthetic of DL is well executed and enjoyable. Explosions, weapon effects, sounds and music are especially well done. Ship designs are a little uninspired, but enemy designs more than make up for it.The only complaint I really had about the game was the lack of flavour text on weapons. Weapons have different firing effects, but the only way to find out what they are is to run a mission with a weapon. This was annoying and could often lead to mission failure, because not all weapons work that well. Tyrian used a separate window with the ship constantly firing to see how the effect worked, I think DL could benefit from this design.Overall DL was an enjoyable experience and worth the money. I would recommend the game to ARPG players and SHMUP players who want to branch out of their genre."

It just seems like the direction they may be going in isnt what id like to play.

It is missing two BIG features too though.  Autofire (DUH!  When are you ever not shooting?) and the ability to switch weapons.  There are ten different neat weapons in here, but some are so situational you never use them.  I'd love to be able to switch between even two."

This game deserves a review 'cuz it's epic.I've played these types of games since UN Squadron and Raydon on SNES so...I'm used to how hard they can be.That being said, this game is awesome. Great graffics, sound, story, design/progression etc. You can name your ship, which is cute.The forgiving mode is great (that's what im playing in, cuz I like my gear) so you can repair legendaries when they break, so death has no penalty really, but even normal mode if you have it together you don't die much.Don't listen to the negative reviews. I don't find the controls sloppy, the equipment confusing or the levels difficult. Progression seems nice; you can always go back and farm for more gear and credits. Enemies and levels are varied and well thought out.  Skills are well done. One review did have a point that most of the primary weapons are kinda meh, but thats what your skills are for. I don't understand people crying that this game is difficult.  In UN Squadron you had 3 lives and that was it. If you died, you had to start over with no weapons, no ships, no credits.So, yea, these types of games can be brutally difficult. But its fine, pick one of theships with more health if you didnt grow up playing these games or are dying a lot.  Even if you're halfway decent, pick the Interceptor b/c you can eventually make it have just as much health, with the right equipement, as the maurader and it gets double the weapon damage modifier. Yea you dont get as much focus, but you kill more things, so credit take is about the same.All in all, great addictive mix of shooting stuff till it goes boom and grinding for gear. Totally worth the price, I'm sure I'll get lots of hours out of it."

Sadly the content is stretch over 30+ hours to see all the cool bosses and new ennemies of the game, which make it too repetitive quite quickly. as an rpg: level up and grinding will be part of the game.

76561198080373672,Recommended,322750,33367300,Posted: 8 July,all,Andran,"The game is a decently polished side-scroller. The skill and item system is very similar to that of diablo 3, as weird as it may sound to compare an action-rpg to a side-scrolling shooter. Gameplay is intense and feels good, even great at times.Unfortunately, the game is still rather short. It doesn't feel like it's finished even though it's supposedly not in early-access anymore. My advice is to try it if you don't mind that the game is still unfinished, but if you don't have that much money and/or want something to play for months, buy something else instead."
,Not Recommended,322750,32362215,Posted: 12 June,all,evil_arev,"Meh.I guess there's more shopping/equipping fun than shooting fun in this game. I hoped more from the shmup part. It looks beautiful, can't argue here, but the stages are perfectly forgettable and mostly boring. Perhaps it changes further into the game, but I don't see myself playing for hours to see if the game becomes fun enough.The shopping part is nice. There's a lot of equipment with plenty of of subtle differences to keep you optimizing the ship. That's the most interesting part of the early game, at least for me.The dialogs are rather bland and I can't say they add to the game. As such, I'd prefer if there were far less of them pausing me between the missions.On top of all the gripes I have with the game is the terribly designed UI. The game says it's best played with a gamepad and then emulates a mouse pointer with the analog stick. I remember UFO: Enemy Unknown on the PSX doing this. It was in 1995 and the UX designers have come a really long way since then. The developers mentioned somewhere they're going to improve the gamepad experience but, again, I won't be waiting for it to happen, especially since it won't fix the mediocre shmup part for me.Refunded."

76561197970739339,Recommended,322750,32311355,Posted: 10 June,all,Captain Chaos,"I'm enjoying Drifting Lands so far. I love games like this that fly in under my radar- and even better, provide a demo. Other devs, take this hint from Alkemi: If you want people to buy your game, publish a damn demo! Also, score one for Steam's ""Because you Played X"" recommendations, or this game might have escaped my notice.Drifting Lands is a hybrid horizontal shoot-em-up and action RPG, self-described as a Diablo-like. It has an appealing visual style, a great soundtrack and an interesting class system wherin each ship has a different means of building the score multiplier, called Focus, which in this game means more money, which means more upgrades for your ship. Not simply being a light/medium/heavy lineup, each ship is designed with a specific type of shooter fan in mind. The nimble Interceptor is for the bullet hell types, and builds Focus by ""shaving"" enemy bullets, that is, passing close to them without hitting them. The middling Marauder builds Focus by flying into and staying in ""focus vortexes"", requiring the player to balance positioning and potential threats. Lastly, the durable Sentinel builds Focus whenever it recharges its shields, meaning the player is actually rewarded for taking damage- where doing so with the other ships would make you lose focus. It also has more armor and passive upgrade slots then the other ships, with the intent being it is meant to eventually overcome by gear quality what the interceptor would need player skill for. I will see if this is the case in the long run."

76561198139614545,Recommended,322750,32528169,Posted: 17 June,all,Wonderpill,"What a fantastic game!!!From what I was reading and the videos I watched of the game, I was hesitant to pick this game up, based on it being a budget title.  I'm glad I let my inner-child control my wallet sometimes... This time it was one of those times where it worked out in my favor.I have been a fan of these crazy game types, where the screen is full of nonsense, and you dodge it or reflect it, Ikaruga gave me a decent run for my money back in the day, but it was short, 6 hours of playing it and I was bored.This game reminds me specifically of the PS2 ""R-TYPES"".  R-TYPES is not the whole series in general, but the specific game from the R-Type series.  Tons of ships, that were customizeable, and unlocked various ways.  This game is similar, and for me so far, is at least on par with a series that made it through my childhood into my adulthood.Bravo!I have put in about 14 hours into this game, and I would say that there are a lot of things going on.Aside from some spelling issues, I caught 4 back to back item descriptions that were missing letters in the middle of words, or just missing words in general.  This is the only MAJOR flaw I have run across.If you do not like ROGUE-LIKE games, sadly, there are a few missions that send you back to the first sector if you fail... This can be time consuming.There is also a difficulty ramping, that you will not feel until you smack face into the spike in difficulty.Hardcore mode can be had if you are a masochist, (with this selection of mods on the ship, if you wreck it, its GAME OVER)... not recommended.There is a handhold mode, that prevents items from breaking, and ships from being destroyed, which loosens up a few perks from being end game options.I am currently at the first Boss encounter, which I assume there might be more of, but based on all the gear and what not, I am at the cusp of really cracking into the game...That Difficulty spike... hits right about where I am, and it is due to the game blocking you from getting the NEXT LEVEL of weapons, because they are for Tier 3... so I will struggle with this for another hour or so... I beat all the Dark Souls games, there is no way I am giving up on this game.I am enjoying this in 4K, and the soundtrack is very catchy, I recognize quite a few riffs from retail songs, and I might actually grab the soudtrack for this game, now that many of the songs are burned into my retinas... Not sure how music can do that, but I am pretty sure I still taste a bit of pixels...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, ANY AGE, Hardcore or casual gamers... (though you Casuals might want to choose the option where your stuff doesn't break.)"

I love side scrolling shootem up games,  I always wanted a game were you can mod/upgrade your ship, (like the Xenon megablast) but that does not end after few hours.  This game is wonderful, as you keep finding more items.  not to mention various play styles.  I have not even tried 80% of other play styles yet.   This is a game I will keep playing for a long time.  Thank you so much to the developers for making this game!"
,Not Recommended,322750,32319777,Posted: 10 June,all,Nadrik,"EDIT: As of 6/17/2017 they've rendered the game nearly unplayable for me. They added mouse steering to the game, with no option that I can see to turn it off. If you're a normal PC player like I am, you probably wanted to steer with WASD and have your main fire ability bound to Mouse1. Welp, don't move your mouse an inch, because it will automatically swap to mouse steering.I get having options, but WHY did they not add a way to disable this? I can no longer reccomend this game.ORIGINAL REVIEW:As of now I'm only about an hour into the game, but I'm blown away. This game takes me back to of plaing Gradius on the NES, but with added RPG upgrade elements and multiple ships! The art style, the flow of combat, the weapons, all of it is top notch. And the MUSIC! This may be the first game where I actually purchase the OST!Obviously being so early in the game I can't speak to end game yet, but this isn't really the type of game where that matters.My only real complaint is that the default controls for the KB+M were pretty poorly thought out, but that's changed easily through the options menu.Now you'll have to excuse me while I go kill some more hours in this game!"
