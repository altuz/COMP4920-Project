The first time I got into a straight up sword battle with a skeleton I grinned like a complete idiot. I dodged, he dodged. I'd block his blows, and he'd leap back to avoid mine. He'd land a wound and I'd yell out of frustration, and every time I landed a strike I found myself taunting this digital mesh with all I had. I wasn't twiddling controllers here, or mashing on the ""X"" button; I was fighting a skeleton with a virtual sword, and loving every second of it.The game isn't perfect, of course. It's too easy to teleport partially into a wall, and there are pacing issues evident even early on, but frankly, that doesn't matter. After defeating a skeleton archer in a bow battle, I laughed, stood up from behind my cover, and said ""If this was World of Warcraft people would never leave.""If you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to buy this title."

First level was the best VR experience I've had to date and ALMOST worth the $20 price tag.  Second level, an arena wave fighter, was a nice change of pace and a lot of fun, but I was ready for another level like the first.  Instead I was presented with a link to exit the game.  $20 is steep IMO for what equates to 1 dungeon and a minigame.  Hopefully future purchasers will see this review and at least know what they're buying."

There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.When I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic.It has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.My only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.Remember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?  Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great?  Remember when you wanted to be playing this game?  Well, lucky for you, this is that game.Buy it, support it, and get on the Dev's nerves about making it better and better.  I love this game.10/10 would snipe clipping skeleton king again."

I decided to take the plunge, as much for lack of other content as anything.This has been the single best experience I've ever had in gaming - by a wide margin. Not just VR, everything.Tips to super-enjoying this:1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you're playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.Legit criticisms:1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away.2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.3. AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment.5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.Conclusion:This is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had. This game is amazing. It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have.If you don't have a Vive. Get a Vive. Get this game. No joke."

You will never forget it as long as you live, I guarantee that. There is simply nothing like this game. It's absolutely amazing. It's an essential VR experience for everyone who has VR, and everyone who is skeptical or even just trying VR for the first time. Do not wait. Buy this immediately.20/10"

Search dungeon rooms for loot like you're really there; lean over to look inside barrels or behind statues for hidden treasure. Then use your sword and shield to parry opponents' attacks and then wait to swing while they're off guard, or dart forward to jab a vulnerable spot and leap back before they can hit you. And when I say dart forward and leap back, I don't mean with buttons on a controller.I have a decent sized playing area, so that's reflected in this review. I imagine it's still fun standing only but having enough room to dance around in sword fights was a huge plus."

My first session was about 90 minutes and the only thing that made me pause was I needed a drink.  I really didn't want to take off the Vive and get something.  So my next session I donned a camelback full of some flavored water and back in I went.  I played a couple more hours and had such a good time fighting off monsters, picking coins out of thin air, getting my magic wand and defeating chapter 1.You don't level up, you don't pick your class, break everything, pick up everything you can and keep it.  The environments are varied and well done - dwarven caves you can mine for big loot, outdoors by the ocean, into tombs and trapped passageways.  Really really well done.My only criticism right now is the lack of a clear save point, checkpoint or otherwise letting you know that you can stop here and still have your progress later.  I got reset a couple times, but still had a good time moving quickly through content I had seen before.P.S. got shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt... it stuck out of my shoulder for a minute.

You get to use bows, shields, swords, two-handed axes, and there's an awesome inventory system to store this stuff.  Chapter one was fantastic.  There was a really involved map and story that unfolded as you played, and the pacing was excellent.  It even got darker as I played (figuratively and literally), which I really liked.I was really looking forward to chapter two, however, but it was not what I expected at all.  Where chapter one was like reading a book, chapter two was quite literally ""kill these guys really fast"" with no story to it at all.  There was a small arena on the same small map, and I was teleported back to the same area for every wave.  Felt very arcadey and really broke the immersion.I hope that chapter two will be turned into a mini game or something and replaced with something as deep as chapter one.  I kinda feel like the developer decided to call it quits after chapter one and reluctantly made chapter two.  Regardless, chapter one is what makes this game."

Being a fan of RPGs, all signs pointed to Vanishing Realms as being the game of choice. Several minutes in and I wasn't disappointed. This immersive environment, while having a slightly cartoonish, Dragon's Lair-type quality, was extremely fluid and believable. While it doesn't have the same level of interactivity of games like ES:Skyrim, there is enough to keep you conscious of your environment (it's easy to set your floor on fire if you carry that torch too low!).I was extremely skeptical of the system of movement (teleporting) at first. Quickly I realized that with even a marginal play area, the mechanics worked very well. Being in the habit of smashing every container in site and wrecklessly grabbing every item in site with a mouse point or controller, the realistic action of picking up every item/coin/treasure and placing it in a ""pocket"" added a fun level of realism that made me appreciate the difficulty of being a ""hero"".Combat is simplistic, and yet precise all at the same time. There is a variety of weaponry, but I was fairly disappointed that there were no real physics or damage differences (that I was aware of) based on the weapon type (bashing hammer damage vs. slashing sword damage). I found the ability to duck and dodge while conducting archery combat to be extremely entertaining. The enemies become a little simplistic once you've gained some familiarity with the system, but the combinations present a challenge and keep things fresh.The game has an intensity to it, when entering unknown caverns and labyrinths, that is completely lost in standard PC/Console gaming. Peeking shyly around corners, uncertain as to what surprise may lurk there. The sweat of actual combat! Hacking and slashing at a horde and wondering if maybe retreat is the right decision!Overall, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms! It's a quick playthrough and I'm anxious for additional content! The possibilities are incredibly exciting and worth the investment."

Picking up fruit and eating it is as natural an action as it can get in Vanishing Realms, where in other games it would be a bizzare set of buttons and menu options. Finding a key for a door literally involves picking up a torch, poking around corners, and finding it in the world.So many things work exceptionally well, blocking arrows with your shield is amazing.

Another couple of hours in this one would not have hurt. Sword play could be improved and teleporting is a little touchy and not as good as in other games that use teleporting movement.But clashing your sword on your shield in a come get me motion is pure fun. Looking up and seeing fantasy structures and scenery is what I have dreamed off since I first played a fantasy game on a flat screen.Overall this is a must have game for the vive right now, better games in the genre will eventually come along.

,Recommended,322770,30454092,Posted: 11 March,all,Pen Pineapple Apple Pen,"I bought this game on sale thinking it was going to be some 20-30 minute rinky dinky polished VR turd experience. Nope, instead it was the exact opposite. I'm being completely honest here, this game is literally one of the best VR games I've touched on the Vive, all bullsh*t aside. The only other game I've played that actually felt like a FULL game and not a tech demo experience was Lucky's Tale on the Oculus Rift.Vanishing Realms took me almost 6 hours to beat, and while that may sound small, that's actually pretty long for a VR title. Honestly I became so immersed in the game that it felt a little bit longer than it actually is due to the sense of presence. In this game you actually FEEL like you're in another world due to the sense of presence, which is most VR titles I think, but this game actually makes you feel like you're a warrior on a quest in a virtual world, it feels legit. The graphics are a bit cartoony but honestly who gives a sh*t? Not this guy.You fight skeleton warriors, mages, bosses, etc. You can mine ore, use a magic wand, use 3 different types of swords, an axe, hammer, 2 different bows. There's traps to avoid, chalices to collect, not really any puzzles (personally I hate puzzles). The game seems super easy at first, but it starts to get quite challenging. It's not too difficult, but difficult enough that you can't just stand there like a statue swinging your vive controller like an idiot, it requires a bit of tactic and you actually feel like you're fighting a real battle. The enemy AI isn't that great and seems a bit cheap-ish, but I think fighting in this game feels really nice regardless. I used mostly sword, shield, and a bow. The enemies try to swing at you in different ways with their weapons if you fight up close, you can block the incoming attacks with your sword or shield and it feels like you're actually blocking everything, it's very responsive. The game will make you move around a bit (if you have space), and potentially make you work up a sweat lolI applaud the devs for this, you guys did a really good job. The game isn't super amazing, but it's still a really well made VR title that deserves some attention I think. This is probably the closest thing you're gonna get to an ""Elder Scrolls"", ""Legend of Zelda"" kind of experience on VR at the moment, and for 20 bucks it's not bad. I'd say wait for a sale though and grab it if you own a Vive, you won't regret it I promise. It's definitely worth the money out of all the VR turds I've seen on Steam."

It's a straightforward homage to classic dungeon-crawlers, except that you actually get to feel what it's like to crawl said dungeon. The enemies are intimidating, combat is satisfying, and the environments are great.There are a lot of rough edges, to be fair. The bow is somehow simultaneously unsatisfying and OP. The inventory could use some work. Enemies don't have a ton of variety and the big bosses are ""bullet sponges"". But I don't care. I got to fight a skeleton in a dungeon with a sword."

76561198188697017,Recommended,322770,28257190,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,cockrill,"I just finished the first chapter of Vanishing Realms and wanted to leave the developer some feedback...First, my hardware specifications are:OS:  Windows 10 ProProcessor:  i7-4790 @ 3.60GHzRAM:  16 GBGU:  Radeon RX 480VR:  HTC Vive, Game Area 2m x 1.8m (Just Under Requirement)I received my HTC Vive a few days ago and have, like many I suspect, gone into a frenzy downloading and trying out VR content.  I've had lots fun and been amazed with The Blue and delighted with Google Earth, as well as numerous other titles.  I am 100% sold on VR, and am excited to begin my own development for the Vive platform.  (I'm an old software developer by profession.)One of the titles that kept popping up online when I searched for top rated VR content was Vanishing Realms.  I was hesitant at the price at first, however, as I've discovered that there is a lot of content that, quite honestly, isn't enjoyable.  But, I'm a big ""sword & sorcery"" fan and Vanishing Realms gets lots of good reviews, so I paid my $20.00 and...  Promptly forgot all about it.A couple days later (yesterday, in fact) I was looking through my growing VR content library and saw that Vanishing Realms was in there.  I fired it up and put on the Vive headset.  That was a mistake...  I had a list of chores to do around the house and didn't get to any of them.The first thing I noticed about Vanishing Realms was how polished it was, compared to other experiences I had sampled.  The Vanishing Realms menu system was very intuitive and responsive.  I often see some frame drops when using the Vive, but noticed none while playing Vanishing Realms.  I was worried that the somewhat ""cartoon"" (versus photo-realistic) graphics would detract from the experience, but I ended up really liking the graphics.  (The ""monsters"" were realistic enough to cause me to jump back in exclamation on more than one occasion!)  I'm afraid that trying to go too photo-realistic with the graphics would result in frame loss which would ultimately detract from the virtual reality experience rather than add to it.The game's audio is great and really helped define the game's atmosphere, whether it be the sound of wind blowing, the crackle of a torch, or the clang of sword on sword.I was already somewhat familiar with the ""blink"" movement system from playing with The Lab, where it works very well.  It works equally well in Vanishing Realms, although, at times, it can make some combat ""too easy.""  An arrow coming at you?  Just blink over a bit to dodge it.  Fighting a nasty creature hand-to-hand?  Blink in, hit, and blink out.  During gameplay, to ""even the odds,"" I tried to force myself not to blink too much in combat, as it seems like cheating in some way.Speaking of movement, my play area is slightly smaller than the required 2m x 2m (I'm at 2m x 1.8m or so).  This did hamper my ability to reach certain items -- I would have to physically back up to the edge of my play area, and then blink closer to the object to be able to reach it.  This isn't the fault of the developer, however, and I am enlarging my play space which, I suspect, will solve this issue.  Also related to my smaller than required play space, sometimes, in the heat of ""battle,"" I would step out of bounds which paused the game, causing a brief ""disruption"" of the virtual reality play experience.I really like the inventory system in Vanishing Realms.  I like that it takes a moment to fumble around switching weapons in the face of an enemy -- it's much more realistic than just clicking a button on a control pad to switch from bow to sword.As mentioned previously, I paid just at $20 for the game.  After playing the first chapter I consider my $20 very well spent.  When compared to the cost of going to see a movie (which lasts only a couple of hours), the cost for Vanishing Realms appears to be a bargain.  I would be willing to pay for additional chapters and/or expansions upon my completion of the game.All in all, I don't have many complaints regarding Vanishing Realms.  Sure, I wish there was MORE (more levels, more monsters, more scenes, etc.), but, again, the game is only $20 (compared to $60 I've spent for Xbox One games).  I also wish that the game was more difficult, but I understand that it needs to be accessible to a large audience and not just hard-core ""swashbucklers"" like me.  As it is, I know that my 11-year old son will enjoy the game without getting frustrated that he is getting killed every scene.All in all, I highly recommend the game and can't wait to play the next chapter.  I will also be keeping an eye out for updates and additional titles from the developer."

Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn't quite add up no matter how good it is.With that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.Add that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it's not like it's a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn't more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more.I didn't give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.UPDATE: Rather disappointed that after 4 months, there is still not a single update to this game. I stand by my review that this had the potential to be one of the greatest VR experiences out there, but instead the developer seems to have taken our money and disappeared. Such is the risk of investing in a game in the hopes that the money will go to improving it.I also do not think it is a coincidence that every single negative review for this game is being downvoted to make them disappear from the ""most helpful reviews.""

Most of the games I played (Job Simulator, Raw Data, H3VR, The Lab, Space Pirate Trainer) don't really feel or play like finished games, more like glorified tech demos. They're really fun for a little while, but after a few hours you get bored because you can't really sink your teeth in them. You don't get lost in their world like you would with a ""proper"" video game, like The Witcher, Tomb Raider, DOOM or Dark Souls. From all the VR games I played, Vanishing Realms feels the most like a complete game. There's a story, an art style, a world to explore, and game mechanics to master.If you are looking for a ""real"" game in VR, this is the best one I played so far. However, I do have to say that it is kind of short. Even if you take your time to explore every nook and cranny, you'll be done in about 3 to 4 hours.

I have over 20 games, and a lot of the popular titles.  This is by far my favourite VR experience so far.A floating inventory system is a great idea.A fully interactive 3D environment with destructable and tossable tiems, is very well done, and hides treasure in all sorts of places forcing you to look into barrels, under tables, and smash all the things.The first sword-and-shield melee combat system I've seen that works, and the AI fights in real-time.

You gave this game some love and it shows!In simple terms; this game is fun!  It's a bit short, but I'm hoping for more content in the future.It's the little things that stand out for me in this game. They make you feel as if you are actually holding a shield and a sword (or bow and arrow, etc). It really stands out when you compare it to some others like it; yes, you can just wave your sword around, but you can also actually use it!  On the last level, I was getting really good at going around their shields (or under or over) to kill in very few strokes.  The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!  LOL, AND they move faithfully when you do, persisting long enough to be disconcerting!I have now been spoiled; games that don't allow me to clash my sword on my shield really suck!The maps were also imaginative and fun, keeping you thinking and on your toes!I LOVED the inventory management in this one!  I had a bit of a problem with losing items in between saves, but nothing that mattered (which is probably why they disappeared).  Seriously, the inventory system is worth experiencing all by itself!I definitely recommend this one and hope for more!"

Using the sword to parry strikes feels even more awesome.As soon as you get used to the sword and shield, you are given a bow, and it is equally fun learning to use.

Tracking is excellent, I have not had any of the issues others have reported.

It is the little things that make it so immersive, the fact that hitting a skeleton on his Helmut, or shield does little to no damage, the fact you can parry, they way you can burn straw, or a curtain, the way small things are hidden.

(I couldn't figure out how to drop something unless I put it in my inventory, so every time I would want my pick axe or torch I had to keep going through cheese and a bunch of apples I picked up to look at)However, the core of this game is really fun and I really like the art style, world design, and lore that has started to be developed.  I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more.If people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.The auto pause was a little annoying at first.  Now, after playing some other VR games, I really like it.  It would be very hard to be in the middle of a fight and have to worry being up against the edge of your play space.

They were building something that we all desperatly wanted.  They were the first in an emerging technology and art form.   As expected the games were limited by the tech, rough around the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  There needed a forgiving partnership that filled the hours with enjoyment.  I the consumer would contribute to the game as I played.  I would flesh out their stories, fill in the gaps and use my imagination to create things that were not there to imerse myself in the world they created.As I play Vanishing Realm I feel like this partnership is a chief requirement to my experience.  Vanishing Realm is once again the realization of a child of the 80s dream.  Like I was so many years ago I find myself needing to fill in the gaps and flesh out the world to make it work.Vanishing It is obviously a small project, in an emerging technology, by an indie developer.  As expected it is short in content, rough on the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  If I left it there my sleep-deprived-UltimaIV younger self would die a painful death.  With the short comings aside this game is absolutly a thrill that I have been waiting for years to play.  It is everything I hoped a VR RPG could be, and sets the stage for so much more to come.  This game plucks the heart strings of my 80s inner child.  It is that dream of D&D on the computer and playing in a fantasy world turned into being inside the RPG game.When I play vanishing realm I see the past, the present and the future at the same time and it is a glorious experience.

Just leave it as it is. Maby make it more real and harder still. But if not, its fine as it is!Gameplay and movement: I enjoy the heck out of it! I don´t mind the teleportation too much, even though it always sucks, your teleportation is the least suckiest at the moment.

Amazing!Graphics are crisp and well-defined.The game itself has some puzzle elements, but nothing too complicated.  (E.G. Figure out how to get to a treasure, Find a key, figure out a riddle, etc)Skill-based fighting- Melee: If your opponent swings high, you block or parry directly on their blade or duck.  Try to counter when you can see something open or just wait for the opportune time- Ranged:  Using a bow and arrow feels really natural, there's no hiccups trying to grab the bow or nock an arrow, it's simply draw, aim and loose.  Having a ranged battle involves doing some ducking and moving or using short teleports between cover.- Magic:  Not really implemented (at the time of this review) beyond a wand you'll have to buy during your travels.  It operates much the same as a fired explosive following an arced trajectory.Great ambiance and fitting mood for the area you're in.The ending really made you feel like you accomplished something.  Granted, right now there is only one chapter to the game (rite of steel), but it's a pretty long one!Switching between weapons was a bit cumbersome at times since you have to look down at your belt while you fumble for your weapon.  In a few situations where you're surprised, that's nearly a death sentence.Combat difficulty scaled as you play through the chapter.  Their moves became more complicated and faster with less hints at which way they would swing.  Overall it was still fairly easy if you have a shield.  Multiple enemies without a shield is pretty much a death sentence.This is the type of game we dreamed about as kids.  I hope the next chapter is as exciting and fun!"

There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.The combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.The cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.But the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.The AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.The foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.I found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.I found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.The art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.The puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.It is good that the developer added some measures against cheesing the game, like abusing your available space to access areas you should not be able to otherwise.All in all, I would really recommend this game, it is worth a try even if you don't happen to like RPGs."

The motion controls fail every now and then, resulting in your sword just whiffing through an enemy, but the rest of the time when they do work it's loads of fun parrying attacks and deflecting arrows by doing more than just the waggling we've long associated ""motion control sword fighting"" with. It's not perfect - the bow and arrow, while functional, isn't really as fun to use as the ones in The Lab or Spellfighter because the arrow is automatically straighened instead of angling as you move your hand, and the inventory belt can be hard to use to grab a potion in the middle of a fight because it seems to rotate based on where you're positioned, but Vanishing Realms is still a lot of fun and one of my favorite VR games."

I will add:  Blocking enemy swords with your own sword or shield feels pretty damn good, and blocking arrows with your shield is even better.  However, having an enemy block you (and your hand + sword continuing through your swing unimpeded IRL) creates a disconnect between the VR world and the real.  It simply does *not* feel good.  I can really see how some people would like this game, but the fact is, if it wasn't in VR, it wouldn't be that great of a game, and VR doesn't add as much to it as it does to other games.

The backstory to this particular chapter involves some lost realm in dire need of exploring and an undead king that’s become a nuisance of some sort. Oh, and lots of skeletons.Initially the game presents itself as a bit of a puzzle-solver but after some exploring and coin collecting you eventually get your first weapon and are plunged into combat. The sword swinging mechanic requires that you make short quick movements with your wrist or arm for the game to register it as an attack. The angle of attack matters as well since most enemies will parry or block your attacks if you swing into their defenses rather than waiting for an opening to strike. That isn’t to say that silly tactics like dual wielding swords and swinging wildly aren’t still feasible, but you will also take a lot of damage in the exchange.Be forewarned that this particular VR title has a history of performance issues, many of which I resolved simply by disabling running processes (windows update is a big culprit) to get CPU usage down to under 20% and also setting the CPU priority of the program to high in the task manager. You will likely still see some significant FPS drops in certain areas but it will be way more manageable. Obviously having a cutting-edge rig (e.g. anything with components better than my older i5 and gtx 980) will also mitigate these issues and you can always check the community discussions if you are unsure.Anyways, I’m glad to have stuck with this game after initially trying to refund it (for the aforementioned issues). It’s pretty fun and yet another good game for showing off what the vive can do since it features melee and ranged combat along with exploration and puzzle solving all in a very nicely detailed environment. I recommend it, but just make sure your system is up to spec first!"

I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it's that good. It's definitely my favorite Vive game I've played so far.What I loved:- Great sense of immersion- Great style- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controllerThings that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:- CombatI didn't dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn't quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.I was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I'm not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there's a chance to even that playing field a tad.- User interfaceIt would be great if there's an option to choose a left-handed inventory ""belt"" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I'm a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the ""belt"" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.- Multiple item ""belt"" user interfaceIf a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they've activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you've activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)All of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive.

I have feeling that it would be great in this game (it requires to optimize timing slightly in several traps and may be add jump animation in several places and that's all. It's not a problem to even have different timings for different types of locomotions in single player game if necessary).

In real life you can dodge arrows, spells, or the swing of an enemy sword. Use your shield or just step to the side in real life within your play area.

76561198083101918,Recommended,322770,23123117,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,jasonbazar,"10/10 The best gaming experience I have ever had, on any platform. Ever.Let me start by saying, this is an early access game, which should make what I will say all the more impactful. Also, to set the context, I am in my mid 40's and remember playing Pong, getting an Atari 2600 in 1977 (coinciding with Star Wars, what a great year), owning Intellivision 1 and 2, Colecovision, NES, IBM PC jr, Commodore 64, XBOXes, PS's, you name it. I like games. I am an avid board gamer, I have designed games and was my groups Dungeon Master in D&D going back to 1980. In terms of VR, I backed DK1, bought a DK2, and own an Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. I've played every TES game, All of the Ultimas (started with Ultima 2 when it came out.)This is some next nevel♥♥♥♥♥♥...and by that I mean thanks to VR.  skipping some levels that should have somehow been in there in between. All credit to Palmer Lucky and other innovaters for what we are now able to experience.Now, some things to get out of the way about this game right now. Be warned, that unless you are someone who enjoys early access to games, this is not for you. I feel this warning should be READ before people buy these titles. It's right there in blue, but people seem to ignore it.The game is too short at this time. The game does not have realistic monsters, or AAA title graphics. You MUST make sure to set up your Vive perfectly to get the most out of this, and by that I mean make sure your play area is well defined with a good amount of room. Mine is 2m x 2m and my gut tells me that is minimum to REALLY enjoy this game once you start swinging around your weapon. Make sure your hardware supports smooth frame rates with the Vive.Once all of the finicky parts are set, you can launch into the game. I will say this again, but I don't like the look of the monsters- but I believe most younger gamers will prefer it. I like more ""serious"" looking monsters, just a preference. While you are walking around in the world and interacting with it, this won't matter at all. In the heat of combat, I found it almost startling how something that looks pretty standard on the monitor, can be intimidating once you are fitted into it's scaled den. I love the inventory system, where you only need to look down at your belt and pouches and grab what you need. Eat food to improve health, grab a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, or a staff, or a bow. The immersion factor is top notch. The weapons feel great. Ducking and side stepping ranged attacks feels phenomenal.I will give you one example in the game to show you why this is the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.Deep in the heart of a battle with 3 orcs and 2 floating magic users hurling magic fireballs at me, I hurried to a cluster of rocks. I crouched behind the rocks and watched as fireballs just missed me and singed the side of the rocks I was leaning against. I decided to try to pick off the high floating magic users first. I noted that each time I would attack the orcs, these damned MU's would heal them. I grabbed my trusty bow. I waited until a blast hurled past me. I leaned out just enough to see the enemies and focused on the one closest to me. I slowly drew back my arrow, and tried to aim just above the MU, keeping steady. I released the arrow and made a hit. I continued to pound him and when I got him low in HP, he began to heal himself. I knew I had to increase the rate of my hits. I found a better spot to attack him. A barrage of hits met their mark, and I took the first MU down. I used this tactic to take out the other MU, and had to sidestep his balls of fire while making my way to a tree that was good cover, but closer in range to him. Once I dispatched him, I put away my bow and healed up a bit as quickly as I could. I then drew my sword in my right hand, and my shield in the left. I rushed the orcs, and in a fit of slashes I dealt damage to them. I would use the shield to try to block attacks from one, while stabbing and slashing the others. I finally killed them all and took their treasure. I then made my way into a cave opening I spotted, stopping only to catch my breath.Cons-Short gameplay (at this point in early access)Very small number of enemiesCombat can be a little easy (would be great if difficult levels could be added, increasing number, strength, and type of monsters)Graphics -Not even so much the level of graphics, I prefer a more serious ""look"" to the monsters, similar to TES or old school D&D. However, I really don't care that much that it should detract from my rating. The environments look great.Pros-Immersive beyond anything else I have ever donePace is goodJust enough story to keep things moving (some more voice acting could be added but not a negative at all)Inventory systemWeapons, while low in variety, feel greatAtmosphere, good visuals for VR and ambient soundSummary - Even at this early stage, the greatest gaming experience I have ever had in terms of immersion and feeling as though I was IN a dungeon or ON a mountain etc. Once complete, with added length, variety and difficulty scaling, it will likely be the best entertainment experience (for me) in almost 40 years when I got into Star Wars."

By the time you've gone there, paid for your seat and drinks/food, and sat for a couple of hours, this is no more expensive. The best bit is, YOU are playing the hero, not someone on a screen.

And that's the first and only negative aspect I see for this game: The overall play time you'll get for paying 20€. The first playthrough (Nearly non-stop, I just had to sleep and eat something on occasion..) provided me with nearly 4 hours of fun. A few euros less and you'll get a very polished and well made game for your bucks. Since I got this game during Steam's Winter Sale it cost me 14€ which looks like a reasonal price to me. But this is nitpicking. Paying more than that just helps the developer to provide us with a third chapter.And this what I'm looking for. The third chapter. Or put simply, again, MOOAR content!- I want to smash bigger and more challenging creatures (Though, I have yet to play this game on ""Hard"" and fighting against multiple opponents IS already challenging!).- I want more stories which evolve the same way as the one from the first chapter. (And please, again using rimes which match the atmosphere so well!)- I want more (bigger?) items to throw around, maybe even ones you can utilize in combat. (Throwing a bottle at the enemy and then set him on fire using a torch...)- I want more magic. One wand is not enough. (Though there's magic, after all!)For those who still hesitate:- You really need the required play space. I played the game on a 3.2mx1.7m space and if I had not only a couch which limits me to 1.7m but a solid wall I guess I already had to buy a new motion controller after the first fight. If not after the first 1 vs 1, then definitely after the first 1 vs 2 engagement.- The graphics are not what you'll see in the usual games today. It's rather a more modern Spyro or any similar jump'n'run from the past, graphic wise. But it's not the graphics what makes truly great games great! And that's even more the fact for this game.- The teleportation system works very well. It's not like in other games or ""demos"" and limits you how far you can teleport in a nice way. I can't properly describe it, but it just works and does not feel that different than using your own feet. And since the required play space is already fairly big, you'll have enough chances to use your own feet nonetheless.- It's VR. Put simply. ;-)I can't await chapter three, four, five, ......"

It is not perfect but it still a great game to have on VR. I'm excited to see what is in store for the rest of the game. There are pointless parts of the game. In the game, you get three swords. The problem with that? You get the second one at the same time as the third unless you backtrack. There is no reason to use the second one. There is a second shield but I could not tell you why it is better than the first.I would suggest you have a massive play area to use this. I have 2.5m x 2.5m space and this is too small, way too small. I recommend 3m x 3m or larger. Also, you will be moving around quite a bit when using this game. Make sure your headphones are on secure.As far as suggested features, co-op multiplayer would make it amazing. A training mode would be awesome or just a mode to mess around with all of the weapons. Overall, I would give this a 4/5. The game works fairly well. I haven't seen any bugs but it does feel like an early access. If you want an awesome VR game, I suggest you pick this up.

I had one crash throughout the entire game, which is better than for a lot of finished games.I thought that the point and click movement system would bug me but it didn't and lends itself to the game very well.  The combat felt polished and was enjoyable.  It feels a bit weird to have a huge sword that doesn't weigh anything but you quickly forget thtat once you are hacking, slashing, and parrying with the monsters in the world.The monsters are a bit limited, there are only six or seven of them but it really doesn't matter.  The sword and shield fighting is fun and well realised and the bow and arrow action is excellent.  My only problem was not being able to hit a skeleton thing on top of a pedestal because, as it turns out, the light shade was in the way, but that's just a VR thing.The only crash I had was that I suddenly dropped through the floor and couldn't find any way back.  It happened once and that was it.  Everything else was completely solid.The game is a little more cartoonish than the advertising graphic might indicate but, again, that didn't really detract from it.I am really, really hoping that the reason this is early access is so that further chapters can be added to it.Pros:- Very immersive- Fun sword play where you have to wait for your opponent's vulnerable areas to be exposed and aim for them before you can do damage.- Brilliant bow and arrow action - you have to hold the bow in one hand and draw it with the other.  The arrows fly in an arc requiring you to take that into account for long shots.- Very smooth gameplay- Very few bugs or glitches- Intuitive movement system- Very polished product - I didn't even spot any typos in the scrollsCons- A bit on the short side - what you see as my play time above is how long it took me to finish it but it was an enjoyable 2.9 hours.- Quickly switching between weapons is a bit fiddly ... actually, I'm not even sure if this is a con as it adds to the realism a bit.I would definitely recommend this game.

Also, was the ""flash"" (fade) effect when teleporting intentional? It caused me zero issues, but was wondering if there were other ways... was ""zooming over"" reported to give people issues?"

Also, when the fight is taking you off your gameplay limits, the game automatically pauses, shows you where to walk to come back in the middle of your gameplay area, and then resumes. This is a fantastic idea I have not seen anywhere else.3) Gameplay : great. I dont understand how such a young game style can be so appealing ...

,Recommended,322770,23664858,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,{DNJ} YourCurtainsAreUgly,"A great game that shows where VR could be going. I would recommend it to anyone interested in complex (if ""gamey"" rather than simulationist) combat, dungeon delving, and some light puzzle solving.I completed the game in just over an hour and a half, which makes it on the shorter side for a game of this price. However, that would be comparing it to games played on a screen, vs. the experience you get here in VR. And boy does it pay off. Performing each swing and block, aiming every shot, and grabbing every lever is quite different from just pressing buttons to ""use"", ""attack"", ""block"", etc. The exchange of blows and blocks felt good, if a little easy (feeling generously telegraphed) by the end. I felt the pressure of being flanked in combat, and the instant fear of arrows coming from an unknown source (which you are able to quickly track down by sound, naturally). Still, I'm itching to see more.I do like a lot of the mechanics introduced for the VR medium. If you stick your head into something, your vision blurs, or you're pushed back into an open space. Nice. The teleportation movement system works well enough, though I must say I quite enjoyed the more natural movement used in Spell Fighter once I got over the initial disorientation.The only major complaint I would have is that the game seems to be designed for someone much shorter (I'm 6'4""/193cm and tend to tower over other Hover Junkers players). There are many low ceilings (namely in the arena) and the space feels constrained, even though I have a generous space and stayed away from the Chaperone walls. The game automatically pauses if you try to push too far outside of reach, which became an annoyance at certain points in grabbing objects or attacking some enemies, given my long reach. Default combat distance seems to be incredibly close, and enemies tend to engage me right in my face, far within the reach of my sword, not the kind of distance I like to be at while fencing! Engaging the archers in melee was also annoying as they appeared to only come up to my knees and I had to golf swing to take them out; helmets blocked any reasonable swing I would normally take. Certainly I wouldn't say to skip the game if you are tall, but it's one thing to expect, and hopefully will be changed with future development."

I'd be great to see a visual list and choose exactly what I want- Combat feedback consistency. I share the comments of someone else. It was hard to know sometimes if I was engaging in combat effectively. Hits that would register once would then be blocked. Or blocks that worked once would fail.- It's easy to move around a lot during a battle, and its a little to easy to get out of the games tracking focus. Would be great if it could be a little more forgiving with room scale movementOther than that, I think this game sells the Vive better than anything out there currently. It is a gamer's game.

Everything feels so right and behaves like you would expect.

I would set them farther apart, but the Oculus softare complains about them needing to be 3-6 feet apart when I try that.

Yes other things are great  Audio shield, Elite, Space pirate trainer, holopoint to name just a few amasing games. However this seems to be a fully fledged VR game.

Not saying they are terrible but simple still give you a huge sense of being there and I suppose thats exactly what they need to acheive. It's really exciting when you face the first enemy and have a sword battle then later to use you bow against distant enemies hiding and moving to aviod their return fire hearing the swoosh of the arrow as it narrowly misses. If you have a VR headset go buy it ! I have oculus with touch and it works perfectly.

I bought the Vive and tried out games like Space Pirate Trainer and Audioshield and was very impressed. Then I bought Vanishing Realms and was completely blown away.It really does remind me of my early days of dungeon crawling in Elder Scrolls: Arena. I take it back that far because I know this is the beginning of VR gaming and Arena introduced me to dungeon crawling / RPGs along with Betrayal at Krondor and the like.Vanishing Realms is an awesome, colorful, immersive and totally amazing game and I really hope we continue to see more out of not only this game, but others like it that build on this style of VR play. I know Oculus Touch is coming, but being able to experience this game in room-scale VR on the Vive confirmed my choice of headset so much so that I canceled my Rift order."

,Recommended,322770,22913611,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,<ISM>TitoYang,"This is the first ever review I have written for a game on Steam.  I was motivated to write it because, out of all the VR games I own, this has been the most fun and awe-inspiring experience on the HTC Vive to date.  It's basically a Zelda-like game where you are actually inside the dungeon.  I own many other VR games and in my opinion this is way better than Job Simulator and the Lab, which feel more like VR tech demos.  Vanishing Realms is a very short game.  I was able to complete the available content in a little less than 3 hours or so.  It does have a lot of interesting mechanics and once you get used to the movement and combat, it is one of those games that make you salivate about what the future of VR has in store.  I am not going to describe the game itself, as you can get that from the Store page.  I will describe the experience though.The initial chapter of the game sees your character locked inside a dungeon that you must try to escape by finding keys, following hints in riddles or defeating various types of enemies.  It is very immersive, and you really feel as if you are inside this world, to the point that I often found myself swinging my ""sword"" outside the playable area and bashing my furniture (make sure you have enough room to play as the game suggests a larger playing area than most other games).  Fighting multiple enemies is fun and sometimes challenging, as enemies will change their attack patterns after a bit and dodge your arrows and magic attacks.  The weapons right now are limited to three different swords and a hammer for melee, two different bows and a fire magic wand for ranged attacks.  Enemies vary based on their abilities and you will find yourself fighting skeleton warriors, archers, mages (as well as healers) and a few bigger baddies and bosses.  Once you complete the initial dungeon, you are teleported to an arena-style area where you have to defeat all the enemies within a time limit in order to complete the game.  The game has various checkpoints whereby you can save your progress by walking over them.I own several other VR games such as Holopoint, VR Minilands Golf, Job Sim, the Lab, The Blue, etc (just check my game list).  Vanishing Realms doesn't have a high replayability index, but is a way better experience for the price than many other VR games available now.  The only downsides to this game are its brevity, the lack of guidance at certain points (although it's not that hard to figure out) and the semi-ambiguous ending, although it does seem like the developer is working on more content.  I have to say that at this point, this is the only VR game I own that I have been motivated to play all the way through.Again, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who owns the Vive and wants to get a good idea of what VR can potentially offer in a gaming experience.  I really felt like I was inside this world and I would be completely immersed in the fights and the game mechanics.  Some things could still use a bit of polish but I definitely think this is an experiencee worth checking out if you are into VR."

This is by far the best VR experience I have had sofar. The sense of scale is impressive and the interaction with the environment is great. Everything feels intuitive, you pick up an object and put it in your belt. You look at your belt and pick up what's there. You parry a blow and reposte while the enemy is staggered or go for a quick thrust after a block with your shield, it all makes sense and works.As far as improvements, I would like to see a little more depth to the combat (the animations are brilliant and really highlight how the enemy will attack however after you've gone through a few it is quite easy. Also if you get in close to the bosses they struggle to hit you with some attacks (even without needing to block or parry).For the price, I'd say if you like the fantasy genre and want to experience VR the way it's meant to be, grab it.

And now I've been waiting 9+ days for HTC to arrange a courier to come and pick up the faulty item.

Thought teleporting is ok for some, I personally can handle moving my car using the thumbsticks and don't get motion sickness.  Let us move normally would be a huge benefit to this game for me and I'd love it even more.- Ability to turn on the spot without physically turning around - partly with the above movement, but often I find I'm facing all sorts of directions in some areas and I end up losing tracking (only 2 sensors but getting 3rd soon).

This feels more like a showpiece of what's possible, more than a full game, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.While playing this I often ran into situations where I thought ""Wow, it would be cool if this was an MMO"". While mining I thought ""Wow, profession systems translate really well to VR"". While switching from the bow, to the sword and board, to dual wielding swords, to the magic system, I realized there's a very real possibility of a class system here. Each style of combat was fun enough on it's own and could be expanded upon.That brings me to my only negative about this game. There isn't enough of this game. GIVE ME MORE. I know the install base for VR isn't large enough yet to invest the resources that it would take to build up a large MMO universe, but Vanishing Realms gives you just a taste of what's possible and I'm hungry for more. It's only a matter of time and I look forward to the next chapters. That being said the game progresses very fast and I was able to complete it in under 2 hours.

The enemy designs are all really cool too. Threatening in a cartooish way that doesn't come off as silly.What this game nails though is the overall mood and feel of each area.

It's a really REALLY good VR experience.If you're a Vive owner, you'll be doing yourself a favour with this game."

Just do what you want. Grab the sword, block the attacks. Take the torch and reach to the candles on the wall to light them. Look under the table or bend over to look inside the chest and grab the coins and treasures.Parrying and hitting with the sword is satisfying, although the incoming attacks of the enemies are very predictable after some time. The levels are very nice and i like the inventory system.In future i would like to have a more grown up theme/design for this kind of games and interesting dialogs.

,Recommended,322770,23174246,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,FuzzieChikun,"I love this game. This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping for when it was announced a few years ago that VR was coming to the mass market. It isn't perfect, but it does a number of things very well.First, the cons.What I didn't see in the description of the game is that it ""highly recommends"" a 2.0 x 2.0 meter space. I live in a small apartment, and my play space is only 2.0x1.6 meter. I can still play the game, but I have to be very careful because any time I stick my sword arm through the ""wall"" (my restricted space is couches, so I can reach well above them, I just can't walk into them) the game pauses, forces me to re-center in the space, and then unpause. Slightly annoying, but better than constantly walking into things.However, within about 30 minutes I learned how to not over-extend, but as a 6'0"" guy who has done steel sabre fencing and sword & board fighting in the SCA, it was hard to not try to execute lunges and molinets (wrist turns to get around an opponent's shield and hit them in the face) in that ""forbidden zone"". Treating it more like a video game and less like a fighting simulation did the trick.The story is a little on the flimsy side. Don't expect anything too deep, you pretty much can get the gist of it from watching the intro video on the Steam page. It's not horrible or bad, it's just basic fantasy tropes.The pros:The graphics are beautiful. To me, titles like this prove that we don't need photo-realism to be immersive in VR, especially when the game runs smoothly.Fighting monsters that are taller than I am is a lot of fun. I've always been a fan of games where projectiles persist in the environment, and fighting with an arrow sticking out of your shoulder is surprisingly satisfying. I mentioned the sword and shield mechanic struggles I had above, but it's still a lot of fun to use that weapon combo. The bow and arrow mechanics work fantastically and are a lot of fun, and you can't beat the destructive power of the magic wand.Objects are easy to interact with and add a lot to the feel. The inventory system is pretty top-notch and intuitive: in need of a little health? Grab that apple out of the pocket you stuck it in and ""eat"" it by holding it up to your mouth. Did you find a key? Go find the lock that it goes to.Most of the text is super easy to read. Sometimes I struggle to see the health/mana meters because you have to look at your feet to see them, but the fact that they're out of the way when you're fighting is nice, and you can usually tell by the amount of blood you're looking through how your health is doing. :)Overall, highly recommended. Don't let the minor flaws get in the way of a good time. If you're the type of person that enjoys adventure RPGs like Legend of Zelda or Fable, you'll probably love Vanishing Realms."

There are only so many wave shooters you can play before you need a taste of something sweeter. Vanishing Realms is the cake, with the cherry on top.I love the enviroments and spent an age just gazing up at the sky or celling. The game experience may be short but I had a blast from the opening screen right to the end. It's the little touches that I loved. That gold cup stood high up on a plinth. Grab a rock, knock the bugger down. Trophy trapped on a wall in a web, burn it free. I felt involved. In an early part of the game I was laying on the floor crawling past some axe's, much to my wife's amusement. The wand feels great to use, blocking attacks with your sword or shield is cool, but the bow and arrow for me is the stand out weapon in the game. It just felt right.Sure it's not perfect. Combat feels a little simple. Definitely helps to have a large play area. Mine is fairly large at 2m x 4m and the 2m can cause movement issues. You will find yourself teleporting often just to get where you need to be, but please don't let that put you off. I have played in a 2m x 2m area before I relocated the vive and it still plays fine.To sum up. Buy this game. If you don't enjoy the genre then walk around the area's and look about.

If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.Pros++++++-Immersive gameplay- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!- Some fun trap elements- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)- Some fun mini-boss and boss battlesCons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)- Not much else when it comes to cons.Personal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)Well all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games. Or in other words, if you liked Zelda, you will like this game. It is only a few hours of content, but this is a game I want to support. I cannot wait for the full release of this game!"

Exploring was nice, and once you achieve some of the objectives it gives a nice and satisfying feeling.Also make sure to respect and know your chaperone bounds, especially early on in the game when you're not used to the combat yet. Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D. I didn't have any accidents, but there were a few close calls where I nearly punched a chaperone wall.I'd like to see some more refinement on the combat, though. It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.Oh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese. Speaking of archery, right now aiming is done purely with the bow hand. I'd love to see a combination of both bow hand and arrow hand, so it's more difficult to hit near the same spot over and over.I'd love to see more content!

Overall, I loved the experience, and just nitpick a bit here.Pros:-Combat feels awesome, especially when you have multiple enemies engaging you at once- World looks good, and the atmoshere is nice-Teleporting mechanic doesn't take you out of the immersion (unless you blink around like a dingus)- Stats and user interface are easy to understand- Puzzles and clues are neither too challenging, nor too simple- Hidden items/easter eggs are fun to look for here- Distinctly different weapons for various situations-Some enemy varietyCons:- Switching to the bow can be difficult at times- The wand weapon that you get is simply too powerful. It makes clearing the final boss incredibly easy if you have maxed out your mana.- Enemies do not pursue the player aggressively enough- Combat doesn't scale up fast enough (by about 30 minutes in you should be able to kill everything with little issue, unless you are swarmed). Enemies need to attack faster.- Enemies are fairly similar in regards to combat behavior. Would like to see more behaviors, or something simple like some skeleton warriors having their sword+shield hands switched.- The final boss lost some of his wow and scare factor after figuring our this pattern. Needs some more attack patterns to make him more challenging.- The sequence of trials after the main quest is kind of fun... but overall not challenging enough at that point or as engaging as the rest of the game.- It takes a good amount of time for you to face your first enemy... like longer than you need it to be. It makes it sometimes hard to show it to friends, as they can't drop right into the action.Bottom line, it is not perfect, but it is quite good. Please purchase this and have a fun VR experience!"

Maybe it's because I'm only a few hours into my VR journey and the novelty has not worn off yet, but this game kinda blew my mind. It's a bit simplistic... this is true... but this experience has changed the way I feel about gaming forever.  Like I said... this is one of my very first VR experiences, so perhaps if I wrote this in the future after spending a couple hundred hours in VR experiences, I'd not write so enthusiastically about this... but for now, I love this game.I'll try to be objective though to hopefully help someone make a decison about whether or not to buy this.   The setting is kinda cartoony and the enemies look a little Zelda-ish, but when engaged in a sword fight with enemies slightly larger then me, the innocence of their looks temporarily fades away and they feel a bit more menacing.  And that cartoony setting has a real sense of scale and of being a real place.   From the slight vertigo I feel looking over an edge to the floor below me, to feeling moon beams soaking into my skin... It all comes together quite nicely.The only criticisms I have are that melee combat is a little easy and repetetive.  Block, strike, block strike... it's hard to mess up. Regardless, it's still fun.   And there are other combat options such as a ranged bow which are fun to use.Another minor gripe is that enemies seems to just stand around and wait for you to approach.  Would be much cooler if they were a bit more aggressive and plentiful.  But then again, for a VR noob like me, maybe it would be a little too fast paced.My biggest overall complaint is that I want more.But, none of these things stopped me from having one of the best times in recent memory.  I can't wait to see more games of this type!  Bravo! Well done!So, if you are new to VR like I am and the VR experience is still fresh, I think it's worth the money to try this one. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"

You will be immersed as never before, as you are using your whole body to fight enemies right in front of you.

,Not Recommended,322770,25629941,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,HAMSTER_FISTER,"I do not recommend this game in a vaccum. Read on before marking as ""not helpful"" - it's not Reddit, this is a thought-out user review, not an epic troll on an internet forum.TL;DR - The game is actually somewhat polished, which automatically puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the SteamVR lineup. However, a slew of disappointing design flaws and the cheese-ability of the combat system do little to justify the pricetag when the game is as short as it is. If you're not too picky and willing to play along, go for it.Pros & cons:Pros-quality artstyle, decent enough ambiance to create significant immersion-the linear levels work without feeling railroady-sound effects and ""game feel"" work in VR, picking up coins and striking enemies doesn't feel like a chore-VR allows exploration to feel more like exploration, and less like a slog-A few nice and simple environmental puzzles keep the game from being a complete wagglefest.Cons-Combat is incredibly easy to cheese. Waggling your sword at an enemy's head essentially guarantees victory. Add in a few quick teleports from place to place on bosses, and you've got a low-effort strategy that can wreck anything without actually playing along.-No artificial locomotion options. Unless it was some hidden options menu I missed, there was no way of giving the player any option other than teleportation. While TP is a nice default for comfort's sake, there are people who would like to use it, especially in the early days of roomscale VR software.-It's short as all hell.-It's insultingly easy, even if you play along and don't cheese fights. The telegraphs are massive, and the shield blocks EVERYTHING with no penalties.-Melee enemies pretend you don't exist until you're already in striking distance. I was expecting to be ganged up on numerous times by the enemy configurations, and never was unless I explicitly tried to. Even when I was firing the bow+arrow at their friends, they never did anything but look confusedly in my direction sometimes.-Exploration yields little, save for a few coins.ALL THIS BEING SAID, Vanishing Realms is still one of the best VR games I've played. For most, the novelty of VR outweighs the subpar nature of the game itself. And that's fine, but I still wouldn't recommend this game on its own."

After I played the two available chapters in Vanishing Realms, it became my favorite VR experience so far. The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great.What I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved.As for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.If you own a Vive, you need to play this first-person, Zelda style game.5/5"

Think Zelda in style, going around collecting gems and loot with a flame torch in one hand and a sword in the otherThe teleport system that is being used with VR seems solid... but with games like this, that looks so convincing in VR, I just want to walk and walk and walk. It would be cool to see some kind of game design that employs Unseen Diplomacy’s technique of room control. Anyway, that is more a criticism of how unbelievably convincing VR is, and how much of a shame it is when you see the Chaperone Boundaries come up.If you are new to the Vive, buy this now. Best game I have played on it yet, and actually feels like a game rather than a tech demo.EDIT:Chapter 2 is dreadful... it really left a sour taste in my mouth to the entire experience. Gone is the wonderful RPG exploration with puzzles, in is a battle area with time limit. It feels like the poorest excuse of level padding and it really wasn't fun.

I really want to see the dev change this, otherwise this review will turn to negative once the game leaves EA.EDIT 2 (in ProgressThe update has made the combat much much harder and much more fun. Unfortuatly you can beat the game by crouching (the AI can't cope with it). Vast improvement in smashable objects and little puzzles (such as throwing rocks to knock down goblets etc).

I understand that teleporting is supposed to reduce motion sickness and discomfort at the cost of immersion, but in this game I don't think teleportation is helping.  While traversing and fighting monsters in this game you will want to  take many small teleports rapidly in sucession.  This ends up resembling a slideshow.  I find this to be very disorienting and motion sickness inducing.  A more traditional smooth movement would be much much preferable to me.My second problem is that I was not a fan of the design and art in the game.  I expected it to feel more atmospheric and epic in scale.  Instead it felt like a retro adventure game that I somehow became trapped in.  Typical lever pulling puzzles, linear map design, and very uninspired environments.That said, the game is quite functional and has some cool stuff to offer.  I'm sure some people will enjoy it far more than I did.

The swordplay is weird because the best strategy is to teleport as close as you can and wiggle your sword. The monsters instantly back away when they're low health after you've parried their attack and go to stab them for messing up. That is super dumb and doesn't drive me to actually hit them, it drives me to just want the fight to be over because the AI can just back up out of range instantly.The physics on objects are weird.

You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn’t without issue however.The current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn’t change where you are and aren’t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don’t want five apples on me when I’m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren’t used for anything currently, there’s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don’t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.Combat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by “Skyward Sword-ing” your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies’ hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I’ve seen, the average player doesn’t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I’d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn’t feel good to use, it shoots it’s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn’t have much sensation on use.The AI isn’t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster’s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.Since the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with."

About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy ♥♥♥♥...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy ♥♥♥♥, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.  I don't have negatives.I do wish they have a saving system though,  I don't how you save the game?  You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.Another thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.

I completed all the content available in about 100 minutes and by the end of it I would say that yes I had a good time. If you are desperate to play something on your new VR headset you can do worse than this game but be warned this title has more in common with an amusement park ride than an epic RPG.

It's a simple romp with some cool looking baddies that actually freak you out the first couple times they get close. The combat it pretty fun too. I was swining away looking for soft spots to hit as they tried to parry my swings. It was fun. I loved the world.The only thing that troubles me is that there hasn't been any updates since April. For $21 this game is definitely too short. I did see some chatter from the dev a couple weeks ago so maybe it's just taking more time to polish up the rest of the content. I am not a developer so I have no clue how long things actually take. Probably even longer than a handful of months...

If you like what you see on the store page, then you'll like what you play in game.A few picky little ways to improve this game would be to have the melee skeleys attack a liiiiiiiittle faster. Admittedly, I two'd in my pants a lil bit at the first skeleton, but when I had the time to actually go drop a two in the bathroom before getting slashed, the intimidation wore off.Also, here's some even stingier pickiness - it would be awesome for the weapons that you hold to interact with all the environment and not just phase through it. Having my weapons simply go through walls and the likes makes the game feel less realistic than it could be. A fantastic example of what prime enviornment X held item physics should look like in this game could be seen in Modbox.This game definitely is a step in the right direction. There aren't any other Vive games out there that feel like they will become a classic quite as much as this one does.

It really reminds me of the 80s & 90s TV kids game show Knightmare where a team of friends guided a 4th mate through a quest and lots of fun challenges in a computer generated world.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KnightmareThere is a lot of immersion due to the cool scenery and sound effects being good. I can only imagine in 5 years time the way VR is going we're going to have more games like this featuring multiplayer, playable classes and much bigger worlds.Vanishing Realms is essentially a dungeon crawl hack and slash game with combat, looting and puzzles. You explore a vast dungeon/castle solving puzzles and collecting treasure which allows you to buy various weapons and armour along the way to help fight skeletons and other monsters. Think Knightmare mixed with a little bit of Zelda!The combat features blocking and attacking in various ways like stabbing and slashing with range weapons as an option. I'd say the combat is not highly skilled by normal RPG standards but it's still very fun and engaging requiring timing to block or dodge attacks. I can only imagine what I must look like in my VIVE swinging my hand around to stab and raising my other hand to block with my shield.:-DThis game has all the usual dungeon crawler puzzles and challenges to workout along the way.I initially downloaded a torrent copy but after my first 20 minutes I went and bought it and I am happy to support the developer if they make more games of this standard. The only thing I'll say it's not really a roleplaying game as there's no character development and the story is quite basic in the form of text it would be nice to have some narration perhaps in future updates.I would defiantly say this is one of the best VR games around at the moment and I'm amazed it's early access it feels like a completed game.Just an end note I know some people have commented on the teleport style walking but this doesn't break the immersion at all and I'm sure lots of games will give options to toggle this off once VR tech grows more main stream.

The bow isn't great but is not bad either. I wish the dev would work more on this mechanic and allow arrows to be drawn and nocked similar to 'QuiVR'. It's awesome to see arrows blocked by the shield poking through the other side.Interactions with objects is completely satisfying - from mining ore to breaking containers and glass to lighting curtains, pillows, banners, leaves and spider webs on fire.Graphics are top notch for a VR title and everything is absolutely wonderous. The world feels alive and is very interactive.The haptics feel dead on and the controls are smooth. Even the auto-pause feature (which irritated me at the beginning) is a nice addition to keep you within the chaperone area and from breaking your controllers.

I like it because it's a high-fantasy dungeon crawler.I managed to complete the first level. The combat was interesting enough, and I like the fact that I got to try out some melee fighting, bow shooting, and magic via magic wand.I found the pacing to be... odd. For example, the first level often felt slow because of the exploration component. At least walking around was punctuated with combat encounters. The 2nd level had a completely different pacing. Little or no exploration, but it becomes frantic because activities are timed. I have a particular annoyance for timed things, and I eventually lost interest and stopped playing this game when I kept failing the time-based challenge. For whatever reason, there just isn't enough payoff in other ways for me to bring the same level of enthusiasm for meeting this video game challenge. I enjoyed Dark Souls 1.

Puzzles in this game add up to simple fetch-object-from-a-few-feet-away-and-bring-back-to-other-object moments.  These puzzles required no thinking and were just boring.  Yes, it's VR, so it's very immersive, but that will only get you so far!  Picking up objects felt good, and throwing objects played into some puzzles, which was kind of clever, but that really wasn't required to progress through any portion of the game, which was already pretty short.  It was also very unoptimized and ran very slowly at times for unknown reasons.  I mean, VR is demanding, but NRAN runs much more smoothly and has much more going on (including emulators and minigames and more realistic lighting/shading), so I'm disappointed with this game's performance by comparison.Overall, this could be a good purchase at $5 but is definitely not a good purchase at $20."

This product is not currently worth the list price, but I will revisit my review if the creator ever updates this product.Edit: I finally got a chance to check out the changes. The game was okay at launch, but hasn't aged well (even with the updates). The gameplay is hollow and does not have meaningful tactical choices. The AI is predictable and easily exploited, which makes combat dull. Chapter 1 has some decent puzzles and the exploration is fun. Chapter 2 feels lazy and tacked on. If it were $5 or $10 or if the Vive was still new and had few quality game choices, I'd recommend it. I just don't think it's worth the price right now, and the creator has said that further content will likely be paid DLC."

Of course it would be challenging to build a full physics based combat engine, especially as you get no force feedback, but they did not try at all. I think most people who rated this game positively did it because the hardware is awesome and it is one of the first games of its kind, but the game uses like 3% of the potential.

Standing face to face with a skeleton is shocking. Wandering around dark dungeons gives a distinct feeling, like you stepped inside a Zelda game. It's worth trying out because it's unique, literally can't get this anywhere else. However, there are many design decisions I don't like. The inventory system is barbaric, getting a particular item is always frustrating. The UI bounces up / down to always stay visible even if you don't want to look at it. Grabbing loot is followed by an annoying chime and stupid UI circles right in your face. The game tries really hard to remind you it's just a game, rather then just letting you be in the world. The final combat sequence is a series of enemies that must be defeated inside a short time limit. This is a bad decision, it encourages you to break the already flaky combat system, Actually  blocking swords and striking when you have an oportunity will cause you to fail since it's so time consuming.Another developer will probably do this better relatively soon."

The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive's lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don't know.- Abandonware?  The game has passed the time frame layed out in the early access description, with no updates in two months.  The game was described as having almost two hours of content per chapter, but I was able to easily clear both chapters in under two hours, as the second chapter is just a series of arena fights.I really wanted to like this game based on it's reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can't tell who is hitting you from where.  I was surprised at how soulless the game felt, I never felt there was a good reason for anything I was doing, just dungeon crawling for the sake of it, which once you get past the glitter of ""it's in VR!"" becomes boring fast.I will be eager to check out this game again once it has more updates and re-review it then, but as of now, I wish I had not bought it."

It would be much more believable if the enemies' movements were at least a little physics based.

And share productively as to move out the junk and promote good stuff. Vanishing Realms is well worth the price.

There's a bit of traditional style gameplay, things like finding keys and such, but it's of course all VR, so finding a key is literally finding a key, and using it is the same.

Ever since I was a kid I've always wanted a good D&D VR experience and this surpisingly more or less does the job in a cartoony D&D world. The feeling you get when you pick up the bow and arrow and start using it, the sword and shield battles are interesing ... (yes you can fight more than one at a time even making it itneresting). There's necromancers that heal the undead forcing you to tackle them first.

The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting.Overall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements.

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat.The melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion.The game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.8/10 for now.

I did not find any bugs! Great job so far. I would like to see more hidden items and I'm always hoping for secret rooms with hidden buttons or triggers. I found the monsters a little too easy to kill especailly if you just hang back and hit them with unending arrows. Maybe there is a difficulty setting that I missed or I sugest adding one. Enemy projectiles could go a little faster. Maybe the sword skeletons could block arrows better. Another idea would be more loot from monsters depending on how you kill them. ie skeletons give no loot with 100% arrow damage. It would be a nice addition to add armor, magic rings, more weapon variety, etc.. so you can do more upgrading than just buying a better bow.

Too short, but honestly I think it's fun enough that it'll be worth another playthrough before too long. This is supposed to be the first chapter in a series, and I hope we get to see the rest.

A number of the interiors are a pleasure to walk through and explore and had a good balance of things to do and puzzles to solve.The story line is simple - again, old school, but your first interaction with a skeleton warrior - right there - in front of you - trying to kill you, is something you can only experience in VR, and this game does it well.   The fighting has been beautifully realised.  Particularly the sword and shield combat.  I found myself sweating after a series of hack and slash encounters.Teleporting has been done well in this game too.  I found it produced no discomfort or nausea.I struggle to come up with any negatives other than those limits which are imposed on any VR material at the moment - ie lower graphic detail and game length.Looking forward to the next chapter."

Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!One thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.The game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous.I also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period. For example time-consuming use of a mining-pick to obtain gold (which is neccessary to proceed), as well as the cryptic hints on how to proceed to the end of each chapter or how to pass through certain doorways."

But it is nicely wrapped up in a package that feels complete story-wise (not that there is much of story).But if you have a Vive, this title is well worth it as there is nothing else like it.It is quite fun to beat up skeletons in swordfights. One thing that could have made it better would be if the AI was a bit better. Right now the enemies just stand there even if you are fighting one of their buddies literally 2 m away. It would be ok if they would pull from a larger radius so you would get a couple more fights where you face more than one at a time.Also, the bow. The bow right now is sort of overpowered due to infinite arrows, and enemies at a distance will most of the time just stand there while you shoot at them over and over until they die - even if there is a fairly obvious path to you, and even if it's a ""boss"". Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill. On the other hand that means there should be some other way to kill bowmen on unreachable ledges (orberhaps you will be forced to just dodge them)."

The sense of immersion and feeling you get is leveled by none and the combat system is fantastic. If you like fantasy or RPGs this is a must. The combat starts very easy but by the end of the first section it's bloody hard. As with other RPGs you can choose your style but in this there's no class system - it's just down to you! I ended up dual wielding swords for maximum blocking & damage. The hit reg can be slightly off at times with the sword play but you can physically dodge most of the attacks which is fun!

Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere.There's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.I remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible.It's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.PRO's:- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great.- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here).- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).- Solid music.- Intuitive puzzles.- Leaves you aching for more content.CONS:- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down.- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time.- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen.- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.Anyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin. Keep it up."

While some of the mechanics could use a little more refinement, the total experience is wonderful, and really gives you a good look at what large scale games for VR will eventually be like. There are some really nice level design moments, such as the room with the archer you can't reach right away, which feel really new in VR. Some suggestions:- Magnet on object pickup, especially on gold/coins- Limited, but recoverable, ammo for the bow. It's too exploitable right now.- All small objects should be interactable. Because so many of them are not, I got confused in the begining and didn't realize I could pick up the torches. Consistency of object interaction seems more important in VR than in regular games.- A bit more hand holding in the first rooms.- Current mechanics for grab/let go are a little confusing as they are slightly different than many games (most likely because you want the sword/etc to equipt without having to keep the trigger pressed) - but I often ended up dropping items by mistake, and eventually lost my pick axe this way.- More hidden goals, secrets, etc for replayability.Overall though this is one of my favorite games for early VR, and I can't wait for more."

The game length is about an hour with no reason to replay it other than to relive the experience.It's advertised as an RPG, however when I hear 'RPG' i think choices. There are no choices in this game, other than 'Should i spend my money on this item.' and 'How do I attack this skeleton.'. A leveling system, some sort of upgrade system, or even a few forks in the dungeon could go a long way in Vanishing Realms.I'm recommending this game because its still great, and it has tons of potential, but if you have a limited amount of cash to spend on VR games, hold off on this one until its had more time to grow."

It felt like a dungeon crawl, and the experience was my first like it in VR.PROS-The game is visually sound with a good consistant atmosphere. The styalized and cartoony look and feel reminded a lot of WoW, and the few different areas felt unique nice to look at.-The combat felt good and hit impacts felt satisfying. I feel that it was far too easy for myself, but it is sound and fun.-The HUD and convenience mechanics were good. Health/Mana/Gold float down your waist until the value is changed, never in your way, and not too far either. There were no problems accessing inventory and things like that.-The adventure feels like a natural progression through item and weapon aquisition. At the end I was excited for new challenges and further progression.CONS-With only a couple hours of play, the game is too short. While at the end I felt acomplished, I wanted a lot more. Especially considering the $20 price tag. If there are more chapters released in the future as the ending eludes to, I will be happy.-As I said earlier the game was too easy. There are hidden collectables and money to find, but there isn't really any use for it once you get your full set of weapons. The combat was fun, but I never really felt that I was in danger of dying when I put any effort in.-While the look of the game is great, the story and game feel generic. The fact that it is in VR is great, but I didn't feel any interest in the world. There are a lot of RPG standards.If you want a fantasy adventure in VR for the sake of playing a solid one, and don't care about the cost/time ratio, pick it up."

R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using.- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more ""round"". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of his strikes.- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.General movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.Some minor quirks with how far monsters ""back off"" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way."

I know I have. And Vanishing Realm made my dreams come true.Made by an ex-Valve dev (yes, singular), Vanishing Realm puts players into, quite literally, the boots of a lone adventurer, armed only with his/her wits and thirst for adventure. The cartoony nature of the game may seem like a mood breaker for some, but trust me when I say all these will go away once you hold the sword in your hand for the first time, or when you that huge skeleton swung its flail right above your head as you franctically ducked instinctively.The battle was fluid and engaging, requiring players to parry, dodge and attack with good timing and precision. However, once you get used to the mechanics, it can get a little too easy, even in boss fights. The variety of weapons is also quite limited at this time as the game is still in early access.However, the potential of this game is huge and it could very well revolutionise dungeon crawling adventure games as Ocarina of Time did at the time of its release.

Enemy hitboxes are baffling, enemy combat AI is rudimentary at best, defending is laughably easy, and there's just no satisfaction when you hit anything.Other:-I'm not a fan of the teleportation locomotion, as it makes abusing fights really easy.  I know there aren't many options available right now, but hopefully more options are explored in the future-You don't have to stand still while using the bow & arrow, remember about roomscale!

You have your melee guys, your ranged folks, your magic fellows, your mini boss types, but they're the only inhabitants of this world. I would have liked to see some wildlife, even if it wasn't interactable (like a scripted scene where something runs out ahead of you) just to give you a sense that there was a living, breathing world here.

No demo, 'VR' is a short yet substantial journey through a beautifully crafted world that is unlike any I've ever experienced as a gamer.   It is in my opinion a great first step in defining the ideal way in which we can enjoy traditional games in VR. The vivid lighting effects & majestic God rays are a sight to behold & made me stop on more than one occasion to take them in. The teleporting nature of gameplay feels good and controls become intuitive almost immediately. Shooting the bow is especially addictive & fun.  Just be sure you have a generous amount of space a to play.  My space barely met the minimum requirement which I suspect created a fair amount of tracking issues.  Turning off the pause screen feature was helpful.  Buy this game now, just make sure you have some extra room on the minimum allowable space so your controls don't go janky."

You go through chapter 1 collecting all these items and gear, and then go into chapter 2 expecting to have some cool stuff to do with your gear, but instead are met with repetitive arena battles that are not very difficult at all.

There's a section in game where there were a number of ore clusters around, and I was wondering if I would be able to mind them later on. Sure enough, a few areas later I found a few pickaxes.Puzzles were challenging, but didn't make me want to take the headset off and quit.What I didn't like:Presently in game, there's an auto-pause feature. This may have been more of an issue with my cobbled settup, but I was experiencing the auto-pause going off a lot during combat and exploration, despite me not going out of sight of my base stations. I tried turning it off, but whenever I did go out of range of my base stations I got pwnt by the enemies.Combat is good for the most part, but hit detection needs a lot of work. I managed to complete both chapters, but not without combat grinding to a halt because of auto-pauses, or constantly having to flail and reposition due to the auto-pause throwing my character out of position, and rendering me unable to hit anything.Call me a noob, but I was having extreme issues with archery at long range. There's a section where you need to fight a skeleton wizard, a skeleton cleric, and a skeleton juggernaught. Attacking the fire wizard or the juggernaut doesn't work because the cleric  heals them. Trying to dodge fireballs and hit the cleric repetedly was almost impossible due to how archery works. I wish there was a proper sight on the bow, or at least something to assist with aim.Later on in game you have the opertunity to gain a two-handed axe as a weapon. While it deals good damage, I found myself going back to my battleworn sword that was dealing less damage due to the outright clunkyness of the mechanics. Again, this may have been an issue with my settup rather than a game issue.Inventory management for weapons was something that I almost tore my hair out at. Trying to swap from sword to axe, or vice versa, was a trial in patience, since if you click on the axe with your sword equiped, it causes them to stack rather than swap. I ended up getting hit a lot because I was trying to swap to my sword, and ended up stacking it on top of the axe, leaving my unarmed in my main hand, rather than swapping to the proper weapon.All in all, Vanishing Realms is a good game, but it does suffer from issues that can be solved with a bit more polish, and a bit more work setting up your play area."

Took me about 2.3 hours to complete on Classic difficulty, and I fully expect to go back and play it again on Hard once it is out of Early Access and Steam Achievements are implemented.Pros:- Enemies will learn as you fight them. Hit an enemy swordsman 2-3 times with your bow and arrow, and they will make sure to dodge/parry the next time you shoot at them, forcing you to change strategy and fight them differently.- Higher difficulty enemies will utilize chain attacks and attempt to strike you in your week spots, keeping you on your toes and parrying between strikes.- Great variety of environments to explore.- Progressive introduction of new weapons/enemies.Cons:- $20 for a 2-3 hour game is a bit high.

I'm glad I finally fired it up yesterday. It has been my favorite VR experience so far. It was easy to get lost in the world.Once you learn the control conventions the game uses, everything just works as you think it should. For example, the triggers grab. If I grab an item with the wrong hand (maybe I grab an item I want to throw with my off-hand), I just put the other controller on the held item and click that controller's trigger. The game swaps the item to the other hand. These touches are small but make it easier to feel more like you're in a place than playing a game.It's a short but fulfilling experience.

I only just quit playing because after several fights with the 2h axe, I was getting a bit sweaty, and I'm not an out of shape gamer.Basically if you own a Vive, you MUST get this.  I'm not sure why it didn't show up for me in a VR search on steam, (found it via google), this should be shipped with the Vive as a package its so good.Side note, my room is pretty small, the Vive minimum, and I'm under the recommended size for this game but the games UI is good enough that its never been an issue.If I could make one small suggestion, I would allow for drawing/sheathing motions from the back and hip for swords, bows, etc.Anyways GET THIS GAME."

I can't wait for more content/chapters to become available for this game, I've already competed the game but will be going back in for another run soon (probably when I'm done writing this review).  Something I would like to see in this game and other VR related content would be a full body, it would add to the experience if when you look down you see you.

And I can't believe I still think it's awesome now, when it came out way back when Vive was brand new and the bar for content was so low.This is really excellent. I just spent 90 minutes in it for what was supposed to be a quick look around and just...couldn't leave.Ok. Criticism. The swordplay feels a bit arcade-like. And it's got the same problem that sword fighting games always have in VR. And I think I have some advice, that I've been handing out to every developer I've found who's working on this kind of thing.Change your swordfighting mechanic so that it's like when you draw the sword you go into an altered state.Obviously, this means slow motion. Which is how we all instinctively did sword fighting when we were kids. Because you aren't going to have serious swordplay at real sword-swinging speeds and be able to actually intercept stabs and slashes in a realistic way. Not at speed. Which leaves us with this really imprecise version of swordfighting that's been dumbed down. But that takes the joy out of the swordfight itself! I mean, it's still cool because you're in a mystic cave and you're fighting a skeleton and so on, but the swordfighting part gets old fast because of everything I just described.So slow it down. Make the swordfight work on a flexible timescale very much like the basic mechanic in SuperHot. When you pick up your sword, everything should slow down to timescale slaved to how fast you move. And if you try to stab your sword through their shield or armor or a wall (i.e., you don't stop swinging when it hits a barrier and you see sparks fly and the controller buzzes in your hand or whatever), you drop your sword and have to duck down and scoop it up (which isn't life threatening in slow-motion...but it's a setback and you probably won't do it too many times in a row).Then you can make the hitpoints go way, way up in both directions - a hard slash across the belly should be fatal (for the player or the NPC's). Smooth out and polish the animations a bit so they pass muster in slow motion. That especially goes for the animations when you kill them. Maybe work in some halfway-there maiming scripting - if you cut off an arm or leg, they're pretty much done for, but not before they make one or two last clumsy attempts to kill you with their remaining limbs. Do that, and players will actually get really excited about any opportunity for melee combat."

Inventory location was a little awkward, but not too bad.  Interface is easy and intuitive.  Graphic and visuals are nothing spectacular but that is fairly typical with most VR games.  There are no deep story lines to this game, it is pretty much a hack and slash on rails.  My only gripe with the game is that it is short.

,Recommended,322770,34666165,Posted: 1 September,all,Shr00md,"People complain about the length and content of this game, but even now most VR games are just demos. Vanishing realms  has a nice atmosphere, cool interactions with the world and what's most important a fighting system that has some weight to it. No one whom I let play it and experience VR didn't leave with it wihtout a smile on their face.If you think that 20 bucks are too much for a game that can be finished in ~5 hours played in a chilled fashion then maybe wait for a sale. But you already paid 500 to 900 bucks on the equipment and maybe even more on a machine that can run it, so why should it hurt?"

I'm sure that as the mechanics of RPG games in VR gets more solidified the gameplay of Vanishing Realms will seem underwhelming but for right now it's one of the best out there. And a fair price too! Definitely check it out!

This one however did, it's a great little game, the best in my library and would happily play it again. Definitely my favourite VR game, alongside Elite Dangerous (which is in a whole different class really).On a GTX970 - This runs smoothly, there's no vomit inducing jitter that I get on some of the other games. It's simple enough, but if you've always wanted to feel like you're crawlng around castle dungeons (with cartoon artwork) then you will just love this. Loads of fun."

I expected a low-budget, glorified tech demo (as many of the current class of VR games are), but was very pleasantly surprised by this. I really hope it continues to get improved and expanded upon - it has the potential to be really great."

Vanishing Realms is a very polished and overall it's a great game. This game is not as enjoyable if you have a smaller play space. My play space is about 2x1.5 Meters and the fact that I have to teleport a lot makes the game less realistic for me. I wouldn't suggest this as the first game to buy when you get a Vive or Oculus. I will definitely check it out if I have the money to spend and already tried most other popular VR games."

It's just a demo as it is now, and the content does not warrant the price. A year ago, when VR content was sparse this game was interesting and did a lot to show the potential of VR, now it's just a money grab. Wait until the developer actually completes the game or it's at least 50% off sale."

A must have game for VR, plenty great feeling combat and well designed (and importantly short) puzzles for a well paced and definitely fun adventure! It's the sort of game you can play in short burts thanks to the checkpoint system or hours at a time.It's got just enough complexity to remain interesting yet simple enough for almost any gamer. The enemies are fun and despite it still being in early access it's well worth your time if you enjoy light hearted RPGs and/or adventure games :)"

I had a grin from ear to ear the entire time I was playing this game. If you play this game the way it was meant to be played you will have an absolute blast!. You can of course try to cheat (saw a few videos of people exploiting) but if that's what you are going to do.. why did you buy VR?I love the combat and with a couple wrist weights on my arm it turned into a realistic workout. I hope more content comes out and a few more monsters. I love what is in the game right now, I was ducking and weaving, the more space you can give this game the better it will play. That being said I was playing just under the 2m X 2m space but I was able to make due just fine, I just wish I had a bit more space.If you are running room scale VR and always wanted to battle the undead with swords and shields or a bow and arrow then buy this game, seriously, do not hesitate. It may be a bit cartoony but it gets the job done. This is a dungeon crawl that seriously made me glad I bought the Vive over the competition.Why are you still reading this? Adventures await! This game is worth it at double the price!Edit -I have now used the Oculus Rift and room scale with this game as well as the HTC Vive. I would like to comment on how the game handles with the Rift. The Rift plays quite well with 3 sensor room scale. I did not have any issues at all. I was able to set up the Rift sensors to get good tracking even when on the ground, at times I felt I had better control on the ground with the Rift vs Vive. At no time did I feel any disconnect in the hour I played. I was quite pleased! I then attempted to use the game with only 2 sensors. I would highly not recommend this. This game requires full 360 tracking and 2 sensors will not give you 100%, I was able to get it to a playable level but I did run into disconnect issues with the controllers and it breaks the flow of the game.If you have 3 sensor room scale for the Oculus Rift this game is a must have!!!!!"
,Recommended,322770,35401108,Posted: 1 October,all,KBL1974,"Ok recently got a Rift and have spent a great deal on a multitude of games. I read some Steam reviews on this and they seemed very sure that this was a must try. Have to say that they were spot on.I think that anyone who doesnt take something special away from this was never a young child.It IS what VR promised. Hand down.There's a simple joy associated with every action. The bow and arrow, to my absolute delight, seems to be the same mechanic as The Lab. You know the feeling. Precise and fun. You really feel the feedback tension as you pull the arrow back.I almost never post reviews (apologies). But this seems to warrant the extra effort on my part.My only mild gripe would be the click to run and click to turn issue. But its my no means a game breaker. I quickly adapted and proceeded to grin from ear to ear with every moment.Thank you for such awesome."

Trigger pick up is nice.  I don't care for the new movement stuff.  I like warping.  Maybe I'm just used to it but it's just confortable for me to warp.  Overall I love it.  I'm a huge fan.  You've got the best VR game out still.  I really look forward to the new chapters.  I do have suggestions though.  And this may not be what you want for your game but I think it would add so much to your next chapters.  More traps.  Maybe snakes in vases that give you 3 seconds to move or strike them and your posioned and die slow unless you rehealth up.  I like the health mechanism and feel it's not used enough.  Statue traps.  If you choose to grap an oddly placed gem on a huge statue it comes to life and strikes you.  Maybe you can't kill it.  You just need to get out of the room once you grab the gem or you're dead.  How bout since you've added climbing, a snake or monkey falls on the rope as your climbing across. If you don't slay it without cutting the rope you fall and die.  I realize these additions could make players move quickly and you may be trying to avoid that so if this is something of a concern then maybe only put these in the hard setting.  I've got tons of great ideas if you want more I only want to see more of what your doing so thank you.  Reilly"
,Recommended,322770,35413753,Posted: 2 October,all,mikepatt9,"Vanishing Realms - 4 out of 5 starsMood and atmosphere were great from the get go. localized torchlight was such a nice touch and the lighting of scenes throughout always impressed me, although dark areas could have been darker. Even without the torch there was only one place i struggled to see clearly. sounds and music added to the dungeon feel. Kudos to the designers.Game play was very enjoyable with accurate aiming and pinpoint swordplay. you are not going to wildly swing your weapon and expect results. The peril level is fairly low with very few ""startling moments"" an no ""horror"" , making this adventure excellent for children. As an adult and veteran gamer I may have asked for more but that is not a criticism.There were some times that melee  felt a little lackluster. Here's why.....Enemies were for the most part activated by proximity not line of sight. you could often stand quite close and just stare at them, so they lacked a ""threatening"" attitude. It was also easy to stay out of the areas of multiple enemies and engage them one at at time, and too easy to run away. Maybe slow the teleport dot even more than it already moves ( a good feature that is a clever way simulate player run speed)Lastly, while there were elements of puzzle play most were easy (very easy) and the bosses posed only moderate challenge. I never ran out of health and had ample food to regenerate. There were lots of nooks to look into but few things to collect and (so far) not very many upgrades to shoot for. there wasn't ever i time that an object was out of reach and as far as i can tell  few reasons to revisit past areas. But this was my first go at it  and that was on default settings....and i did not get all achievements. 6 hrs total play time for about $25 is good value and i will play again for some things i am sure i missed.Vanishing Realms is super fun for everyone. Hoping to see more and I will definitely buy new chapters"

(if you’re into that sorta thing)- Not a single loading screens in a solid hour of gameplay- If you move out of the play area you have, the game will pause. Still stopped me from walking into furniture heaps of times. Strangely, this is the first time I’ve seen this feature in a game.- GreatCons: Melee combat can feel a bit off at times, hits not registering etc but certainly nothing major."
