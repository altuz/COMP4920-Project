I really like the 1st player career mode, only a few weeks into the season but it is a great addition to a game that over the last few years hasn't added much. Which is why typically I don't suggest buying the new game until it has been out a while. As always with a new game it will crash occastionally and I'm sure they will put out patches soon as the game as only been out 2 days now.1st person career mode:You determine what type of cyclist you want to be (sprinter, climber, stage races, et cetera).Then pick your team, typically a contentional or contentional pro team.You have a race director or tell you want he would like you do during the race (just like in old career modes you used to give to your riders). So he declares you the leader, or free element, or teammate, and gives specific instructions like don't attack, ride in the breakaway, follow counter attacks, et cetera.You have a small number of points that you are allowed to use to adjust your race schedule during the year, which is nice when you want to get more training in.You select how much workload for your training, which in effect hurts your freshness for when races come up, so you need to decide how many rest days you want.Overall just a great addition, and as always if you like the career mode as a manager that has changed a little, they do R&D now on equipment, but quickly other than that I didn't see any major changes from previous version of the game.So far I highly recommend this game if you like cycling. I will update if any major issues arise."

If you are a cycling fan, yes this game will fill up your hopes, if you take the time to properly learn it.That's the main reason why i love this game. It has such a big learning curve, and if you take the time to properly try out strategies, and don't just full out attack at the beginning of the stage, the game is really fun.BUT you will go crazy after some time because of bs happening all over the place :D"

They don't seem to care about going the extra mile and improving the product. The distinctive jersey's are trash. I play the game in 3D mode, and let me tell you, the graphics are very poor.

The idea and concept of the game is fantastic. The fact that the AI riders seem to react differently to my rider then the other 199 AI riders is flat ridiculous. Im not the top ranked rider so why can any other rider decide to breakaway but if I do or follow a breakaway the pack is right on my heels? How are riders able to maintain when they are completely out of both bars of energy? If that happens to me my rider drops back like hes sitting still. When is pro cyclist mode I can see my teammates killing themselves to keep up yet still maintain and recover as fast as I do when I keep my bars almost full. Then lets get to the crazy numberous amount of bugs that no one seems to be working on or care about as they are posted and made awhere of. Im into season 4 of pro cyclist and now all the sudden my mouse pointer freezes on the screen and you have to move your mouse around guessing where it is till you get lucky enough to scroll over something with it and the icon changes colors a tad. Yes the game is playable like this but I refuse to waste my time trying to figure out where my mouse is. Ive had the game over a month with alot of crashes and a pop up that asks me to send my data to help the developers work on a fix. I cant find anywhere that someone from the game has responded or gave info on any fixes for the future. I dont really write reviews but I feel like this time I didnt get even half my moneys worth when I cant continue to play the game and dont know if I ever will be able to.

The game auto-saves, so the crashing is at least not causing me to lose any progress (yet).Bug 1) The game will sometimes get stuck on ""Downloading Water Physics"" or something like that, when trying to do a 3D race.Bug 2) The game will randomly show you / try to start up a race that you aren't taking part of.The two above glitches can be fixed by clicking on a team name, bringing up their info and clicking the X above them. Then close down the mode and restart it.Bug 3 -the most annoying of all-) Sometimes when you do the ""Quick Simulation"", all the riders show up as ""Withdrawn"" and the board makes no movement to the overall classifications.

The interface has taken a huge backwards step and the rider fitness screen is now completley unreadable. Also the lack of Continental teams makes many 2.1 races pointless with sometimes only around 70-80 riders taking part (e.g. there are 6 UK Continental teams but once again only 2 make this game.) Considering that in the 2014 edition it only takes around 1 hour to fully set up a new team on the editor the lack of effort that has gone into the details of this game is insulting.I would advise you buy the 2014 edition instead as it will be cheaper, the maps are basically the same and the interface is far better."

76561198076969188,Recommended,322850,16679219,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,GiantTreeGuy,"This game is by far the best cycling game in the world. There are two main modes that are commonly played throughout the community (Career, and Pro Cyclist Mode)Career-The career mode is great if you like to control a whole team. The pros about this mode are it is easy to understand. You can change every aspect about your team and can master the manager part. It is always hard to choose which team you want to choose at the beginning of a career, and this game helps your choices. You can choose between any of the three   divisions to select your team (Cya World Tour, Contintental Pro, and Continental) You can filter alphabetically or by the amount of stars they possess (Overall Rating) The cons about this mode are, when selecting a team, they should also give you sponsor details (i.e. Sponsor Budget and Length of contract) Also in this mode there are no major advancements from pcm 2014. Overall this game mode is adicting and very fun. I would recommend this mode to anyone who likes a team and realistic aspect.Pro Cyclist Mode-This mode is amazing. You can control everything about your rider during the race and out of race (Height, Weight, Complexion, Nationality, you can even change the picture of your rider) The gameplay of this mode is outstanding. There are no downsides to this mode except you should be able to do something with the money you earn. I would reccoment this game to anyone who likes fantasy due to the fake Cyanide Cups at the beginning and the fact that you are not a real pro cyclist.Overall this game is the best one out there. The gameplay is amazing no matter what mode you play in. It's super addicting and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not at the controls. This game is for people who truly love the sport of cycling. If you don't know much about the sport, the tutorials will help you further your knowledge about professional cycling. I'll give it a 9.25/10 rating because of the crashes the might happen in the loading screen. Tip: Don't Click ANYTHING during the loading screen of a race."

Also the game has crashed quite a few times, and there are some periods in some of my games that I can get past because of this.Overall I do enjoy the general feel of PCM, but the requirement of a custom DB and the many crashes makes me feel like I have wasted my money.

The pro cyclist mode is fun, it is actually my favorite mode, but not totally complete because even if you are the team leader, you cannot tell your teamates to get bottles, relay at the front, protect you, or not relay at the front if you are tired (which they sometimes do). The AI in this mode sometimes does not understand that you may be going onto a climb, which makes it easier to bring back a breakaway group. For some, the mode looks bad as you ""cannot"" control your rider as you can only tell him to pace and other actions and move from side to side with the number pad. The normal manager mode is fun but if you are only looking at that mode, the only difference between pcm15 and the older games in the series is the ratings, age, and teams of the riders which you can chage with downloading databases off sites like pcm.daily. The track mode is unchanged and is fun to play if you have nothing to do. The one-off race is like last year and is basically unchanged. The game is very fun, but if you do not understand cycling, then the game will feel very strange and awkward.7.5/10"

I've tried loading the game with the default settings as well as the updates and database patches, and have problems either way.  It's too bad a really fun game is ruined by the companies inability or refusal (not sure which) to address the bugs.Update:  after experiencing a few crashes with the original game, I downloaded and installed a new database and ""fixes"" from PCMdaily.  This just made the problem worse, causing me to be completely unable to proceed in my carrer in PRO mode after about the 4th race.I decided to start from scratch and uninstall the new database and game, then re-install the base game again without any mods.  So far it's been working fine for me through about 10 races, with no crashes.  Hopefully this time around it continues, but I still can't change my recommendation yet until I see how reliably I can continue to play.Update 2: Well, I made it almost through an entire season with my pro after the clean install, but then started getting the crashes again.

Now after over a year it is still a lot of problem after countless updates and patches. U get the feeling u buy an unfinished game with pro Cycling manager. And its not the first game that has major problems. Its a shame because the career mode is generally a lot of fun. But Cyanide shoudl improve and make games that actually works. Suddenly it crashes. Sometimes u cant proceed to the next day or year in career. And all this happens for no reason. Some satges simply wont work. Like the time-trials. All this is totally ridiculous. And i cannot understand why cyanide cannot fix this with all its updates. Also they should make the game with real names of teams and riders. Not come with a new database u have to install to get this, which also creates more crashes. When u buy a product like this its fair to expect that it actually will work. Here Cyanide disappoint time and again. A shame for the nice game. It shows that it creaters dont value the customers. As said i like many things with the game.

Nice, but not very polished.You gain money, but you can't do nothing with that; the developing of your player is so fast that you become a sort of Froome in a couple of season; and for the Career mode, the old bugs still persists.However, the game at least introduce some new pretty design, a new, awaited, game mode, and a some nice improvements.But, at the end, is still and always the same broken product!It's frankly unacceptable!This company is one of the biggest in Europe, and is still not able to solve bugs (stupid bugs, like stability bugs, not logical bugs!) before releasing his main product.Finishing, don't buy the game now: you'll finish to asking Steam for a refund.Wait, and check back in the following months, also checking for community mods."

Game is bugged as hell, lacks official support, the graphics are mediocre and the game design falls short in many areas. A really devoted developer could have made this a hell of a game... could...The support from fans is btw great. Go topcmdaily.comfor all your needs around this game like databases, better graphics, etc."

,Not Recommended,322850,22489754,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,truthwarrior,This is basically a sports management game and not a cycling game. As far as I can tell I was never able to directly control someone riding a bike. The line which states “Pro Cyclist: a new game mode where you create and control a cyclist from the start of his career and turn him into an international star!“ does not mean you will ride a bike. I gave up on this game early so I won’t say much.  So I am writing simply as someone who plays video games.Pros•	Management tools•	Decent graphics•	Thorough tutorial•	I am confident if you are into managing a cycling team and not into riding you will have a good time.Cons•	You don’t ride a bike•	The world is kind of empty for watching cyclist ride around a track•	You don’t ride a bike

It has a couple of rushed and unfinished game modes, occasionally crashes and has licensing issues (which do get solved by the great community behind the PCM games). But if you can look past all that you can have a lot of fun with this game.Only buy it if you like cycling and management games, or if on sale."

Pulling everything together to win the big jerseys feels like a marathon journey, and you can blow it on one little mistake. While most of the races are whizzed through in fast forward, its excellent for the multi-screening type of person. I'll easy be half watching the tv and then focus can be switched to the important bits. Running a team is a little daunting at the start, but once your up and running it all can tie in nicely and you can focus on the racing."

Frequent crashes, loading of races freezing, wrong profile of races shown, all riders giving up in some simulated races,......There was one thing that decides me to delete the game actually..... A mountainous Giro race, with finish on top of a mountain, won by a guy 6 minutes before the second.... the guy had the climbing stats of a rookie, (62 while any decent or good climber would have 70 - 80).I could live with the boring races, that always end up the same way.... and I played even  through all the bugs. But one day it ends... That's today.No more Cycling Manager for me. I've been patient, waiting for patches to improve things...... But since those aren't coming, this is the end."

So far Cyanide is the best producer of Cycling simulator game in the market today. There are certainly some bugs and lot of improvements to be done, but I still enjoyed this game as much as I've enjoyed the previous versions.It's so rewarding to see your Pro cyclist in a pro mode beating the likes of Froome, Contador, etc. In the mountains and be able to replicate Jens Voigt's ""Shut up legs and do as I say"".I will certainly recommend this game to those die hard cycling lovers. I honestly say that this game is quite improving and I hope someday they will hit the mark where we fans will said ""well done Cyanide"", still hoping for that version to come.I suggest that you visit the community sites likePCMdaily.comfor some realistic databases. So I will give this game a rating of 8/10, for bringing up some new contents."

Ive lost 4-5 save files in 80 hours of gameplay and the national and world champion jerseys are awful. It has some commontary still from 5 years ago and cyclist's faces are all the same. But i still love the game because i love cycling and i love PCM. Dont buy if you dont really care about cycling don buy if you like cycling only buy if you love cycling and PCM."
76561198032522502,Not Recommended,322850,34025087,Posted: 4 August,all,krolpand,"I can't recommend this game to anyone but hardcore enthusiasts.It's basically a linear numbers game that will bore the hell out of you if you're not into cycling.Game play in Pro Cyclist Mode looks like this: Your rider has 75 Hills but can't drop one with 50. The same rider will destroy you in the flats. Or you will get boxed in. Or the pelotons refuses to chase in a one-day race. Or your team won't work for you.If you control a team and can actually keep track of everything happening, you will be able to pull some amazing wins.However, this game is overall pretty slow and unbalanced Nairo Quintana won the overall classification along the points AND mountains jersey at the same time. The best sprinter in 2017? Rin Zebal."
