So I gave it a second chance, and a third, maybe even a fourth. I plowed through the tutorials and got to the more in depth scenarios. I am now kind of hooked on this game, even though it's not really what I expected.This game is simple in some ways, yet deceivingly so. All of the units have the same strength, but have varying costs, speed of movement and utility. There aren't that many unit types, although the game doesn't feel like it's missing anything critical. Air, land and sea are all represented. There's no fog of war, no base building, and the economy doesn't need to be managed. It's definitely not a typical RTS in that sense.I think I hated it at first becuase I was expecting another RTS. A typical RTS. I couldn't get past the fact that one tank unit and fighter jet unit are worth exactly the same once in combat. I couldn't get by the the interface and control scheme being unique. And I certainly couldn't get by the fact that there are no special abilities, rank ups, or customization options. I'm glad I plowed through and looked past my expectations.This game rewards thinking ahead, the dance of tactics. It doesn't require you to click a thousand times a minute. Any ruses or strategems you create are entirely based on what you do and decide, not what some simulated fog of war or magic ability button says happens.If you take two units and feint east, what happens? What if your opposing player doesn't even notice? Or what if he does and guesses what you're really up to? Even the AI feints and doubles back in this game.This type of situation and depth is part and parcel to this game, all while giving the player the option to play the game their way. The game doesn't force you to use Air units. It doesn't force you to use Tanks. By all means kick out a hundred infantry in a massive stack and just plow straight ahead. A smart player will trounce you if you do, but that's the beauty of a game that rewards tactics over click fests, and has unit strength parity at all times.Really all I can say is give this game a shot. Considering the price point it really delivers. Just try to get past the tutorials. The game gets alot better.TL;DRHas strategic depth without tomfoolery or magic abilities, simple controls and units while remaining versatile, no clickfest! A real gem for the price."

Unfortunately there appear to be a limited number of scenarios but it's not bad overall. However I do have some difficulty recommending at even this price point simply because in many ways it is extremely simple.Now that I've had  alittle more time to fiddle with it:Pros:- A nice simple version of Risk (as I'm sure you noted, also a con). Units have the same strength but do move at different speeds. Easy to understand and really reduces things to how well you can strategically/tactically manage things.- The AI isn't that bad.- Each scenario is fairly unique (in terms of what you need to accomplish and under what constraints).- Game does an excellent job of explaining what everthing does and how you need to do it piece by piece (each of the early scenarios introduce something new and how to use it).Cons:- A nice simple version of Risk (as I'm sure you noted, also a pro). As all units have the same strength there isn't a ton of variety in what you see scenario to scenario.- There are a few minor bugs I've noticed (it seems to love to minimize when I click things).- The UI is a bit clunky and a little bit of work could have streamlined it considerably (you have to click on individual barracks/airbases/etc to generate units). Essentially you have to go to each place to build something new (although there isn't a ton of new unit generation - at least early on) which involves going to each city, finding the barracks/airbase/etc around the city, then clicking on what unit you want to build rather than from a nice menu.- It's all scenarios, I assume they run out at some point but no global conquest type thing that I've seen.I'll update it a bit more as I can accross other items of note."

Personally, I cannot speak to the validity of these claims, but I've seen this statement more than once. If true, this would call into question many of the positive reviews for this title, as it artificially inflates its appeal. I would only advise potential buyers to do their homework before handing over their money.+ Advancement of time is visually represented by the orbit of Earth, and showcases a competent day/night cycle; time can also be advanced by 12 or 24 hours at the player's whim+ Selecting from within stacks is practically implemented, in which individual units are cycled through the stack; this makes it easy to see what is selected and what will remain+ Interesting and minimalist design; overall, the presentation feels unique and aesthetically pleasing+ Soundtrack offers a selection of quirky and enjoyable tracks; lends the game a more casual feel+ Cloud cover is visible, and can often be quite disorienting; lends a small, precious facet of realism that the game otherwise lacks entirely+ Tutorial is comprehensive and helpful; more than adequate at walking the player through the nuances of gameplay- Defense bonuses feel inadequate, and are relegated only to cities, of which there are precious few- Unit variety is absolutely horrid; there is essentially one or two unit types for each arm of military (one type of infantry, one type of tank, three types of ship, two types of plane, for every faction)- Multiplayer appears underpopulated- All factions are absolutely identical; no distinctive units, advantages, or distinguishing traits, whatsoever- No terrain - or artificial - features to exploit; all terrain is essentially flat and featureless, having no bearing on movement or combat- Only deciding factor in battles is number stacks, regardless of force composition; if you have more units in your stack, you will win provided they cannot reinforce in time- No option of tactical withdrawl; once forces are committed to a battle, they automatically fight to the death, and the player is helpless after the fact- All units boast the same representitive strength; one infantry unit measures up, identically, to a tank or plane unit- Things like maneuvering, reconnaissance, logistics, etc. are all completely nonexistant- No resources to speak of- Battle mechanics are overly simplistic; on the whole, the strategy and combat is not very stimulatingLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit"

It's mixed Metacritic rating is closer to the mark.In 'War..', you control one side battling one or more enemy sides.  At your command is infantry, armored, fighters, bombers, carriers, battle fleets, transports and nukes.  And that's it.  With the exception of the nukes, everything has the same number of hit points, and other then a few minor tricks (aircraft in a battle don't take damage until all friendly land or sea units are destroyed, or transports and carriers don't do damage in naval battles), each one fights the same.   Take Risk, toss in a little Rock Paper Scissors, and you have this game.You can buy new units to help your conquest, but the interface for this is a bit unfriendly, and building up the money to reach that point can take awhile.'War' boasts some 20 odd scenarios, 3 of which make up a crash-course tutorial.   The tutorial doesn't necessarily end there however, and will constantly interrupt your battles with well meaning advice.  Incidentally, completing one part of this tutorial and advancing by a full day in game uses the same key (space bar), so if you press space too many times trying to shut the tutorial up your enemy is going to take advantage.   You CAN turn the tutorial off, but since it's trying to help you and you're obstensibly a new player, is that wise?The scenarios range from realistic (US counterinvasion of Kuwait, China vs. Taiwan) to unlikely (Britain vs. Zimbabwe over South Africa, China vs. Russia and Japan).  There's a World War scenario I didn't try, as well as Global Domination.  From YouTube videos it looks like the last is more of a sandbox game with multiple AI factions.The description boasts of the game using a spherical globe.  It does, and this is actually a pretty nice touch, but it's just not enough to save this game.  It's a little too simplistic (though a decent AI), parts of the interface (like building units) is God awful, and memorizing its peculiar combat rules (what will attack what) isn't worth it.Still, the game isn't unfixable.  Fix the interface somewhat, maybe either add some more units or make the combat a little more engaging, and make a number of more realistic scenarios (or even giving players the chance to mod in their own scenarios) and you could have a fun little game here.  Not one a wargamer can take seriously, but a way to pass a few hours.Right this second however, you can spend your gaming dollars more effectively elsewhere."

,Not Recommended,322900,20647086,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,Ronneberg,"The Gameplay:So, with  War, the Game one gets the basic RTS package, with the twist of your map being the entire earth and you having the topdown view on a sphere instead of the obligatory 2d map. Unlike many other games of this genre, War, the Game does not offer a main story-line, but instead various scenario missions - some also in multiplayer - which will reward you with a certain amount of stars when you fulfill specific extra conditions (these may vary from the time you required to the amount of money you spent etc.)Also unlike many other RTS games, this game offers no possibility of base-building, and does not give all players the same starting conditions:In the game you take control over one of the Earth's many nations, controlling their cities and armies. Cities have a certain income (I couldn't really figure out a pattern - for example Sydney with 4.6 million inhabitants generates 8 billion $/year, whilst Munich with 1.4 million inhabitants generates 16 billion $/year), so when you start with a great or a rich nation, you automatically have a headstart since your income over time and your starting army differs from other's. In multiplayer missions this leads to great imbalance (America for example has 14 starting cities (with a total income of  137.8 billion $/year)- all of them providing buildings that allow the creation of units - whilst Australia is stuck with 2  (with a total income of 16 billion $/year) ).There are five building types, which are all preset, which takes away a great amount of flexibility and individual strategy since one usually has to resign to one of the very few tactics that always seem to work out fine.In multiplayer getting to a lategame stage could get very interesting for sure, but the problem is that the game is very slow paced, resulting in the multiplayer games dragging on for hours - and without the option to save it's very hard to pull off a full game.Now in singleplayer you can for one speed up the time and also save, but this mode really suffers from it's nonexistant versatility -> most of the missions have one and only one way to be beaten, whilst in the large scheme world wars the AI always goes back to theironestrategy, making the game very monotonous.The gameplay itself also is very basic, there are seven unit types:Infantry, armor, jets, bombers, battleships, transporters and carriers. Now whilst all of these have their little twists about them, they all share the same firepower, resulting in the battles strategically devolving into 'Who can send more troops?'.Now since the fighting is based around this strategy, the game's early stage is basically building units into a massive stack and waiting for money to be able to build more units to throw onto that massive stack.Pro:Spherical mapHilarious unit stacks (that reach the moon)Amazing soundtrackContra:Monotonous (It's basically always ""CONQUER X!"")InflexibleUnbalancedHilarious unit stacks (that reach the moon)Very slow pacedNo saving in multiplayerSummary:Overall I give the game a 3.5/10 - for it offers no more than any other RTS game, has poor amount ofcontent and thus gets stale very fast in addition to it suffering from too slow gameplay."

In this early stage, the rudimentary ideas seem promising but, in several cases, are incorrectly implemented. The game also seems to be missing some features, and it loses its appeal to boredom after a short time. All in all, I can't recommend it at the time of writing. However, I do think it's a title to keep an eye on, and with updates, may well improve."

It's almost like RISK in real-time, except it includes just enough elements to keep it from being mind-numbingly boring. Despite this, it remains simple enough to be a decent way to relax.I almost see it as the conventional (Non-nuclear) version of DEFCON. Yes, there are tactical nuclear weapons, but they're not the focus of the game like nukes are in DEFCON.

If you are looking for traditional base building, resource gathering, and specialized counter units, you should look elsewhere. This game is very simple and easy to learn the basics, but difficult ot master. Only 2 ground unit types, 2 air, and 2 sea. Each is 100% equal in strength to the other, so a $3.5B Bomber will be on equal footing with a $1B infantry unit. Once a battle starts there's not really much you can do to affect the outcome other than throw more units in. The key to this game is maneuvering. If an enemy is more poweful than you, the only way to win is to find where he's exposed and use faster, more expensive units, to go around their stronger forces to capture cities and hurt their economy, or attack isolated units before their main force catches up to whittle him down. I promise every single scenario is beatable if you find the right strategy.PROSVery uniqueVery simple yet still challengingPretty good value, especially if on saleMultiplayerCONSHonestly won't be very fun until you get to the large scale scenarios, which can take a whileNo campaignMultiplayer never has anyone on itVery underrated game.

The globe design makes for an innovative and realistic experience but then again in other aspects it falls very short, such as the lack of terrain effects on movement (an obvious thing that would immediatly make the game more interesting and engaging), no artillery or long range missiles (bar for the very underwhelming nuclear bomb which isnt very nuclear). There's no reason why this game couldn't be fleshed out much more than it is. While I enjoy many of the levels, some of them seem more based on racing against the AI than actual strategy, particularly when it comes to endless stacking of units.With the Falkands mission, I was able to glitch win by simply having my fighters engage and withdraw from battle over and over until the enemy got worn down. It's a noble project no doubt but it might have been better to focus on quality over quanitity and perhaps scale things down to a more compact but more interesting theatre of war, a perfect example would have been the Ukraine crisis, with more fleshed out units, options, strategy and a better overall experience. See Vietnam 65 as a great example of a game playing to its strengths.Pros:Innovative idea, particularly having to naviate units around the curviture of theglobe makes it interestingHas 'potential'Cons:Unfocused at timesSometimes strategy takes a back seat over unit stacking or achieving what are ultimately linear objectivesThe game somehow feels unbalanced at times, normally with the AI at a distinct advantageLack of what could have been nice additional details, effects of terrain, national border violations (more geopolitics)The ally system on some levels is really basic and can take away from immersion."
,Not Recommended,322900,17528490,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,River Crab,"Simply put, the tactical and strategic depth of this game boils down to making sure you bring more units into a fight than your opponent. There is no strategy beyond that, there is no way to utilize terrain, unit composition or clever maneuvering to gain an advantage, making the game quite dull. This could change if they could introduce elements such as morale, training, military doctrine or technology to make things interesting, but I don't know if they have any plans to to that. Even Defcon, with incredibly simple units that perform exactly the same for every player, made combat far more engaging because unit position and strategy still mattered.I don't even really dislike this game, to be honest, it just feels incomplete and unsatisfying."

It doesn't give the user dozens of different options and force them to tackle complex systems. No, War is more elegant in it's execution and gives the player a limited scope, requiring them to use strategy to outthink their opponent rather than sneaking an attack by in a thousand layers of choices. Combat is abstract and requires the player to decide where to manuever and where to sacrifice.One feature I like about War is that no unit is better than another. Each adds exactly the same combat strength to a battle, but each unit has a unique ability. Tanks are fast, whereas Infantry can hunker down in defence. Fighters are some of the most powerful units, but there are a few principle zones they are limited to due to air field access. Bombers have further range, but cannot be based on carriers.All of this makes for a game that has the elegance of a game like chess or go. Highly reccomended for strategy fans."

If none of your cities are one of the random 2 or 3 out of like 30 or 40 that have aviation factories, you might as well quit because those nations that do have them defend them with every unit they have because they know how powerful planes are. It seems like whenever you play this game, every nation has access to planes except you.Also, there are no unit attack animations, the music is blaringly loud even on the lowest setting, and if you go AFK for even like 5 seconds the camera starts drifting in random directions.Granted, letting players create their own scenarios and share them over the Workshop is cool, but I'm sure it's been done before. I bought this game in the Summer Sale for like $4 and I still felt cheated."

Example-In a campaign where it is UN and allies in Asia against China I don't overly mind that most countries will just sit where they are, because alot of cities don't have recruiting facilities, but then you have India who may help immensely, Japan on the other hand just sit there building armies and won't go to help you even if your fighting the Chinese in one of there own cities.So, can be fun, can be a drag.

The operations are fun...for the first few, the rest are unrealistic, simplistic and boring.

The A.I. is nice but it get nukes WAY too fast and ends up ruining your game. No higher level thinking tactics, the most you will do is ,""Hey! That city has less people in it, I'm gonna get it now!"" or ""I'm going to buy this unit but not the other unit, because this one is cheaper and more effective"" No economy, no way to build defences (except putting a garrison that is almost useless) No way to improve cities, the diplomacy is a sham, this game is bad, it has it's pros, but it's a bad game that is not worth the money right now."

I'm a fan of fun, easy to get into grand strategy games, like Superpower 1 and 2, I have Geo-Political Simulator 2 which sucks due to every tiny fraction revolting every waking minute, and Supreme Ruler games suck because they are a great grand-strategy RTS, with lots of detail, but worst economy and military system ever: every country is magically in super-debt, and you have to super-micro-manage because AI managing your army fails every time, worse than the AI that manages CPU controlled countries (Mexico's puny army easily conquers the USA for example), and even then, the units don't respond to your orders 75% of the time. Worthless software.Now, we have WAR: THE GAME. I love the fluid feel, the graphics, the simplicity. I agree, the ""globe"" thing is a gimmick but it's an very nice gimmick. Better than the overly clunky maps in the Supreme Ruler series and even worst Hearts of Iron/Europa Universalis series which are a million times over-rated (seriously, they blow).WAR: THE GAME, is not a ""grand strategy"" game like these. It reminds me more of an very old PC game called ""COMMAND HQ"". Any fellow old school gamer will know what I mean. Or, if you like games simple like DEFCON, this is kind of similar in the simplicity. But you have to be very smart. I though that first it was easy to deceive the AI but then got my butt kicked, so it's simple, but that hides it does require some thought. There is a space-war type game out there, can't rememeber the name, but operates with the same principle: simple, but you have to think it out.I very much appreciate games like this and developers that try to go as far as they went here.The graphics are very fluid, runs great, feels smooth, and very comfortable. Nothing to over-convolute the screen and has a somewhat relaxed feel. I would be interested to see what games the developer makes going forward. No crashes, no hiccups, there is a comfortable level of quality and I like to give credit where I think it is do.The only negatives is I had a hard time figure out what was going on when I used the middle mouse button.It sped up the game, and press again and it sped up more, and each time sped up, couldn't get back to slow (bug?) and the graphics changed from color, to black and white, to fuzzy TV flurry/distortion affect without any explanation (satellite mode? Huh? What?). There should be some clear pop-up text that is visible to show you are toggling between different modes. I can easily see a person new to the game clicking that by accident and going, ""OMG! WTF DID I JUST DO! MY GUYS ARE DYING NOW?! OMG! WTF?! W T F!!!!?!?!111!!!"" :)The only other big negative is there is no ""skirmish/open-ended conquer the world mode"" I don't know if that is just a limitation to the game programming or what. I agree with what someone else said it feels mayble originally designed for an iPad or something where you do ""scenarios/levels"" and they get progressively more difficult or complex"", fortunately, and appreciatively, they branch out so there are options and that is nice.****This game would totally rock with an open-world, try to conquer it all mode.****I cannot stress this enough.UPDATE: A recent patch has added this!!!! I recommend this game even.There are custom Scenarios on Steam Workshop that let you do the same, and Scenario Editor is included now!!!I have to majorily disagree with what I consider unfair criticism of how you select multiple units.Many complain you cannot simply click/drag a box over them. Instead, you hold down a button and run the cursor over the ones you want. I actually liked this!!!! Some units were in places a drag-down box COULD NOT GRAB!!!! So instead, I can mouse over this one, that one, and way up here to THAT OTHER ONE. And it was fast, fluid, no glitches. So what gives? I can surmise some are simply use to the old style of click/drag-box from RTS games, and that is fine, I understand new things can be a bit difficult to get used to but the system this game uses --- the overly fanatical criticism just wasn't warranted. Not all new systems are good, such as in games like Supreme Commander or Sins of a Solar Empire with the super-zoom where your mouse is. I could never get used to that junk. So live and let live.Lastly: NOT A PAID REVIEWER. LOL. I think some people get so upset people like this game, and they had much higher expectations, they can't fathom it. This is an indie strategy rts war game. Not Hearts of Iron or one of those other lame games using a lame game engine. It's fairly simpler. Superpower 2 is 10x more complex than War: The Game. I bought this game and feel good about supporting a indie developer. Some of the most popular, most fun, and interesting games come from indie developers (Salvation Prophecy, Eschalon series, Avernum series, Binding of Isaac, etc.).So no, this is not some epic grand strategy masterpiece, this is a beer and pretzels game.But not a Budweiser and generic Wal-Mart pretzels game, but rather a Stella Artois (or Baltika!) and Trader Joe's Pretzels game. :D"
