76561198018603774,Recommended,322910,17976805,"Posted: 10 September, 2015",all,Eider,"This game includes two modes of chess: regicide & classic.The regicide mode of chess is classic chess with a twist, and that twist is a complex of RNG (after moving, you're given the option to use abilities to damage opponent pieces or bolster your own), game board physical barriers (a wall or giant spikey fence on a square), 40k story elements (to arms, brothers!), and limited starting pieces (e.g., a game begins with three knights instead of the entire chess compliment). Chess classic is, well, the classic mode of chess.I bought this game to play chess classic with neat looking 40k chess pieces, and I think it's a good game to play if you like chess. The AI is actually difficult to play against on higher difficulty settings. Most new to chess can probably start at intermediate. Regicide chess is an entertaining (and sometimes a RNG infuriating) bonus.If you don't like chess, then you've not got any business buying this game. If you want a cheaper chess classic game without the bells and whistles Regicide provides, there's a free chess game on steam and a pretty good Amazon app called ChessGenius. So largely buy this if you enjoy 40k or want to play chess with a twist."

So combining them should be a perfect game yes? Well, I have a few issues.The gameplay as far as how the chess board looks, and plays is great. The models look astounding, and the animations are almost perfect looking when taking opponent pieces.What I'm mad at is that 40K is about variety and costom armies and such. I bought this in early access and they only had Space Marines and Orks. You only have a few skins available for the armies, but skins like Space Wolves for your Space Marines are the exact same models as all the rest. That's a problem when an army like Space Wolves have very different features like fangs, and different ornaments for armor, and even different weapons. Instead, the models look just like the others. And I was told that they were supposed to have more races than just SMs and Orks. Love SMs, but again no variety. I want to see some Tau, and Tyranids, and maybe at least some Eldar or Imperial Guard. That hasn't happened, and it doesn't look like it will.If none of that matters to you, and you just like chess then get it. Good chess game. If you are getting this for 40K reasons, don't give your hopes up. I got it for 40K reasons, so I'm not gonna recommend it."

Long Live the King’‘Warhammer: Regicide’ is a gloriously bloody reimagining of one of the world’s oldest turn-based strategy games - Chess - set against the violent backdrop of the Warhammer:40K universe. Gorgeous visuals, tactically diverse gameplay and unapologetic violence elevate a classic board game to quite something else entirely.Campaign:Act 1 - consisting of 10 playable missions - is currently active in Early Access. Act's 2 and 3 are to follow shortly. (This section will continue to be updated)Gameplay | Graphics | Sound:Developed by ‘Hammerfall Publishing’ and released in May 2015, gameplay currently consists of two additional Modes beyond the main Campaign: 1. Classic and 2. Regicide.‘Classic’ Mode:is simply traditional ‘Chess’ but one where your game pieces come to life and engage in brutal combat during movement and capture phases, much akin to the legendary ‘BattleChess’ of yesteryear.‘Regicide’ Mode:is a different animal altogether - and while the game-board, pieces and traditional movement phases are unchanged from classic Chess - each move is subsequently followed by an ‘Initiative Phase’ where players can use a multitude of unit-and faction-specific weapons and powers (to include: Shields, Psychic Storms, Frag Grenades, Melee assaults, Life-Leeching Powers etc) to attack enemy pieces from range. This opens up a whole range of tactical gameplay options whereby players not only have to consider traditional points of focus such as ‘Protecting the King’, ‘Developing the Center’, ‘Point Values of Pieces’, ‘Combination Plays’ etc, but also contend with the realization that exposed pieces can be quickly cut down from distance. Losing your ‘Queen’ (from an uncaptureable chess position) to a barrage of ranged fire quickly reinforces the point that playing this mode as you might regular chess is suicide.The game currently includes two playable factions – Imperial Space Marine’s and Orks (each with 3 Clans/Skins) - and each army is brought to life with richly detailed 3D models, varied and visceral battle animations, and atmospheric sound, making for some of the most satisfying and gloriously bloody battle sequences in recent memory. Additionally, 360-degree rotatable cameras, adjustable height settings and 5 ‘AI Difficulty’ levels (spanning ‘Novice’ to ‘Veteran Master’) allow for a user-customized and scalable experience.  Finally, a serviceable Multiplayer component allows you to matchup with players from around the world or ‘Play a friend’ with local Hotseat functionality, and an 'XP'-based Armoury system allows players to ‘level up’ their game pieces, earn customized load-outs and bag unlockables through a progression system as well.Flaws:While I am generally loathe to criticize such a well-refined and model ‘Early Access’ experience, featuring user-centric | responsive Dev’s as well as regular updates, it should be noted for purposes of informed choice that Act's 2 and 3 of the Campaign  and 8 out of 12 (~70%) of the aforementioned Weapons | Powers, while in the works, are not active in the current build. Additionally, being restricted to only two playable factions and game boards | environments does dampen overall replayability. While much of the above will be addressed in forthcoming updates, a broader concern is the title’s overall focus on casual players – while largely ignoring both newcomers and experienced chess players. A side-by-side comparison with the standard bearer of chess titles, Ubisoft’s ‘Chessmaster’ or even the ‘Fritz Chess’ series, highlights the lack of both tutorial and learning options to wean in newer players, and progressive | varied AI | swappable chess engines, databases | analysis of classic games, strategies for openings, mid- and end-game, replay options etc that experienced players will look for to constantly improve. The inherent risk then is that without a broad userbase of enthusiastic newer players and a dedicated community of ‘pro’s’, the group in the middle will hit a ceiling and have nowhere to go.Overall, ‘WH:Regicide’ is a fantastic update of a classic game and nearly 25 years on, and after many a charlatan and imposter, we have finally found the rightful heir to the ‘BattleChess’ throne - fans of Chess, Turn-based Strategy and/or theWarhammer:40K universe, will find a lot to love here. While the lack of tutorial and continuous learning capabilities do hold back its longevity, - stunning visuals, tactically-varied gameplay, an engrossing Campaign and multiple game modes make this a title you will find yourself returning to time and again.

Tango (rindo25),"A great game with superb animation, however with only orcs and space marines it feels like it would get stale for a $15 game, just the inclusion of space marines reskined as chaos marines and given altered animations would add a bit more variety.  That is what I'd like to see, more variety.  The Warhammer universe has so many factions that could be added like the Tyranids, Necrons, Eldar, or even other chapters like the adepta sororitas, adeptus mechanicus, and adeptus custodes.8.8/10"

,Recommended,322910,15738226,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,Pariah,"This game is not Chess!It is more like the game they play on the Milenium Falcon, where Wookies tear your arms off if you lose.Good mix of concepts and rules!Nice design!Don't have to be good at Chess to be good at Regicide!If development stopped today, I would feel I'd bought a decent game for a decent price already.Thumbs down if you have never liked Chess or Warhammer, you big nerd.Sure you can compare this game to Chess, and use it to play regular BattleChess - there is even a way to make it a rather ugly looking 2D board with regular token pieces, but there are plenty of free Chess programs to choose from.The animations and camera movement and voice samples are kinda annoying if you are playing Chess, but idk why you would be playing that game (except for novelty) when you could be playing REGICIDE!!!When you are playing Regicide - all the animations and voices make it feel pretty damn epic..! (I turned the voices off, cos there are like 2 samples repeating and it drives me nuts...)I've only played a few hours of the game, and I really like it!!Regicide incorporates two different rule sets and strategies into one (awesome) new game. It does it seamlessly and in a way that makes both the Warhammer and Chess elements more fun to play!!The new rules are very well designed, and it encourages taking risks with your Chess play. You will quickly learn that, in Regicide, any Chess gambits or strategies you usually practise will no longer work! Both the different plays, Chess and initiative, are equally important if you want to win.Clever use of initiative can turn a few cowering prawns into a deadly band of fearless space marine, accompanied only by their captain, that somehow manage to stay alive long enough to brutalise everything on the gib-strewn battlefield... I mean Chess board.Being able to remove a piece without capture can lead to a lot of extra strategies - and the AI appears to take account of these and sometimes compensates. Pretty neat.A game versus the AI on Expert level lasts around 15-20 minutes. That is a challenging, but winnable level for anyone who can't remember what it is like to not know the rules of chess.Don't bother ""warming up"" with lower difficulty levels than you plan to start off with - it can feel like a slog and the step up in difficulty and thinking required per level is quite a lot, so it almost made me feel unprepared after facing only the easier difficulties first.Whether you play orcs or space marines does make a difference - there are slight advantages to both, any they require subtly different tactics to get the best out of the %'s and power-ups.There are a few things about the game software itself that let you know it is in development, a few bugs and glitches, but nothing major.If the game never had another keystroke of work done on it, I'd think I spent £10 on something that is decent enough already. It is very original and has a good, leisurely action movie kinda pace to it.You don't have to be good or bad at Chess to be good or bad at this - it's Regicide.A 3-4-player team/vs. version of this game is TOTALLY POSSIBLE!!I hope there will be more races and an army painter, perhaps.If there was some scenario or level or board design option, like with Shadowrun - I would be very happy.Man, you could even make Space Hulk like levels, or make levels around pieces movement, so that they had to travel a little to reach objectives - you could have movement puzzles, Chess puzzles (but with guns!), intiative puzzles, combinations, chasms, switches, geometry and rotation puzzles... man... I would LOVE a level editor for this game.Ok - decent game, original concept, really awesome! Hope it takes off!Reply value feels like it depends on mood phases, as there are many other multiplayer games i'd choose to play if I only had 1 hour to play... and number of friends that also play the game will probably be low as it's something you either are into, or you are not, I guess... Chess and Warhammer - Who isn't?Feels a bit like it might go the way of Gauntlet and Space Hulk, where sometimes you don't get a good public game going, because after a short while - people move on to another £10 game.I will probably be playing it - it is a good end of the day game to wind down :)Hopefully there will be different and darker coloured maps.And Chaos Marines and Demons and stuff... And Genestealers. And Harlequins."
76561198009461724,Recommended,322910,17107880,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,PayMeMoneyNow,"If you are a fan of Warhammer 40k and want the feel of Warhammer 40k, this is the game that will satisfied your urge to charge for the Emperor and Waaaarggghhh across chessboard. While the game is based upon a chessboard, the game has tactical, strategy and some luck in the gameplay.If you dream for a Dawn of War, keep dreaming......... or wait for Total War Warhammer, like me.I don't understand why people expected an Hammerfell Studio build a Dawn of War while this game not only played significantly better but also far closer to the tabletop version of the original game. I am a Dawn of War fan but I won't shy away from a innovative concept in using the Warhammer license.Before I get into the content review, i need to inform this: I am also one of those rare players who prefer playing hotseat game and this is one rare game indeed to offer hotseat multiplayer. So my personal opinion will heavily favor hotseat multiplayer rather than online multiplayer.Presentation vs Performance => 9/10Yes, this game scores very high in the presentation and performance aspect. Even though my 4 year old laptop could run relatively decent on Beautiful settings, the game keeps its awesome presentation even on low performance settings. Though removed some ambient lights, fog and special effects, it keeps the game well presented and appealing to look at. Yes, on Low the game still look great. I generally run the game on Normal and it look good, really really good. Hammerfell Team handled the Unity Engine with great care and knowledge. This game scores very high in the presentation vs performance aspect.Game/Graphic/Control Settings: 7/10Aside the realy really sparse Graphic settings available to the player, the game got a good majority of the required settings available for the player to tweak and adjust, just wish the Graphic Settings is a little more than the current version.Sound: 9/10The audio feels like Warhammer 40k, the game audio was impressively done. It feels like you are into something really epic, serious and get this feeling:===================================================================Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war.===================================================================Yeah, that sort of feel. Brutal animation fitting with brutal sound, chainsaw slashing through ork, bolter and shootas blasting each other and psychic energy turn body into goo, heaing it makes my heart feel good :)Gameplay: 8/10REGICIDE MODE: My initial thought of the Regicide mode was very close to a tabletop game( yeah, cause is CHESS!) You play like a normal chess game, but you are given 3 points each turn, you can use points to perform snap fire, tossing grenades, assault, pinned, lifesteal and many special ability to damage your foe. The game also have a RNG system, you might missed or score critical hits upon your foe and your foe can do the same. I enjoy the apsect of having special abilities, however sometimes I felt the AI can be very punishing if you halfway beating it, the AI will suddenly score multiple critical, while you suffering missed shot more frequently, thus ruining the core aspec of the game.CLASSIC MODE: Surprisingly, I spend more time playing classic mode than I played regicide mode. Simply because this mode rely on skill and tactics, and completely remove the element of RNG. You play chess but the chess piece are now Space Marines and Orks and they tear each other apart. This is where the hotseat multiplayer comes in. I play with a friend of mine who play Chess game and solitare, he was incredibly impressed by the game (yeah, he beat me 5:0). He told me he was thrilled seeing an Assault Marine (Armored Dude with Jet Packs) use chainsaw to mow down Lootas Boyz(Orks with laser gun). He ask me how to get such a game, I showed him and he bought the game in a heartbeat, remind you that he never played any of the Warhammer 40k games.Regicide mode, the core game is fun but sometimes kinda punishing to play, but the side Classic Mode is where the game stands very strongly, cause if the AI or a person beat you, cause you need more practice (Yeah, i suck compared to my pal).Aethestic: 9/10Yeah man, the sheer carnage of the game is what make Warhammer 40k Regicide so great. Nothing beats than seeing Space Marines and Orks smash each other to bits. Chainsword, Bolter, shoota, Assault Cannon, Loota Kitz, Waaarrrggghhh and For the Emperor! I know some people might find the animation repetitive after a few playthrough. I can generally enjoy this aspect and not hit the space button as I play this game in between working on my laptop and checking files or websites.Price: 10/10While certainly not the cheapest game compared to sales games. At RM 30.00 (14 USD) this game is very affordable. The graphics, the sound, the game. Is all milk and honey to me, thus I am happy to said is one hell of a game to have to play on free time and with your pal and siblings.Campaign: 7/10 Early Access (16 August 2015)This part s probably is weakest part because so many of the good aspect is offered. The campaign is about the Blood Angels investigating an unknown distress relay that led them being trap by orks. The campaign offers a simpler aspect by removing a good majority of the units and putting obstacles that get in the way.The intro before each mission pretty weak, still potriats and voice overs concerning the situation. I understand the lack of budgets to do lip sync animation, but still......You will be leading a few chess piece with abilities against overwhelming foes. You will on rely on trial and error and surpsisingly less about luck to even the odds. My strategy is to fortify/hunker down and wait for the AI to make an unavoidable mistake, and it works, a lot. Not because of the poor AI but because the set up can be easily exploited if you is first dnd formost a chess player. Snap Shot, supression and bombardment are there to force the AI to come forward to the slaughter. The campaign only become difficult in the later stages, where the above strategy is a literal must.If you never played the the early access AND had no experience in Chess than the campaign is a good place to start. But for an early access player who played and understood the gameplay, the campaign serves as the side dish of the entire game. But with Hammerfell going to update up to 3 acts and 50 missions, this side dish is definitely worth checking.The bread and butter is still the hotseat, skirmish and online multiplayer(which I not really into).Bugs: 9/10The developer is quick to fix the game. Initally I encountered animation bugs and graphical glitches, in July, the game is nearly freed of bugs and glitches, NEARLY is still the word, and has yet to be seen.Overall:8.0/10Here is some warning, if you are looking to play long hour, total time sink hardcore video game. This is not the game as you are playing chess and tactical turn based strategy game. Or if you dislike AI using international Chess playstyle, you will hate this game. Or you dislike playing hotseat game, avoid avoid avoid......... (what a pity, cause this is a truly great game)The campaign will be huge, but is not going to be flashy :(If you are a fan of Warhammer 40k or like Sci-fi games, if you like Chess with a lot of violence, if you like incredible challenge and play at busrt from time to time, this game is a simply must have.It offers a different dimension for both Chess and Warhammer 40k, and best of all, you can actually play it Hotseat with your family and friends(prefer guys or don't mind violent animation) Time to call your borther you have not been talking with.My ThoughtIs kinda sad that this game has not a lot of exposure :(Is a truly fun game even if you are not a fan of Warhammer 40k :)It has incredible replayability :D"

It could do with more graphics settings to take advantage of the PC.Audio, there's some slight bugs such as repeating audio on a devistator running across the field that could be ironed out, and the music while good can get a bit repeditive, might benefit from some more variety, across the board the audio is plenty for the title.UI, my only major gripe with the game. The UI's not very intuitive and it's quite clear in the presentation that this has long term intentions to primarily be a mobile title, controls wise it works perfectly with mouse and keyboard and touches such as keys to move the camera and multiple mouse buttons affecting camera movement are great additions.Overall a great title if you feel like playing some 40k themed chess or diving into the more tactical regicide component which adds an interesting spin to it, and the cutscenes from the campaign are enjoyable and add a bit more fluff to your experience."

For less than 15 bucks, you get a pretty neat rendition of chess, AND a re-imagined version of chess (Regicide), too.While you can't go wrong with chess in the first place, this game supplements it with some pretty brutal kill scenes, hell, watching an ork get vaporized is rewarding enough for the price tag of $14.On top of that, you have Regicide. Regicide follows by the same rules as chess, but with the twist of each piece having various attacks it can perform at different ranges across the board. So, not only can you get an instant kill by jumping on another piece on the board, but your piece can shoot up other pieces if it's within range and has a clear field of view. Again, kickarss kill scenes to be had.A campaign mode is on the way, but for now, you can play online or with a bot. There's some progress to be made yet, but as it is right now, I'm extremely satisfied with where this game is at!4/5 would praise the Emperor again."

You can play in a classic (chess) mode, or in Regicide mode, which incorporates unit abilities, skills, strengths and weaknesses. In the latter mode, it becomes like a turn-based battle from any TBS WH40K game (like Chaos Gate, etc.) but with a chess overlay (you can queen your pawns, if your king dies you lose, etc.). What this means is that you can kill enemy units even though you've already made your turn during the chess phase.From what I can see, this game holds a lot of promise and can be great fun.What I think would REALLY make it fun would be (and this may already be in the works) persistent troops (that improve with battles won), equipment and armor upgrades, maybe even some RPG elements, and perhaps some sort of overarching storyline to tie everything together. These are the things that made the Dawn of War franchise great.More variety in enemy units (other than Orks) would be nice too.For now, I'm recommending this game, and will update my review as the development progresses.7.5/10.0"

I am a massive old school Games Workshop fan.This game is chess with the added abilities of space marines and orks. You play your normal chess moves with auto kills for taking pieces through the usual methods. However, you now get three initiative points, which allow you to fight as if you are on a 40K battlefield, hunker down, throw grenades, activate shields etc.This means that the usual boring game of chess (sorry chess heads, but I grew up on computer and war games with dice), is now replaced with a much more tactical battlefield experience. However, you can always just use this game to play to standard chess rules if you want, ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....An example would be - oh no I have ended up diagonal to a Space Marine pawn, but have two Orks adjacent. They use initiative points next turn to shoot him up close once each, they pass their hit check and there is one dead space marine. The chess nerd sitting opposite cries into his chess book.At the moment we only have skirmish mode with two factions to choose against various levels of AI or human players. However, a campaign mode is planned where you can level up your pieces, and I can only assume that other factions will be added at a later date to spice things up (maybe as paid DLC though).I think this game is definately going to be worth the current asking price. However, as it is only an early access game, there is always a risk involved. As long as they add what they have promised, then I think the risk is worthwhile. I might wait for the campaign mode to be finished before playing it heavily myself though.Then it will be...For the Emperor or Waggggghhhh depending on which way I decide to swing."

Heads and organs flying, and bodies instantly exploding into bits and pieces. I saw a random spleen just lying around on the board at one point. My favorite unit is the Librarian, lifting enemies with psychic powers into the air, and then exploding into a bloody fireworks show. I think I have a problem.The game features 2 main modes, Chess and Regicide. I love chess, and I enjoy the battle chess mode immensely.The second mode, Regicide, has an XCOM-battle style with units having multiple abilities and %-chance to-hit. There is a unique kill animation for every unit against every other unit, so it keeps it fresh.POST-LAUNCH FEEDBACK:My main gripes about this game is that it takes too long. One match usually lasts 40-1 hour. Most of this is due to the slow walking animations, kill animations, ability animations (all of these are skippable by pressing spacebar, but you'll have to click spacebar 100+ times a game, which is so tedious). I'd like to see a quicker game mode with less units, maybe secondary win objectives. That'd be awesome.They are in the process of adding another race, which is good news. I think for the longevity of the multiplayer pool, they need to add more multiplayer options, game modes, things to spice it up; this game, like TotalBiscuit said, lives and dies by its multiplayer base."

I take most of my entertainment from playing against other opponents in online multiplayer.

But that is the kind of person that I am, I like the challenge of playing against another thinking human being.The XP system will eventually build up and you'll find that you're units can look cooler. The requisition system can also allow you to unlock other skins for your army, and you can gain that by just playing.If you like the warhammer theme, and the thought of playing chess with a twist against other individuals by all means it's worth the money. Also if you don't want to play with the RNG, they also have a classic chess version of the game. Keep in mind that buying a regular-decent chess board with pieces can cost more than 10 dollars. If anything else think of this as buying a chess board that can at times help search for opponents for you as well.If you are not into turn based games, I would definitely not recommend this. If you're looking for constant action, this is definitely not it either. Yes this game has some bugs and issues, however the dev team is listening and trying their best to resolve issues.

You can play Regicide, which is their version of chess or you can play normal chess with just the WH40k characters as chess pieces. The Regicide game play is actually very challenging once you learn the special abilities and traits of each race. I still think there are a few balancing issues, as Space marines in my opinion die too easily against Orcs. They could have addressed this by making the space marines more powerful but limiting their numbers. The whole feel just doesn’t seem right IMO, but this is still in early access stage, so I expect a lot to change.The UI was a bit confusing to start with, but I managed to find the exit button for it. There is no unit customisation or modding option for this game, which I think is a shame as it would be great to see units that have been customised by each player when you go on MP.I haven't played MP yet, as I prefer SP games and modding my own maps or missions, so I can't really day anything about that aspect of this game.At the time of writing there are only two Race’s, the Orc’s and the Space marines. They do however have some selection within these Race’s, but I am not sure if they have any impact on the gameplay or are just purely cosmetic? What would be good to see, is if you choose to field, let’s say the White Scar’s Chapter, then you will be allowed to field fast attack units etc. The different chapters need to reflect their different fighting styles and abilities.Would I recommend this game? Sure if you are a fan of the WH40k universe and like challenging tactical games that are turned based. This is as close as you’ll get to the table-top version of the game. The graphics aren’t out of this world, it’s more in keeping with the DOW series rather than cutting edge, but I think that this is a small development team so their resources are going to be tight. I am hoping that this game is developed further and they make available some customisation or editing tools for the community. Out of 10 I would give this a solid 7.5 with plenty of scope for improvement, but its slowly getting there."

Then this is the game for you! This game is essentially chess, and if you don't know what that is then you really need to get out more. The attraction to this pc version of the game however is the fact that the theme is warhammer 40k (which is fricken fantastic) and it also has its own twist on the rules. ""Regicide"" mode is classic chess but after a movement has been completed you are given an additional phase. In this phase you use initiative points to activate different abilities (snapshot for concentrated damage, krak grenade to lower a pieces armor value, etc) and this completely changes the strategy you need to employ, because pieces can be removed from play without being taken by other pieces. In other words, this is no longer an average game of chess. In conclusion, with the amount of time I've spent with the game I can easily recommend this to any pc gamer looking for a game with a high difficulty, or a solid version of chess.Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9/10Replayability 10/10Overall a solid 8/10"

The rank and file of pawns in chess are defined by their restriction to forward-only movement.  Making them able to fire 360 degrees means that a lot of chess-based maneuver tactics are removed, and almost any movement results in being shot to pieces.2. Pawns are for shielding and pinning, and rarely used offensively.  They are the major paticipants in the current game, a switch which I don't think works very well.3. Understanding the points and upgrades etc. is baffling me.  These need to be simplified for idiots like me.I see great potential here and look forward to seeing the game improve."

The combat animations and dialog add a unique flavor to each piece on the board, as well as each army. Kills are bloody, and satisfying, though if you wish to skip the animations of moving or the combat, just press spacebar.The online multiplayer could definitely benefit from more players though, as sometimes you can find that there are not many people on at certain times of the day. Still, you can occasionally find yourself playing against one of the Developers themselves.The Regicide Mode is played as a combination of Chess and a turn-based shooter, allowing you to kill units with both chess captures as well as unit abilities. More than once have I been saved by a unit ability in a game where defeat looked certain. Rule of thumb, Space Marines have more armor and more accurate guns, while Orks have more health and deadlier close-range attacks.The campaign consists of entirely Regicide Mode, with various objectives (and secondary ones for bonus currency and experience) to mix things up. Currency can then be used to purchase more Ork Clans or Space Marine Chapters to play as online or in Skirmish, which have different abilities in Regicide. If you don't want to wait for one of your favorite chapters, they currently cost $0.99 each.

Its very similar to Battle Chess where the rules have been modified to allow units to fight in a variety of ways rather than just regular chess movements. All your standard chess pieces are here, Space Marines and Shoota Boyz as pawns, Terminators and Nobz as Rooks etc etc. Every differing unit comes equipped with special abilities (such as frag grenades, snap shot, only in death, etc etc) and comes with multiple visceral executions that literally make you giggle with bloody joy. The first time you watch a Librarian turn a Shoota Boy into a giant pile of organs and blood, you'll probably feel the same way. Furthermore, the graphics are quite beautiful and there is some considerable detail in every model and the maps. From my time spent so far, I do wish there were more maps, though.Unfortunately, the game can get sort of repetitive unless you are a diehard Chess player. But the campaign definitely breaks up the monotony of just playing chess with modified rules. All in all, for only 14.99 (12.74 right now) this game is great value and I definitely recommend it to my Chess/Warhammer 40,000 fans out there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsdJ_1Rt8Os"

However, it needs a few more features to make it worth 13$.*my personal bias*I was in chess club as a kid, and always was excited for my churches chess nights. I have grown up around chess. Recently I have fallen in love with the Warhammer 40k universe, although I cannot play the table top game as my friends are gold fish that are terrified of anything more complex than monopoly. 40k would just spend them into a spasm.*Gameplay*Basically this is chess. The units are the same as in chess, and the movements are all the exact same as chess. And any chess captures(like moving a knight on top of a pawn) are always insta kills. HOWEVER, what sets this game apart is the second phase of your turn. There is the movement phase, and then the cool second phase. In this phase your units can do various different abilitys, like shooting, throwing frag granades, and other ablilitys. Although these are not insta kills, they do damage to a unit and overtime the health reaches 0 and that unit is as dead as any captured peice. I think I have killed more orcs by just shooting them then actually capturing them. Also, this is where the sides differ, The pawns of the Space marines have different range, health, armor, and so on than the orcs. I cannot remeber the actual numbers, but Im sure that you are capable of googling that. The AI is very competant. The novice AI will let you win, and the Veteren AI will rip you to shreds...But that isnt very impressive because computers have been good at chess for ages. The last thing that really sets this apart is the graphics, which just make the game feel much more intense.*what this game needs*As I mentioned earlier, The 2 races differ, but there are only 2 races. Orcs and Space Marines. They hinted on the forums of the offical game website that more races are to come, so I am not really holding that agaisnt them. There is no reason that the Tau, Sisters, Chaos, Eldar, and Dark Eldar cannot join.(The Imperial guard I understand because in chess you cannot have 50 pawns against a standard army, and really the IG is just a infinite amount of pawns).Also needed to be added, but very much hinted at is custom maps. Maps with walls, and custom army set up. The campaign has this, and if there is a map maker which allows for this it would really be awesome.*conclution*This is for you if you are a Warhammer 40k fan that likes chess. Because it is basically 40k themed chess. The shooting and the powers really set this apart from standard table top chess however. I personally found it really enjoyable, and if other races are added(PLEASE ADD TAU, give them range adv. and low health it would be sweet!) and a custom map maker is added in, then this game would really be a worthy addtion to any tabletop game lovers steam collection."

I love this game, but in order to give a proper and fair review, I  must issue a BIG WORD OF CAUTION! The ""regicide"" mechanics of the game throw an inspired and interesting twist on top of classic chess, but it also throws in the element of chance. In order for your soldiers to shoot, use abilities, or do any of the cool stuff added through the regicide game mode, you must do battle with your true enemy in the game. That enemy is, of course, the percentage counter. Due to the unspoken rule that percentages in a video game will always fall in favor of the computer player, this enemy is a scary one indeed. Fans of the tabletop game will already be used to even thier best plans falling apart due to poor dice rolls and this game is only different in the sense that you will have a lot more games like that than not. Playing the campaign requires a great deal of tenacity as you will find that every ork is an expert marksman while your space marines shoot like star wars storm troopers. This wouldn't be as bad if your troops were any good at CQC, but the orks gain an even larger advantage in that respect. So, the orks have more health, better CQC strengths, and the dumb luck to shoot you off the board when shooting is allegedly the only thing your marines are good at... what does that leave you with? Well nothing really. You just have to be tenacious and wait for the enemies lucky streak to run out. But once it does, all the tactics you've created by playing the same level over and over again will come to light and you'll swamp those fools! So essentially my word of caution is that you've got to be willing to accept that regicide is as much a mix of skill and luck as a poker game. The odds are stacked against you, but it's good fun all the same. If you can accept that and want one of the coolest reskins of chess to ever hit the market, this is the game for you."

,Not Recommended,322910,25104661,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,General Kass,"Edit: I break down the Ork playstyle as OP in this review. To prove my point, I played regicide Orks against Grand Master difficulty Space Marines. I won on the first try with minimum casualities. I took a screenshot and uploaded it as proof.hate to give this a negative review.The visuals are wonderful. The VAs are (as with all 40k games) excellent.However,Right off the bat, I don't think the choice of armies was the best. In terms of fluff, you have a chapter of 1000 super soldiers facing off against a force so large it's called ""The Green Tide"". You'll lose over a dozen of these prized soldiers in a single battle. I'm sure GW wanted their Space Marines instead of IG, but it really just doesn't make sense.Second, I find that (in my opinion) the Regicide Orks are overpowered compared to the Space Marines. SM have a lot of skills focusing on defense and maintaining the line, while Orks are very agressive.For example: Space Marines have abilities that...allow units in a 3x3 to shoot more accuratley, another that regains armor, and one that grants extra toughness when an enemy is nearby.Orks, on the other hand have abilities that allow them to regain health on attack, shoot twice in a single round, and they have several units that increase critical hit chances.My problem is that (assuming every hit is successful) it takes 4 snapshots from SM pawns to take down a single Ork pawn. Orks can take down an SM king (non-assault) in 2 turns (or less) through a mixture of snapshot and more dakka (Emperor help you if they get a critical). Orks are aggressive to the point where all you can really do as SM is create a wall of bodies to hide behind.In assault, Ork pawns deal 4 damage to Space Marines. SM pawns only have 8hp.Without bonuses, SM pawns deal 3 damage to Orks. Ork pawns have 12hp.Space Marines do have more armor and can hunker down better than orks, but it doesn't really matter in the campaign mode. Why doesn't armor matter?Here's an example:An SM bishop with +1 damage does 5 damage to a normal armored Ork.If an Ork has no armor, you now do 6 damage.However, that bishop can only shoot once a turn and no unit does more damage than a bishop. Regardless of whether or not an Ork has armor, under the best possible circumstances, it takes a minimum of 3 hits to kill an Ork Pawn and only 2 hits to kill a Space Marine Pawn.Additionally, Orks are oriented toward assault (melee) combat while SM have more shooty bonuses. Problem is that on an 8x8 game board, (and especially when the majority of your units can only move forward) units will more often than not end up adjacent to eachother, which is ideal for Orks. I could see this working as 3 dimensional chess (perhaps with 40k style buildings instead of just barriers), but as it stands it feels like the Space Marines are simply outgunned at every opportunity and forced to agressively use defense bonuses in the campaign.Here's a prime example because this will happen to everyone either in campaign or skirmish:You have 2 SM pawns. There is 1 Ork pawn adjacent in front of you. You have 3 initiative. Assuming you hit twice, that 12hp Ork is now down to 6hp.Now lets flip the script.You have 2 Ork pawns. There is 1 SM pawn adjacent in front of you. You have 3 initiave.Assuming you hit twice with assault, that SM is now dead.Third, the campaign can be pretty annoying. Not because of anything to do with the gameplay, but because if you ever need to restart the scenario, you can't just get back in the action. You need to watch the dialouge scroll and the primary, secondary, fail objectives again. Why yes, there is a skip button. It doesn't actually skip the dialouge and objectives though. It just makes them all load faster. You still have to sit through all of the dialouge and objectives every single time you restart a mission, despite that the objectives are conviently located on the left side of your screen. In any other game, this would be the equivelent of having an unskippable cutscene for every single combat encounter.Finally, there's cosmetics. You may notice in the promotional video on Regicide's Steam page that one of the cosmetics is an Ultramarines Captain (with a big Roman crest). Yeah. That isn't in the game. You just get a reskinned SM King. About the most advanced cosmetic in the game is either that Dark Angels terminators are bone colored or that Blood Axes have camoflauge. So why have promotional videos with content that is not in the game?So although I enjoy the game and will continue playing it, I really can't recommend it to others."

Yes, yes I know Chess is a strategy game, but the added abilities of your 'pieces' AFTER moving really add another layer on top of this classic strategy format.For example:In one of the earlier missions I had to get 1 of my 3 Assault Marines (Knights) to 'Point A' , with the secondary objective to achieve this within 5 turns. 2 Turns in I was in position to do this with a turn to spare, however, an Ork Loota (Bishop) had positioned themselves so that if I moved to the point from which I would leap to victory, the Loota would move and take me, like in normal Chess. So I was forced to re-evaluate my strategy and my life, meaning I would achieve the Primary but not the Secondary Objective of the mission.But then, during the enemy's turn, the Loota moved into the square I was planning to eventually get to! I smiled deviously, smugly moving my Assault Marine to destroy the Ork Scum, ""Stupid AI"", I chuckled to myself. Ending the turn after healing (an ability) and presenting this pinnacle of human achievement an Iron Halo (a shield ability) I ended the turn, preparing myself a triumphant Nutella Sandwich. I then proceeded to watch a Storm Boy (Knight) move next to me, and I, like a plum, watched with triumph as the Loota shot at me futiley, taking out my shield. ""I'm still alliiiive"" suddenly stopped in my throat as the chant turned to an anguished groan, as the Storm Boy, the Knight, then used his Orkish brute strength in Assault to take the exact amount of health I had left, away, with a single denying swipe.Curses.Campaign is good, the Skirmish function is also good, as you can play against AI OR Human, and you can play Space Marine v Ork, Ork v Ork or Space Marine v Space Marine.

In ""Classic"" mode, you can just play chess against the computer or another player - using your Warhammer characters. Each piece is taken rather violently with whatever weapon the character has to hand. To be honest, if you enjoy chess, this is a lot of fun.The ""Skirmish"" mode is similar, except each piece has weaponry and can take a certain amount of damage. It's not chess, but it does add a new wrinkle to the game, which makes for some interesting play.The campaign mode has a lot of playability. You progress by completing chess-type scenarios, with warhammer characters that correspond to chess pieces. They can, however, capture pieces through moving, or damage/destroy them with weaponry. The board also has barricades on it to spice things up, and there are different victory conditions which alter how you play.I'm really enjoying this game... but you probably need to have an appreciation for chess and, at the very least understand how the pieces move.If you go into this game thinking it's a regular turn-based strategy game, you may be frustrated at not being able to move your tactical marine (read: Pawn) to the left, or capture the piece in front of you... and you may be annoyed that the heavy-bolter marine (read: Bishop) can only move diagonally.If this isn't a problem for you, then this game is a great addition to the Warhammer 40k universe."

Maybe the game went out of access a bit too early.The game also has a campaign which provides several scenarios you wouldn't encounter during normal skirmishes and has some quite challenging side missions.Overall however the game is fun and if you don't like the new additions you can always play it in classic chess mode.I do recommend playing this gameI don't quite recommend buying it for over 10€, maybe wait till the price drops some more in future sales"

Sounds weird, but somehow works quite nice.WH40k Regicide can be played in two modes - chess or regicide. You should know how chess works, nothing shocking on that front, can be played vs AI or other people. The regicide mode is used in the campaign - which is basically a series of puzzles - and can also be played vs AI and other people. Regicide is your basic chess, but the pieces have special abilities and can shoot each other. Fun stuff.VISUALSFor a chess game it looks great. Pieces are detailed, the kill/capture animations are pretty fun to watch. Yes, they become boring after a while, but you can both skip them or switch them off. The only problem I had with the graphics is that the animations for melee and ranged attacks are the same. Basically each unit have only one attack animation.AUDIOBoth background music and sound effects are ok. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's perfectly sufficient.GAMEPLAYThe three campaigns take quite a while and getting all primary and secondary objectives can take a while. Chess with wh40k pieces is fine if you like chess. Regicide mode is quite fun, especially since you can play Raven Guard. Several other chapters are also unlockable. The campaign can be a little bit too much luck dependant at times, but maybe it's just me.If you like chess and wh40k definitely give this a try.

Additionally they can make an option to give the player/players a choice to end the game in a draw, also end the game in a draw IF THERE IS REALLY NOTHING TO DO TO WIN, not draw the game just because there is 1 pawn instead of a queen when the pawn actually can become a queen and change the game. Also I want them to remove health and energy bars from Classic mode since it is not necessary to have, just visually annoying in fact.Apart from this, I will recommend this game because its not broken to the point of not being playable, I've reallye enjoyed it, its chess but with awesome gameplay, but I do want more in-depth animations and gore along with more races/chapters and maybe an army customization option, if I see someone get killed with a sword I expect it to be a wound where the sword penetrated/slashed. Also I want Necrons and Tyranids, I would love to play Necron.It has still some distance to go before you can call it a ""great"" game, but for now I give it a 6/10 due to current lack of replayability.When the game is fully optimized and has 100% chess mechanics and more depth I will give it 8/10-10/10 depending on added features and tweaks."

If you don't like chess then you probably won't like 40k Regicide. Fortunately I do enjoy chess (not as much as I used to though, chess club kid here, no really) and I can't wait to play this with a friend or two.The visuals and audio are nice and hit all the right 40k notes, but otherwise aren't spectacular, the gameplay is, as previously mentioned, chess, but the light tactics gameplay (which takes place after your chess move) allows you to change up the game in ways that might pull you through if you suck at chess (chess club kid who never payed attention here, no really) which is nice, but it's not enough to make the game stop being chess.If you like to play chess then pick up this game, if you're a big fan of 40k then I'd recommend waiting for the campaign to be released in its entirety (not out yet, and the first injection will be 15 out of the 50 promised missions) because from the teasers and interviews it looks like it's going to be pretty cool. If you fall into both of these camps then you can safely grab the game now, and if you fall into neither then just give this one a miss.For what it's worth you are getting your money's worth here, and even more when the campaign releases."

I figure i'd do an RPG or something along those lines for my first review on here, but this one stood out for me for some reason. I've been playing games all my life, both board games and video games. I play everything and anything in my collection, which isn't limited to those on steam. I probably have about 20k+ games under my belt, in some form or another. I stream video games to twitch regularly, and do my own reviews on a seperate site. This isn't to brag or anything, it's more to give validity for this review in that i know at least something of what i'm talking about.When i bought the game, i figured this would be another virtual knock off of chess. There must be at least a few dozen out there that i've seen before. The only reason i picked this one up was for my love of the warhammer 40k franchise. I figured screw it, if nothing else it should have at least entertaining visuals even if it brings nothing else to the table. I was wrong. For an early access game, this is increadibly well polished. It's one of those games that ends up surprising you when you actually buy it. What i expected was a pretty form of chess. What i got was a different thing all together. It does have a standard chess mode for those of you who enjoy the normal layout and playstile that is the oldest strategic game known on earth. What i enjoy the most is the nonstandard mode, known as regicide. It brings an entirely different dimention to the game of chess. You can use many different abilities - from shielding, to healing your pieces - that make it much more indepth than the standard game of chess. It can be a bit more polished, but this is in early access so i have no doubt that overtime this game will continue to shine more than i's somewhat dreary competitors out there. For the first time in a long time, i found a game worth supporting in the early stages of development. I'm really excited to see where this game goes in the long run, and look forward to the new updates as they hit. To the developers, thank you for bringing another great game to the Warhammer 40k franchise, and i wait excited to see what new developments come to what i expected to be a game much less than what you've created.TL;DR version:A game that brings something new to the table that's reletively well polished, especially for an early access game.Rating: 9/10~Daxx Alabel"

There is already a system to calculate hit chance (with indicator in %)3. There are close combat and distant combat in place.4. Already a full fledged ability system in place for each unit type.

,Recommended,322910,15690950,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,Endothlyne,"An interesting warhammer 40K take on chess. Played through a game and won with just my king left. There is a campaign mode (currently not playable), skirmish and online modes. I imagine that later they will add more backgrounds and units. I wouldn't be surprised to see other chapters appear as DLC's after the main release as this seems to be the norm with 40K video games. There is currently no save game during a battle. Although this adds to the tension I would like some kind of save feature as a battle can last quite a few turns. The animations are great and pull no punches with graphic gore. The units are nice and detailed. I'm not so sure on the voices though as I miss the deep metalic terminator voice. Again this maybe something they will polish towards release.A great start and already very playable. I hope they bring out a ton of different pieces for this game as that will just add to the longivity.  I await with eager anticipation as to what they will add next.--------------------------------------------------------------------Update on Released Version 08/09/15I liked this game right from the start of the early release. Chess has never been so much fun. The completed campaign adds an interesting story element to the game with different primary and secondary goals for each mission. Chess fits in well with the 40K universe as both involve risk taking and sacrifice. Its very satisfying when you lure a more powerful piece into a trap. My compliments to the devs for a great game that will keep me coming back for more."

The game really rubs it in when a marine or ork gets killed.The voices are AWESOME and the Orks true to their way, are HYSTERICAL in what they say even though they are not trying to be funny.This all combines to an emotional game experience, where you really FEEL for your losses....as I found myself saying out loud to the Orks:""oh I can do that to you too!""""Oh you want some?""""I freaking hate you""""Yeah, how does that feel?""Since 1992 when I first started PC gaming, I have never done that!Man, I was really getting into it.Anyway, please remember this game is in Early Access, and will get more to it, but even now just playing Regicide is FUN!However, there are some bugs regarding multiplayer where you try to start a match and instantly die.But  despite that, its a fun addicting game, and even for people like me that are poor at chess it is so COOL to just say ""Heck with it"" and start firing weapons to make up for your lack of chess skills.However, you are constantly trying to balance your chess strategy with a Warhammer 40K Squad Strategy (Firing Weapons etc).For too much of one or the other will result in your defeat.Case in point, my last opponent was first pwning me in warfare, i.e. shooting etc, so I played chess to make him nervous and break his focus, but then he outmatched me chess wise, so I resorted to weapons.Thus, you have to be on your guard for chess moves AND Warhammer 40K squad tactics.Its an awesome combination."

As seeing the potential of what is to come, the small battle stage(s) so far are small and limited towards the type of battle that can occur. I am a long time fan of warhammer 40k, however i was never able to afford all the figurines and battle pieces to forge wars and battles against other players. This game seems to be the possible link between the worlds without the largely dedicated wallet. Now don't get me wrong going with this possible idea leads to many avenues of pay to play/ pay to acquire other armies and even seige armaments, just as long as the campaign  congratulates the players who fully play and beat it on multiple difficulties can then unlock those same purchaseble items. other such things like account player levels can open up menial things that entice the players to keep playing within reason of coarse. Then being able to create our own maps and scenarios for solo players and/or if possible groups can play vs like pvp or even pve in scenarios created. the ideas and possibilities are endless, i just see given the right tools provided by your developers and creative team we the players can then in a sense create our own game but with all the pieces you provide. i guess in a close likeness taking the table top to the pc. Now this is where the controversy would possibly come from your long time table top players, however in reality i don't see many of them complaining about wanting to go from one to the other.after all this rambling, i go on to say i believe i am not the only person who would play, invest and replay as well as invite many other friends and family to enjoy such a game. this game is still in its early stages and to see it continuely evolve to the epic possibility would be greatness only i think warhammer 40k has been waiting for and now can ascertain."

,Not Recommended,322910,23198377,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,bad_rain,"I hope i wouldnt get any hate for this, a lot of folks really enjoy this game... I tried too. I'm a sucker for all 40k related, so that was an automatic buy for me. I'm not particular fond of chess, but i know the rules. I hoped maybe Regicide will help me get into chess more. That was a mistake, because this game is a weird combination of ideas.. and i can't really say i enjoy this mixture.Main mode, so called ""Regicide"" consists of two phases. In one, you move your pieces, like in a standard chess game. Moving, capturing - the same. Next is the Intiative Phase. Now things get messy. You can use initiation points to ... shoot enemy pieces or use skills. Every piece has its HP and Armor, so if you can't capture it by standard means, you can just kill it from a distance. To add insult to injury, every action in the Initiative Phase has percentage of success. So... you can for example - miss every shot. Not mentioning that two pieces on both sides can be diffrent in stats. Assault Space Marine (Knight) will have other stats than Ork Rockteer (Knight). Which is obvious within the lore, but ... it's CHESS.Why that bothers me? You have a SYNCHRONIC game like chess, in which luck is not a factor... and you add to it - ASYNCHRONIC elements and luck-based mechanics. I does not work for me. For some people, it's a new level, a new challenge. For me it's just ridicilous.... and i really tried to like it. I forced myself to play it, but every time results are the same. Above that game feels very sluggish, probably due to two phases which every player must go through.What else? Graphics are fine, music is ok, but it feels like one track repeats all the time (maybe it's just my ears decieving me). Voice-over work is pretty decent, props for that. Overall, it's hard for me to recommend Regicide... Is it for chess players? Not really. Maybe for 40k fans? Maybe, but if you're not familiar with chess, you will feel completly lost.So, its for Wh40k fans who enjoy chess? Such a weird focus group.  I'm a 40k fanboy, i do enjoy a bit of chess... and i don't like Regicide. So we're in a pickle here."

There's minor bugs like shooting animations going in the wrong direction sometimes, and the AI turn sometimes plays all its movement and shooting animations at the same time, and will even start its movement before the animation for my last action is finished, so it's confusing to watch. The UI doesn't provide nearly as much useful information as I would like it to (e.g.: can't get a tooltip to tell me what an ability does if the ability can't be used, so I can't plan if I want to save my initiative points for the next turn or not) and the help doc has huge gaping holes in it so I can't look stuff up. The animations are nice, but snap shot and assault shouldn't use the same animation; I wanna see those terminators use their powerfists!All that said, I like it.

Absurdly stupid idea, I said.I read about, it sounded stupid, and it dropped off my radar.Much later, I bought on sale and figured if it could give me a few days of enjoyment, it'd be worth it.It's 3 weeks later, and I'm still playing it.Pros1. The campaign, by itself, will take anywhere from 40-50 hours to complete, especially if you buy Ork campaign for 99 cents.  There is something like 60 missions plus another 40 in Ork campaign.  Although hard, I really enjoyed each mission, as it plays out completely differently and is like a challenging puzzle.  I'm sure many people never finished the campaign because they got ""stuck"", but I really enjoyed figuring out how to win each one AND get the secondary objective.2.  The abilities and the chess merges very well together, once you get the hang of it.  It's not like 2 seperate games, but actually a deep strategy game that is more about positioning than piece trading like in chess.3. Overall, the flavor is excellent, and despite the ""chessboard"", it really does feel very 40k.  The animations and abilities really help a lot, and it's not like playing chess, but a turned based Warhammer 40k game.4.  Balance. Really well done, especially between the different factions of Space Marines and Orks. Each one plays differently, but none feel strictly ""better"" than the other.  SM and Orks are balanced too, although I'd say the Orks are a bit too strong, and need nerfing.Cons1.  The game's gameplay and graphics are very polished, but there are mistakes in the text.  Some objectives are just plain wrong.  In about 100 missions, there's maybe 2-3 missions with incorrectly marked objectives, so it's not too bad.2.  Slow release schedule.  Where is the 3rd faction?!3. The secondary objectives are absurdly hard.  Some of them may be nearly impossible (lose no units with 12+ units on each side?!). Still, it keeps you coming back to missions to try different things."

It has exactly what I wanted from 40k chess which is chess with kill cams but it is lacking on the races side of things. All you have is Space Marines and Orks, some Tyrannids would be nice or better yet Necrons. All i'm saying is that it gets old after a while watching the same (albiet good) animation over and over. This games only poor choice would be the inclusion of the regicide mode which really only slows the game down. Also it is not the most optimised thing to hit the shelves of 2k15 no sir. Infact it is horribly optimised, I can run SupCom on max Just Cause 2 on max but I have to run this on very low, come on hammerfell! Really?

This is still in early access, but still fun as all hell. I cant wait for the other modes to be unlocked upon later versions and then final release. There are many fun modes you will be able to play, so it goes beyond your normal gameplay and strategy of regular chess, it doesnt get boring and replay value is great!

It's also very entertaining.The difficulty can always be adjusted so it's not as daunting as real chess.I'm hooked to it. This one can keep my brain from getting rusty.There are two modes of gameplay in the game. One is strict chess (with kill animation) and another called Regicide which is loosely based on chess rules. In Regicide mode, your units can fire and use abilities and this makes it a lot easier than strict chess games. The animations and gore are well made. The game is cheap too especially when discounted.You get the Space Marine campaign with the game along with about 3 different kinds of Space Marine Chapters and two new playable Orc factions. Each one of them has some subtle differences in stats that affect gameplay. While there are micro-transcations in the game, all but two items could be unlocked by playing the game. Those that need money are the Orc campaign and an extra map. They are a dollar each. So you can sell some steam cards for them. Additional Space Marine Chapters and Orc factions can be unlocked by accumulating points from playing the game or by spending a dollar on each. Aside from the campaign you can play skirmish with the AI or online or play in hotseat mode. It supports cross-platform play too. So you get to play with those who have the game on Android and IOS.Take this game as a chess-inspired tabletop Warhammer: 40K tactical battle game.You're not making chess movement, you're tactically positioning your troopers on the battlefield.You must get this if you are starting to learn chess or want to learn chess or if you're a fan of Warhammer:40K lore.

If they make some changes I will edit my review, but for now it is what it is. And it's a pity, because I love the idea, and somehow I even like the game, and many of its features.So, why am I giving a negative review even when I like the game —and a lot—  you may ask?

Some deep tactics involved+Campaign is fun and even some missions are hard+Nice graphics+Game is really cool+Developers are really friendly, nice community also+DLC chapters can be obtained playing the game+Cross platform multiplayer-AI is sometimes a bit silly-Enemy AI cheats you with RNG hehe-Lack of information, ingame Librarium (help info) bugged, skills not well explained-Hard to find a match online because few people; sometimes more than 40' and no player found...-Multiplayer does NOT work, it's currently a crash fest, unplayable (bad servers).-They introduced an async mode, but you can't watch enemy turn in any way, so pointless-Cutscenes and intro don't have subtitles-No borderless windowed modeLong review:Game was released months ago, but is still lacking some features. Let me explain a bit. There are two modes, CLASSIC and REGICIDE. Let's talk about Regicide:Gameplay consists in two phases. First is similar to chess: you make one move and capture an enemy piece, and that is. Pieces are WH40K based, so you will see a marine killing an orc, or the opposite. Some movements doesn't have animations, and some are repetitive, but anyway it is a lot of fun. If you played Battlechess you know what I am talking about.Second phase is what makes Regicide unique: consists in a very interesting tactical turn with shoots that involve armour and chance to hit, toughness, weapon strength, each unit also have a different health, etc. So it's very fun and well designed, I must say even brilliant. Also, each piece have different skills and the faction you are using also have some. You can use them depending on your total available points to use each turn, the cost of the skills, its cooldowns, range, etc. Also, some of them affect other units, some give buffs, debuffs, area damage, shields, etc.So the system looks awesome, and indeed it is. You move one piece, and after that, use some points to use skills with some of your pieces (even the one that have just moved), shooting at enemies, etc.However, UI is a bit clunky, and the game presents an alarming lack of information. For example, you are not able to look ingame at the skills if you have used them this turn or if they are at cooldown, or if you can't use them this turn, or if you don't have line of sight, or in the main menu, etc. Example: it is your turn and you have to move. However, being a deeply tactical game you would like to know which skills you can use after the move and plan accordingly. Well, you can't do it, because some skills will not show up until you move. And even then, not every skill is shown, only the ones available. So you can't plan like 2 or 3 turns before.Of course, you can ALT+TAB and check all the information in the internet. Because the ingame Librarium (help menu) is also bugged and doesn't show almost anything properly. So be prepared to alt+tab a lot in middle of the game, each time you want to know a skill or that. And enemies doesnt show ANY skill. So when an enemy uses a skill, it says what it is, but you won't know exactly what happened. So you must alt+tab, look and search in the Librarium in official site. Same at the start of the game for EACH enemy unit, because if not, you don't know how to protect against each enemy piece.Bad part is not that. Bad part is that the forum Librarium (aka manual) is also a bit crap, because most of the information is missing: some skills say ""heal a bit amount"", but don't say HOW MUCH. Same with plenty of skills, cooldowns, damages, buffs, etc. So you will play the game mostly blind skill-wise.Each unit has also 5 attributes. And game gives no proper explanation about what are they for. Good luck trying to learn combat mechanics and discover things like ""armour is reduced each time weapon strength of the attacker is higher than armour of the defense unit"", ""each 2 armour points reduced 1 damage"", ""toughness reduce damage"" and some things like that. Because neither the game nor the manual talk about that. You just know each piece got 5 attributes, but not how they work.Also good luck searching information about line of sight and skill related ones.More things... Well, game provides experience points, skill points, pieces have some tiers... and if you check forum and that you will discover soon how they function, but game doesn't show the minimal explanation about them, so be lost for some time.You can buy DLC with money or playing time for more factions (well, mostly variations of the 2 main factions, marines and orcs), so chapters. And they are fun because some of them got different attributes and skills too (which are NOT explained unless you check the bugged librarium). However you can't buy it through steam, only ingame.Other than that, the game got some bugs, more of them minor. And not fine UI, for example when you want to learn the units, there is a hotkey that lets you use an overlay for chess pieces over them. Well, it disappears each time your turn ends AND each time a death animation happens. So you must click 3 times that hotkey at the end of each turn, and after each death animation. Ugly.CLASSIC mode is Chess with warhammer pieces.Conslusion:This is why I can't recommend this game —at full price—, for now. Game got potencial, is really fun, but the lack of information and some silly decisions added later, make this maybe doesn't worth your buy until they change some things and improve other ones. And multiplayer server looks bad, too many crashes at the start or at the middle of the game that make this game doesn't worth your money even in a big discount until its fixed (if someday it's fixed, which I start to doubt).However it is somehow fun, and chess+WH makes it a must for some guys like me. So read some information about it and maybe you can enjoy it just for the campaign even with their problems if you are a fanboy like me. But be warned if not because multiplayer does NOT work."

I really wanted to like this game, but it's just rubbish.You get shoved with a login screen each time you start the game. No, I will not register to anything, thank you. So that's multiplayer out the window, onto the campaign!Take the tutorial first, but...oh dear. The 3rd thing it asks you do is select an 'ability'. The tooltip header is ""** ABLTY_NO_NAME_SM"" and the description for this ability is ""** ABLTY_NO_DESC_SM"". This is within the 1st minute of the tutorial. This is promising, can't wait to see what else is missing. This is definitely a finished game...right? The tutorial soon after states that you can hover over enemy units for details on them. Nope, you can't, you have to click on them. Tutorial is rubbish, quit it and go to the campaign.Each campaign level starts with a couple of voice actors shouting about orks. It's unpleseant, but can be skipped. You're then presented with a chess board-like level with a few units. These units are chess pieces (pawns, bishops etc). Each level has an objective (kill the boss, for example) and a secondary objective (lose no units, for example). To achieve this, you have to actually play chess but with the addition of 'abilities' after each move. Abilities are shoot, defend, support type things and have a 'chance to hit' rating. Now, having a chess game, which is based on skill, mixed with chance, may sound like a good idea on paper, but in reality, it's crap. After you've carefully made your intelligent bishop 5-steps-ahead chess move, it's then ruined by and ork SHOOTING AT IT.You're forced to make a chess move when it's your turn, so you are forced to 'chess think' and then your pieces just get shot at afterwards. To me this mix doesn't make sense.The pace of this game is slow. Really slow. The animation is half decent upon first viewing, but gets old really fast.The UI is nice looking, but lacks in information. Want to know the attack range of any units? Nope. Want to know the exact stat changes from using abilities? Nope. Want to even know what the stats do in the first place? Nope. Want to read an ability's description at any time? Nope - only when you've met the criteria to use it at this moment can you read that.Once you've laboriously completed a level, you get XP. Yep, it's one of those games. You have to unlock stuff to get the most of the game's content. There appeared to be payable DLC content on day 1 launch, which is a big no-no in most people's books for obvious reason. Since I'm disallowed from playing multiplayer, I have little interest in this area anyway and can't tell you if it's pay to win of just cosmetics. At this stage, I don't care.There is a skirmish mode, which gives you the option to play normal chess. This is fine if you like both chess and Warhammer, plus you have £10 to spare, but did you really get a Steam account for that?"

There is a fairly sizable campaign along with skirmish mode for classic and the Regicide game modes. However there are some fairly annoying flaws which really knock it down a few points. Mainly the ""RNG"" which, as many people have seem to have noticed is quite clearly rigged. I personally missed three 95% shots in my first game and many since then along with many other seemingly statistically improbable outcomes. e.gconsistently missing 8/10 75% chance shots.Also alternate chapter skins need to be unlock through ingame points or bought, not something i personally have an issue with but i can see how it may be annoying for some to be stuck with yet another Blood Angels game as chapter choice is something that is pretty inheretly central to all Space Marine games no matter the medium. Finally the camera, this game includes limited number of death animations for piece capturing, (many of which just revolve around person X walking up to and shooting person Y) which again I have no complaint with, but very often these arn't viewable as the camera is lodged in someones torso or lump of concrete.Overall i would recommend this game but only to those with patience and preparation for being screwed by janky RNG."

,Recommended,322910,16674825,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,Gimzod,"I'm making another review, since the last one was pretty outdated considering how far this game has come.IMPORTANT: Ignore the reviews about the RNG system not working. The devs have listened the community, adjusted it in a very recent patch and it finally works: Space Marines now do have a higher chance to hit than Orks, and it now takes chances in accout. Also, they have increased the XP and Requisition gain, so that now it's easier to level up and unlock new skins. And animations CAN be skipped for everything.That being said, there's not much to say that the other reviewers didn't say before me. It's a 40K chess game with two modes: Classic and Regicide. In classic, you... play chess. Really. Chess with 40K skins, good voice acting, both movements and executions in mo-cap and gore. There's five levels of difficulty, but I suck at chess. One thing to note is that, even on highest difficulty levels, the AI might still make dumb mistakes.Regicide is the same as classic (maybe with a little more AI mistakes), but with abilities. Your turn is divided in two parts - movement, just like a normal chess turn, and initiative. In initiative, you can use skills that consume initiative points (three at the start, five max; three earned for each turn) up until you consume them all, or you can stack your points to have a wider array of options in the next or use the King's ability - an artillery barrage that damages units in a 3x3 area. Each unit has health and armour, and both defensive and offensive abilities to use once per turn for each unit (example: you can't shoot and throw a grenade with the same unit in the same turn, but you can shoot with one, make it go to ground to increase its resilience to attacks and then order another unit to use another attack). Most, if not all offensive abilities require the enemy pawn to be located within three squares of each other. On top of that, each unit has certain ""skills"" - Knights are best used in melee, Bishops in ranged, and so on and so forth. Plus, there are abilities that can be used by the player that don't belong to any unit. You start with four of them, but you can unlock more for both Space Marines and Orks as you level up and earn skill points to use in the armoury (you can still bring only four skills, but you have a wider choice). Campaign is Regicide mode with obstacles, objectives and different units each time. Pretty nice writing and voice acting, but nothing exceptional.As you level up and progress you earn Experience Points, Requisition Points and Skill Points. As I have already said, you use your Skill Points to unlock new abilities you can choose to your liking: there's a set for SM vs SM, SM vs Ork, Ork vs SM and Ork vs Ork. Requisition points are currently used to unlock new skins for both the Orks and the Space Marines (as of now Dark Angels, Space Wolves and Ultramarines for the Space Marines; Death Skull and Evil Sunz for the Orks), since you start with Blood Angels and Raven Guard for SM's and Goffs and Snakebites for Orks. Even with the new update, it still requires you quite some time to unlock a new chapter or clan. Lastly, Experience Points make you level up - but not only that. After a certain number of levels, one of your types of units will gain a visual enhancement and reach the next Tier. All units start at Tier 1 and will reach a maximum of Tier 3. These changes are purely extetical, but they're pretty nice.Something people might (probably will) not like is the fact you have to sign up to the game's forums to create a profile and play the game. Another thing is the apparent lack of players in multiplayer, which for the life of me I can't understand. I know this game isn't GTA Online, but Hell, I expect to find someone to play with. This might have been fixed, I'm not sure. The playable races are currently two and, no matter the skins, there isn't that much variety for either maps or factions. I heard new factions may be coming, though.On the plus side, the community on said forums is very welcoming. You're guaranteed to make friends there. And if you can't find online players, there are matches against the AI and Hotseat Mode for both Regicide and Classic for you to play. Not really a solution, but hey, at least you can play offline if you want. Finally, the developers are exceptional. Maybe it's the fact the community is small, I don't know, but if you have something to ask or something to report they WILL answer you sooner or later. You can even chat with them on the forums like you do with friends, they're great. It really shows they care about the game.Final vote? I'd say a 7.5-8/10. Worth the €15, considering a decent chessboard costs the same.It's a really nice game and it's really fun to play, but the lack of great variety might discourage most. Buy this if you're a hardcore fan of 40K or chess, or both. If you aren't sure, look at as many gameplays and reviews as possible, this isn't a game for everyone. You must either be sure about it, or follow one of the devs' livestreams on Twitch and hope you win one of the keys they usually hand out during those.P.S.: Don't blame the fact Dawn of War 3 or Space Marine 2 aren't still out and aren't going to be for a long time on this game. Blame it on GW on handing the 40K license to much worse developers and blame it on Company of Heroes 2 - those are (mostly) the reasons why this game doesn't have a stellar reputation and sequels to some of the best 40K games aren't out yet."

The highlight of this game (in my opinion) is seeing your pawns (Tactical Marines) march up to the opposing pieces and just shooting them in the face. Satisfying. Very, very satisfying."

It can be played campaign or skirmish (AI or human player).The campaign which can be tricky depending on difficulty, uses pre-arranged boards (some pieces missing and placed in strange starting positions) with obstacles and a generic space marine vs orc storyline.In skirmish you can play classic mode which is chess or you can play regicide mode which adds some special abilities to your pieces that can be frustrating if you're expecting a clean chess game. Took me around 2 hours to utilize these abilities more wisely and stop getting stomped so hard. Important lesson: If you are playing marines, be aware that orks have a nasty assault ability that allows them to dish out heafty damage if adjecent to your piece. In many cases I found it wiser to hang back and just pepper them with bolters (snap shot) unless they opened themselves up to stupidity and checkmate. More replayability if you are really into chess and see yourself playing more games against randoms and skirmish AI.If you dislike such games and are just looking for a 40k title, I'd ignore this game or wait till a sale. I consider myself not that grand a chess player but I love 40k and I do enjoy chess so I give it a 7/10. Would give it higher if it had different factions other than just orcs and space marines but it does the trick when the craving hits.(Edit: It is worth noting that the different chapters/orc clans have different stats in regicide mode.)"

If what you came up with doesn't look a lot like this, don't ever speak to me.Regicide is what I always wanted BattleChess to be. You play Chess, with all the pieces you already know. But in addition to moving one piece every turn, you also get to spend three action points to use the different pieces' abilities like ""snapshot"" or ""frag grenade."" So while you can still capture an enemy piece simply by moving onto it, you can also kill them by shooting them enough. Very cleverly done, and I think W40K was the perfect IP for it."

The content of the game is still severly lacking with only two playable factions and one map this makes it hard to come back to and play again.

76561198116450528,Recommended,322910,18211572,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,GamECreeD™,"TheGameSelectionz PC Review on: WARHAMMER 40K: REGICIDEAs we all know that a normal chess is by moving chess pieces in every turn after you or your opponent make the first move. In the new WARHAMMER 40000 series Regicide, I equip my knights into the midfield of battle and into reaching range of the boltguns carried by my pawns to cleanse, purge and kill the orcs.Regicide is a two in one game. First is exactly is a chess game (as for players that don't know how to play chess, don't you worry the tutorial will teach you the basic and it's easy) but, try switching all the chess pieces from the chess board a chess game usually used to Space Marines and Orks characters from Warhammer 40,000 world, awesome right?!Now.. let us talk about the modes available in Regicide shall we.Classic Mode: lets you play normal chess against the AI or other humans, and while it might not be the best chess game ever made, like Battle Chess for example, the pieces animate into entertaining miniature duels that make up for basic features.The animations itself as brutal as you will expected that has been given in the setting. While playing and watching pawns blast to pulverize each other into chunks of meat plus the gore had livens up well... boring moves.. at least until you've seen them all.Regicide Mode: This mode keeps the regular chess rules, even advanced stuff like castling and 'en passant'(in passing) captures, and adding a slice of light strategy. After each turn plays out, like in normal chess, you'll enter the initiative phase by spending points to activate special abilities. A players unit piece might gain a defensive shield, shoot at an enemy, use a psychic power, or throw a grenade. Each piece has hit points to be chipped away or reinforced it by using these abilities, but the initiative phase initially seems less decisive than in the movement phase.The last two modes will be the Skirmish and Campaign Modes:You could play as a stand-off skirmish against the AI with different difficulties or a human opponent online or hot-seat. Through a single-player campaign with a surprising amount of good narrative development by opening the story with a cut-scene. Each of its 50 levels has an intro, as the Blood Angels chapter of Space Marines strive to take Hethgar Prime back from the Orks of the Goff clan. These levels are like puzzling chess books, that will give you a set of pieces in an unusual way to let you find out as a challenged for you to take the queen without losing your own, or preventing your opponent promoting a pawn.As a 40K fan recognizes Regicide as the chess variant had been played in one of the official novels while also realizing that this game doesn’t resemble the descriptions of it, but who knows the Blood Angels sometimes got into blood-drinking frenzies and maybe eat brains. As I played the campaign to see how its story going out to be the weakest part of Regicide, but even with nicely done voice actors from the Dawn Of War series would not be enough to convince the nerds that had known more about the 40K universe. Skirmish mode had it good, whether against an AI with harder difficulties or an actual player, where it feels more like Chess+ mode.TheGameSelectionz final verdict for this game is 8/10(Great Game)."

This game doesn't really NEED key rebinding, but in 2015 I feel that is a baseline capability which should not be overlooked.Despite the small issue with the key rebinding being absent, I found little else to fault with this game and at $15 it is definitely worth your money and time.

,Recommended,322910,18105097,"Posted: 19 September, 2015",all,Starstrike,"Warhammer 40k: Regicide is chess with a few twists. The twist being the game having an action phase where you have a couple turns to do a multitude of actions. These actions can range from damaging enemy peices to increasing the defences of your own piece as well as other things.Like chess, This game will test your mind and it feels great. The gameplay is simple. Pick a piece, move it and begin action phase. If an enemy piece is within kill distance, you can instant kill that piece like in real chess. Overall, very well done mechanics and adds interesting things to a board game that I used to play as a child.Speaking of the old board game, There is a classic mode in Regicide as well. It's classic chess with a brutal look at taking pieces. The animation on the kills are nice and violent. Each kill is satisfying.As far as graphics go, The game looks pretty nice. The boards are interesting and of course, the armor on the characters looks amazing. This goes for the Space marines and the Orks. Overall, a nice game to look at as well as play.When it comes to sound, I'm a tad iffy on it. I've had a couple sounds cut out consistantly. The sound of Rook's Gattling gun seems to have an odd cutout. Music is nice but in the heat of the moment, I don't really notice the music and just want to focus on the game at hand.Overall, This game is brilliant.

VERY INTENSE IN MULTIPLAYER REGICIDE (in my opinion anyway i dont know how you might think about it). Seriously when i won my first battle in regicide it just felt so much more rewarding than i thought it was going to be. Pretty much a must-buy if you like chess like myself.after a recent patch they adjusted the AI so the hit percentages now seem like they hit and miss as they should now, and i can tell easily since the orcs have a 52% chance to hit my guys in the campaignso after that patch i say it is now 8.5/10 :) (i feel like putting decimals on things today for some reason)"

I thought I'd pick this game up, maybe convince a friend to get it, and it'd be that '40k chess thing' we'd sometimes play now and again.This game has me hooked, though - I have absolutely DEVOURED the campaign, and playing in multiplayer is a blast. I would favorably compare the Regicide mode with a good turn-based tactical game along the lines of the battles in King's Bounty or Might and Magic (though it's a chessboard, not hex tiles), though battles take significantly longer (avg. 1 hour to complete a match, I had one last night go for 2 hours)Thinking of Regicide as '40K Chess' is a completely inadequate description. If this had merely been Chess with 40K units (and there is a 'classic' mode that is just that) I wouldn't be able to recommend this title over, say, just getting a free or paid account atChess.com.But the titular 'Regicide' mode is its own unique creation and plays completely different from how you would expect a chess match to go. During each turn, there will be a Movement Phase and an Initiative Phase - the former is what you'd expect, with pieces moving and being able to capture like everything you know in standard chess.However, the following Initiave Phase allows you to spend Initiative Points:You can use abilities for ALL of your pieces, not just the one you moved. Examples include the self-explanatory 'snap shot', to melee attacks (which all units have in one form or another) to more specialized abilities such as artillery strikes, krak grenades, or Terminator shields (just to name a few)There are global player abilities you can also spend points on, such as giving a shield to any of your units, healing them, giving them buffs, cloaking them, etc. You are limited to four abilities in a match, but you can customize these from a list of around 8 or so, and they are unique to either the Space Marines or Orks.You generate 3 initiative points per turn, but can save them up as needed (a common thing in turn based tactical games), to a maximum of 5 points.If you play in a chess mindset, this can have disasterous results for you. Want to take a pawn with your queen, pinning an enemy rook for capture next turn? There is a very real possibility that all of the surrounding enemy pieces will shoot your queen into slag on their turn, so be careful.Pro +Graphics and kill animations are impressive. These are skippable if you want to speed things up in-gameSound effects are good, voice acting for units/campaign has quality similar to Dawn of War (yes, orks sound orky)Soundtrack has a solid 40K/Space Marine feel to it, glad I picked up the OST when it was on sale.Campaign is quite fun, and I enjoyed trying to get most of the secondary objectives. Think of campaign missions sort of like the 'chess puzzles' you'd see when opening up a newspaper, though in the game's Regicide mode, and often there is debris and cover strewn about that limits line of sight and impedes movement in particular ways.The multiplayer mode is very enjoyable.Neutral ~Have to register for an account in-game, and in-game friends list is separate from your steam friends list. Minor annoyance.[Note: third race is planned eventually] Only two races, choosing between various chapters only changes the colors. I'm wishing space wolves had crazy beards and wolf helmets, rather than just being a different color scheme. Devs hinted they might look at that, but no guarantees.Additional race colors require unlocking with requisition points, or buying them outright for something like $1.26. Adds a grind I didn't think was necessary. Playing through the campaign gave me enough points to unlock two colors, though. Only other way to accumulate points is with ladder matches.RNG: Most unit abilities have hit/miss probabilities, as do some offensive player abilities. You either think this is okay, or you're the guy who misses 10 shots in a row.Cons -[Note: devs have told me this is a planned feature] Currently lacks any kind of map maker or workshop support, so multiplayer match layouts are limited to the standard chessboard setup, with none of the cover or debris you'd see in the campaign. Different maps are currently just different visual environments.Does not currently seem to be any way to save or view replays, unless I missed that somewhere.[Note: devs have told me UI upgrades are planned] There is no public chat lobby, no player counts along the lines of 'x players queued in ladder' etc. If you sit there trying to find a match against a random opponent, you're currently going to be disappointed and waiting in vain. Best practice is to search out and add friends via steam groups, game forum, have friends that are interested in playing it, etc."

It's a lot of fun even though tha AI in that particular mode is a little on the easy side. But as I said before, It's battlechess with Space Marines and Orks. If that doesn't sound good to yoou then the game probably isn't worth your money either way. If that does sound like something you'd like, than this game is certainly worth your money."

There's essentially a pure chess version and then a version is more similar to bloodbowl where you can buff or have individual units take action (generally shooting).  There is enough RNG to be interesting; the better player should win most of the time.  Campaign is relatively solid, but the lack of options post campaign (allowing customized maps or anything other than a standard chess setup) kills the replayability long term, but the game is overall quite good and certainly worth it on sale."

Well, that's not so cool with the Emperor.  It's a good basis, but not enough for a full game.  So to make it perfect, the Emperor called in another old godlike figure to help.  RNGesus may have gone a little overboard, but the Emperor saw that this modified game still had more potential than the original form of chess.  In order to make it balanced out and truly a game for all the Ages, Space Marines were put in place of normal chess pieces.  The Emperor looked on his creation and saw that it was good.  And it was.  Thus Regicide was brought to mankind."
76561198017681954,Recommended,322910,20895164,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Big J,"While GW/Warhammer 40k videogames are often a bit of a chancey investment, Regicide is one example that hasn't left me disappointed at all. I was expecting 40k Battle-Chess, and indeed the Classic mode is exactly that. Regicide Mode, however, is actually a properly clever, inventive meld of chess and an Action Point system similar to the one from Space Hulk. There's even a Campaign-mode with small-scale set engagements, specific victory and defeat conditions, and a reasonably well-scripted voice-acted narrative that ties the campaign together.The movement rules come more-or-less directly from Chess, with one move per turn, but after moving your piece you can perform a number of other actions with any of your pieces, including the one you just moved. Pieces can either be 'captured' (like taking a piece in Chess - an instant kill) or damaged and killed over a series of turns or attacks by ranged or melee attacks from nearby pieces. Some pieces have less health, making them more susceptible to ranged attacks. Such attacks have a percentile chance to hit, modified by range, taking cover, aiming etc, and inflict varying amounts of damage depending on what weapon and how many points of armour your piece has.On the more critical side, the interface system is mostly good except for some irritating details - for example there's no clear way to deselect an action if you decide you'd actually rather not (although clicking on an empty tile does the trick, it's not intuitive to click forward to go back). Also, optional vanity sales and paid-for content once again defile the game industry, with this offering including a range of 'unlockable' alternate Chapter liveries, and (assuming Regicide is a moderate commercial success) will probably eventually include DLC packs for Chaos Marines and other Xenos species (at the moment it's just Orks and Space Marines). The good news is that if you play enough, you can earn enough experience points to unlock most of the vanilla content anyway, and playing daily boosts an XP multiplier - but only by 0.1x per consecutive day. Considering all you're really getting for your efforts is a custom aesthetic option, if you're like me, you'll probably just ignore these options until you happen to notice one day that you've accumulated enough XP to unlock something. On the other hand, if you're wealthy enough to throw money at games developers for what ought to be included in the retail price, I suggest you donate your wealth to me instead - it's a better use for it, plus it makes me happy and keeps me in cookies and cola.To sum up, this game will teach you the basics of chess while also showing you what happens when a Librarian explodes someone with his brain, and if you play the campaign it'll tell you an interesting war-story too. Since a decent tabletop chess-set will set you back at least £20/$30, the store price for Regicide isn't too steep - but God-o-God do game developers need to stop demanding we pay for the privilege of opening the 'options' menu."

Top of the crop is a ""Shrouding""-Ability for the Space Marines that is cheap and makes a Unit invisible for two turns, which makes it easy to capture the enemy King, since he can even walk into check!-RNG with not always obvious percentages+Chess moves and tactics are more important than fighting (a chess capture is an intsakill)-The AI apparently did not get that drift. It is as dumb as an old bootstrap on drugs. While okay in classic chess skirmishes (at least on the two hardest settings), it often sacrifices important units for a slightly better damage output --seriously, I don't know, how often I captured an enemy Rook or queen with a pawn, just because they wanted to get advantage of the higher hit chance up close--, moves into fire cover but does not care about covering a unit with other units and uses the opportunity to capture an undefended unit so rarely, that it really suprises me and messes up my strategy, when they do every once in a while.-When you counter an AI-stategy in classic, it goes mad and randomly sacrifices figures+long campaign with different objectives and side objectives for more XP and ingame-currency-stupid and boring story-dumb dialogue-some side-objectives are nearly impossible to achieve: ""the pawn on G5 has to reach H8"" on a field where the only enemies are a knight and a few pawns that are unable to go there.

In a classic game of chess every piece will have its set movement and attack pattern giving both players the idea of what and when to move and can predict how the opponent will react. In the Regicide game mode, no piece will feel redundant with the addition of the initiative phase giving different stats (e.g. health, armor, weapons damage, accuracy etc…) to each piece which give players an opportunity to react differently and engage the opponent’s pieces or protect your own (to an extent) outside of the standard rules, ultimately changing the course of the battle and making you think twice before moving or engaging an enemy piece."

Throughout the campaign you will play in this mode with a certain number of pieces scattered across the board and have to complete a primary and secondary (sometimes multiple) for experience and to move on.The game is graphically awesome for chess.Pro's:- Unique spin on Chess- If you can play Chess this adds a notch of skill (in regicide mode)- A campaign that are like small chess challanges- Unique Turn based strat- Sweet graphics and kill moves- Achievements and badgesCon's:- The roll system is flawed!! space marines are meant to shot better then orks...

,Not Recommended,322910,28940590,Posted: 2 January,all,Evangium,"Game Modes -Regular Chess - PVP or PVAIRegicide - PVP or PVAICampaign - PVAIFor a stand alone human vs. AI chess game, it's not too bad.  However the only reason you'd buy it is for the Warhammer 40k Space Marines/Orks chess pieces.  The straight chess mode isn't the best chess AI.  It's probably on par with Windows Vista Chess on medium.The Regicide mode does provide an entertaining diversion.  If you've ever played chess before, made a bad move or been outwitted by your opponent and found yourself thinking, ""Wouldn't it be cool if one of my pieces could shoot/nuke his,"" then regicide will help you live out that fantasy.  Well it will for about 5 minutes until you realise that the AI cheats and the RNG rolls hard against human players and scores criticals for itself.If you're a 40k player, then Regicide will really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.  Your space marines will shoot like they graduated from storm trooper academy a lot of the time.  They really make the whole 'Greedo shot first' scenario look totally plausible.On the Space Marine side, Hammerfall has borrowed from the lore to make 40K equivalent pieces out of regular chess pieces, but has made them too weak to really look like they are proper ports from the table top games.  On the Ork side of things, it's almost the opposite situation - too strong and accurate due to the RNG.  Personally, I think Regicide could have been improved if they'd just adapted unit abilities and rules from the codex, rather than doing their own thing.Most people will find that even though the game is easy enough to pick up, but it's a frustrating trial and error process to figure out how to best spend your initiative points to cause maximum damage for the points available.The campaign mode is a fairly straight forward progression through a series of chess puzzles played with Regicide rules and variations such as making some squares obstacles that can't be occupied.  However the requirement to complete secondary objectives to get the full amount of requisition points (used to unlock new paintjobs and abilities for your armies and the Ork campaign) really makes the campaign fall flat on its face.  It really speaks volumes to me about how poorly thought out that part of the campaign was when it became obvious in the later missions that success depended on scoring perfect rolls in the opening rounds of the match and the AI rolling badly at key points throughout.  A well designed mission shouldn't have you clicking the restart button because you missed a shot or because the enemy scored critical hits against a key piece (some of the secondaries are ""complete mission without losing your 'X' piece"").Then we get to the PVP.  Having a look around the forums confirms that the devs have pretty much abandoned the game in it's current state.  As to be expected, the player numbers have also dropped due to lack of interest or improvement for the game. At the times I play, it seems there's hardly anybody online.  I have yet to join a match or have somebody join one I host due to insufficient player numbers (though that's a guess since you're not actually shown number of players online).  I'm convinced that the server population is pretty much dead since you'd expect at least a few seal-clubbers to be lurking around if there was still some life left in the game.So in conclusion, is the game worth it?  I got my version for $5 during the Steam sale.  $5 is a fair price to pay for a single player, 40K themed chess program if that's all you want it for.  If you're looking for a game that lets you play chess against other people online, you're probably better off looking elsewhere."

You don't allocate stat points, you don't get armor, and the campaign is pretty straightforward.If those are reasons that you'd hate a game, then don't get this. As much as I'd love to have more customization via stat points and armor, it really isn't necessary. The game plays very well and it's a fun twist on chess.If you really feel like playing chess, then the standard mode is more than enough to warrant the price. The visuals and gore are great; it definitely feels like Warhammer 40k.The campaign is really run and gives you a lot of scenarios to play out while having a loose story tying them together. There are currently two campaigns, one orc and one space marine, with two and three acts respectively.Regicide mode doesn't seem completely balanced between factions, but it's still fun. You have to deal with RNG, but there is more strategy with how you use your units. I think it could do without the hit chance, but I still like it.

I generally don't mind dice rolls in games, I have no issues with XCOM for instance, but when it's combined with the deliberate nature of chess and the ability to take pieces in a single go by capturing them it becomes surprisingly infuriating. The whole point of chance in games is to force you to adapt your plans to whatever bad luck may transpire against you, but as it's still basically chess it fills extremely tactically inflexible. To put it succintly: If chess is about thinking several moves ahead, how can I do that when there is pure chance involved?I know there is a pure chess mode in the game, but the selling point is Regicide mode, after all. Maybe I just need to git gud, but having played through the first Act of the campaign it feels like there aren't any interesting consequences to bad luck, there's just restarting.Add on to that all the issues with having to sign up for an account and that the game is very poor at explaining things like the levelling system, or the range of abilities, or what those abilities actually do before you get the chance to use them..."

,Not Recommended,322910,31709901,Posted: 12 May,all,Grrizz,"Its almost a good game, I've given it several chances but ultimately there are just too many stupid decisions in the design. The main ones that keep comming up for me are:- If one team cant move during the movement phase the game is a draw, so if you corner your enemies obejective piece... draw... the AI will seemingly try to make it so it cant move to avoid loosing too. This is the biggest problem IMO.- In the campagin the hit percentages displayed are not what is actually in use, it starts off that way but as you progress it deviates, I ended up keeping track of hits and misses and it wasn't even close in the later acts (I know, I know, there is a degree of randomness but over time the results should trend toward the percentages).- When you get down to just a handful of pieces left the AI will often just run away, you can chase it all day long but you wont get anywhere (bearing in mind you cant corner it or it will be a draw...). It feels like a bug when this happens because more often when the match has clearly been won the AI will just throw the remaining pieces onto squares for you to capture so as not to drag out a already foregone conclusion.- When the AI makes a 'hail mary move' (i.e. if everything in the following round doesn't go its way the move would cripple its position) it seems to always workout for it, these dont happen too often so perhaps I've just had bad luck but given how other parts of the game work I cant help but suspect not everythings random and I've seen the same move repeated on the same map several times as if it were scripted.- If a round lasts too long (like when you are chasing down a couple of final pieces while trying not to end in a draw) the game starts lagging between each action.If they cleaned these up and some of the other less frustrating bugs I would have happily recommended it as the concept is neat, its the execution that wears thin."

If you're unfamiliar with that game, you would customize where you placed your units on your half of the board. You didn't know what you were getting into so you'd need to know how to play your style and adapt to the opponent's set-up. It was great. Looking at screens, it looked like this was possible. It's not.The chess style gameplay doesn't fit the regicide game mode for me. Not a fan of every unit being able to blow away whatever enemy unit I want in a single turn without putting my piece at risk. Having RNG deciding the hit chance in a chess game isn't very entertaining. You can just sit back and shoot the advancing enemies and win without ever moving a piece.As for classic mode, an online chess game with Warhammer skins isn't worth 14.99 USD. I can do that in Roll20 for free.I enjoyed the animations, the audio, and some of the different melee attacks. Lack of customization was a let down. That's a huge perk to making your army for tabletop. With that missing and my gripes with the game, it was an instant return.Hopefully the devs do some work, listen to their community, and add more content soon.If not, wait until this game's price is set at 4.99 USD in less than a year."

It combines chess, the slow methodical boardgame where long term planning is based on a set of simple movement rules, with a random number generating action point system which makes that long term planning impossible.Most units special abilities work about 70% of the time or less, so you are gambling everytime. However, moving units like regular chess results in a 100% kill, so there is no consistency. You will restart mission after mission because your amazing space marines refuse to hit with their 64% chances over and over again.It is also very painfully slow. If you enjoy watching two sides move about slowly while shooting (and almost always missing) at each other, then this is the game for you. There is no auto skip, so you will be mashing spacebar in order to make the seemingly interminable missions go a little bit faster.There is very little variety, each unit has a handful of animations that you will get sick to death of within an hour. There are three acts to the campaign with WAY too many missions in each. You basically replay the same battle over and over with a slight shake up in unit composition. It's dull by the end of act 1 and then you realize that you're going to do it 2 more times, but with less and less of a chance each time.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."

For instance, SM campaign, act 2, mission 8. Primary objective says ""Reach the enemy's objective zone, or eliminate enemy's Meganob."" Secondary says ""Eliminate all Ork's units."" So, I captured or killled all orks, leaving the Meganob all alone. Logically, to complete both objectives I had to eliminate him too, right? I captured him with my assault marine and you know what? The mission was complete, but the primary objective was failed. WTF??!!And one more thing. I fokking hate unskippable logos in the beginning.

It's chess, with an added round after each move to make a few attacks and wear down an enemy's HP to eliminate pieces, rather than just capturing them through chess moves. Does chess really need the addition of random chance (to hit), however?The graphics are poor for something that came out this recently and they reused assets as often as humanly possible. Most of the units look exactly the same, minus a bit of equipment swapping. Unlocking other factions gets you different colored guys.I played through Act 1 of the campaign, which mixes up victory conditions and setups enough to keep things from getting overly stale, but honestly, everything merely swung between being too easy and being annoying.Maybe worth a buy on sale if you're really into chess and Warhammer.

A shame because that's why I bought the game. The rules are simple enough and it's a neat twist on chess but the AI either cheats or the percentages shown for success do not reflect reality. It's possible I'm the most unlucky person in the world but when the AI executes a risky maneuver suddenly all of its units actions work where I can't get something with a 95% hit rate to land. The Orks, which you always play against, also have units that can attack twice where none of the Space Marines can. Considering the limited movement phase, this turns into a huge advantage for them.

Ceramite armor apparently doesnt block atleast SOME OF THE SHOOTA ROUNDS??? What happend to being the Galaxys finest warriors when the Orks can absorb bolter rounds. The animations are good sure, but they are somewhat basic and lacking in more.

I would have very much enjoyed seeing it evolve into a more plot driven strategy game, but that is in no way what it is.You may dismiss me as someone who doesn't like chess enough to justify buying this game. I suppose you would be right, but it's not that I don't like chess. I like both chess and Warhammer 40k, I just don't feel like the luxury of having the two combined (at least visually) is worth a premium. Go ahead and call me a cheapskate too, but there are free chess games available, and other Warhammer games to spend money on."

There is level advancement with experience points, achievements for the ambitious, unlocking further armies, skirmish, hotseat, live and asychchronous multiplayer - comfort for the more busy - all conveyed with a story revolving around Blood Angels chapter of the Space Marines order.Even though the story seems oftentimes cardboard cheesy, you can definitely expect to catch someWarhammer 40 000universe lore and ambience.

In regicide its like playing a crappy form of xcom except that your pieces can only move the way normal chess pieces move. The fact that in one mission I had 2 bishops and 4 pawns against only a single bishop and still had to spend a number of turns to wrangle the bishop in while he pinged away at my units just felt stupid and clunky.

It does have a different game mode called, funnily enough Regicide which is still a chess based game and so follows movement and piece taking rules but also the pieces have abilities and combat actions.ProsThe game is reasonably good to look at and is faithful to the warhammer 40k.Each piece is well fleshed out but only has a few combat animations such as attacks, kills and death animations.ConsThe game is quite limited and will generally play out the same, which got a little stale after less than two hours.RNG plays a significant part of the game.Orks have a lower chance to hit but score hits and critical hits more often, probably a cheap fix to make the AI harder.Despite being the Imperiums finest, Marines are noticeably weaker in armour, fire power and toughness. Although stats say differently.The campaign mode is lack lustre. Essentially a brief story element  then in the game. Much like Space Hulk there is little feeling of immersion or actually comprehension of what is going on.Alternative factions are behind a paywall or can be unlocked for a grind.  I believe 10K resources are needed to unlock a chapter, each Skirmish rewards around 100 so you are looking at 100 games at base Requisition gain to unlock a chapter. I don't know if they give special abilities or not.ConclusionI can only recommend this game to those who like chess, and 40K. As a title I find it lacking, like many 40K games recently and especially in the mobile market the games feel like themed cash cows. For being a release, and a game that was Early Access for sometime there are still issues with the game. In the main the game itself lacks substance, the tutorial was very basic and had some errors. The campaign, something I always want in 40K games is less of a campaign but more of an excuse to stick the two sides against each other on a lack lustre and uninteresting back drop.Unfortunately due to Games Workshops falling revenues at the moment they are throwing licenses out for games in an attempt to claw back royalties from publishers. The quality of earlier THQ and Relic games and if you go further back SSI are long forgotten."

Sadly.On paper I liked the idea of this.  Basically, chess, with a shooting phase after moving a piece.  A chess-style capture is an automatic OHKO, while attacks gradually deplete HP on a unit (or multiple units with AOE abilities).  You have three initiative points per turn (which can roll over to later turns) to have units attack or use various unique abilities.  Terminators, which stand in for rooks, can generate a protective shield, tactical marines (pawns) have grenades, Librarians (queens) can heal themselves by stealing enemy HP, etc.  There are also global player abilities.The dealbreaker for me here is that most attacks and abilities have a chance to hit, and the RNG is a steaming pile of AI-biased bantha poodoo.  Now, if you're about to tell me to ""git gud"" and ""learn2turnbasedtactics"", my response is that that is generally my line, so you KNOW it's bad.Now, I COULD soldier on regardless, but I had no real motivation to:Twenty missions into the 50-mission campaign, I have killed a lot of orks, including a weirdboy, and seized a communications relay.  I fought a warboss, but he got away, and the scout squad that got to the relay before us is dead.  There we go, summed up, by the numbers, 2/5 of the story for you. My squad is not persistent or customizable, no character has a personality, and although I'm supposedly the Blood Angels, there is nothing distinguishing me from generic space marines but one mention of the Red Thirst and the paint job.  Perhaps there's a shocking twist lurking.  I doubt it.You might say this is irrelevant, since the real draw should be multiplayer.  Maybe, but I can't find any matches, literally zero.  Now, I freely admit this may be an issue on my end.  On any computer I've owned, some games just can't seem to do this.  The problem is, most DO, and I can't be bothered to search forums and forward ports and make firewall exceptions and a lot of other stuff that generally, speaking from experience, doesn't actually help when I could instead just play something that works out of the box.Speaking of which, the last few other turn-based tactics games I played and liked that coincidentally address something I complained about above:Invisible, Inc -- no chance-to-hit whatsoever, your agents and the enemy guards are perfect shots.  All about cover and thinking ahead.The Banner Saga -- has a free, separate multiplayer mode, Factions, which has at the moment an extremely small community (probably will go up whenever TBS 2 releases and there's a new surge in interest) but at least, if there's a game to be found, it will be found.Fire Emblem (pretty much the whole franchise) -- the Random Number Goddess reappears and smirks deviously at me, but I shall know no fear, for I am fear incarnate...or perhaps because here, unit stats change over time, weapons can be switched, and different terrain exists, meaning it's actually pretty easy to get a 100% or 0% that even she wouldn't lie about.  ALSO, there's actually characters and plot worth caring about even when I want to tableflip my emulator.Hey, at least the animations are pretty cool, and from what I can tell the devs are too.  In fact, apparently they're considering removing the RNG.  Perhaps in time this review will become anachronistic.  Until then, if you want strategy play chess or something above; if you want to watch space marines stomping xenos skulls into the dirt, Dawn of War I & II and Space Marine exist.  I miss Relic..."

Overall the kill animations and finishers are a spectacle, the first 10 times... After that I found myself skipping the limited number of animations to just save myself time, maybe I'm impatient? But seriously anyone who finds the same repetitve kill sequence entertaining, after a dozen times, might actually be the perfect target audience for the game, clearly i was not.To sum up REGICIDE mode, it is chess, however while playing chess at the end of a 'movement phase' players can use abilities which impact their own, or the enemies pieces. For example using a shield on your own piece as defensive play, however the introduction of the ability to attack at distance (up to 4 tiles) and kill other pieces, TOTALLY RUINS THE GAME. I understand this steers it away from the normal rules of chess, but seriously any chess player who plays this game is going to flip out, after pieces which are perfectly SAFE, are removed from the board by some random pawn a few tiles away getting some lucky shot.That is exactly the problem with REGICDE mode, it takes the game of chess which is a game of total skill with no RNG involved. To a game of ""well I might as well just charge my pieces forward since i can just shoot the guy, and hopefully not miss"".A funny experience I had was when the enemy king shot and killed my piece, this piece just so happened to be obstructing a Rook, so the king put himself in check. However because the move phase was finished the king was stuck, so I entered my move phase with the ENEMY KING ALREADY IN CHECK! (I don't have to insult your intelligence to explain how bad that is).Overall I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you play classic mode without all the extra added BS, then you might have a fun experience for a few games, until you realise that you might as well just go and play chess online!As a whole the entire experience becomes mundane after literally a few games. You would probably get more enjoyment by spending the money to go see a movie, because this game will gather dust in your library.If you're wondering why I even bought this game, well i was curious to see just how fun it could be. It wasn't very much fun. I have been curious so YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. I feel that having chess at the core of the game, only deepens my hatred for Regicide mode as it tears apart a game I love.Like I say this is only my opinion, so if you are still compelled to waste £10, then crack on. If even one person reading this who is on the boarder lineto buy this, is swayed not to buy this game, then that's good enough for me.Becuase even if you are a hardcore fan of both games, this game is seriously just not worth your hard earned cash."

I dont know if this was just me, or maybe the game is too new. Either way its not fun by yourself- Added ""attacks during each move"" essentially detract from the game, inserting element of chance, which is exactly what chess is not. Additionally the moves are repeated, and I quickly found myself wanting to fast forward all the talk and show. This was during my first game!- Only one animation per kill, on particular unit vs particular unit!? Battle chess from 1990 did that. They could have expandedI quickly found myself playing classic mode with superimposed chess symbols over the pieces.

In the past 2 games I've destroyed their queen, in my first game I had multiple pawns, and 4 special units left against 2 space marine pawns, a rook, and a king. Think you could win that right? If you're an Ork playing against a CPU you're always going to lose because Orks are severely underpowered when it comes to initiative. I've lost almost all my special units not to movement, but through initiative phase. Where as an Ork I only kill most units through movement and not initiative. I know Orks have sh**ty aim, but this is rediculous. Orks will always miss their shots, Space Marines will always hit and win their shots. Also another bug - SQUID BOMB DOES NOT WORK - I used it, and literally nothing happened. This is a good game if it's Space Marine VS.

The game has the campaign which is like one of the two custom modes: a chessgame with obstacles. The other custom mode is just chess. point. The obstacles are fun and annoying, because you can use them in your attack or defense and sometimes they are just in the way, because your moves are restricted as in Chess. In the obstacle mode the pieces (like in Chess) have their specialities which they can use to attack you without playing chess. In this mode, succes or miss in a ranged shot, there's a lot of random luck. Anyways you can choose what to play.The fact that this was my first ""Warhammer40K"" game made me more enthousiastic for the genre. Nice Univers, much to do about. I have now more games on the subject.More important: I see positive difference in the new version (64K-patch - nov2016). The graphics are more sharp; the horrific animations are more visuable. So if you like your chess pieces to say dagadagadaga; or the more profound Imperial babble talk; the looks, restriced however to two factions and two types (Ork and Marines) - the colours you can earn or buy - are good. And I love the gruefull animations! The specs are reasonable. I play this game also on a Ipad 3, although a next gen is required and needed! Nice thing is that the game synchronizes.I would buy it, but wait ...

I'm not really into Chess, but if that's your deal, it seems to run well and play correctly. I'm not sure if the game has Chessmaster 3000 levels of AI, but the AI is good enough.I only recommend this to chess fans. Warhammer fans need not apply unless you want a Chess game, that is..."

I like playing in classic chess and bought this game solely for the voilent visual effects.Is it worth $15, it is pretty cool visually to watch and in my situation I think it was worth the money but to speak for everyone else I'd say wait until it goes on sale and just buy it to play with your friends and watch them get right into it with you whilst enjoying the gory effects they did not expect to happen."

Not only that, the game also has a stylized version of regular chess as well, giving the player the choice between slaughtering their opponents in two different ways."

If you are lacking a chess game and ever liked 40k, get this thing."

I found where I can see the controls and how to reset them, but not how to edit them. I guess I'm missing something.- The ""ding"" sound when hovering over a UI item is sometimes there, sometimes it isn't, and sometimes it's too late... there's no visual indication as to what exactly is dinging.- I see arrows under my chess pieces in the multiplayer team setup screen. I thought maybe there were other models or skins available but clicking them didn't do anything.being a UX designer myself this is the first time I play a game (past 2005 mind you) where it occured to me time and time again that they forgot to take a look at the UX.That being said, if you like Warhammer 40K and you don't really dislike chess, BUY IT! :)"

,Recommended,322910,30219326,Posted: 27 February,all,Zaxam,"Bloodly gruesome game of chess with interesting gameplay. For anyone who enjoys Chess & Warhammer 40,000.Multiplayer is a bit time comsuming, due to P1 starts turn but P2 can't see what they are doing until they finish their entire turn. Then it takes 10 seconds to a minute for P2 to start seeing what P1 did, then process repeats for P2.Friends list is basically useless, because you can't add a friend. If you do want to play with a friend you have to hope that you both connect after starting a match at the same time.Beside those two things it is an incredible game. Especially to think in the ways of chess but also shooting Orks in the face, just to spill Blood For The Blood God!"
