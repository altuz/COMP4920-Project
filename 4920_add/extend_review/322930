76561198048846286,Recommended,322930,12819638,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,floyd2406,I really love this rc sim. Please be aware that it's more a training tool than a game. Right now there is a problem with the steam version that it only gives you 4 models instead of the 30 in the standard version. I'm sure this gets patched very soon. When it does you can make sure I will purchuse the professional or ultimate version.edit:The problem was fixed (very fast) and there are now 34 models to fly with. After flying with some other planes and heli's (I really suck at those) I'm really impressed with how every plane handels. All I need now is the ultimate version. A big thank you for the developer for responding and the patch.

Aerofly RC7 is a flight simulator of RC aircraft and can also be used as a training tool for those interested in the real hobby. Aircraft range from miniature indoor helicopters to full scale, fuel-guzzling beasts, every one is easy to fly yet tough to master! The sim includes beautiful photo-realistic scenery from real locations all over the world with many different airparks to fly from, which all have their differences, my favourite being the variation in runways (gradient, length, width etc). Every one makes for a challenging flight without even considering the wind yet!The hud is great and easy to interpret, it includes vital instruments in a simple easy to read format which can all be adjusted to your liking from the dropdown menus, everything works very smoothly and everything feels like how it should feel. From the menus you can also customize each aircraft to your liking e.g. throws and whatnot. I've found nothing annoying about this sim yet but If I do I'll be sure to come back and update this review.To sum it up;Pros:Great physicsAwesome interfaceStunning photorealistic scenerySmooth running, high fps on ultra settingsEasy super simple control setup(Regular Joystick, Keyboard or RC transmitter of the simulator type)Plenty of great aircraftTrackIR compatibleVery customizable (Aircraft flight surfaces, throws etc..)Cons:None other than the cost aspect, I got the regular edition yet moved to ultimate as I noticed a few of my favourite birds were in it. Ended up costing me well over $100 all up.I guess in the end if you really are into flight in general, flight simming or RC aircraft the enjoyment had is definitely worth it. Like all flight sims especially those with payware they are not cheap, I'd honestly say this one is worth every penny, and I personally love it!A must have for any AVGeek!"

I had one a few years back but things didnt go so great and became discouraged with the hobby until i saw this. I bought the standard version  (all a beginner really needs) and thought i would need hours and hours of practicing before I got good at it.. nope! I just needed an hour to learn how to not overfly my airplane, and smoothly control things to keep from crashing. Felt confident enough to go out with my new airplane today, and was more than happy to see that what i learned with this, helped in the real world...Highly reccomend to anyone looking to get into RC flying. I use a Logitech game pad (similar to PS2) and have a DX5e Radio that i am now waiting to get the hook up for so i can use it with this program.Graphics are excellent, models behave like they will IRL.  Overall a fantastic tool!11/12 UpdateJust an update - I was out flying over the weekend, and again yesterday. I have to admit that this as a TOOL (not game) is extremely useful and helpful to those getting into the hobby.  If you are thinking of getting into the world of RC flying, try this first - its a lot easier to spend 30 bucks on a piece of training software (a real steal if you think about it) instead of the hundreds of dollars on airplanes, radios and parts that you will need if you go out with out any practice or experience.I am not sure why there are people out there griping over the views  or cost.  The view is the only one you have (unless using FPV) when you are out at the field.. this isnt a shoorter, or flying game. This is a TRAINING TOOL!As with anything, start small- build from there. As a beginner you dont need the most expensive version. Learn to fly first, learn to transfer those skills to real world and then move up.If you go into this thinking you are getting a game, or that this is like FSX or anything, you will be mistaken."

I mistakenly assumed they would have improved their flight model from Pro, but all they did was add aircraft and sceneries. I cannot detect any improvement in stall/snap/spin realism at all. Pretty good for basic stuff, and hovering/torque rolls, but stall/snap performance is MUCH too forgiving, and not at all representative of any but the most forgiving models. Realflight is MUCH MUCH better.  I have been flying RC since 1978 and I'm an 8,000 hour professional pilot (full-scale) with competition acro experience (full-scale)."

There is quite a steep learning curve to fly a RC plane while you are standing still on the ground, and this is simulated very well by aerofly. I like to try out the many different RC planes and helis. I even manage to land two or three of the planes :-)After playing around with the standard version I upgraded to the ultimate edition. Not only the learning curve is steep, but also the price."
,Recommended,322930,12911151,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,Balamir,"Well as you know there are 3 top RC simulators (RealFlight, Phoenix and Aerofly RC) in the market and this simulator is one of them. I have both RealFlight and Phoenix RC simulators and I just bought ultimate edition of Aerofly RC to compare with them.To be honest, It is very hard to compare all those 3 top rc simulators with each other, they are all good and they have all pros and cons. However,instead of comparing all those 3 games, I will try to explain my opinion about Aerofly RC.The Graphics are really good and it will probably satisfy rc sim fans.The Gameplay mechanics are really good and this simulator will really help you in real life if you are beginner. Especially, I have some of the in-game plane models in real life and game really gave me feeling that I am flying in real life. By the way, I am using Art-tech 6ch simulator transmitter which is cheap and easy to use on your computer.Sounds are good enough for you to feel realism and sucks you in the game.The aircraft details are fine and realisticThe weather is good. Especially if you fly your rc models at noon you can set up the time of the day and practice not to fly in to the sun.The wind is effective and normally in my city its rare to see weather without wind, so in the game I am using wind settings to be better rc pilot in real life.Summary:Best part; In my opinion, the hardest part of the rc plane is landing and this game will really help me to increase my skill about landingsI wish; there are some kind of missions which can add more playable options with friends, the game is a bit expansive and you really need to buy ultimate edition if you want more and you will want more... In some sceneries you can not change the views. There can be more planes, especially some electric motored planes are not enough for me because in real life I am just flying with electric motored rc planes.In conclusion: this simulator is really great and it will give you both pleasure and training for RC models. I insist that you should use simulator controller (with cable if you can) instead of xbox or other type of controller. The other simulators are also great. However, this one is enough for you if you are searching for a really good simulator which will train you for real life or just enjoy multiplayer with friends."

Great for if you are planning to purchase the real thing and want to get some practice in before your maiden flight.The quadcopter phsyics models feel well done and I have found it has helped my real world flying, especially learning the yaw orientation when doing a swooping turn."

LOLFun, fun, fun, I love this game/Sim !!The fixed photo realistic scenes look fantastic.The 4D (3D created) scenery is a bit old looking, Flightsim 2004 look to it.The full scale aircraft models are not very interesting as I can fly similar with better detail  in my Flightsim X.The cockpits in the 3D planes are poor looking.  But I did not buy it to fly in a cockpit or through 3D scenery, I bought it to fly Radio controlled models around a fixed position and this game/Sim does that very well."

I've had a lot of fun with it, and I've spent many hours of addictive play.Later on, you may want to move up to a more realistic simulator, though.  I say buy the basic version and a decent RC simulator controller like the Volantex.  If you really like playing with an RC simulator, you can later spend more money on a more realistic one like AccuRC, Phoenix or RealFlight.Heck, AccuRC even connects directly to Spektrum RC controllers at no extra cost.  If you already have a Spektrun RC controller, you might want to skip Aerofly and go directly to something like AccuRC.  Aerofly won't connect to your Spektrum RC controller unless you buy additional hardware interfaces."

If you want a diffrent view, say from behind the rc plane you have to upgrade to the pro or ultimate im not sure which. Its dosent matter anyways because ill never pay $84 or $110 dollars for such  a small ""REWARD?"". Look at games like Skyrim, you get a crap load of contect for $60.00. With this game, $30.00 is a barely a 8th of the game. Who wamts to pay $110.00 for a videogame with few features, when games like SKYRIM exist at a fraction of the cost with so much content you feel you ripped off the developer. if you like rc planes and dont care about only one view and a handfull of planes/helicopters and gliders then go for it. But if you think a videogame should have all its features in a $60.00 format considering how few the features are,  Then pass. Let it go to the bargin steam bin from ill purchases."

The base game has plenty of Planes and Helis to have fun with. But the Ultimate Edition, I kinda dont know why its that expensive. A basic RC plane costs around the same price. Anyway, lets get on with the review.Pros:Good GraphicsEasy to fly in.Healthy amount of planes, Helicoptors and Drones to fly.Good way to get into flying Radio controll.You can use your own Transmitter to fly with it.Cons:Dont bother playing if you dont have a radio controlExpensive to get more planesNot 100% realistic.game doesnt dectect all of the Spektrum Dx7 switches :(You will require a connection to your own controller.Overall the Simulator is good for what you would want. If you are wanting to get into it. Try the cheapest one and get a cheap simulator transmitter. Or something like:https://hobbyking.com/en_us/orangerx-t-six-2-4ghz-dsm2-compatible-6ch-transmitter-w-10-model-memory-and-3-pos-switch-mode-2.htmlBut you gotta get a connection for that transmitter."
