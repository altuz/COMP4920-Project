I guess the game is all right, if want to sit on the couch with a controller and play just some  hands of poker alone...Wait till a sale comes around. 8-12€ would be okay price for it."

That wouldn't be so bad, except the AI is awful at poker.  I mean really awful.  For example, the AI telegraphs the strength of their hand by their bet sizing.  Also, donk leads into you after you were the preflop aggressor mean either top or middle pair every time, so you can either bluff raise on overcards or fold if you have no equity.Overall, it's just a bs cash grab imo.  I've played a ton of poker in my day and this is hands down the computer worst poker experience i've had."

Bought it during Christmas sales, and even then was surprised how terrible it is.I had more fun withPoker Night at the InventoryandPoker Night 2, not to mention the F2PThe Four Kings Casino and Slots.There is no need to tell you about the negatives about chat or lobby or that youhave to buy chips with real money. And I don't mean chips like skins or anything like that, which is also the case, I mean CHIPS TO PLAY WITH. What the f?Did I also mention that the freaking camera is also nauseating? Also why can't I keep my cards always visible to me? That's just stupid.Shame. Real shame."

If you love poker, I think you'll like this game.Graphics/Eye Candy-Best I've seen in a poker gameMusic-Top Notch with many styles or can be set to shuffle all of themA.I.-Good I guess, Debatable really, from what I've played all of teh A.I. players have their styles, some are Fish, some only play teh nuts, and inbetween there also.Best Poker Game I've played on Steam-Yes, Hands downThe whole atmosphere really sets teh tone, as it did with Pure Pool, not enough can be said how VooFoo studios can suck you into a game.I do recommend this game, I haven't had to deal with any microtransaction some are down rating for, I'm sure if I go bust that time will come, but I don't have too much of a problem with it, you can earn chips by levelling up, so that is good, plus yuour table winnings if you come out ahead.I say give it a try, if ypu don't care for it, get a refund, but I hope for many players that way we can have some good multiplayer games."
