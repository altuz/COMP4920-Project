Pixel hunting and  cursor control seem to be the most challenging part. Many of the puzzles are based upon ideas that have been used before. Mayan math and the dreaded minesweeper are two of the most prominent. Played most of it in previous games over the years. The graphics are just as old as most off the puzzles. Not a bad game but not a game where you say "" WOW"" .  Probably a good challenging game for newbies to the genre. Hardcore adventure gamer's will find it to be tolerable. The minesweeper at the end is just a bad way to waste time in the game.  I give it a solid 5."

The graphics and music are okay, some of the puzzles are good but there are too many sliding tile puzzles, so it becomes a little repetitive and not very original.The worst part of the game is the controls though. The different cursor views confused me for a while and having to hold down the mouse button and press two different things just to do one action... pretty frustrating. Also I wish I could just use a trackpad and not have to sit at a desk while playing- it would be better off with a simpler point and click interface."

Alot like myst. puzzles not hard nor easy - just right. story excellent told gradually and captivating .  you gradually get around the island or where ever you are- not quite sure yet - dont want to say anyway for fear of spoiling. Its not one of those games that you ""get lost"" and dont know what to do next. You always no what to do mainly to get further. applicable music for the atmosphere. An allround excellent game if you are an adventure fan. not a game to miss. however do be warned this game is extremely short. more like a demo!"

However, the puzzles soon became repetitive, and the environments you could explore were very limited.  While the story was fleshed out, there wasn't really any character development, and oh, could there have been!  However, two things killed it for me:  1)  I couldn't save, and the ""checkpoints"" I would start back at if I closed the game were not clearly marked.  I had to keep the game open ovenight and during work for fear of losing progress.  2)  The price is too high for the length of the gameplay.  If you're interested in a puzzler, get it for $5-$10, not $20."

Unfortunately, the lack of a save system means that you will have to play through the entire game again to revisit those gems. (Achievement Hunters beware: one achievement is granted for completing a certain puzzle quickly, so take longer than the threshold and prepare for your full replay)The game appears to auto-save whenever the voicework kicks in... Oh, yeah, that checkmark under ""Full Audio"" is overstating things. While there is ""voice acting"" (more on that in a moment), it only occurs alongside scene transitions or via a specific kind of item. The rest is unvoiced... which I failed to notice right away, missing some helpful tips in the bottom right corner as I was experimenting with the 3D perspective.That said, the game might actually be improved by silence. The sound quality is perfectly fine, but the performances are flat, merely reading the lines aloud, so characters experiencing fear and stress come off as pleasantly calm... Bye-bye immersion... Also, I imagine that the script itself was translated into English, which would explain some of the stilted dialogue and odd syntax.I did experience some minor bugs... or, perhaps, amazing superpowers on the part of the protagonist, as he could occasionally see through solid objects or interact with items that were left two screens ago... but nothing gamebreaking.In the end, I would recommend for puzzle adventure gamers, who have not already been turned off by any of the above. The puzzles were fun, the graphics were fine, and the story was occasionally intriguing, though it does end on a bit of sequel bait. Wait for a sale though..."

It's one of those games where you/the main character is alone and not aware of why he is in this very place.So why no recommendation? Simple: The developers messed up he interface in the worst of ways. So (as usual in point-n-click games) you move the mouse around and see some icon that signifies how there might be something interesting or necessary. To make it short: You need to be most concentrated to actually interact with items: While the mouse pointer stays where it is supposed to be the interface wobbles around. Yes, indeed: You point to the ""pick up"" icon and without any regularity it switches on/off and almost every time even other icons suddenly are activated (e.g. ""interact"" which looks like ""look at"") without your mouse pointer hovering above it. To get rid of this you have to move the mouse around untill by accident the desired icon is highlightened. Absolutely annoying.I still remember ""Syberia II"", a really nice point-n-click game, though many disliked the not-funny not-classic-adventure style and wonder how they came up with such a buggy interface."

Here we go.***5 minutes in I realized that 25 years of game interface technology was being discarded in this game, opting instead for a non-intuitive, nay, counter intuitive interface that make you wonder why the game designers made you jump through hoops just to stand up. ****I wrote this because a bug in the game prevented me from having the game cursor - so no hotspots were activated for me. I literally had to click on every inch of screen to find the next steps.****This game isn't something you would consider 'playable' as the game interface is horridly designed I assume, so that you would feel defeated before you start.*****I did manage to get a cursor with some work. Once that happened, I rather enjoyed the puzzles except for the last. The final puzzle - EVEN IF YOU MAKE NO MISTAKES takes 20 minutes minimum of careful mouseclicks. If you make any mistakes at all, it could take 20-30 hours to finish the last puzzle. I'm not joking.****I'd take a pass on this title, and play The Talos Principle instead. This isn't for you, this is for the guy who designed it. He decided that gameplay is stupid and you are stupid. Designed to be frustrating and make you feel like you are wasting your time- so don't. Don't waste your time on this title. I don't want to play a game designed to make me fee frustrated just for playing it, let alone spending money on it.*****Buy it if you wish, but personally, it's just as enjoyable watcing it on youtube."

It also seems to be buggy and has a 10 minute time limit after which actions that you do don't work right (without any warning). There appears to be no way to skip this disaster of a puzzle and proceed.  I did post a question about this on the forum last month with 0 responses. So I cannot finish the game, and for those interested in achievements - unless you complete this you cannot get more than 50%. I can only say boo - two thumbs down, I would have liked to have completed this game. Don't buy if you like achievements."

Final puzzle is a slightly more colorful version of microsoft minesweeper, which was fun enough to play while pretending to be working on our office Windows NT 3.5 machine in 1994, but let's face it, most of us very easily amused back than (think typing 707 on a calculator in math class and than passing it to a friend holding the thing upside down)"

Only one vaguely interesting puzzle (the one involving the monkey statues) the rest all things we've seen before.  The inventory puzzles are strictly of the understand what you've done after you've done it variety.  And the story is...poorly implemented.On the positive side, the final scene leaves things a bit open to interpretation, so a sequel might be better than this opening act.  Also, like all Microids games it is very pretty, but there are really only three scenes:  the facility, the island, and the temple.Also, the achievements don't all seem to be working for me since I did find all the testaments, but the testament achievement says I found zero."

,Not Recommended,322970,16091174,"Posted: 30 May, 2015",all,saeraphas,"I really wanted to like this Subject 13 because I'm generally a fan of puzzle-solving games, but I feel like there are too many rough edges here to ever settle in and enjoy it fully.I got off to a rough start because the controls are not intuitive. The game's launcher has an option to customize controls, which is misleading because it's mouse-only. As a result, I spent the first several minutes mashing buttons on my keyboard and becoming frustrated because nothing seemed to be working. Further frustrating is that it's possible to accidentally click through the tooltip that tells you to how to navigate the controls. My first ten minutes in-game were completely wasted. I started over twice before understanding that holding down left-click over some items on-screen opens a wheel menu at the cursor.A lot of the information you'll need to complete the puzzles isn't visible in the default camera view, so you'll have to contort your view somewhat in order to find the key items you need. The camera controls are only unlocked sometimes, though, which leads to frustratingly inconsistent controls. Mousewheel down is a particularly frustrating example - sometimes it means ""zoom out"", sometimes it means ""leave this area"". Eventually you'll figure out how to work with the controls, but even after several hours in-game it doesn't feel familiar.Probably half of the key items you'll pick up present their own puzzles that you have to solve before you can use them. If you spend enough time examining each object (and checking the help/tips) you can probably figure out how to use it. Prepare to spend a lot of time figuring out what obscured detail is preventing you from taking an intuitive path to your goal, though. Have you ever had to use a socket wrench on a ladder before? I haven't. But your character will, and not for any good reason either. The game wants you to make twisting motions with your cursor to turn keys, unfasten bolts or open lids, but these motions feel out of place with the point-and-click style of the rest of the game, and they frequently don't work correctly on the first attempt.The puzzles cover a pretty wide range of difficulties, from 4x4 sliding-tile-puzzle to Mayan kind-of algebra, but for the most part the game has a help/tips system that gives you a new clue every few minutes so that you don't get stuck. It'll also let you skip a puzzle once, so that if you get completely stuck the game's not ruined. You can only use it once, though. Unfortunately, some of the puzzles don't make any sense, and the only way I was able to get past those was either by brute force (combination locks) or by looking up the mechanics or solution, both of which really spoil the fun.Some of the mechanics are downright bad. There's more than one instance where you'll have to scour the screen for a nearly invisible button or item, and you won't be able to progress until you find it.At some point in the game there's a large cylindrical minesweeper-type puzzle that I just can't get past. I've uncovered every non-trap square and marked every trap square, but I don't know what's missing to trigger the completion and after three attempts on just that puzzle I'm not sure that I care enough to try again.I don't know whether I'll ever finish this game. I feel like I gave it a good effort, and if I'd been able to finish it I think it might have been a good buy at $12.99. As-is, I just feel frustrated."

Sadly, I found this game quite boring to play.  The biggest issue for me was the severe limitation of movement.    It is basically a pixel-hunting point-and-click adventure, reminiscent of the ""Escape""-style games.  Each chapter is basically a room you have to escape from.  The voice acting is terrible, and the journal entries you find along the way did little to make me care about the characters or the facility.  Compare that to Portal 2, where the humor and the post-apocalyptic story kept you going at a fast pace.  This game is glacial. If you miss a tiny little clue, you are basically stuck, and can't continue or do anything else until you find it.  This game might be worth $5, but I paid $13 and I felt robbed.  Poor story, boring puzzles, weak characters, and almost no freedom of movement."

In chapter 3, I had many objects in my inventory, and I had a pretty good idea of what needed to happen to make them work with each other, but the sequence the game wants you to do it in is a bit maddening. Many times I would be clicking on the correct sequences, and because of poor visual queues and awkward ways you have to rotate or manipulate objects, I would have to find the solutions by clicking randomly to get the object to perform correctly. The ""logic"" of puzzles also wasn't always clear to follow. The game does have an interesting story, compelling mysteries and an interesting setting. I would recommend it, but does come with design flaws that take away from what could have been a great ""point and click adventure"" experience."

They are on the difficult side and reward players for perserverance. The last puzzle is an absolute doozy but even though it took me ages I still felt satisfied. The fact that you need to spin the camera to find hidden latches or buttons is great for a traditional adventure game but there are some rough patches in the game that would have benefited from some ironing out. The voice acting sometimes matches the written text but often not. The graphics are very beautiful but again could be refined somewhat. It's not an epicly long game but for the length it did have and the devious puzzles thrown in it did feel just right.
