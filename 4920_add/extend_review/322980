,Recommended,322980,12445169,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,gel,"I played the android version of this game. I bought it to see what it was like on PC.The good parts of the game would be - having lot of levels, different gods to choose from (about 20) and some form of strategical placement when it comes to using your spells. By that, I mean that you don't just simply spam the spells as much as you want. You have to make the humans like you by casting ""good"" spells in order to gain worship, which is the resource used to cast other, more offensive spells for destroying their tower. Basically, you have to find a balance between appeasing the humans and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off by destroying their tower.  It's an interesting combination which makes it unique and offers some depth in the otherwise very standard affair of stopping bad guys from getting from one end to the other.Now for the bad. The game is an android port. It certainly looks like one and plays like one. The menus on 1920x1080 look pixelated and stretched while the models and textures are pretty lackluster. It's not ugly, but it's not pretty either. The game also starts getting pretty hectic later on, where the difficulty wasn't too well thought out and instead of thinking about enemy unit combinations and synergy, they basically throw in as many of the big units as possible to give some semblance of difficulty. After a while, the game also starts to feel like a grind, but what do you expect from a tower defence game?Problems aside, this game is pretty good for how much it costs, especially with the sale. It's a solid defence game with some nice depth to keep you interested. It's going to feel like a grind at times but if you don't mind it too much, the game is pretty fun."

Check out my podcast Steam on the Cheap where I review cheap games and let you know if they are worth your money.https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2Gods vs Humans is a quirky tower defence style game that does not reinvent the genre but does add a neat twist.Here is my video review and keep reading for a more indepth review here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhq07wcPw8&feature=youtu.beFirst off this game has a lot of depth for a $7 dollar game. The idea is simple. You are one of 20 different gods trying to stop the humans from building a tower to destroy you. Through the levels you will play as Egyptian, Greek, Nordic, and Japanese gods each with unique settings, tower and powers. (Nice rhyme i know)Each god has their specific set of powers as well as commons ones shared. You will use your powers to destroy pillars to bring down a section of the temple until the whole temple collapses. If the humans reach you then boom your dead and they are now gods. By the way you don’t want that to happen.The difficulty ramps up because following old mythology you get you power from the worship of humans so if you harm them while destroying the tower they become angry with you and severely limits your power. Also there are evil priests that try to convert the humans and supervisors you have to keep happy or else the workers will repair the pillars faster than you can destroy them. There are also protectors on some floors that will counteract certain spells meaning you can use fire on a level or maybe lighting on a different one.So far I am finding this game to be very challenging and one that I can't stop playing because I want to see what they are going to throw at me next.As of now I am recommending this game even more so because it is half off so it is definitely worth it.I will update this review if I find anything that changes my mind or find things that are cool and you should not about. Don’t forget to click yes if you found this review helpful Thanks :)Update 5 hours in and still enjoying this game. It does get pretty hard so prepare to get frustrated here and there :)"

The same stuff level after level. However for my young nieces and nephews the game interface is too convoluted.If you have nothing to live for and nothing to do with your time, then maybe this game is for you."

,Recommended,322980,12458132,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,Dad's Gaming Addiction,"An interesting tower defense-esque game.  Essentially, you're a god who's trying to prevent the humans from reaching you via a tower they are building.  It'll be up to you to keep them happy and knock down their tower at the same time.  Anger them, and your ""worship"" points trickle in much more slowly (preventing you from using god powers as often).  They also work faster when they're angry, which is bad.  There's a lot here for $3.50 (on sale until Oct 17) including 20 gods across 96 levels.  Worth checking out at the very least.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3itB_jr-Zkchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G0r0VMn5CY"

,Not Recommended,322980,15193359,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,Walnut,"I thought that maybe this would be a game to spend time playing while other things download. The problem is, it's way to repetitive. I got bored about halfway through the tutorial, but I pressed on, because I thought it might get better from there. It did not. The interface is rather sloppily put together, with the numbers on the abilities not actually working, and just having an overall feel of being designed solely for mobile and then simply released as a PC game. Even the sale price I bought it at is too much to be asked for. In my opinion, the developers should either have spent a lot more time on the PC interface, or just stuck to mobile-exclusive."

,Not Recommended,322980,13263601,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,LeBoost,"This is by far one of the most repetitive-boring games I've ever played. I bought this game expecting a fun strategy game to waste time with, but instead I lost out on $5 that I could've used to buy something else. First of all, this game is extremely repetitive; the levels never change, there is absolutely no deviation from the basic formula of winning each level (spam on the first floor: win game.) Second of all, this game is not at all fun. There is nothing stimulating in it; there is no change, nothing interesting, and is just not worth it. I say this warning with all there is inside me: DONT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT BUY IT ON SALE, DONT EVEN LOOK AT IT, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE. Spend the current price to charity, not this piece of garbage procieved as a game, you'll get a lot more out of it."

The game itself doesn't have much charm other than the artisitic cute design and it feels to be mostly for casual gamers and/or kids.The levels are bit repetitive, I don't really see the appeal to different 'gods' from get go, and the humor aspect also wears out pretty fast after first one or two rounds.It's also way too easy."
