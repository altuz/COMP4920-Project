I'm sad.I really wish I could recommend this game. Sadly, I cannot.For a few months now, this game has been unplayable.Not in the ""this is really glitchy"" kind of sense. Not even in the ""the latest patch makes X and Y annoying"". No, it is much worse:this game doesn't start at all.After selecting whether to play it with a keyboard (""space"") or controller (""A""), the screen goes black and that's it. The rest is silence.Trying to play it with all of the following has resulted in failure:an XBOX 360 Controller;a keyboard;a Steam Controller andmy fists.I am waiting for a response from the developers. Until this outrageous issue is fixed, this review is staying on depths of the ""negative"" sphere.If you can make the game work, however, it is a ton of fun. Good luck with that, though.(I wouldn't be writing this review if I was the only one with the issue.)"

76561198107659623,Recommended,323040,21189079,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Topdown,"Important! Laserlifecannotbe played without a controller. Its not that it hasbadkeyboard compatibility, it hasnone.If you don't have a controller, Laserlife is 'Intel RealSense' compatible. See website for moredetails:http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.htmlLike any game on Steam, Laserlife has its ups and downs. Luckily the ups far outnumber the downs.Laserlife has a story at its heart, as in the description, it is the story of a dead astronaut from childhood to death. And its a good one.Telling a story without any words* is always a challenge, relying upon visuals**, sound and imagination. And let me tell you, Laserlife has all of the above. It delivers a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling with brilliant creativity that really does make you stop and think. Take it from me, I'm no sentimentalist.There are three ""Acts""; Childhood, Adulthood and Death.Each Act has 4 levels, each leading to a different milestone in memory.Each level in the game is made up of 4 phases and is set up as a kind of twin-stick runner, utilising 2 lasers.The 'Collection' phase. Using the lasers, collect memory fragments. Numbers increase and decrease through levels, typically 150-200 fragments per run.The 'Harmonising' phase. This time, the lasers must simply impact the fragments. Unlike the previous phase, lasers cannot move across the middle of the screenThe 'Warp' stage. This is somewhat easier than the last 2 phases but frustrating if it is done incorrectly. It is a tunnel runner, making sure the lasers do not hit the oncoming obstacles. Hitting once will lose whatever chain was amassed the previous phase, repeated hits will result in restarting the 'Harmonising' phase.The 'Power' phase. This phase lasts only a few seconds and has no lasers. Simply rotate the joysticks at speed.The environment of the 'Collection' phase is the same over the Act, therefore there are only 3 'Collection' environments in the game.They are a kind of pseudo-psychadelic representation of that certain stage in life. They are meant to stimulate thought, emotion and - most importantly - your imagination.The environment of the 'Harmonising' phase is where the story really comes into play. Using the same kind of style as the previous phase, only much clearer, they tell a certain aspect of the story - a significant part in the astronauts' life.The 'Warp' phase has a tunnel environment, nothing other than that. Various obstacles block your path, easily navigable...mostly.The 'Power' phase revolves around the captured astronaut as the memory is vigorously extracted.The music is a fine example of techno done right and complements the gameplay fantastically.It is also really quite helpful with timing.Overall this is a triumph of modern day storytelling, employing original and highly creative means.However, I did mention downsides.The primary downside is that this game is far too short! I completed it within 2 hours and that includes a few repeats. The only way to make it longer is to aim for perfect scores.I implore the devs to add some more content, another story, anything!This leads me onto the second point which is that the price tag is, for the gameplay time, pretty excessive. When you play, you can see where the money has gone and I, for one, can understand that but charging £11.00 (~$16.00) for just a few hours isn't something many can commend.As such, I can't recommend full price for this game, brilliant as it is - buy it on sale.*The only words in the entire game come from random excerpts of real dialogue between NASA astronauts and ground control (added for effect) and the poignant explanation at the end of a level.**The visuals are truly great, however if you are playing properly you will only see them in your peripheral vision. I honestly recommend you to start up a Phase 1 or 2 and not play it, instead focus on the exquisite background."

I think it does, the stages feel pretty nice, and getting the scores are part of the challenge. I like what i've played, however brief. It is a solid rhythm game that keeps you on the toes as it dances about. I don't know about the length, but the music, the graphics, and the whole approach just nabs you and doesnt let go. If its as short as other reviews say, I can see getting it on sale. But I'd get dlc for this in a heartbeat. Easily worth 5-10 bucks for what you are getting I would think, especially going back for challenges.So, i hope that this review gives you a glimpse from a music fan. (And to give my hands a break on the constant movement that the stages demand.)"

,Recommended,323040,20522513,"Posted: 14 January, 2016",all,wraptile,"Difficult to recommend but an interesting game overall.I'm really conflicted whether to put thumbs up or thumbs down.The gameplay is quite weak and thecontrols are difficult, when finally you get the hang of it the game is over. I would have prefered some sort of analog input instead of digital input of controller analog sticks. In short the controlls definitely affected my gemplay negatively. I've started out with xbox 360 controller which was terrible, switched towii u pro controllerand it definitely made the controlls more bearable.The presentation is superb though that might be because I'm a huge sucker for ambient kind of entertainment. The music is great as well as are the visuals, animation. The store is pretty barebones but I think that's actually a plus in this case.I've finished the whole game in 80 minutes as a casual run, meaning I did every level once with no resets.Would I recommend it for 15€ ? No.For 5€? Probably, but only if the trailer caught your eye because the whole game is pretty much extended trailer with uncomfy gameplay tacked on.At the end of the day the game just feels nice if you are into ambient elektronika."
,Recommended,323040,20740550,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,Acropolis,"This game is exactly as cool as its premise. You are assembling a dead astronaut's memories in a very alien way through a really neat rhythm game.Pros:+Visually impressive and well optimized (except right after level completion, occasionally)+Really fun and unique gameplay. I haven't played a rhythm game like this before (although I have seen comparisons made). If you could somehow put in your own music, this would replace Audiosurf 2 for me.+Futuristic and alien music. The music is easy to ""feel,"" which is obviously important in a rhythm game.+Again, the premise and concept are just really cool. You'll be fascinated by the story and visuals by the time the menu screen shows up.Neutral:=Some of the fragments that you have to push an analog stick just partially to get are nearly impossible with the first person moving forward setup. You'll see what I mean in later levels.=You'll hear the same songs over several times in the first and third stages of each memory in a group.=The game is <2.5 hours. Concise, yes. But you'll probably want more!Cons:-You have no idea what the camera/your trajectory will do, causing you to miss some fragments.-Your lasers move much too slowly for some of the fragments in later levels. I know it's possible, but it just feels unfair and clunky.As you can see, my issues are mostly just minor gameplay complaints that can be overcome by getting good. If you have doubts about the game, I recommend just tossing it on your wishlist and waiting for a sale, as the game is short."

Fantastic music and visuals, supported by it's mechanics really make you feel part of the music. However, it is extremely short, and this really is what makes it not worth its price at all. It should be a quarter of the price it is demanding. There is no reason for having a score in this, it doesn't give you anything extra when you do nail a perfect level. As soon as you start getting a feel for its mechanics..it ends, that's it, no more content, just re-do the levels if you wish.I'll be asking for a refund, there are plenty of other games for the same price that are just as great but with quadruple the content.

My thumbs hurt after playing for just a couple of minutes.

,Recommended,323040,35168139,Posted: 23 September,all,TrojanThighs,So having played this and the recently released Aearo I am quite shocked this never got the same attention. Gameplay is very similar. Controller required for sure. As a rhythm game fan I'm always seeking new experiences and this really tickled my urges.It's twin stick controls and visual design are good. The touch of story is compelling but don't expect anything complex.It could perhaps do witha wider variety of tracks. What's there is ace - chilled electronica stuff but there isn't a whole heap of it and I think this might put me off grinding for that 100% achievement.I have completed a normal playthrough already in my 90 odd minutes but with a the hard difficulty option and that urge to collect more orbs I can see myself coming bhack to it in the future. I think Aearo might have refined this idea quite a bit but this is definitelyu worth a sale purchase or buying bundled with the bit.trip games IMO. Well worth a dabble.
