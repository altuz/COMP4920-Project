,Not Recommended,323240,12829269,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,il Duderoni,"Let's start out by saying that it's pretty obvious that we're dealing with a Tablet port here.Not only do the controls obviously hint at this, but the tutorial screens (if you can already read the Asian characters) show actual instructions pertaining to tablet usage.Sadly, however, this means that the game has 'tapping' expectancies. Meaning that, because reaction speeds are slower with a mouse (in particular to click a very specific region) compared to quickly tapping with a finger, that it'll take longer to actually point at something. Not to mention that the skill buttons are clickable with the mouse, meaning that if the fight takes place in the lower regions of the screen, that you'll often click them by accident.But what of the Gameplay itself? Sadly, as it stands now, it's basically a hack-and-slash, giving you three stamina-using skills to use, a dash and a regular weak attack. Spamming these special attacks quickly drains your stamina, which will cause you to be temporarily stunned if said bar is completely depleted.While you have the choice of one of three characters, you get the other two as soon as you´ve beaten about five bosses. These AI seem to be well capable of just spamming their own skills, but the enemy tends to have a preference for you anyway. Meaning you'll still be well busy keeping yourself alive.And that's it. Tap to move or double tap to dash out of the way of an attack, keep laying on the heat and you're set. The character buttons that possibly serve to further define or gear up your character are ""not available yet"". So we're obviously dealing with a Tablet port that also serves to just give a taste of what's to come, as the loading screens love to wave around that the actual release is dated for December.There are no graphics options to speak of. No resolution options, either. Let alone anything else. Alt-Enter works to switch between Fullscreen and Windowed, but that wasn't said anywhere.Honestly? Unless the developers make some changes that clearly embrace the PC market or simply make it friendlier for them, I would avoid this game. EVEN IF ITS 3 DOLLARS.Take my opinion for what you will, but I say that this has a lot of fixing ahead of it before I can consider it well playable.UPDATELet's clarify this: If you start asking money for it, it stops being a Beta and becomes a release. If you don't want your game judged that way, then don't ask money for it or don't release it yet.The page also does not clarify the true nature of this game, as it being a 'preview' or a taste of a product to come.This is not a practise we should condone. It's just milking money from people."

,Not Recommended,323240,13539159,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,SmegmaOverlord9000,I love the idea of this game and I feel like it is very very close to perfect. It just needs to actually be updated with what they say they are updating it with. There was supposed to be a giant addition patch that settle all my disputes with this game... but it never came. The date the update was supposed to be live is still posted in-game... it was supposed to be released 10 days ago and not a single word has been said. So sadly I cannot recommend this game until the patch goes live and it smoothes out. If you enjoy the idea of playing playstation bosses with basic MOBA characters then by all means play it.
,Recommended,323240,12857160,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,Janaga,"For 2 dollars, I'd say this is a nice game and a good adaption.It really doesn't give bad graphics and despite being locked down to bad hotkeys (My opinion). It is really fun.WASD is normal for me but the UIO and JK hotkeys threw me off a little at the beginning. That aside, for the short amount of time I have spent on this game thus far, its great. Especially for ONLY 2 dollars.This isn't a big game, not really a RPG but more so to me a arena or a survival arena with some minimal aspects of a rpg. (The reason I don't say its an RPG is simply because it does not have a true story, the only role you're taking up is the heroes (classes) and all your doing is fighting bosses and progressing through the battles).With that said for those interested in the game, don't hold back. If you enjoy boss battles or just challenging battles. This is for you. If you like Gladiator styled games (arenas) then try it out. I'm definitely not upset with the two dollars i gave this game.It may not be completely done as well, for those who want to get with friends one day on this game or wants to fight them. They're setting up Co-Ops and PvP soon as well  - so again for only two dollars you're getting a good amount in return! Try it out!"
,Not Recommended,323240,13789512,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Valegator,"This game is not even finished as such it should be branded as early access.It took me 3 hours to finish the game, that is to finish all levels that are curently released.Game claims that new levels will be released. The game boils down to Monster Hunter boss fights and boss fights only.There is no way to power up your character other than grinding for levels.Don't get me wrong I had my fun with the game. The first 20 minutes when you start the game are kinda fun.Combat, bosses and music is good, but when you are forced to fught same boss 5 times just with diferent skin it gets boring. After some time it juste feels like some chore.Attack>Attack>Attack>Roll>Use specials>Attack>Roll>Attack untill you have stamina for special>Attack>Boss Dead.Later on it becomes even more boring cause they encrease the enemy health.First time you fight robotic T-Rex:Game: Hey you will now fight robotic T-RexMe: Ow yeah. Bring it on.Game: You won!Me: that was cool fight and music was nice.Second time you fight robotic T-Rex:Game: Hey you will now fight robotic T-Rex2.0Me: Oh ok. Bring it on?Game: You won!Me: that was re-skin of a previous boss.Game: Yeah but this one used laser that you easly dodged.Seventh time you fight robotic T-Rex:Game: Hey you will now fight robotic T-Rex again now with x5 HP and randomly shooting bombsMe: Realy?Game: You won!Me: Yeah after failing 3 times cause timer run out before I was able to deliver finishing strike.You can see where am I getting at later on timer becomes the boss.So after all that is this game worth 2€. Maybe after they realease all the content.As it is this is this game is not even finished as such it should be branded as early access."

All the bosses are just the same models but with better stats, and I didn't know wtf was going on when I first started playing because of all the Chinese letters all over the place (no english, or very little). The game looked promising but at this moment I can't recommend it to anyone to due the lack of content, language barrier , and how it looks and feels like a tablet game."

They didn’t even bother to translate the text and code the game right so how did this get past Steam’s quality control team? ""China's biggest action game"" can be defined in a word, which is ""disappointment"".At first, it feels good to rip apart the monster bosses but after a while you realize that this is really all the game has to offer since there are no ways to access the features of the game such as equipment, skills etc. The game is completely INCOMPLETE and doesn’t care that the 80 bosses advertised are merely reskins of the same low population of boss models.You are forced to battle earlier bosses because the latest one that you have to beat is overpowered compared to your current levels. In other words, you have to grind A LOT which shouldn’t have to be the case for these types of games.Summary:This is a tablet game that should have stayed as a tablet game, although, if you feel like endlessly smashing bosses with little to no effort and reward, then this may be a game for you.Worth:You should ask for a refund since the game is laughably incomplete.Last Thoughts:I’d rather play Malicious on the PS3."

Leaving original up so people can see what I liked and disliked about the game. Shortcomings were not adressed.===================================================Original Review - 6 out of 11 found helpfulPros :- Low Cost- Character Models and Sounds are cool enough- Enjoyable in short bursts- Difficulty is tweaked alrightCons :- Repetitive use of boss concepts and models (same half dozen with slifht tweaks over and over)- Few cooldown abilities are only effective if you can orient your character in the right angle - weak controls -- The short burts gameplay model works much better on a tablet when you dont have acess to your pc gaming rig- Fights against other human characters are a messy brawl where you mostly fire around blindlyConclusion :For the cost - and what it offers - its a fair bargain. However the PC is really the wrong platform for this game and you will very quickly yearn for more depth in your gameplay, a story, some better sense of progression, and this game is not the one to deliver it. Still might be worth adding to your library if you get it in a bundle or for very cheap for a quick relief of your hack and slash itch"
76561198031588755,Recommended,323240,12834880,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Reaping Havoc,"This game was released far to early, Its real content update is on the 12th of december (pending pushbacks) It currently has no RPG elements, just a standard leveling up and fighting bosses with more and more health. This game was designed for tablets and phones but the port to PC has played out well so far. Using WASD to move UIO for abilities and JK for standard attack and roll ( you can click to move and click to activate abilities but its slow and prone to missing as its all aimed and non targeted) The creators have already given evidence of a cash shop for gear so if you are afraid of pay to win in a PVE game then this wont be for you.This is a great page showing all their future promises with the game including PvP and co-op gaming via  wifi or mobile.https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-world-2-empire-in-the-stormRight now i enjoy the game and it feels fluid and pretty fun altho repetative ( mostly due to them teasing me with what i could be doing like gearing up or evolving) I'd highly reccomend waiting a bit longer for this game to get your real money's worth but i wont regret spending the $2 for what ive played so far"

Note also the instructions are not in english, though the game is easy enough to grasp -- I would even argue it's fun -- fancy button-mashing boss-battles, one after the other? Some people are bound to find this more fun than I did -- and that's not being mean... I just like my video game fare more cerebral. That said, it seems like this game had many more features intended, but never got implemented -- evolving and upgrading your character? ""COMING SOON!"" (Indicated release date was December of last year for these features best as i can tell.) -- It's also implied there is supposed to be PvP battles, but nahh... though it is fun to fight against other heroes as well as bosses. Still... not enough there to hold my attention."
,Recommended,323240,14109839,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,DePhoegon,"Worth the 2$.Though  atm, the fiddily camera angles take alittle getting use too.WASD works as one would expected, if there is only 4 directional input (I couldn't tell, and felt like 8 directional, with smoothing to make it look decent)-UIO/JK Sp attack./(attack/dodge) keys work well, & they have alternate key inputs that aren't clear.--123/qe for sp attack/(attk/dodge) & Arrow keys for movement   [Though frankly I have a var easier time using WASD & UIOJK keys.The differences between the classes aren't clear, though I would argue it barely matters.The bosses ... as it were seem to have the ankle biter weakness.Though, with this being a tablet port, & Mouse control being really only useful for the menus, and for now feeling partly like a demo.  I would honestly think that this game is wel worth it's price even if it's not updated (which I trully hope it does get updated, to atleast support MP[only SP atm]), and there is a statifying feeling of getting through the bosses then face rolling them & getting S ranks :P  (not sure if higher ranks are available, I assume not but I could be wrong)This isn't a game I would suspect most to just sit for hours & play, but given some Keymapping to a controller, & Steam streaming.. I could easily see this being loads & loads of fun to see who can do better & such.I had the hardest time with the butcher, & it was mostly only due to time issues (5 minute kill window for each boss), though I suspect the camera & inability to aim my weapon @ first contributed to that.  [being the only boss so far I had to restart a few times for running out of time]If the price was higher, I would not recommend this game, but as it stands it's worth the 2$ USD, and you could honestly do alot worse then this.I wouldn't expect controller support & it doesn't claim to have it.   There isn't much to the RPG elements, outside auto leveling, & some locked elements to the characters.  (will update if I reach the limit of it &/or it changes)"

And I have to say, I am not regretting my choice so far.It's like a Monster Hunter game - you pick a hero to start with (either one of the warriors or a berserker) and slay big things! After the first set of missions, you get the other two classes added to your team, at which point you can switch your hero between the three of them and start battling against other fighters as well as bigger monsters. It did get a bit dull after a while, but is a great game when you're bored.Probably a 9/10 from me."

Worth about as much as a soda where I live.Okay, so, now that I've gotten that out of the way lets get to the actual review.This is a Japanese Beat'em up/Hack and Slash designed originally for a mobile touch interface. However, they converted this over to PC, keep this in mind before you buy it and Thumbs Down it.Pros:-Cute chibi style graphics.-Unique bosses and stages.-Destinctly different characters.Cons:-Uses unchangable UJIO controls.-There is no tutorial_________________________________Overall:_________________________________This game needs some work before it's ""Awesome"" or ""Great"", but it's not a bad 2$ game for PC.I think if they just added the ability to change the control key setup, this game would be loads more fun, the UJIO is wonky and unnatural. Besides that, though, it's a fun game to play when you're bored and are tired of dying constantly in Dark Souls.Would I recommend this? Yes, yes I would. You see, World 2 (Boss hunter) is up for some BIG updates- PvP, new characters, etc. When this update happens, this game will be really exciting!

ONLY keyboard controls that dont always work. wasd is movement, but about 1/3 of the time when you start a fight, you can only move 1 direction at a time. so randomly, youll have NO diagnal movement. the ""bosses"" are just a bunch of pallette swaps. the music sounds like a cheap ripoff of various final fantasy songs.  there are NO options, no configuration files, and its made in -shudder- unity. would have been really nice to be warned of that problem beforehand.yeah, its 2$, but thats 2$wasted. your better off buying a cigar than this game.  if you want a mindless button masher with terrible chinese facebook game graphics, no character customization, HORRIBLE translations that make absolutely no sense, and moonspeak all over the place instead of english, this is for you. if you want fun, quality software, this game is NOT for you."
