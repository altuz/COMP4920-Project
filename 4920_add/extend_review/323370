,Recommended,323370,30233520,Posted: 27 February,all,retired,"I've been playing tera a decent amount recently so i understand the point of certain complains people have about this game.Firstle, NEGATIVES, if any of these issues should bug you, you probably would NOT enjoy Tera's experience :-The game is poorly optimised. You would hear many people saying they lag in dungeons even with good pcs with gtx 960s and above. Even if you have very good specs theres no guarantee you would get 60 fps in velika or in rooms with tons of mobs. However if you can get passed this the experience isnt unplayable whatsoever and you can tweak the settings to see which allows you to have a playable experience.-Desync. There are often times in pvp you cast a skill to point A, and it hits a player at point B. This can be frustrating if some random guy manages to hit you after missing his skill in pvp.-Class/Gender lock. The recent classes namely reaper/gunner/brawler/ninja have all been locked to a specific class AND gender. Theres also news that the upcoming Lunar Dancer will be locked to female castanic only. If you want to swag up a badass cool looking guy this may be a bummer for you. Also not everyone wants to play as a 12 year old loli.-Mundane questing. As you start to get more alt characters, you would have to continue leveling from 1-65 over and over. Basically, it gets boring as heck and quests can be a pain to do. You can however skip some quests and do dungeons only or battlegrounds to level up which isnt so bad and is a great way of learning your class properly instead of going from point A to B doing quests.-Small player base. There are not alot of players online most of the time, with only more during certain events. This only really affects certain dungeon queues and battlegrounds. If you dont pvp as much, you wont really notice a lack of queue for most dungeons.-RNG. There are a few things in Tera are that RNG based. Biggest thing is gear. Enchanting ,Masterworking or Awakening gear from +9 to +15 takes alot of tries and rng to pull off which may lead you to rage filled suicidal moments that prove you are in fact very salty and are considering to uninstal the game. Small problem for the most part as most gear aren't that hard to enchant unless your rng is 0% in every single game played which then you should probably re-evulate your life choices and quite gaming.Now if you dont mind any of the negatives stated above, you may want to consider the POSITIVES for this game.-100% not pay2win. There are some items like innerwear which are supposedly cashshop exclusive purchase but you can still buy these items through gold or tokens. The game is very playable and enjoyable even without having you spend a penny on it. You still get an enhanced experience if you wish to pay with real life cash.-Large variarity of cosmetics. If you wish to make your character look blink or swag or sexy, you can do so in Tera. You dont even need to spend real life currency to do so. With enough gold, you can make your loli elin cute af and afk at highwatch without any complains.-Combat System. Of all games i have played Tera is one with one of the best combat systems. Its fluid, flashy and never gets boring (unless leveling alts over and over). You get to pick one of 12 classes(currently, more in future) that are unique in their own ways. Furthermore the animation of many skills are quite impressive and it definitely isn't some point and click game. Each skill has a unique function (althought some classes might have similar skills with one another) and it definitely takes time to master each class. Naturally, don't expect to nail everything on the first dozens of hours you play.-PVP. Another thing i really like about tera. Fast paced pvp that really allows you to learn more about your skills. PvP is a way to improve more in the game. Also skills used in pvp aren't always the same as in PvE against monsters so overall there is greater variation in playstyle of each class. Sadly pvp battlegrounds are dying due to small player base but duels against players will always be there.-Dungeon Rotations. Twice or thrice a year, level 65 dungeons get rotated out of the game and replaced with newer dungeons (or dungeons from way back). This ensures that the end game isnt stuck with the same old dungeons which makes the game pointless at some point. Plus you will have to master new dungeons once the patch hits which is quite refreshing.-Beautiful scenery. Like many other mmorpgs out there, Tera shines in its beauty. The landscape is nothing short of stunning as long as you are not on lowest graphics settings.-Satisfying gear progression. While some long time players may argue that getting new gear each patch is repetitive and boring, I actually find it satisfying and nice to farm and work towards new gear each patch at level 65. You can also grind tons of gold only to fail on +15 enchantment and go back to square one.-Mounts and pets. Tons of mounts to choose from, also have pets which aren't as useful but they are there. Many mounts grant you passive HP/Mana regen while mounting and others even flight. Pets are there with auto loot, extra storage or even auto gathering abilities(albeit not neccessary). Sadly, you will only have enough gold saved once level 65 and after having played a decent amount to buy these items but it doesn't take too long to get to max level. (took me 10hours to max level an alt but you can do it more quickly with more experience)TL;DR, Game is still fun, enjoyable. Many of the complains mostly affect veteran players and not so much to newer players. Furthermore there are many guilds out there with friendly people that are willing to help out  newer players so i would definitely recommend this to someone wanting to try it out for the first time. Get ready for some days where you will log in for 12 hours straight, and some days you don't even log in, its pretty normal. Despite the complains ive had, the game isnt far from fun and recommendable and thats just a little nitpicking.Edit: Nut Weab Geme(maybe)10/10 if you are a lolicon."
,Not Recommended,323370,29653152,Posted: 2 February,all,Giddy Gardevoir,"So I played this game to death back in the day. TERA's combat really sets it apart from most other MMOs and redefined what I expect from MMO combat in this day and age. The characters are gorgeous, and I really thought the original argon storyline was badass. I wound up with a character lineup of about 6 or so max level characters in the game back when level 50?... was the max level. The game was grindy, hard, and pleasantly challenging. BAMs challenged you to learn your class and master understanding tells, iframes, dodges, and coordination. Animation cancels were key, and knowing the length of time certain abilities took to perform was clutch. The dungeons were not very forgiving. Hell, even the normal mobs weren't very forgiving, punishing you if you weren't careful at the later levels. BAMs regularly one or two shot people in the world... and it didn't feel unfair at all because you only got caught on your♥♥♥♥♥when you didn't pay attention and learn to read them....So normally I would say 'amazing game, everyone should try it and play it, it will redefine what you expect from combat in MMOs and make a lot of other MMOs you thought were 'fun' suddenly seem extremely dull.' That's how it USED to be. Nowadays, though, they nerfed the BAMs into the dirt. Nerfed dungeons so people just cake walk through them and barely recognize what they're even hitting. Totally eliminated any need for a tank or healer (you could do the dungeons before without them, but you had to know all the strats, tells, and abilities of the mobs and bosses in that dungeon to make that work and could wipe VERY fast if caught offguard by anything), and basically made the game action combat for babies.Why they would nerf and trivialize the combat when, outside of some very pleasantly skimpy outfits and great visuals, it was the major selling point of the game, is beyond me. But without that challenging combat in place to put people to the grind and push them to learn it, I cannot recommend. It used to be 'Monster Hunter Online, with dungeons.' Now it's 'Disneyland with Giants that hit about as hard as Pluto.' No, I don't mean the planet. I mean the dog.To put a little perspective on things, because people keep arguing 'you have to grind through to get to the challenge...' in the first year or two of TERA's launch, a basilisk would kill someone in cloth at level in about two claw attacks (one if they got hit by the backstroke), and could body slam a caster straight into Oblivion. This is at level gear. No 'gear grind.' Maybe some 'gear bought off the AH' but the change in stats from that would be trivial. A lancer and heavy armored character could soak a couple more hits, but if you were bad at blocking or iframes you got punished and you died fast. That was just flat out standard for open world BAMs (and quite a lot of the normal open world creatures, too, actually), especially if they had a level or two over you.The only way to solo farm them was to learn their tells, learn any patterns, and know what each twitch of the mob meant. This was just 'leveling.' This was combat content from level 17ish+ (I only say level 17 because even though some of the earlier mobs could really @#$@ you up they weren't BAMs, and BAMs are what I'm using as a prime example.). You got that challenge right from the intro though, if you count the first boss on the island, who actually could jack you up fast if you hadn't learned basic mechanics yet. Hell, the ogre you have to kill for one of the initial starter quests on the starting island could do that stupid 'double clap' move and kill you in one to two hits....So yeah. The game is dumbed down. Is that to say there's NO CHALLENGE anywhere in the game? Naw! I'm sure if you bore yourself to tears through the cakewalk the vast majority of the game has become, you'll find some pretty stiff challenges in the content once you've finished your gear grind to hit the cutting edge (too bad that same gear grind means until you're caught up, you probably get babysat through dungeons that 'would' be hard otherwise too, huh?). But I'm not talking about 'when you're at the edge of the gear grind.' I'm talking about 'the majority of the game your average player will experience in the first 24 hours or so. As much as I loved TERA back in the day, there's not a chance in heck I'd recommend it to someone 'now.'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgV24TXwTXk<--- Basilisk fight from back in 2012. The player doesn't blow (they get hit by no major attacks, only the glancing attacks mobs can do.). They stay on the basilisks flank (the only safe place to attack from when you don't have a block, which warrior didn't have back then.). Knows her iframes. It still takes her about 6 minutes, and she still comes out of it half dead. That was TERA back in the day. Compare that to 'now.' Tell me the vast majority of the game isn't pitifully easy in comparison.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFfin9fwCashttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNDDKSwPEQIAll just open world, leveling content. Even fighting these monsters in groups was dangerous as hell, nevermind soloing. Last video is ALSO a really good example of why people used to hate warrior tanks with a passion as an additional bonus."

,Not Recommended,323370,29433671,Posted: 22 January,all,Murg,"TERA has a ton of great elements, which make it a game with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, there are far too many deal breakers. This game is made for noobs.The developers of this game have taken something that could have been really good and essentially cranked it down to ""Very Easy Mode"". If you're looking to walk around in a pretty forest killing helpless creatures, this game was made for you. I don't recommend this game to anyone looking for any level of challenge or mental stimulation.Firstly, the dungeons are a total joke. Your party is made up of a tank, healer and DPS, but theres really no need for a tank or healer. Everyone can just face roll the dungeon on their own. It's a total cake walk. The hardest part of the dungeon is picking up all of your loot while still keeping up with your teammates who are sprinting through the instance. Players literally purchase their characters a pet that auto-loots so they are able to keep up.Secondly, there are several overpowered classes that are super easy to play. For some of them your rotations don't even matter. On many classes you can just push any available button and you will do fine. On the other hand, some of the overpowered classes have some really interesting and dynamic skill sets. Unfortunately, the game chains abilities and you can just spam space bar. If you are playing one of these classes, you will quickly learn that space bar is the only button that matters. The TERA community has coined the term ""Spacebar Hero"" for these clases.Now I'm sure all of the dedicated fans of this game will tell you:1) Wait until end game and theres a bit of a challenge.2) Don't play an OP class. Pick a hard one.Both of which are ridiculous. Why on Earth would anyone play an underpowered class and then farm their butt off to keep up with the 12 year old who is smashing space bar? When games have overpowered, ""spacebar hero"" classes, it totally ruins all sense of competition.As far as waiting until end game goes, there is nothing fun about grinding for 65 levels before you get to the ""Moderately Challenging Mode"".  How did it become industry standard that players are expected to invest 40+ hours in levelling tutorial before the fun starts at ""end game?""I really liked TERA for the first few hours that I played. Unfortunately the developers chose to water down the game and make it so easy that its not fun for even casual gamers. I'm really tired of the gaming industry making games so easy."
76561198045348586,Recommended,323370,29452385,Posted: 23 January,all,Lazy,"TERA falls into the trap that so many MMOs do today, which is great artists and programmers, but bad game designers.The graphics are beautiful and inspired, everything looks polished and complex, if your computer can handle it I would recommend it based on the eye candy alone, but that is not everything in a game, especially an MMO.I am one of those old MMO players who enjoyed the golden age of Ragnarok, and although that game is far from perfect, it has the same formula as TERA, amazing art, music, style, but absolutely terrible design, gameplay wise. But Ragnarok has better design overall.What I mean by that is, TERA has no customization, once you select a race and class, everything else is set for you: your equips, your skills and your function in combat. Even though it is fun to block/evade enemy attacks and simply watching their animations is fun in itself, you can't ignore the fact that you are just doing what you are supposed to, there is a railroad and you can't think outside the box, experiment or even explore like you should in an MMO, you don't decide your attributes, your skills are mostly level locked so you don't have too many options (god forbid having options on an mmo!) and all the equipment upgrades are basically the same item as before but with a slightly bigger number or maybe some useless ability like 4% bonus damage or whatever...I can't say a lot about the PvP part because I didn't play the game enough time to be a competitive PvP player.I think of TERA more like an online action game with great graphics than an RPG, there are RPGs from 20 years ago with higher level of customization, if TERA managed to include these in the game, then it would definitely be considered one of the best of the genre. The video game industry needs better designers."
,Recommended,323370,29662437,Posted: 2 February,all,Dyne,"Tera is a strange game, not because of its setting or fauna but because of the strange decisions made by the developers. As a free to play game there is an obviously a microtransaction system which I'm okay with. Tera does this extremely well in that you don't need to buy anything in order to enjoy the game (in fact I've never even been tempted to spend a dime on the game and don't think I ever will be). What is strange to me is that the developers stripped all of the lore out of the game some time ago for some bizarre reason. The cities and towns in the game are completely pointless and the NPC's have no personality or anything of value to say to you. Aside from selling the few items you get at the very beginning that you can't ""recycle"" there is literally zero reason to ever go to a shop in this game. What's also strange is that the developers left objects and characters in the game even after they stripped them of their usefulness. There are fields of plants with text hovering above them that used to be part of a side-quest but now that the side quests don't exist anymore they serve absolutely no purpose. NPC's will say things to you that you can tell would have been the beginning of a quest but you can no longer progress any further than that. The game is a skeleton of what it once was and I have no idea why they would do that.If you play MMO's to enjoy the story, move along. There isn't much of one. With the towns and characters being hollow shells that offer you no substance, the only ""story"" you get is through mission text and an occasional cutscene. The dialogue is pretty good for a game that was made in Japan. There are a few things NPC's say that make you scratch your head but overall you can't really tell it was translated.The Elin race in the game is a bit disturbing... overly-sexualized cat and bunny-eared people that look quite a lot like children. Given that something like this is in the game you can probably rightly suspect that most of the playerbase consists of embarrassing weeaboos filling the chat with ""senpai"" over and over as they roleplay a 14 year old scantily clad cat-girl begging for a large demon-man to split them open.Aside from all of that garbage that they scraped from the bottom of the Japanese cultural barrel, the game can be rather fun. It is, in most aspects, little more than a World of Warcraft clone... but the combat is fairly unique although the way the store describes it is misleading. While it gives you more ""action"" than WoW, you still will usually just be pushing 1-8 on your keyboard to queue up abilities instead of dodging and performing combos. The classes aren't varied enough to keep the game interesting for very long... most of them play exactly the same with just different names for their abilities. Once someone tells me ""the real game starts once you get to level _____"" (as four or five people already have when I brought up issues I had with the game) you know you're in for some BS gameplay. If you're the kind of person who can get addicted to performing literally the same 8-12 actions over and over again for 80 hours then you'll probably enjoy Tera.I enjoy Tera... mainly when friends are on as playing solo is really boring and you can be damn sure I wouldn't try to party with one of the creepers in general chat. The game has absolutely no challenge to it and you can blow through the entire quest line in a day or two if you're really grinding. I've only died twice in the game so far and both times were because I wasn't paying attention. If you're actively playing none of the enemies presents any difficulty at all. Which, again, leads me to be baffled that they took so much content out of the game.Let's just talk about the main city in the game, Velika. Velika is pretty big compared to all of the other settlements that I've seen so far (I'd compare it in style and design to WoW's Stormwind although it's about 1/4 the size)... but there is only ONE place in the entire city that you need to go. The entire rest of the city is filled with NPC's that say one to two inconsequential sentences and vendors that no longer sell anything. It just feels WIERD to know that someone put a lot of time into designing all of that and they just never did anything with it. Similarly you'll travel through zones and come across farmhouses and little towns with NPC's standing around and there's NOTHING to do there. Hell if you took out all of the redundant content you could probably fit the whole game into 3 or 4 zones. Some zones have you walk through 5 minutes of empty terrain with the exact same one or two monsters the entire time.The game is visually pretty. I was impressed with the first flight into Velika when you see the floating castles and beautiful landscape features (even if the graphics are quite dated) but it's not consistently like that. Some zones, as I said above, are pretty much barren except for an occasional ruin or pointless house that you can't explore. Character models are pretty decent (especially if you fancy 14 year old girls with tails) and you can customize your avatar extensively compared to other MMO's (though nobody is going to ever be close enough to appreciate it so I just go with a preset).I'm recommending it because it's fun... and it's free. If you had to pay money for it I probably wouldn't. I probably have the patience for 8 or so more hours and then I'll likely uninstall it and never revisit it. With all of the gutted content it really feels like the game is close to shutting down even though they keep coming out with updates. It may not be true, but that's how it feels."

The beginner island is vastly improved and it gets you into the game fast without wasting your time running for miles like the old one did.  There are now multiple ways to gear up, so getting the new sets is easier than before and you actually have choices how to do it.  Class designs are better looking and more fun than ever, and the combat system here (still the main attraction by far) is still the best in any MMO I have played, and I've played most.  If you like the lore and feel of an MMO setting but want a more engaging combat system, this game is for you."

It takes a decent level of skill to make the most out of the class that you play.Classes are unique in what they can do with different playstyles and mechanics, each with varying difficulty.You can experience everything the game has to offer without spending a cent, but there are a few ""pay2win"" aspects that don't really diminish the overall enjoyability.Open world. You can swim, jump over stuff, etc. Teleportals and teleport scrolls also exist for those who don't like that stuff.Dungeons have a degree of difficulty that you must overcome in the later levels. It's easy initially, but later on dungeons do get challenging and fun, to an extent.Boobs. Self-explanatory.ConsTerrible, terrible, terrible optimization. If you don't meet the minimum requirements for this game, don't even bother downloading it. You will experience FPS drops and rendering issues which will hinder gameplay immensely.The game is not for casual players. If you wanted to play a game that will reward you by doing minimal effort, this game isn't for you.Questline is bland, boring, and downright unenjoyable. I myself skipped dialogue just to progress through quests faster.Grinding is the name of the game. At first you grind for levels, then when you hit max level, you grind the same dungeons over and over again for materials that may not even drop.Classes are unbalanced. Some classes are literally just better than others. Some deal insane amounts of damage while others are left in the dust.Races are unbalanced. As you'd think, in a game that requires aiming, bigger races do have bigger hitboxes. This is a huge drawback for PVP. As such, most players play the smaller race classes.There's a few gender and racelocked classes. Really takes away from the uniqueness one can bring to one's character.Limited customization. It seems like a lot at first, but then you realize females and Elins get all the love. No love for the Barakas or the males. #ripgenderequality #ripracialequalityLong queue times for dungeons in the early levels. Most players tend to play high damaging classes, which slows down the queue times at lower levels as the system tries to find tanks and healers which don't exist.PVP queue times are long. In this game, there are things such as battlegrounds which you have to matchmake for. It's not pleasant how long you have to wait to get into a match during offhours (weekdays).Limited end-game content. You play for maybe about a week, or if you really enjoy it, a month, after hitting max level. Afterwards you realize how unrewarding the game is, and you just stop altogether.Of all the races people can play, they choose the tiny little girl rather than the ones with boobs. Makes me really question people's morality. Too many lolicons in this game, honestly.tl;drThe game is fun for what it has to offer; although limited. The combat system and the general enjoyability of the game make up for what the game lacks in storyline and broadness. Great gameplay, but repetitiveness becomes increasingly intolerable. Recommended for those who want to experience something new, exciting, and somewhat challenging.P.S.In case you were wondering, I still do play this game to this day. There's a certain aspect of this game I find that just keeps me going, but that's just me."

I guess Im done with these super repetative, candy colored mmorpgs for good.  They are all basically the same with only very slight variations in flavor.  I mean exactly what else can you do in an MMORPG except go here, kill this, collect that, talk to this guy or that gal?  They are all the same because its not really possible to be very different in this particular genre of game.  So Ive had my days in WoW and in Rappelz, and in Defiance, and in probably at least a dozen others of the same ilk.  WoW was fun for a long time, Rappelz took over my pocket book far too much and Defiance-which I did Beta testing for-was kinda cool but just not different enough.  Oh and I did Alpha/Beta testing for WildStar as well.  Nice little game but again, just not different enough to stand out in any major way.  I guess if you are just coming of the age to get into these kind of games then they will be exciting for you-at first.  Chances are you will outgrow them as many of the rest of us already have.  Another thing is that these flashy colored, repetative mmorpgs are a dying genre since people are becoming more and more use to incredible, very realistic, almost true to life 3D graphics like you see in Skyrim or Tomb Raider.  Anyway, TERA is free so I cant ""not recommend"" it.  Perhaps its pay to win much further along than I got in the game but other reviews havent mentioned that.  So go ahead and try TERA if you've got the time to waste.  My time is more valuable these days so Ill spent what little free time I have on games that I consider more satisfying.  Good luck."

Sadly, I grew bored with it after a while....the fact that classes are locked to one specific weapon (with a lack of diversity in the skins to boot) and the lack of additional gameplay mechanics drove me away. Since then, I have been back and forth with the game, never spending a whole lot of time with it.My opinion: if you want a game with action-based combat and a wealth of extra content to offer, pick up Black Desert Online."

Server is unavailable. That was nice. Took me over eight hours to get into the game.Once I'd FINALLY managed to get into the game, it decided ""hey, let's ♥♥♥♥ing crash multiple times for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason!"", every 15 minutes. I got to level SEVEN before the game just started refusing to load the character and froze on the loading screen.I figured, &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm already giving this game a second chance. Might as well go the extra mile and try validating the files AGAIN."" Not only am I unable to load the character, I'm now unable to get to the ♥♥♥♥ing character selection screen. That's right, repairing the game's files made it crash SOONER.All this hassle, struggle and frustration, for what? A sub-par MMO that's only selling point is Sexy Characters. To the point where some of the best classes in the game are restricted to the video game equivalent of sex dolls.The best part? This is my SECOND attempt at playing TERA. The first one didn't go very smoothly either, but that was because of my crappy graphics card. I'm not going to hold my lacking hardware against the game."

Trying to just get what you need in game with no real money is unbearable. The Dev's really push you hard to just buy everything in the store, as much as you don't want to. At least, with my experince.PVP is awful, I can't tell you the times as a lvl 15 character I got killed by a lvl 65. Different lvl 65s. Some 65s who used hacks to make them un-killable. Trying to reach my checkpoint to go to the next quest was nerve wrecking, especially when everyone is faster and have much, bigger swords. You could play on a PVE server, but it's not even worth it to switch over, It is so tedious to make a new character and go through the whole story step by step and reach end game again, it feels like Laundry Day with a never ending pile of socks with no mate.Don't play this game, it might be worth it a year or two times down the road to check it out, but with the latest update has gotten a lot of veterans mad. My roomate, who has played this game since it came to light, finally deleted it because the update was so bad. I stopped playing a long time ago, with my fience at the same time. There is nothing of substance, this game is just salt water.MMO's go through bad updates at times, but for a long time the updates here just keep getting rid of things you like using, making them absolete if they don't, and forcing you to play and play to get the new ""better"" items. They remove so much for the ""better"" content, until you realize you have the same weapon with a different paint job. Nothing really keeps you here, the Devs just says there's more to the water than just salt. Maybe arsenic but I'm waiting for the lab results from my doctor.Find another MMO, a better one, at least to wait if the Devs gives this game something worth while."

,Not Recommended,323370,29715153,Posted: 5 February,all,Kanon,"""Tera- A game with endless possibilities limited only by your imagination..."" So they would want you to think. More so should be called ""Tera- A game limited by how much money you're willing to dump in for the good items before they release a new set within 3-4 months."" Though maybe i'm just a tad bitter about how they're doing things, that or this is a legit problem. For clarification the game is decent in the beginning (from 1-60) but after that it's ""welcome to the p2w grind""BUT WAIT, AREN'T ALL MORPGS LIKE THAT?You may be asking, but in truth, not really, at least a majority grant you the fair chance via patience to get these items. The problems I see with this game are based around the fact gold drops about as frequently as you'd expect to find a gold coin in a disaster area struck by both a hurricane and earthquake at once, and the economy alone is beyond inflated it simply crushed the elephant in the room with it's sheer mass. The chances of getting items, ones you need is slim to none when the guy who has the whole set is rolling on it as well and a good 90% of the times you lose the roll anyways and are back to square one.Then we take into the effect the grind, wouldn't normally be a problem as with anyone else, we're all used to a grind to an extent, but as an example you need say 20 of item X and another 40 of item Y (both of which are found in different dungeons mind you) but drop in bunches of 1-2, sometimes 3 per run, again rolling and pressing your luck in hopes that you out roll everyone else, keep in mind too, other players who may or may not need these items, so let's go with the worst case scenario, you get one, but lose every other roll. Now you need to run that dungeon again another 19 times or 10 if you're one of the lucky bunches. Now this is where the grind becomes more and more bs as it goes, say you got the stuff from the first dungeon, NOW you need to repeat that on either a hardmode variant of that same dungeon, but you can't because item levels, or run a different one and repeat the same grind another 10-40 some odd times before you get the parts needed to make the set you're after... but guess what? That doesn't mean anything because even using your cooldown resets and got the ""elite"" status and can run it multiple times, They've already released the next armor/weapon set in line, rendering your work null and void, to which as a further ""Eat♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; to the players who work legitimately they hand out what you worked so hard for in ""easier dungeons"" or through Iod quests/daily reward points, to which this cycle is unending. Now you could just turn around and pay $100 or more if you feel like it and get the set from someone selling it, but again no point since they're going to release a newer, stronger tier within 3-4 months and render everything in your bank useless and outdated.In short, Tera's nothing more than a flashy wave of eye candy that tries to favor those who want to pay to win over those who work for their gear, and essentially♥♥♥♥♥♥on you for trying to make a profit to buy the items necessary for you to progress, But I digress, if you're one of those people who enjoy getting♥♥♥♥♥♥on, by all means but this game needs a masive overhaul to everything if it's going to survive, otherwise rest in pieces"

,Recommended,323370,29663236,Posted: 2 February,all,♦ Ｇ Ｒ Ｉ Ｍ ♦,"I very highly recommend this game. I wasn't expecting much, but from the Trailer and The Given Info I thought I might as well give it a shot. Not only was I extremely surprised with the quality of Tera, but I also enjoyed it. Which is really saying something. I don't play many MMORPGs and I often find alot of major errors in them. Whether it's Bugs or Flaws in the System, I always find something. Like Wizard101 (♥♥♥♥♥♥ game btw) which requires payment for literally almost anything. Or maybe it's just really dull. Very Rarely do I ever find an MMORPG that I actually really Enjoy. Well, to get the larger portion of things I have to say out of the way, let's start with what I like about the game;-Unique and Fun Battle System:Tera has a rather unique battle system, where it isn't just Point and Click, Skill Spam, e.t.c. You actually have to Aim for Your Target, and position your attack right for maximum damage. Skills are useful and have more than just 1 use, too.-Very Nice VisualsThe Game has a very nice art style and a very pleasing visual aspect to it. A Great Amount of Detail went into the environments. I like that.-Steady, but Fast Level Up SystemWithin 24 Hours of Character Creation, I leveled up very quickly. This can be considered a bad thing, but I like the overall pace to the game. It has a very satisfying level up system. You can go as fast as you want, and the game keeps up with you. You get upgraded Equipment for every other Story Quests in the game, Including Weapons and Armor.There are other things, but I feel like I don't really need to say much more on things that I like.Next, things that I don't like;-Somewhat Broken Class SystemWhile Tera does have Races and Classes to Choose From, there are a few problems with it. First of All, Some Classes are Race-Specific. Which kind of irritates me. When a badass sounding class like ""Reaper"" Is reserved for the 3 foot tall furry loli class, your facial expression turns to something similar to ""what the ♥♥♥♥?"". Second of All, Not only are they Race Specific, but Gender Specific. I really don't understand why the ""Brawler"" Class is reserved ONLY for Human Females. Especially since there have been many, many Brawler Classes in other MMORPG's that are universally available.-Overpowered CharactersThe Game, even if I enjoy it alot, is easy. You cut (or shoot) through enemies like an 1000 Degree Knife through butter. You also gain MP from attacking enemies, which I dont really think is a bad thing, it just makes the game feel kind of easy.Bosses provide little to no challenge or mental stimulation. I still enjoy the battle system, especially because I feel like a god when cutting through 6 enemies surrounding me with 1 swing, but it is kind of easy.I still Recommend this game though for any Adventure/Fantasy lovers out there."

,Recommended,323370,29881498,Posted: 12 February,all,Hellrazor215,"One of the best combat systems I have ever seen in an MMO. I am not a fan of group play in this, but solo is fantastic. The story is not bad either. The biggest problems I have with it are that the game doesn't explain some things very well, like crafting, it'll give a token explaination but I ended up looking up most of my questions online. It also has some extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ female models, which I'm not totally opposed to, but it is bad enough I feel embarrassed inviting my friends to play. Which is sad because as I said the combat is incredible."

,Recommended,323370,29591187,Posted: 30 January,all,Captain Birdie,"Great combat, Great graphics.  challenging end game dungeons.  The downside is the game doesnt really start until you reach end game content. Leveling is quick and easy to max level. Lots of complaints about ""space bar heros"" Truth is that the space bar heros are never good.  If you play by just hitting spacebar you will only be doing a fraction of the damage you could be doing if you planned out your attack and had a good grasp of your class. Any one can play any class easily, however to play well you need to have a bit of skill.Pay for convienence and to look pretty.Cons: dying game population."

It's gameplay will shine through regardless."

,Recommended,323370,29471187,Posted: 24 January,all,Saobie,"Its a fun mmo that reminds me a lot of MaplestoryIt has some issues, which ill outline first:You level up really fast. I played this a few years ago when you couldnt get to 65 in just a few days. Over 120 or so hours i spent to et to 49, i saw a vast game with lots of content. I played mostly solo and it was a great experience. You feel like an adventurer out doing random oddjobs for the good of the people. Back then i didnt see a TON of players, since most chose the mainstream dungeon raid rout to level up, i chose hardgrinding. However today, you can make a character and get to lv49 in a day with x2, maybe not even. Iv never been max level, so i cant say how much there is to do once you get there, but for everything before that, you basically skip it all.Theres also the bit to extreme limit on character slots. 16 is the max per server, yet you only get 2 to start with. That dosnt let you really try any classes. According to most players, you should play a class to 65 before you decide weather or not you like it, and if thats the case, youd have to do this a myriad of times, while deleting any class beforehand that you worked up to 65. This is unless you paid 5$ like an absolute idiot to get another slot, are a founder (8 slots per server, and lots of other perks. 17$ average price), or used ingame gold (current price is 27k on average). The last 2 options by far being the best and admittedly not bad choices at all.Now with that out of the way, i get to talk about why i recommend this game. The thing is that you get to meet a lot of people. Its a pretty popular mmo. The issue is the good classes are gender locked, so you often get horny ♥♥♥♥boys trying to get with you, disregarding the possibility that you could be a guy playing a female because you wanted to be a Ninja or a Brawler. Iv been told the economy is good, though iv never delved into merching, and a good economy is, for players like me, a very big selling point. Theres also apperantly a lot of endgame content. Outside of that theres a myriad of classes, which each play slightly better/worse/differently depending on your race. The community is pretty ok. Im not confident in saying its great because in pvp servers your likely to get railed by some upper for no reason, but i dont have many reasons to say its bad since i actually met a lot of cool people just yesterday (playing as a Ninja and copying others gets you a wide variety of responses). Oh, and lets not forget that as far as i can tell the game isnt p2w. From wat i see, paying dosnt get you any actual combat benefits outside of leveling faster. And most paying players usually buy cosmetics, which is almost exclusively what money is good for in this game. Take that as you will. Oh, lets also not forget the graphics are stunning8/10. Id rate it higher if i knew more, but i havnt been max level before"

It's more like a ""NOT YET""To the persons behind this game, I sincerely thank you for bringing this to life. I'm not talking just for En Masse Entertainment but also all affiliated with them including your food delivery guys (if you have some).Your efforts and dedications gave a whole new meaning to RPG and we hope this last longer than other MMORPGS in the market so that you can be paid with your well earned reward.Kudos to you all!ROLEthe function assumed or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation.This game offers youcharacters. Positive reviews will say that they are the best looking in the market (you can look on any other MMORPGS but I think you'd agree too) and most negative reviews ranges their insult from either gender biased (because some are locked genderly) and just plain ""flat"" (offers you not enough things to change). I'll give an 8/10 for this mainly because they're visually stunning but on the long run I'm afraid I'm going to get bored. I'd be spending hours in front of my computer to play this ""role"" and it's never gonna be enough for me if it's just an eye candy. I ain't staying around if it's just a lolli for 8 hrs straight if you know what I mean. Suggestion: Read some reviews or might as well read all of them. I've found some pretty good stuff in there in just an hour of reading. Compile their points, good or bad, and then discuss them in a meeting. You might learn a new thing or two.PLAYING1. Engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose.2. Take part in (a sport).This game boastsTrue Action Combat. Search this on Youtube and you'll be seeing Tera on the Top 10 MMORPG so you'll think it's doing pretty well but apparently it's not. I think Monster Hunter started this (but I'm pretty sure it was calledaction roleplaying video gameback then). MH's lack of targeting system and slow hard hitting melee actually made the players think ""Hey, this isn't hack & slash"". Suddenly they are offered something more""challenging"". In example, you don't press a button and drink potion just because you need to. You gotta time it perfectly or you get hit while doing it (I could go on and on in the difference but you know what I mean.)If this is what you're aiming for TERA, I think you missed it.I remember an spongebob episode in which he faked he work out but actually he just had an inflatable baloon for arms. Spongebob eventually got found out later that episode and most players will find it out later after downloading Gigaton of TERA that this isn't what they think it is. For the players, if you're looking for challenge, this might not be it yet. Go download something else. A not so nice 5/10 from me. Flashy skills won't do justice, players with hundreds of hours in this game are reviewing negatively because of this. Kindly do something more challenging.GAMEa form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.The game itself is suppose to revolve around you, the player, farming your way to the top and enjoying it in the process with your friends(at least I think it should). But sadly the other thing is happening:Quests are generic (kindly watch the Greed Island arc of HunterxHunter if you have time) and completing quest are rewarding. Trust me when I tell you that if you want a challenge in this game, I suggest you don't bring a potion. Or better yet, don't trust me, bring some and forgot you'd even have them because of how seldom you use it.Player improvement: There is no thrill of second guessing also so there's no improvement for you as player. Moba rewards those who has faster reaction time. Reaction based on reading your oponents mind. Why not a True Action combat? Please stop putting red patterns on the floor for the AOE attack of monsters and those exclamation marks when they're about to attack. You've got to leave these to the players. I give the game itself 7/10 for the mere effort to be different and failed to do so. Yes, your ""space bar heroes"" really dragged this score lower than it should be.I think this question came up in one of your meetings. What do players want? And a list of these follows:Free to play.Challenging.NOT a pay to win.Leaves them something in return.(I could go on but you get the point.)For the benefit of the players, I think this question also came up: What do you want?Low maintenance costs.Higher player counts logging in.Stable cash coming in.(sadly I couldn't go on with this, can you help us understand you?)All in all, a good6.67/10from me. Don't worry. It only means there's still room for improvement. My appreciation from you guys are so much that I actually took the time to write.Thank you for TERA."

I realize that I've just spewed outright blasphemy and am in extreme danger of being stricken down by a bolt of divine lightning, so let me explain. Traditional MMO combat – as popularized by Blizzard's genre-stomping behemoth – isn't exactly thrilling. While PvP and high-end PvE ratchet up the mobility factor a bit, leveling generally involves all the high-octane action that's typically associated with being a tree. That is to say, you root yourself in one spot and flip your brain switch firmly into the “Off” position. Tera, by contrast, requires skill-based swinging and fleet-footed acrobatics, leading to adrenaline-pumping last-second dodges against even the most mundane of foes. Also, which would you rather play as: an ugly old gnome or an adorable (and vaguely horrifying) dog person? I rest my case."
