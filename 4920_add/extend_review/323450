,Recommended,323450,14331163,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,suikoder,"The oldschool JRPG that slightly overstays it's welcome. It would be a very hard game if not the fact that there is no death penalty and every battle can be repeated as many times as needed.The story and characters aren't particularly interesting and quite simple. The ingame (not battle) character animation is funny in jumpy-jittery way, it grown on me with time for some reason and I find it hilarious now. The characters are partly voiced (Japanese only), the important dialogs and combat, most of dialogue is just text.The story ends in a way that makes apparent there is a sequel (not really a cliffhanger but close). I know it's the series, so no surprise here.Combat is probably most interesting part of the game, it's somewhat overbalanced with negative sides to everything, these are partly countered much later into the game. Character progression and growth is slow in this game and it's impossible to overlevel. Maybe not exactly impossible but close to it. If underleveled though, party stands no chance against stronger enemies and bosses, so a game does make you not to avoid battles, even if it is possible to run from all of those except with bosses.The game has random encounters and uses overpainted monsters method to populate lands and dungeons, too much for my liking.There is an arena, which gives no xp at all.Dungeon design is boring and very repetitive, not being ingame dungeon maps too, it's too easy to lose or rather forget you way for this reason.It might seem like a game is just bad, but it's quite enjoyable at first, it's a tad too long for it to stay this way."

I'm happy to say that even though this game is a port of a mobile phone game it's high quality and has some good resolution and graphics. The play mechanics are solid with the keyboard / mouse and the dialog has charm to it. Japanese Voice Overs are there as well. The big deal breaker and I won't give it a thumbs down for it would be the fact that you can't use a PC game controller with it.. You have to be in front of your computer to play the game. But other than that, I'm happy with this game."

76561198207083779,Recommended,323450,29639462,Posted: 1 February,all,Zaijka,What attracted me to this game first  - was the 3D battle.  I enjoy anything RPG and this one makes you love grinding.   Sometimes I can just sit there and stare at the effects of magic.  It is also funny and very greatly animated and drawn (meaning the characters and other things).  Lots of effort went into this and it is worth the money for certain.  I would love to play more of the games (if released).  Thank you very much for making this game. :D!
76561198103651772,Not Recommended,323450,24385450,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Vigi React,"This is a mobile port that really feels like one. The scrolling when you walk is jittery as all ♥♥♥♥; it's a throwback to the early emulator days in the 90's (not a good thing.) I even found myself tapping the walk button instead of holding it down so my eyes wouldn't bleed.The story starts off interesting, in a Phantasy Star kind of way, but I lost interest, not in the story really, but in the combat.The first quarter of the game, on Normal, you only need to auto-battle. There is one side-quest boss from the first town that you can't do that (man is that fight horrible, it's a battle of wearing down his super-high HP, with no danger of ever really dying, and it takes like 40 minutes.) So, it's really boring to level, even though you level and gain a ton of Energi spells in this boring period.Once you actually have to strategically fight battles, I was so put off by the janky mobile scrolling and filler storyline, I couldn't march on."
,Not Recommended,323450,22570043,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Fnord,"Alphaida Genesis is what I would describe as an entry level JRPG. It's quite simple and does not try to innovate much, but rather it sticks to the basics and does it in a very approachable way.This game was originally a mobile phone game, but were it not for some UI elements, it would hardly be noticeable. The port from phone to PC is surprisingly good, with one exception: You can't use a gamepad for this game.Graphics & SoundAlphaida Genesis has 2 very different looks to it, depending on if you're in combat or not. The non-combat portions have a simple & colourful 2D look to it, that would be at home on the PS1 (the sprites are slightly too detailed for a SNES game), while combat is in 3D and looks more like an early PS2 game in terms of detail & style.The difference between the two is jarring, and it helps give the game a very incoherent look. While none of the modes look bad, barring overuse of the same few tiles on the overworld, they don't mix well together. Personally I found the combat to look far more appealing than the 2D overworld part, which has a rather cheap look to it, with poor animations and the above mentioned overuse of the same few tiles.In terms of sound, the game is very middle of the road. There's nothing really wrong with the music, but nor does it stand out. Sound effects do have some weight to them in combat, so that's at least something. The voice acting is generic. With generic I mean that if you've the least bit familiar with Japanese games and/or anime you can tell almost exactly what a character will sound like by just looking at it. Also, the voice actors do seem to overact quite often, and I can't tell if it's for comedic effect, or if they're just not very good.GameplayIn terms of gameplay, Alphaida Genesis is very traditional. If you've played SNES or PS1 era JRPGs, you know what you're in for. Random encounters, turn based battles, relatively linear character progression (though you do get some choices in what magic skills to develop for your character) and all that good stuff. If you like traditional JRPGs, you'll feel right at home here, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. One nice thing is that the game will warn you when you're about to get a random encounter, as the borders of the screen changes colour. This, and a relatively low encounter rate, made sure that the random encounters did not feel annoying.StoryAnd here is where the game falls flat. The base premise of the story is not bad. You live in a world where synthetically made humans exist, and where they do a lot of the work. These are treated like second class citizens (so basically slaves), though there are people who want to elevate them to equals. A murder is committed by one of them, and after this there's talk of getting rid of all the synthetically made humans. It's not the most original story, but it could have been interesting.Sadly the writing is just dire, and there's a lot of dialogue here. It's hard to feel invested in a game where the writing is as bad as it is in this game. The dialogue between the characters feels like it would belong in some second rate fan fic rather than in a game released on steam that's made by developer that's been around since the mid 80's. I just could not bring myself to keep on playing, as the more I played, the less I liked all the main characters.Final thoughtsIf it was not for the terrible writing, Alphaida Genesis would have been an inoffensive and rather generic JRPG that would have worked well as an entry level game. A modern day Mystic Quest if you may (though it's a bit more involved than Mystic Quest). But as it stands, this is not a game that I would recommend to anyone. The writing is not even funny bad, it's just cringe worthy, and makes the game nigh unplayable for me."

Graphics have aged well, which is rare for older 3D games.worth it...far better than the rpg maker games that flood steam...better than all of them ive seen thus far.  This isnt an rpgmaker game though.I like that i was never lost, the secrets were not overly complex and more or less involved paying attention to your surroundings...travel times were short, the ""dungeons"" were all short enough to not over stay their entertainment, maybe other than the last part which felt a bit long.  I didnt need a guide at any point, everything was well explained and the in menu quest tracker, story tracker, and world map worked great to make progressing less of a chore and never confusing.Updated after completion:Story leaves a lot of loose ends with little to no resolve, didnt do the second ending yet but it seemed to just end far too quick, not sure i really want to go through all the second ending quests for full completion.  Got to the point where i was just too strong maybe?Either way it was a good paced story, good character building, text was always short enough to read but seemed to build good story.I like that the game was sort of short, i did accidentially leave it on for about 18hours...its a good length game, not too short not drawn out and too long...however i wish they started concluding a lot of the story much sooner, i was actually expecting maybe another 12 hours of play when the game ended...maybe the second storyline you get with the clear save fills the gaps though...ill be honest the normal end...i felt the game abruptly ended with about a 5min wrap up that felt like a rushed conclusion.Was definately worth the money, would definately buy a sequel...just wish the normal ending was more of an ending and the extra ending and content maybe would be better incorporated into a single gameplay with perhaps different paths or whatever.ill update again if i get around to using the clear save and doing the extra content with a different ending, not sure if its just a quick refight or if its going to provide enough content to properly conclude the story in any satisfying manner.  Im almost sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off how it ended tbh.  Still had a lot of fun with it for the price and has been one of the better oldschool jrpgs ive played in a while."

I appreciate they want to increase their selling area but I think they could do better job if re-Master or add another feature/voice over on the game before porting to PC, so it will attract more customers.For this one I think they just porting from Smartphone version to PC (with no difference)Overall score : 7/10Still worth it if you grab one on Sale~"

I will be using a ""Pro's vs Con's"" style of review because I don't personally believe 1 out of 10 type of reviews fairly portray the ups and downs of a game. You may enjoy different things than I do, and someone else may not mind something that's a pet peeve of yours and so on. I believe the best I can do is write good and bad and let each reader of this make up there own opinions to check this out or not.Pro's-First and foremost for me was the 3d models in combat. You don't find that often in steam jrpg's.-Tons of hidden rooms and treasure chests through the the game. To give perspective there is an achievement for getting all 220 chests unlocked and I found over 200 in my lone play through.-Decent length to it for bang for your buck. It took me a little over 20 hours to complete the story.-Not hard to get achievements if you're an achievement hunter. I acquired 16/20 in my game buy doing  just the main story. The only one that's really hard is the aforementioned 220 chests achievement.-It does have voice acting in the game. However it's in Japanese so  if that's not your thing then you might not like this (I don't speak Japanese so I can't speak for the quality and I played most of the game with it all muted and Pandora underneath.)Con's-Meh story.. it definitely falls under the ""Bad guys doing bad things to innocents"" Kind kind of generic story for a jrpg but really more than that it's a love story between characters, love triangle included.So it wasn't for me but that doesn't mean that's not your cup of tea so to each there own.-The characters in Alphadia Genesis are as cookie cutter as they get. Know the stereotype? Well I'm sure it's in here. Fray is the protagonist who never gives up especially on his love. Aurra although my favorite is the younger sister of Fray and the smart one in the group. Enah is quite, Walter is annoyingly jealous until the last 10% of the game. And Grande is the big guy with a heart. Then we have Corone... *shivers* the super annoying lead female of the group. I found myself right click spamming dialog when she or Walter started to talk at length.-The animations for the spells and other moves in the game basically came down to a color shooting across the screen. Whether it's a fireball or Fray's daggers doing some sort of combo."

,Recommended,323450,14602885,"Posted: 22 February, 2015",all,Matthew Broderick,"Robolaxen here with a quick overview of the current JRPG I've been playing over the last few weeks. The game is called Alphadia Genesis and was published by Kemco Games for the iOS, Android, Wii U and PC. The game is a fairly traditional RPG with with 2D overworld graphics that transition into fully 3D battle graphics. Standard turn-based combat, but has a nice combo system that can reward better XP/Currency/Skill Points depending on how large the combo was at the end of the battle. The game features a world map that done in the classic open world Final Fantasy with the use of airships and boats to get you from point A to point B. The game does feature some voice over work but is currently only in japanese but all text has been translated. The controls are responsive and the game has a fair soundtrack.As for the story it is pretty basic, you are the top swordsman in your kingdom, the King sends you on a mission to investigate a murder in a nearby town, you sister tags along because she is the brains of the operation and you are the brawn. you meet many new characters along the way some of which join your party to help investigate the outbreak of murders across the world.Final thoughts, i enjoy the combat system and the banter between the party members. The graphics and soundtrack could be better, but for a game made for the mobile platforms i feel they are more than adequate. My favorite part of the game is the large amount of hidden chest and secret areas to explore. For modern day gamers i would give this game a 6/10. But if you grew up playing the old NES/SNES/PS1 RPGs like i did, i feel this game would garner a higher rating of 7.5/10"

But that's okay, you play this game in spite of that.

Actually I'd recommend this game even to newbies of the JRPG Genre because the game isn't too terribly difficult at any point.

They wanted to write about a love triangle and are clearly obsessed with writing about how teenagers acts in love triangles.  The game is 90% dialog about this stupid love triangle.  The other 10% is the story to Blade Runner.  So unless you just absolutely love reading about how someone isn't sure of their feelings for another and how they're not sure if they should tell their feelings to the other people, then my suggestion is to just go watch Blade Runner.  You'll save a ton of time and not want to stab yourself in the eyes."

It's not worth the $10 price tag, especially since it's a port of a mobile game that only costs $4 on the android market. True, the steam version does not have microtransactions like the mobile version does but that alone does not justify doubling the price. The in game shop is still there but instead of buying the points to spend in it you can find them hidden in various places through the game. I also have to kinda question Kemco's decision to have this game as their first PC port not only because this is the 6th entry in a series, but also because it has other games that would have been a better choice.With that out of the way.....it's a decent JRPG. The story is ok, not the best ever but it's better than most of the RPG maker games that are starting to flood steam. The combat makes up for it though, the PC market is a bit lacking in decent retro style turn based RPGs (I will highlight ""decent"", there's no shortage of retro turn based RPGs but unfortunately a lot of them are terrible) and since that's basically all Kemco does hopefully they start porting more of their games over. Hopefully they also price them to make them worth purchasing outside of a sale."

76561197971885100,Recommended,323450,15009730,"Posted: 22 March, 2015",all,Target Practice,"A nice oldschool RPG.  If you are familiar with other Kemco games it follows the same style.   If you arn't familiar with Kemco they make a lot of Android and Tablet RPG games.  While enjoyable I could never quite get used to the stylus as the form of control.  I was thrilled when I saw that Kemco is making a push into other digital markets.  As for the game itself I am several hours in and I am rather liking it.Good musicThe party has different personalities they arn't just cardboard characters.Combat is smooth and there is an auto combat button, useful for grinding.Storyline so far is solid.Others have complained that there is no gamepad support but its set up to use the ""W,A,S,D"" keys for movement and the ""E"" as the general talk or look at button.  You can use the mouse in tandem and it is a good setup."

,Recommended,323450,34840782,Posted: 9 September,all,Rattlehead,"Alphadia Genesis (JRPG) available on SteamJust like Asdivine hearts made by Kemco gamesAsdivine hearts and Alphadia genesis actually have a lot in common but here's the pros and cons in relation with Asdivine heartsPros:+ Aesthetics and mechanics wise the battle system is better than Asdivine hearts' battle system+ The battle is voiced as well as some of the dialogues+ The map is easy to navigate since there's only one world map unlike in Asdivine where there's two so if you forgot something from the other world, you either go back which is a big hassle or get that later and you know doing quests back and forth between two world maps is a pain+ In related to what I mentioned previously, the quests will require you to just keep on moving forward most of the time unlike in most JRPGs where you have to go back and forth the worldCons:- There are only two difficulties - Easy and Normal and the Normal is still too easy. (You get very rich easily, you don't have to use a lot of things you picked up because most of the time you can defeat a monster party in a turn or two, etc.)- Very few side quests, this is an open world game so they should've took advantage of that and JRPG doesn't feel that much fun without a lot of side quests and subplots- Towns/Villages are boring because there's only the inn, the weapon shop, and potion shop 90% of the time because again, there are very few side quests so the developer decided not to make towns/villages populated. It's purpose is just to serve the main quest since weapon shops only sells all types of armors and weapons that are only good for a certain level and will become obsolete after a few steps in the main quest- The characters are not that great, Asdivine hearts have much more colorful characters and one of the characters in Alphadia is really annoying. I've met annoying characters before like spoiled prince, pretentious prick, etc. but those never annoyed me unlike the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. And again since there are very few side quests there few people to meet- This is just a bonus - The romance sucks, not because Asdivine hearts is a harem and well, who doesn't like harems? but because there's no depth in the relationship of the people involved plus the concept is cliche"
