Just a heads up if anyone is experiencing the same issue.Other than that the game runs great. Has plenty of options. It does have a scarce graphics menu, but the game still looks fantastic for what it is. There's even keyboard AND controller prompts, something a bigger company like Koei Tecmo can't seem to grasp.The game keeps things fresh by giving players different ships (and a fairy) that utilize power ups and bomb attacks in different ways while also changing ship maneuverability. I'm fan of the flagship...ship of the game personally. I find it easier to maneuver and the weapons feel great to me. The overkill system is neat and a great way for players to try and wrack up points by bring more death to those that are already dead. Although, I find my greed into trying to rack up scores by doing this gets myself killed in the process.The difficulty of the game is unrelenting. I find it difficult even on normal settings. I can't bring myself to go any lower than that, but seeing as how I'll probably never get to the end of the game if I don't do it, I'll probably just have to swallow my pride. The game isn't very bullet helly to me. It has more to do with enemy shots moving fast as lightning and sometimes being hard see due to them blending in with the backgrounds sometimes. It might just be because I'm finally getting up in age and my eyesight just isn't as good as it used to be.The soundtrack for the Raiden games have never really wowed me, but their pretty good and always go along with the feel of each stage. I'm more of a fan of their sound effects for their weapons than anything else and this game doesn't disappoint. I just love hearing that laser baby.The game also has a gallery that allows you to view and play around with some of the models in the game. You unlock them through game progression and gives gamers another level of replayability. While the models look pretty rough up close, it still a nice little bonus to just mess around with.Overall all, H2 Interactive did a fine job with their port of this game. If you're a fan of the genre in general this is one game that should be in your library. It definitely won't disappoint your if you're looking for something to fill that shoot'em up void in your heart."

,Recommended,323460,17873235,"Posted: 3 September, 2015",all,"Mr. ""Pro Lizardfricker"" Argent","The Raiden series has always been a favorite of mine (though I'm a bit less partial to the Fighters spinoffs since they have what I like to call ""Audience inbreeding syndrome"", catering to score freaks and those who mastered the main ones specifically and becoming rather obtuse in the process). I've been wanting to play IV for forever since I don't own any of the platforms it's historically been available on, so seeing this one pop onto Steam was quite a treat!With that in mind, the porting work is very solid  - the game runs silk smooth, looks great and even has some very good gamepad support. The original Arcade version of Raiden IV (Released in 2007) runs on the Taito Type X platform, which was sort of antiquated (""Pentium 4"" antiquated) even when the game first came out, so it's no surprise that the game's a pretty smooth runner... Assuming this is a direct port of the original code, anyway. Raiden IV's lineage is somewhat confusing so I'm unclear how Overkill, the PS3, and the original Type X versions of the game all relate to each other.The gameplay's easily some of the most enjoyable shooting you'll see out of a Raiden game since Raiden II/Raiden DX, and the classic Toothpaste Laser even makes the return it didn't in Raiden III! The game's new Overkill mode takes some cues from the more score-focused games (the whole Overkill chaining setup evokes Raiden Fighters Jet's medal chaining) but the mechanics aren't nearly as obtrusive and don't need to be followed if you just want to have some fun with the new map layouts. I think this is a really happy medium between how the Classic Raiden games do things and how the Fighters games did things!Soundtrack-wise, Go Sato (The composer from MOSS - formerly Seibu Kaihatsu) returns to revisit his chiptune compositions for Raiden I and II. He did a very good job of it (and managed to make Tragedy Flame sound less like a transparent final countdown knockoff), so the game gets some marks there! Reusing music's a little unoriginal, but all the arrangements have been meticulously done. Newcomers and series veterans alike will get some ear candy! The new game modes also include remixes by other artists.The game's very agreeably priced and includes plenty extra over the previous ports, making it easily worth the purchase. Give it a spin if you can!"

The longer you live then the higher your score multiplier goes up!Classic arcade game with classic end of level baddies too!One thing I want though.. in this age of widescreen displays, I want a SHMUP like this (vertical scrolling) BUT utilizes the ENTIRE screen real estate.. no large areas along the left and right hand side of the screen that are vacant (I KNOW in this particular game and series as we know it because the original arcade version was a vertical screen orientation), but I think there would be a market for it !

This is essentially a port of the XBOX 36O Edition by UFO Entertainment. Unlike Raiden III Digital Edition, this game natively supports the XBOX 360 Controller and it makes playing this game much more nicer (yes, the D pad even works for those enthusiasts )Graphics are beautiful, they are much more improved over Raiden III and nearly has a flawless presentation (Raiden III suffered from some flickering textures in some spots of the game.) One thing I did notice is that the game does have a tendency to stutter at times when it should not, and I've not been able to see how I can get V Sync enabled to make the game more presentable. The screen tearing is annoying to a degree.One thing I really love however, is the music, it's arcade space ship shooting music at it's best. Lot's of happy moments.Other than the litte quirks I've mentioned, I would suggest picking this game up, only during a sale, I could not reccomend it at full price."

Yes, this game is so good. it strikes the balance between bullet hell and oldschool shmups. The new scoring system is dead simple but is just so much fun, just keep mashing that button ;D The music consist of great remixes of classic Raiden tunes. The music is pumping during stages and changes to darker tune during boss fights.Raiden has never been a bullet-hell and always retained its very unique (read: sluggish) gameplay with fast but sparse bullet patterns. i like how playing with Fairy overcomes the inbred sluggishnes and makes a very different beast out of Raiden game.JOYSTiCK support is the most important thing for me in any shmup. Raiden DOES work with Playstation joysitcks. Inexplicably, being a game first published on japanese Xbox360, Raiden does NOT detect xbox joysticks , both Hori and Madcatz were not functioning at all. It is a shame, because all xbox joysticks have native drivers already installed in Microsoft Windows. I suppose this issue is going to be fixed in future.this game wil demand from you some customisation at the very beginning.Obligatory for the better comfort of the game are:- screen pivot (optional but highly recommended as with any other vertical shmup)- screen size adjustment (make it big)- resolution- controls rebinding for keyboard users (i prefer using left hand WSAD keys for movement)If you are passionate about playing shmups, i wholeheartedly encourage you to buy a joystick.  The simple truth is , Raiden/shmups should always be plaid with a joystick. All other input methods are not fast and subtle enough. If you churned out money for one, it will serve you for years to come (unlike constantly breaking ""gamer"" keyboards and mouses) and you will never look back at using anything else."

I spare you listing all features and gamemodes and screen options because it's listed at the describtion of the game itself and there's a ton of it. What I'm gonna try is explaining what makes Raiden to one or maybe ""the"" best shoot 'em up on Steam.To sum it up it's the overall feeling of shooting your weapons and destroying stuff.The controls are very precise and the feedback you get from annihilating the enemys just feels right. Raiden IV has a high production value across-the-board.You upgrade your ship by collecting three different types of your main weapon which get stronger as you collect more upgrades and rockets. The enemy variety is also very high. There are tanks on the ground, big ships, small ones, enemys coming over bridges and turrets on aircraft carriers. The levels are very well designed and highly detailed.After beating a level you encounter a boss. Those are also very detailed and well animated. And they demand all your reflexes and tactical abilities to beat them.I recommend grabbing a coffee or a cold beer and sit down with your controller to train your reflexes like an animal.

There are a wide variety of difficulty settings, and you can set your life/bomb count in the options menu, so the game can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of how bad or good they are at shmups.If I had one gripe, it would be that sometimes the bullets can be difficult to see, but other than that, this is a solid Raiden game I can recommend to fans of top-down shooters."

I'm gonna sound like an Undertale fan here, but you really should ""just play it"" to get a feel of how good the shooting and level design is.This is the Overkill version as well, meaning you get a whole other game mode, which is an arrange with the titular ""Overkill"" scoring system which can change the way you play the game, which increases the replay value.

Stages and the barrage of bullets are all more intricate and interesting. There's even a set of different ships you can pilot with different speeds, hitboxes, and bombs. Oh and the last ship is a fairy holy♥♥♥♥♥♥A couple shortcomings come creaking back from the previous game. Most prominently now, the bullets still blend in way too well with the on-screen effects and explosions. If you're piloting over a field of firey debris you're not gonna be able to see the fire-colored bullets lunging at you at the speed of fast. It was already hard enough seeing the projectiles behind your own curtain fire by itself. Watch out for the enemies that soar to the bottom of your screen, pivot to face you and fire from point blank from the side. It's still cheap but at least you're fast enough to dodge it now. Also don't pick the second ship, itss bomb has a huge delay making it useless.Overall this game is really satisfying though, miles above the prequel. My biggest dissapointment is that so few people can muster up the chutzpah to beat it."

For some reason, it was outsourced instead of being developed by Moss themselves. Eventually it was ported to PC, along with Raiden III.Now, having the game on PC is good, and I'd upvote it every time. However...The OverKill team made the game really strange, such as the Boss Rush and Score Attack modes now being based on the OverKill mode with no way to practice the other modes, and the World Record mode only allowing for Normal difficulty (not even Arcade difficulty). It seems they also broke the music, and have never really fixed it.For the PC port specifically, I have tried and consistently failed to get any sort of vsync running. I have no idea what's going on there.This threadonly creates more questions."

Good.This is a fun, well designed and extremely challenging ""schmup"" as this type of game is commonly called. Just like in Raiden III, enemies fly down from the top of the screen (or trundle along the ground) firing stuff at your little spacecraft (or faerie as the case may be) while you fire loads of fast moving firepower to head them off. It only takes one hit to get you destroyed but there are an infinity of extra lives and extra continues. With infinite lives and continues, why is this game challenging then? Because it's HARD not to get hit and using a 'continue' erases the point score you accumulated up until that point (as is the norm for these types of games (except, unfortunately, some of these kind of games don't let you 'continue' infinitely like Raiden IV does).Anyhow, this game is pretty fun if you like this kind of arcade-style game. It is being sold at an adequate price but, of course, it's an even better deal if you get it at a discount during a Steam sale like I did.+Nice, cute, bright, colorful graphics with each stage being a nifty area to fly over.+Intuitive, standard controls for this kind of game.+Feels just like Raiden III or indeed, most other Raiden games. This game has a great, classic late 1980's/early 1990's arcade feel to it.+Creative, interesting enemies.+Lots of game modes, some of which have additional areas to fly over.+Most aspects of this game are unlocked from the start, including both spacecraft and the faerie which you can play as thus avoiding any need to complete potentially frustrating challenges to unlock them. Even if you are not that great at this kind of game the infinite continues allows you to get through it all and see everything (including the nifty artistry it took to make this game). This makes the game very appealing for a casual gamer like myself. Just jump in, pick a mode, pick a ship and play.+Settings menus are fairly easy to use with just a keyboard.+The options for different weapons are great and the addition of the Faerie girl as a playable character is funny, especially at the very beginning when she takes off of the carrier while making jet-airplane sounds. The Faerie girl's weapons (bubbles, flowers etc.) are also a hoot.+/-Steam achievements can only be earned in the OverKill play mode.+/-Still makes heavy use of the happy, frenetic techno style music which is common for such games and is, as a result, becoming boring.+/-Extremely challenging. Potentially frustrating even on lower difficulties.-This game can get repetitive easily despite the number of different modes. I can't seem to find a boss-rush mode (a mode where you fight against only the bosses from each level) in this game like there was in Raiden III. Perhaps it doesn't have one.-Not much of a story. You seem to be fighting machines controlled by evil alien red diamonds from space (Just like in previous Raiden games) with your prototype ultra-powerful fighter plane or with your mysteriously powerful faerie girl (if you choose to play as her) (perhaps she's the Gaia spirit of earth-nature protecting all organic life from the evil diamond machine-aliens? No idea)."

This is a great port with extended modes, various stages, and the option for multiple players along with a fantastic selection of weapons. There is room for bullet hell fans, casuals, top scorers, et cetera. The graphics while a bit dated more than get the job done. I added in some FXAA from Nvidia CP as I couldn't find anything else that worked. The resolution is basically what you got in the arcade, and they have a couple themes you can use to round out your screen.As far as shmups go this one is actually quite a looker overall. While older, the gun effects and the stages are very well thought out and increasingly more exhilerating the farther you get into each stage and more you unlock the full potential of each weapon and sub weapon. Absolutely no complaints on the weapons here. This is Raiden at its best and your arsenal is fluid, exciting, and most of the tools are totally different in control from one to another. You can play this shmup pretty much anyway you want. You also get a choice of three ships, one being a fairy lol. Got to have a little of that Gundemonium vibe or something. Classic chip tunes keep the energy flowing and your mind on the action.For difficulty you should not be disappointed. There is the classic arcade mode, practice, easier modes, and they also added some hardcore levels of difficulty for those troopers looking to show off their insane skills. Everything here is well done and it looks like they actually cared about this port. I really cannot see any real shmup fan being disappointed with this one. It's one of the best out there and the port is excellent."

It's by far the weaker of the two on Steam.  The way the charge-missile mechanic interacts with both the flash-shot mechanic and the new ""stop shooting to make the powerups stop changing colors and vacuum"" mechanic is somewhat half-baked.  It's the only game in the series with bullet wobble.And yet, it's still a fairly OK game, if the bullet wobble doesn't drive you too crazy (I go back and forth on that one).Recommended to fans of the series who are desperate for more Raiden, but it's very secondary to Raiden II, Raiden DX, Viper Phase 1, or Raiden III."

The game screen is not only cropped on the vertical sides, but inexplicably on the top and bottom as well. This tiny display does not support any scanlines either. I just can't recommend this game until these issues are addressed.[UPDATE] I have managed to forc vsync using Radeon Pro Software. There is the ability to zoom in hidden within the graphic options and it is possible to rotate the screen if you want to play in portrait mode and your monitor has a rotate feature. The AA in this game is sorely lacking, everything is noticably blocky. It only supports a very small number of resolutions for no reason at all other than the developers were lazy (4K support would have been nice!). If you have an ultrawide monitor this game will make you cry.  It's a great bullet hell shooter, but I still feel not enough love has gone into this port. Ikaruga would be a better pick."

I don't understand why it is designed like this:- Power-ups keep moving in circle in the screen and change color every a few seconds, you have to keep an eye on them to get the one you want. But you know, this is a bullet hell game, paying too much attention to other things can kill you.- No any invincible time when using bombs. Yeah bomb is just another attacking item. The explosion can absorb bullets though, oh I forgot to say that you have to wait 11-2 seconds to see the explosion.- You lose all your upgrade on death, and drop a few power-ups to pick up. Pretty common in shooting games. But...you know how those things work, you are staying in bullet hell equipped with only lowest upgrade and trying to get some power-ups, and bombs can't protect you. You know what will happen...- Enemy bullets and bonus items are almost the same damn yellowish color. If you don't care about score you can avoid them all though.- In later levels, enemy bullets become faster, sometimes my ship doesn't have enough speed to dodge. And some enemies can shoot you from very close distance.I may try a few more times, hope I can get used to this."

First, as someone who always perfers to use keyboard and mouse, I found navigating the menus to be clunky and unintuitive. There is no actual full-screen mode. Enabling the full-screen option just centers the game in the middle third of your screen while the rest of the space is filled with a bit of static art (an image of your jet) and a solid background color. My biggest gripe is the fact that destroying enemy vehicles drops xp icons that float on the screen for a second, then zoom to your ship. Problem is, in a shoot'em up, bullet hell style game, you're trying to focus on dodging enemy fire. Almost from the start, the amount of stuff - xp icons and enemy bullets - you have flying at your jet makes it very difficult to discern what you need to dodge and what is xp being collected. This, for me, sapped a lot of the enjoyment out of the game as I died time and time again trying to dodge xp only to run into bullets. Maybe I'm just old and my eyes are crap, but I've not had this issue with other titles in this style. On a positive note, the game seemed to run fine in the brief time I spent playing and there looked to be a good amount of enemy types and weapon variety. However, due to the reasons I described, I wouldn't recommend it. That's my two cents. Hope this is helpful."

Raiden IV features the timeless weapon system and lightning-fast aimed bullet patterns we've come to expect from the Raiden series, along with beautiful HD visuals, plenty of optional settings to fiddle with, and an all new scoring system. With so many ""bullet hell"" shooters on steam it's easy to recommend this classic twitch shmup for variety alone, but the impeccable quality of the port is what really makes it essential."

Personally I think it is a lot better than Raiden III.  The 3D Grapics and the envrionments are a lot better than III and there are plenty of modes to play from.  Overkill mode is icing on top of the cake.  Music is great from Go Sato who started composing the music in the Raiden series starting on II (and also did Raiden Fighters series as well), and the gameplay feels crazy with the crazy bullet patterns coming at you.  This isn't a bullet hell Cave shooting game so while there is less bullets on bullet count wise, the speed of them is what gets to you.  You can play the game just fine without fliping your monitor to portrait but it is highly recommended to play the game in TATE (vertical portrait your monitor) since you need all the screen size you need to dodge the fast bullet patterns.At least Raiden IV is on PC and people been hoping for this for years."
