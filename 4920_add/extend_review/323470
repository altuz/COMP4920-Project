,Recommended,323470,14897881,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Nef Miyama,"Whether or not to recommend this game is rather difficult, because it depends on what you're looking for. If you just want an action-packed romp through childhood nostalgia, Dragonball Xenoverse will serve you well. Ultimately this game is competent and you can get many hours of enjoyment out of it, but it does have some noticeable flaws that dirty a game with a lot of potential. I'll list some positive and negatives about each key feature I can think of.Create-A-Character+ Being able to create your own avatar is very enjoyable, and you can customize everything about them, from what race and gender they are, to how tall or wide they are. You also distribute stat points to determine how much health, ki,  and stamina the character has, as well as how powerful each type of attack (basic, strike, ki) is.+ Large variety of clothing types that you can mix and match (some can be custom colored, some cannot).+ Huge list of skills and special attacks for you to use.- Character features, such as hair, eyes, etc. are somewhat limited. Hairs in particular have very few unique styles; many are based off existing characters.- A potential annoyance comes from how much effort is required to respec stats and redo appearance options (more on that later).Story ModeThe story mode of this game revolves around you. You're a member of the Time Patrollers, who make sure time doesn't get messed up. Obviously, the plot dictates that it does, and you get thrown into the DBZ storyline at certain points.+ Hits all of the key arcs, has some unique twists. It's nothing mind-blowing, but this is DBZ, so you kind of expect that.- Rather short; probably 6-7 hours worth, max. I wouldn't buy this game if all you're interested in is the story.GameplayYou'll be doing one of two things in this game; exploring the hub, known as Toki Toki City, or fighting things. Exploring the hub lets you buy items and clothes, talk to NPCs, and so on. But the whole core of this game is in the latter aspect, and it's what you'll be doing 90% of the time. When it comes to fighting things, you have a bit of variety in how you go about it. First, there's story mode, as you'd expect. Second, there are what are kind of like 'side-missions' known as Parallel Quests.Parallel Quests can be done offline with NPCs (or by yourself), or online with up to 2 other players. They are how a large number of clothing and special items, as well as special attacks, end up being obtained. They are entirely co-op; you and everyone else work towards the main goal of the mission, which differs depending on what it is. There are basically two varieties; beat all enemies and collect the dragonballs while beating enemies.Another important aspect of Parallel Quests are that they have conditions for unlocking special events that trigger an 'Ultimate Finish'. For example, you might have to beat a certain character before another character, or the special event won't trigger, which may lock you out of a certain skill unlock reward. Parallel Quests can be completed any number of times however, and there are a few reasons to do so, whether it be ranking or... farming items/skills.Yes, everything you can receive from a Parallel Quest is based on a roll of the dice. On the one hand, this gives the quests some replayability, and on the other, you might find this frustrating when you really want a certain skill or clothing item and find yourself farming the quest for hours without it dropping because you were unlucky. It didn't bother me much as someone who plays a lot of RPGs and Roguelikes, but I can certainly see how it could get on a person's nerves.Another thing you find in the Parallel Quests are the Dragon Balls. Yes, you can summon Shenron and make a wish, which is the only way to obtain a few of the many unlockables in this game. However, it is also the only way to respec your character's stat points, or change their physical appearance/voice set. Since collecting the Dragon Balls can take an hour or two even when you know the most efficient way to 'farm' them, it can be very annoying if you find out your build sucks and want to redo it.+ RNG aspect and special events give some decent replayability to the game.+ Gives a much-needed co-op 'PvE' option where you and a couple other guys can just beat up on Cell or something.+ Getting a new skill or item to try for a little while as you get more makes you feel less pressured and overwhelmed.- RNG aspect can also cause frustration through repetition or for people who dislike the thought of farming.- Dragon Balls, and therefore character respec and appearance edit, are locked behind RNG. Since your only other option is to level up a new character, this can be a problem.There are also a number of PvP options, including 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 player matches, 1v1 ranked matches, and Endless Battle, which is similar to any console fighting game player lobby system, where two players fight, and everyone else in the room (up to 6 players total) spectate. There is also a (as of this review) unreleased World Tournament mode. Unfortunately, this is easily the weakest aspect of the game for me.I'll put it simply; PvP is broken. Even after bug fixes to some of the worst offenders, playing PvP in this game is rarely satisfying, in part due to the flexibility of CaC, letting you mix and match the strongest skills, and in part due to some questionable design choices for some skills and Z-Souls (special ability items basically). In some respects, due to the way these function, if you want to PvP, you may be required to use specific skills if you want to be able to play at all. I'll give you an example.Super Saiyan. In this game, Super Saiyan lets you use all Super and Ultimate attacks that cost Ki for free. Normally, these cost 1 and 3 Ki bars respectively. The downside is that Super Saiyan will slowly-but-constantly drain your Ki while active, but during this time, you'll be able to fire off way more Ultimate attacks than you could have otherwise. So if someone goes Super Saiyan and starts spamming an Ultimate with super armor (which prevents flinching/interrupting the attack), you are going to die quickly and can't do much about it. There are counter skills, such as Change the Future, which can let you deal with this strategy to some extent. But there are some more powerful setups you can't do anything about.To be fair, these issues could be patched, but that's the state of the game right now. And when you do find an opponent who doesn't use a 'win-button' strategy (which is rare), it is pretty fun.+ Modes do exactly what you'd expect and want the game to.+ Combat in general is deep due to the number of skills and unique movement options.- PvP is hard to enjoy due to a few overpowered skills, attacks, and Z-Souls.SoundThere's not much to say here, the sound effects are classic and the soundtrack is memorable and well done.+ It's good.---tl;dr - Buy if you're a DBZ fan, don't mind RNG unlockables, and either don't care about PvP or are okay with DBZ-levels of power that goes on within it. This is a good, but flawed, game."

,Recommended,323470,14715414,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Nerd House,"If you're a fan of Dragon Ball in any capacity, the chances are that the story is now embedded deep within your psyche – especially if you've played even just a few of the licensed games over the years. It's hard to surprise a fan, then, because they already know the plot inside out from start to finish. Any sort of story mode is just going to be retreading the same ground again and again – and that's partly where the concept behind Dragon Ball XenoVerse comes into play.Instead of once again watching Earth's greatest warriors kick the crap out of the universe's biggest bad guys, XenoVerse incorporates time travel into a plot about Dragon Ball's history, and how it's being changed by an unknown force. Venturing to different points in the well-known timeline, it's up to you to set history back on its intended course. For example, what if the evil Raditz had avoided Piccolo's killer blow, and had emerged victorious from the fight that was meant to be his last? What if body-switching alien Ginyu had stolen Vegeta's form, and stomped our heroes before Goku ever arrived to save the day? The developer has clearly had some fun thinking up these alternate realities, and fans should really enjoy some of the more subtle touches throughout the game's story missions and subsequent cutscenes. In fact, the whole title's filled to the brim with references and nods to the original work, while the graphics recreate the universe well, with bright colours, flashy visual effects, and lightning quick animations.The best part of it, though, is that you play as your own custom character. Choosing from a selection of five different races, which includes Saiyans, Namekians, Earthlings, Majin, and Frieza's race, the character creation isn't the deepest that you'll see, but there are enough cool options on offer to keep most players happy. Your fighter is at the heart of everything that you do, as you level them up, learn new skills, and kit them out with fantastic looking accessories and clothes, many of which are taken straight from the source material. They'll even appear in cutscenes, and although your avatar isn't voiced, the franchise's consistently stellar art style still fills them with personality. You work together with many of Dragon Ball's main cast, and the game does a decent job of making you feel like you're playing an important part in Dragon Ball's legacy. All together, the story missions will last you around ten hours, but there's little doubt that if you stick around that long, you'll be trying your hand at a lot of other stuff on the side.XenoVerse certainly isn't your standard fighting game. It's far more Dragon Ball Online than it is Budokai 3, and as such, if you were looking forward to a somewhat traditional brawler, you'll be a bit disappointed. You can still play one-on-one battles both online and offline with a relatively large and unlockable character roster to pick and choose from, but with the way that the whole title's set up, you'll be much better off approaching it from a different angle altogether. Put simply, this is more of a role-playing game than an out-and-out fighter, and although it's difficult to pin the title to any specific genre, the real meat of the release comes from developing your custom character as you tackle myriad optional quests and the aforementioned story missions.Speaking of which, parallel quests are where you'll be spending a lot of your time. Essentially smaller objectives that have you taking on specific opponents in varying arenas, you'll nab rewards upon victory, which can include new techniques, clothing, or accessories. As far as special moves go, the game features just about every attack that's ever appeared in the source material, and being able to equip you own character with a slew of iconic moves will prove to be incredibly enjoyable if you're a fan.Toki Toki City is your hub, where you'll buy, sell, and combine items, as well as pick up your missions. It's also the place where you'll meet other players, challenging them to duels or adding them to your team for the next quest. You can interact through a list of short phrases, from greetings to more specific comments, and you can even perform often comical actions and pull dumb looking poses if you're keen to be the centre of attention. Many of the mentioned interactions are taken from the original work, too, so once again, fans will adore their inclusion and appreciate the attention to detail. That's not to say that the title's only playable online, though. It's perfectly enjoyable if you prefer to be alone, but you'll be missing out on some brilliantly designed player characters. Indeed, you can take a seat in the city and just watch as countless great looking fighters go about their business, and then you can take a look at their personal stats, and see what sort of rare gear they've managed to get their hands on. All in all, the developer's built a surprisingly social addition to Akira Toriyama's ever-popular creation, where fans can gather and celebrate his work.XenoVerse's outer shell is well-realised and very enjoyable, but the core of any Dragon Ball game is always going to be its combat. Unfortunately, the battle system that's on offer here isn't the best that the property has seen, but it still manages to be a competent, and above all, fun take on the source material's outrageous brawls and over-the-top action. Anyone familiar with Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z's mechanics will likely grow into this with relative ease, but here, things are more accessible, and tuned to a much better degree. You can choose to grow your custom character however you see fit, turning them into a long-range powerhouse or a melee combat specialist, for instance, and while some tactics are arguably more effective than others, any sensible build should be enough to see out the game's single player content.Whether you're taking part in a one-on-one duel or a team battle, combat is quite deliberate, and forces a certain tactical awareness. Alongside your health bar, you've got stamina and ki gauges, each of which are used to perform certain actions. Special moves deplete your ki, while stamina drains every time that you block, dodge, or make use of an evasive skill, meaning that it's particularity important to understand when it's best to use up your resources, especially near the beginning of the game, when you can only seem to manage a single teleportation before you're out of breath. At first, combat seems quite limited: you make do with the same few basic combos, a couple of not-so-special techniques, and fights quickly become repetitive. However, stick with it, and battles really begin to open up as you make use of longer combo strings, eye-watering super moves, and teleport to your heart's content. As mission difficulty increases, the artificial intelligence gets much cockier, too, which results in some pretty spectacular looking brawls as you and your opponent zip around the wide open arenas, trading blows and firing off massive beam attacks. Of course, all of the classic Dragon Ball sound effects are here as well, which gives combat that much needed oomph.If you've been holding out for a more traditional Dragon Ball fighter, Dragon Ball XenoVerse isn't it. It is, however, a well realised and refreshing take on Akira Toriyama's universe, which allows fans to appreciate the source material from a whole new angle. Accessible, fantastic combat, entirely customizable characters, and some fantastic online functionality give the game a unique identity, and arguably make it one of the most ambitious licensed titles that we've seen in years.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400086386Highly Recommended"
,Recommended,323470,14729623,"Posted: 2 March, 2015",all,Equinox,"Alright, I've played this game like crazy over the past weekend of launch, and I have to say, it has to be one of the best games within the Dragon Ball series. There are many reasons for my love of the game, however I have a few slight issues at the same time, which I will explain below (long review ahead, I really wanted to put effort into this):GraphicsThe graphics of this game are easily the most touched up and crispy visuals I've ever seen from the series of games, yet alone most games in general. Beautiful colors, appealing constructions, realistic grounds, buildings, skies, the list goes on. As soon as I saw my first Kamehameha in the game, I realized instantly that the developers of the game heavily made sure there were no dull, unappealing textures or visuals to turn your eyes away, and that a good amount of time went into making it look flashy without overdoing it. Seriously, take a look at some screenshots, those in-game graphics are very smooth and luscious. Graphics options in a game are also a great thing to have as well, right? Well, you've come to right place. Xenoverse has many options to accomodate to many computers, even if you may not have the best PC known out there. Such options include... V-Sync, Frame Rate, Antialiasing, Resolution Size, Motion Blur, Voice Language (English, Japanese), etc. Even if you may possibly worry about how intensive the game may be with its eye-inducing graphics, the options in the game are very flexible to give the gamer his/her best preferred look and feel of gaming. Honestly, the graphics alone made me want to buy the game, but of course, I had to research more into the game before carelessly buying such an expensive title.Characters & StagesNot much to say in this section. Character roster is solid, includes many characters that played major roles within the series, however some may feel disappointed with others being taken out from previous games. Everyone in the game has their own way of having an advantage over others with their movesets and abilities, and can actually stand up to stronger characters, such as Transformation and Fusion characters, which posed as a serious problem in the past games. Stages are easily manuverable and can be explored to your heart's content. Small barriers prevent you from going out of bounds, but mostly the whole battlefield can become your playground for exploring and destruction. Excellent designs and visuals for the stages as well, no problems there.GameplayThe gameplay for Xenoverse relies on a previous title, known as Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z. Personally, I did not like Battle of Z for the new style of fighting it introduced as a whole, and should've been revised before officially being released. However, this game rebuilds the fighting mechanics of its predecessor and greatly improves on the combo system, combo canceling, follow-ups on combos, everything you would expect from a good fighting game. Xenoverse emerges you into a setting where you can feel comfortable trying to string together long, powerful combos to ensure your upper edge on the opponent. Xenoverse also includes a format of fighting that allows you to team up with other players to fight against several forces, bypassing the usual restriction of having to deal with a quest that possibly may be too difficult for just one person. Unlike Battle of Z, the teammates' AI actually attempts to help you by reviving you or other downed allies in battle, even going so far as to following up from a combo that you've done to your opponent! This doesn't mean that you are able to just mash buttons and possibly try to loop your opponent and cause infinites on them. Xenoverse limits this possibility with Ki and Stamina bars, each going up to a certain amount, depending on the characters chosen. You'll have to play smart in order to play effectively with these bars in mind! Overall, I believe the gameplay is very solid and can be picked up easily with only an hour or two of practice.StoryMostly every Dragon Ball game out there has a story mode that just shows you a boring timeline and you reenacting the events from the anime. Lame, right? Well, in Xenoverse, you're able to actually able to play through the story that we all know and love, while also having its own twists and turns with a completely new element of story replayability, which shows the events of the anime rewritten to the point where the complete opposite, or even something absolutely different happens! For example, when Goku and Piccolo fight Raditz as the first threat to Earth in Dragon Ball Z, usually Raditz and Goku die from a Special Beam Cannon. The twist of this event includes Raditz escaping Goku and being able to kill both him and Piccolo. This alone brought my attention to the story more than ever, I sat at the edge of my seat waiting to see the other distortions that could occur. You'll have to play the story for yourself to see exactly what could happen with other events, but I would easily recommend knowing the original story before trying to learn the distorted story. I also recommend the story for anyone who would like to experience a detailed, thrilling storyline that makes you wonder what could happen next.Character Creation and Leveling UpNow, with the story's way of execution explained, character creation is the next subject to get into. Normally, playing with the fabled hero of the specific event you go through in Dragon Ball Z has always been a recurring event that may never get old for some. Xenoverse allows for you to create a character to go through the actual events in a different perspective! With 5 classes to choose from (Saiyan, Namekian, Earthling, Frieza Clansmen, and Majin), the possibilies are quite endless. Though there are only female classes for everything (except the Namekian and Frieza Clansmen), that alone does not bar the imagination someone could have for them. Leveling up is also another bonus the game includes, which gives the character opportunities to become stronger in the areas that are wanted, such as Health, Ki, Stamina, Basic Attacks, Strike Supers, and Ki Blast Supers. Playing through the game at your own pace allows for diversity between how you want to distribute your bonuses to your character to your preference. You're even able to give your custom character special clothing, accessories, and even Z-Souls (given for special advanages, many to find, all are different) to make them stand out more than usual. Very good execution of the system into the game, while overall adding a new experience for new and old fans of Dragon Ball Z.IssuesThere's never a game out there that has no problems with it, including an amazing title as this. Personally, I do not feel as though there are many issues with the game, but I do have a few that I would like to point out.Camera Scrolling: Feels slightly too fast or too slow, even when moving the meter up or down to a considerable setting. Also feels as if there's no middle setting to make the camera move at a normal speed.Voice Sync: Though this isn't such a big issue for myself, others who may be picky with having the mouths of the characters move in sync with the text and dialogue on the screen will see this as a problem. Sometimes, either the mouths are severely delayed, or go too fast to stay on pace with the text, which can become irritating for some to bear.Again, not much, but still deserved to be mentioned.ConclusionAll in all, I love the way Xenoverse presented itself as a whole to Dragon Ball fans. Excellent music, character roster, stages, character diversity, leveling up, going on quests, having masters from the series, fantastic graphics, suspenseful story, and the ability to play together with your friends. As a player of many previous games in the series, I recommend this game for any fan of it."

Not only is the game excellent, nice graphics, good peformance, good dragon ball z gameplay but it runs well and the mouse and keyboard controls are totally usable. This is probably the best dragon ball z game since the ps2 games. Also if for some reason you like the japanese voices (I didn't ever personally and I usually hate dubs) there is a voice language select.The character customization is great. You can find different equipment to put on that will raise (and lower) stats. You do this by doing missions and then drop from enemies similar to mmos. Special moves and ultimate moves work the same way. You can also choose a master to learn moves from (krillin, vegeta, and even the villians). They teach you their own move sets depending on how long you are their apprentice and how much you level up.The story is pretty good, you are basically a time warrior fixing problems in time due to histories changing and helping the z warriors in different battles."

,Recommended,323470,32716270,Posted: 24 June,all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"I *mildly* recommend this game, and with a caveat that you must have some form of interest or history with the Dragonball series, which is fairly common among people that grew up in the 90's and had basic cable. If you don't care for Dragonball then skip it, since the game is arguably below average.Xenoverse is a game about Trunks calling forth someone to assist him in fixing tears in time whereby events have been altered from how they were originally supposed to occur. That person is you: you assist Trunks in fixing the timeline by going to various battles in Dragonball history and defeating enemies. I won't ruin the plot but there's a reason why the timeline is being altered; but the main draw here is that you get to see various ""what-if"" scenarios to past battles in the Dragonball Franchise and have your avatar participate in them. That's certainly part of the draw, and if you know absolutely nothing of the series it means a lot less to you, and a portion of the draw disappears. You don't need to be up to date on Dragonball and know everything there is to know to enjoy this, but remembering the sagas and details on a few of the occurences should sustain you enough to enjoy this.There's no exploration involved in this game, no traversing a map, and no sidequests that involve anything other than fighting people in large open areas. Even the hubworld is rather empty and just a means to show characters created by other players, which is admittedly interesting. Otherwise I'm a bit let down; the inclusion of more exploratory aspects in the Dragonball universe isn't something that is necessarily *missing* here, as the package works as is. When something is *missing* it's something that is required by the final product and its absence is conspicous-its inclusion would solve issues. There are no issues here with a game mainly focused on arena battles, but its inclusion would certainly 'upgrade' the package and added to the experience.So what of the battles? Well, the game's fights all occur in large arenas and attacks occur in two formats: close range combat and projectile blasts. You have two buttons for attacks (one weak, one strong) and one button dedicated to energy blasts (hold for continous blasts). Since the game has massive arenas, most battles, just as in the show, are characters flying in the air speeding into one another like car crashes waiting to happen, and attacking each other in quick succession. This has its ups and downs.For one thing, the look of the game and the battles is fairly faithful to the show itself; everyone is flying around punching each other quickly in the air and bodies are flying far away with each finishing punch, which creates distance between combatants and prompts more flying towards one another for more blows.But the fight system is fairly simple. A two button melee system means that the combo system is barebones and revolves around, like, 10 different combinations of X and Y in 4 button strings. Additionally, because there is always massive distance between combatants and you're always closing large gaps by flying incredibly fast, you'll often find yourself in situations where youre missing punches (both you and the CPU) and flying slightly past your target and punching the air. It's not a big deal, and it's not as if you'll be stuck doing long animations or anything, but it happens a lot and shows how combat isn't as tight as it can be. When you DO land a punch on an enemy your combo will go off without a hitch, and you can continue it with more attacks, but its worth noting that you might find yourself trying to land that first punch for 7 or so seconds.Worth noting is how useless the projectile button is. Enemies can simply move out of the way. Ironically these long range attacks are better used in close range. For all intents and purposes this games meant to be played up close to the enemy, which sort of defeats the purpose of huge arenas when its mostly you trying to run up to the enemy-you can cut the middle man and just reduce arena size but that would also take an aspect of the anime away from the game.This game can be played single player, but you can also play quests and battle with other players. This game has a sort of Borderlands feel in that it can certainly be done single player, but the developers seemed to have multiplayer in mind. You can still ""recruit"" characters that show up in the hubworld that are created by other players, so you don't even need to necessarily interact with others in order to play with their creations. Other characters certainly help in the game, but it's not a requirement to passing the storymode or optional sidequests.All in all the game feels like the older beat-em ups. Simple fighting system; multiplayer optional and makes the experience more enjoyable. I still enjoyed going through all these DBZ battles that I somehow remembered (not vividly, mind you) despite having watched the show when I was, like, 9, which kept me from getting bored. Ultimately you have a simple arena fighter/beat em up with a lot of customization, a beautiful engine, a multiplayer and co-op component that makes this ideal for a romp with friends, but a single player experience that still provides a decent amount for people familiar with the series. I'd say it's worth somewhere in the vicinity of 20 dollars.Lightly recommended, especially to fans of the series that like the idea of being in battles in the series. Otherwise I'd say this game is below average, so 4/10. I'd tell most people to skip it unless they're fans of Dragonball-if you don't care for the series you'll most likely get bored after 6 or so hours. There were sidequests, and I typiucally play games to completion, but I couldn't be bothered with this one, so it should signify that this package is mostly about the Dragonball and the story more than anything else (as the sidequests have no story to them other than a brief sentence).I hear Xenoverse 2 is basically this but better-I've yet to play it so I went ahead and reviewed this one on its own merits. I doubt I'll play X2 since this game isn't interesting enough for me to want to buy the next one, but if I do I'll throw in a paragraph on that at a later date."

Of course you can also find the song ""CHA-LA, HEAD CHA-LA!"" in the game.From time to time there can be online server issues and you will get disconnected or you just can not connect.Overall, it is still a must have for fans of the Dragon Ball series. For others who are not familiar with the series it is probably too repetitive.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

A distortion in time has occured, and you must be the one to stop it. You will be summoned by Trunks, and the story revolves around your custom-made character. I have seen many comments on the combat, and how it seems shallow. I don't really agree with this, though, as I found the combat to be rather fun. You can choose to button-smash, but if you have skills and timing, you can get a long way. A controller is highly advised though, as it makes everything easier.PROS:- Interesting story- Lots of skills and clothes- RPG-elements- You don't have to purchase the DLC, but it's a nice addition.- Custom characters (!!)- Parallel quests- Masters you can train under (Frieza, #18, Cell and many more!)- Multiplayer is fairly stable now- Collecting Dragon Balls can be grindy, but summoning Shenron and wishing, definitely makes it worthwhile ;)CONS:- I highly recommend a controller. I had a hard time playing with keyboard & mouse.- Tokitoki city is pretty big, and you have to walk around to each seperate booth to get things going.- Lacks some characters (Zarbon, Dodoria, #16 and the likes)- The DLC doesn't add a whole lot, yet is expensive (25 euros for season pass)- I found the Great Apes to be a bit clunky, but I suppose it is understandable with those huge models.- You have to grind levels quite a lot- Combat is pretty simple, and I understand why passionate fighting-genre fans would find it shallow. I enjoy it, nonetheless.TL;DR:If you are a fan of Dragon Ball, you will most likely enjoy this game (get a controller, though!)If you are a fan of the fighting genre, and want in-depth combat, you should probably look elsewhere."

I bought this game thinking building my own character would be very interesting! and it is! how they put it into the story makes me actually feel pretty unique.

Thats actually kinda upseting but it's alright.The other thing you need to be aware of is that end game revolves around two type of players, An android build which never uses Ki Blasts and just lives off fighting, or the SSJ Spammer.

But all the reviews are painfully outdated, just like the game.It's not worth buying. The only way to right this is probably a free weekend followed by a sale.Cons-No one plays anymore. It is VERY hard to find a duel with someone at your skill level, no one plays ranked, barely anyone ever plays co-op. Even at Peak NA hours, or right after school for kids, or weekends, I've tried them all lately and seen a max of 10 people online.-The game was designed as an MMO, unlike other DBZ games. Right now with no playerbase, the party fighting system feels pretty clunky to solo the game with.-The grind. It follows a normal MMO-grind system, if it was at release; you had people to party with for the quests making the grind seem less. But you don't anymore so you are forced to play with:-Absolutely terrible AI. You won't notice it at first, but after you start getting more skilled at the game and learning mechanics, you'll see just how terrible the CPUs are. They don't break guards, they don't dodge super abilities with charge up times, (Think kamehameha- while you charge, they just sit there, dont even block). And generally they have the reaction time of potatoes. This was okay, because the game was designed to be played online, with other players, to quest together- but no one is left to do that.-Stat modifiers are tied into what outfit you're wearing. So, wanna fire badass kamehameha's? Don't equip Goku's Beerus Gi, it reduces your Ki attack modifier by the maximum. ChiChi's world tournament outfit helps that stat more.-Certain abilities are still IMBA as hell. Regeneration's tick rate in the game is determined not by time, but by your FPS. So if you have 100+ FPS with regeneration skills, you're broken.-Price still $50.00+Redeeming features+Gorgeous manga style game+Really good original story+Combat really makes you feel like your in the original series+Character creation is really nice, There are 5 races, each with their own racials, mostly balanced+Height, weight, and even gender effect a characters balance between health, speed, Ki, and striking techniquesI was late to the party. I really enjoy the single player story but without people to play a game that was designed to be an MMO at its heart, its dreadfully boring. Imagine playing world of warcraft without players, and you get the idea.If you think $50 for a single player beat-em-up with a grindy level system set in the Dragonball universe is worth it, I'd still recommend it. But I expected to be able to have online matchmaking at the very least."

,Recommended,323470,15311668,"Posted: 11 April, 2015",all,Caramel Frappe,"This is one of those games based off an anime that's actuallygood. I was worried at first I admit, but the people behind Dragon Ball: XENOVERSE put a lot of care into this game and I haven't even completed all of it yet! But I have played enough to understand and get a grasp of things.Pros:You get to create a character of your own based off the DBZ races ... even Buus!Character creation holds a lot of variety, even though some sections are limited.Most if not all cutscenes show your character in them, executed with swell animation.Fighting mechanics are well done, action packed and gives you that rush per battle.Able to customize your skills with almost any ki / martial art that exists in the DBZ universe.Side quests aren't annoying and reward you with loot that's worth working for.Co-op is extremely awesome in this game, and can make quests way funner.Boss battles are fair, challenging but fair ... also difficulty doesn't change if you bring friends along.The mini map is simple and very helpful in finding what section holds what.Dialogue isn't cheesy and sometimes the actors will cuss, satisfying those who like that.You're allowed to have 4 pages of taunts, which your character + other people's can do for fun.Your character's build can go however you want them to be, either powerful in melee, ki blasts, or other.Able to join the villains in their optional quests to take down the heroes.There are trainers in which will teach you very useful abilities, along with sometimes aiding you in matches.Able to customize your character with clothing / armor you've unlocked and most can have their color changed.Extremely addicting game with a ton of replayability and benefits for which race you go as every time.Easy to make friends in this game because of how important each player is during a mission.NPCs will start to respect you the more you level up, sometimes even wanting to be trained under you.Main campaign is interesting, villains are cool and yes you can eventually obtain their armor.Able to play as any DBZ character you unlocked outside of your created character during any side quest.Some cutscenes are animated that match the show, while the voice acting is well done since most dubs suffer.Cons:NPCs in PvP is somewhat unbalanced, while custom characters in PvP is absolutely broken. Some characters can one shot you with 3 bars of ki off the bat, while others have abilities that they can spam and stun lock you for ages. Most of the PvP also consists of hackers & cheaters, leaving people avoiding PvP altogether which is a shame.Sometimes, even doing a quest / mission flawlessly will leave you with a C ranking simply becasue you didn't trigger the optional random event. These events happen at random, which is usually out of the player's control.For very good loot, you sometimes have to grind for awhile. Performance doesn't trigger a better chance of obtaining loot.If you're playing with three people, sometimes they can hog the enemy which leaves you having to race in landing a hit. This is especially true if you need to melee enemies to gather ki.Certain abilities that you can get early outmatch the late game ones by a landslide, making the game too easy.During certain parts of the mission, you will be given horde rush of enemies leaving you either bored or hurting.If your partner is down and you need to revive them, it's likely you will be unable to because it takes awhile to fully revive them while the enemy is constantly beating on you.There's no feature to see how clothes / armor will look on you when shopping... so it's only when you have obtained the equipment are you allowed to see how it'll look.Certain enemies will transform in a cutscene, even while you're doing a combo or using a special attacking, meaning you've wasted that because the cutscene kicked in.Certain side quests are brutally harder than 7 stars, despite they're only 4-6 stars. Some 7 stars are laughably easy.Cannot change or alter your stats without having to make a whole new character.Most armor / clothing until late game is useless for stat benefits. Some even harm you by going negative on an important section, hindering you despite wanting to wear it for fashion purposes.You can fail a mission because an NPC died on yah, despite you've done everything to ensure survival.Takes a long while at first to earn XP or zin (money) unless a friend is willing to let you ride with em on very difficult levels for the benefits of getting easy XP and zin without earning it.Hard to understand the mechanics since the game doesn't do a good job explaining things. Only experience and playing will help you understand what does what exactly.Lips don't move while characters are talking sometimes, breaking immersion.All in all, this game is amazing though. The pros for certain, outweigh the cons and I adore what we've been given here. This is a game that DBZ fans will love for months while non fans shall still enjoy the daylights out of this game. You want to be a Sayian who looks like you, but can still go Super Sayian and do all the things you've seen in the show? You can! Want to be Freiza's race and wreck everything with death beams or super spirit bombs with one hand? You can! Want to have a female Buu who's super adorable but can kick the crap out of Broly hand-to-hand?? You can! This game lets you have that, and I appreciate it. I especially love seeing my custom character in the cutscenes being vital to the story. Not to mention this game is only $49.99 right now on Steam and will definitely go on price during Steam Sales. Worth full price in my eyes."

,Recommended,323470,14742303,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,「東亜」ポプ子社長,"March 7th: The review has been updated. Check the bottom of the review for more detailsHave beaten the game a few days ago. Now, if you are looking for a review with some details, and if you are still not sure whether you should buy this game or not, then read on.First, many people seem to be talking about the whole connection issues, and yes, it appears you need to be connected to the Xenoverse server in order to even play offline. But do you get disconnected so often that, it is almost unplayable? Not really. Most of the time, the offline mode works without any issues. But usually the online mode is off, and you most likely will end up seeing the message stating that the Xenoverse online is currently off. But yes, this game basically requires you to level up and all anyway (Unfortunately I have not done the online mode yet, so I might add some more to this review when I get my hands on it), so in the end, you should have no problem playing the game, at least the offline mode. And I will explain why the game is made like an MMORPG later in the review.Now, let me point out the things that make this game ""good"".First, the combat system. If you are thinking this game might be the Battle of Z 2.0, then please give it a chance. This is ABSOLUTELY nothing like the Battle of Z, and feels nothing like that game, either. First, Battle of Z, as far as I know, is pretty slow when you want to rush right into the enemy, in fact, you can't really do that. And many people complained how the game feels a lot more like a strategy game. But thankfully, as the game was made by different company (Dimps, the company that made the most famous DB game ever, Budokai 3), this game really focuses more on action, and the game is quite engaging. Many of the missions can be pretty hard, in fact, you must keep grinding in order to even stand a chance against stronger opponents and beat harder missions (So yes, this game is like an RPG game). And you might be thinking ""Are you serious? I am not buying a game like that, that sounds like wasting a lot of time"", but it shouldn't take much time to level up fast, only if you knew where to level up. But yes, just like an RPG game, there are status effects like poison and such. Probably this is the first fighting game that has so many RPG elements in it.And yes, the game might be hard, but compared to the Battle of Z, this game is very forgiving and a lot easier to unlock more characters. The game is challenging, but it is challenging enough to make you come back and grind more, so if you like the Dragonball franchise and good fighting games, you will most likely be playing this game for hours.There are many (But not THAT many as far as I know) clothes that you can buy, and also there are many skills that you can buy as well. And getting trained by the DB characters and get new sets of skills is pretty interesting, too.Now, on to the problems of the game.As I have mentioned, the whole combat system is fun and engaging. However, in most cases, the environments can not really be destroyed. Sure, there are houses and many places that are breakable, only making the game look far more fancier during the battle, but when you use wave-style beams and such, you can see the ground being destroyed due to it, but the destroyed part disappears instantly. It is pretty much a small thing to think about, but I really wish the destroyed parts could just stay destroyed.And I wish I could see how big the map is. When I try to run away from strong enemies, I end up finding myself pushing the invisible barrier, as the barrier does not appear until you are right near it. This can be pretty irritating, as the enemies can come right at you pretty fast and you just don't know how big the stage is. Well, probably you will understand when you play the game, especially when you want to run away from real tough enemies.And now, I really am not sure why Dimps had to just put the elements of Dragonball Online. Towa and Mira, the main enemies of Xenoverse are basically the original characters that first appeared in Dragonball Online. And the whole character creation idea and such basically is from the DB Online as well. Dragonball Online is the Korean-made MMORPG that failed to be successful, and probably Bandai Namco just could not let go of the elements from DB Online, so I am assuming that led them to make the Xenoverse like a ""successor"" to the DB Online. But in reality, because of this, basically there are times that you can not even play offline since you need to be connected to the Xenoverse server. The chance of not being able to play the offline is around 10%, which is not a lot (And most of the time you can just log in when you just try again anyway), but it still can be pretty irrtating for many players. And since the game functions more like an MMORPG, if you want to play 1 vs 1 or 3 vs 3 type of game modes, you must first ""log in"" and then go to the place where there are robots and ask them. I am not really sure why anyone needs to be walking all the way just to play those modes (Even though it takes around 10 seconds to get there from the starting point, if my memory serves me correctly).I mean, I can see Bandai Namco wanted an MMORPG type Dragonball game, but I think they could've made this a little bit easier and more convenient.But honestly, as you can see, my complaints are pretty much minor things. The story mode is all about a new story, so you will enjoy the story mode if you are a fan of Dragonball franchise, and I believe as a Dragonball game, I can just tell you that it is very entertaining.And I can say personally, this is ""the Game of the Year"".And maybe I could say, finally ""the Game for the Dragonball Fans"".530,000 out of 10 (You'd know what 530,000 is, if you know DB)*UPDATE*----Let me point out some more things that I forgot to mention.*Graphics: 9.5 out of 10Now, many people have wondered what kind of graphics it will get. A PS3 version or a PS4 version. Turns out, both versions are not all that different in the end. The main difference between them was the FPS. And guess what, the PC users can enjoy 60FPS, so I would say the PC version is as good as the PS4 version, if not the same (My Steam FPS counter usually says I get around 58~62FPS). So, if you are worried about the graphics of the PC version, don't be. In fact, I never really cared about the graphics throughout the entire game, and I bet no one really does.*Gameplay: 9.5 out of 10The Battle of Z felt really slow, weak and the difficulty of the game was a nightmare. I personally liked DB Raging Blast 2, but I actually like this one more since the game can be a lot more chaotic once there are so many enemies against you or when it is 3 vs 3. I just beat the secret campaign which unlocks two of the very famous Saiyan characters and the first mission, my goodness was it hard. But that mission surely tested my skills fully, and when I beat the mission, I was pretty happy with the fact that I could've finished it. It really is that thing that makes this game so fun. Challenging, very engaging and rewarding."

It took me awhile to figure out what it was holding me back, but after some replaying and hearing my friend’s experiences I figured out what it was.I'll start with the pros of this game- Finally a good online for the DBZ Universe- Good replay-ability- Great character customization- All the skills you could hope for- Level up system- Just enough grinding to keep you interested- Tons to do with friends or by yourself- And the graphics somehow make everything feel better even the negative things- More...And here are my cons- Bad launch day servers- PVP is not balanced- SSJ is about spamming skills not powering up....- All playable characters are EXTREMELY WEEK compared to custom even the ones you have to wish for- Unsecure servers (Hackers/Glitches/Exploits)- And here is the main reason that weighs on me why this game does not get a 10/10... The storyline, first time I played through the storyline I felt like wow that's pretty cool I get to see every one of the Z warriors right? Well the fact is not only is the story line short, but it is weak in plot and the worst part about is that the fact that your character is basicly NON EXSISTANT! I would go back in time wanting to be part of the Z warriors hear Goku say wow your strong lets battle sometime, but no every person I run into is like wait was someone just here? I understand it's to balance the timeline and all, but it still felt overall lacking and the main reason I can't give this game a 10/10.So in short this game is amazing it gives you almost everything you can want in a DBZ game from skills to characters, but it lacks just enough where it matter to earn a 9/10 it would be lower but the game is great enough to carry its own slack of having a poor storyline where you feel nonexistent and some non balanced moves and exploits/glitches."

You'll eventually get used to the several cons that I've listed as you keep playing since they don't really ruin the experience too much, if at all, and some of my personal dislikes are rather petty, while the rest come from the fact that I prefer the Tenkaichi series (particularly the combat system).

,Not Recommended,323470,14729882,"Posted: 2 March, 2015",all,Litigation Hammer,"I really wish I could recommend this, but there's just too much bad mixed in with the awesome.THE GOOD-You can make your own character. Let's be real, this is the main selling point and it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.-CaC has 5 different races with unique racials and quite a few different costumes to play dress up in. There's a small variety of body types and pieces, so for the most part you'll end up with something that looks close to that OC you made when you were 7.-It plays like the Budokai Tenkaichi series; it really captures the feeling of Dragon Ball battles. Movement feels great and there are a lot of different movement options available to you.-3v3 (or more when playing against the AI) is really chaotic and fun, even if it's not perfectly balanced.-The master system adds some amusing lines from many different characters. Cell would hug you if that's something he did.-They tried to mix up the story with revisions in history. I always enjoyed the What If story modes in previous Dragon Ball games; in this installment What Ifisthe main story.-There are so many different supers and ultimates in this game, and quite a few have utility beyond dealing huge damage.THE BAD-The servers are absolutely awful. It's unlikely you'll get into the multiplayer lobby on your first 5 tries, and even if you do there's no guarantee you won't be booted back to the title screen after one mission. I cannot stress this enough, you can't even play single player if the servers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves, which they often are. There's no excuse for this; I should not have to struggle this much to play offline single player even.-While the CaC is awesome in concept, there are few physical customization options. You will see many characters that look almost identical to your own. This extends to the clothing options. While there are many to choose from, you soon realize how little outfits there really are, especially since many of the lower parts, for instance, are identical except for color changes.-Combat is very fast paced but also very simplistic. Your combo list is comprised of when you start pressing Y instead of B. Due to the lack of balance, you can breeze through most fights by maxing your Ki Blast Supers parameter and just spamming supers and ultimates. Any depth really comes from loadouts and movement.-The game seems to lack polish. For instance, when your character turns Super Saiyan your hair doesn't change models, it just turns gold. That was quite a let down. Another example is the dialogue found in story mode. There are numerous typos and scripting errors, and the lip sync simply doesn't exist. Sometimes it's funny (Yamcha will declare that he defeated Cell), but regardless it shows a lack of care.-The hub world seems very lifeless and flat. The only way to traverse it is by walking or jumping, which does nothing of value. You can't fly or run. While you can pose your character with a handful of emotes, you can't really interact with anybody in the hub world. Chat is restricted to premade phrases, and characters will pop in and out of existance before your very eyes. There's also no guarantee you'll end up in the same instance as your friends, so trying to team up with them can be a little frustrating, especially when paired with the server problems.-The look of the game is very bright, neon, and harsh in my opinion. It is overwhelmingly bright and full of bloom.-There seems to be many DLC character packs in the works for this game. While DLC isn't necessarily a bad thing, I doubt the pricing will be fair, especially when they're offering a season pass.-I praised the game's story mode earlier, but I have to say that as far as What If stories go, this game's story lacks depth. Most revisions of history happen in the prologue of each saga--that is to say you don't actually experience any of these revisions. Mostly what you experience are the same fights that happened in the series, except your enemy will revive 3 or 4 times. They could have done a lot more with this and it's disappointing that the main selling point aside from the CaC is so shallow.-The grind is real in this game. Due to some messed up RNG, the secondary phase of each quest isn't guaranteed to take place even if you satisfy the requirements. Even if it does happen, you're not guaranteed to get a drop, much less the drop you want that's specific to that mission. This leads to a lot of frustrating repeats of the same mission over and over while you pray that the skill you want finally drops. God help you if you're going for a full outfit. God can't help you if the servers are having a tough day.Despite the descrepency of pros listed compared to cons listed I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't. I'm glad a Dragon Ball game has been released on PC, and I'm glad they finally implemented a character creation system in a Dragon Ball setting. I have fun when I play this game, but I recognize that the fun I have stems almost entirely from watching my character in action, and it's despite many glaring flaws. That fun is also combined with a large helping of frustration. My hope for this game is that it's the Budokai 1 or Budokai Tenkaichi 1 of the series; those two games were enjoyable but objectively flawed games that led the way to spectacular and inovative second and third installments. A Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 or 3 that followed that pattern would be absolutely astounding.Finally, if you are a diehard Dragon Ball fan, you will enjoy this game. If that's you then go ahead and get it. You probably won't regret it."

Seriously, I've wanted a game like this since I was 10. But, and this must be said, it is NOT a complete game by any means, and there are many obvious cut corners to consider.That said, it's a game where your choices in character builds and loadouts are fundamentally important to your overall effectiveness when moving through the story. The game in this regard, is an unbalanced piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, published by a company with one of the worst business models for fixing and balancing, or even acknowledging that they made a mistake in the first place. If you aren't keeping your head in the meta, or doing your proper research for the best builds, you will tear your hair out at how difficult the game will be for you.The in-game social system and matchmaking is completely♥♥♥♥♥backwards if you intend to do anything with friends (Here's a video example of how poorly crafted the friend's system ishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeLMWu6j8-g).Levelling is grindy, which by itself isn't a problem, but there is a distinct lack of content to keep it fresh. There are plenty of new and nostalgic scenarios for you to fight in, but most of it is made up of recycled maps and characters.The voice acting is really off and on (they got the genuine Chris Rager as Hercule goin' on which accounts for a great deal of forgiveness from me). A good portion of the voice acting is god awful as the replacements for the original cast are painfully obvious to anyone familiar with the series.For nostalgia's sake, it was definitely worth the 12 bucks I paid for it. 100 hours even for full price is really pushing it.

The combat is surprisingly indepth. The character customization is thorough enough to set yourself apart from the rest of the player-base (and the DBZ Character Universe). The story  is engaging enough and all the animated cut-scenes genuinely feel like you're watching a new addition to the DBZ Movie Franchise.

,Recommended,323470,14839933,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,RavenousDash,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible because there's a lot to say about this one. If you're a Dragon Ball fan, you're gonna want to buy this. It's probably the greatest DBZ game in years, if not ever. The biggest selling point and the biggest reason why it's so good is the character creator. You can choose between 5 different races: Majin (male or female), Saiyan (M or F), Earthling (M or F), Namekian, or Frieza Clansman. It's really difficult to choose, not only between race and gender, but between all the different appearance options available and will keep you busy for quite a while. That's the nature of a good character creator. Every single special move in the game can be unlocked and equiped by your character, allowing a lot of possibilities. Iconic costumes and other equipment can be bought or unlocked to personalize your character. RPG elements allow you to level up the way you want to by putting points into different stats.The fighting system can best be compared to the Budokai Tenkaichi series. You can move/fly around freely in an arena and lock on to opponents. It's fun but probably not too deep, though there is room for creativity with the custom move sets. There's an interesting story mode that puts a new spin on the all too familiar storyline of DBZ. It's great to see them doing something original with a story that has been done to death in practically every game in the series. It doesn't go over everything, only important fights, so some characters you may have expected aren't present. That being said, the character roster isn't huge like Tenkaichi 3's, but your custom character is probably the only one you'll end up using most of the time.Toki Toki city, the game's central hub is a bit cumbersome to traverse. Instead of using a menu you have to use the ""services"" in this city to access things like online battles and quests. Some faster movement speed or more streamlining would have been nice. Speaking of quests, the game employs an RNG system with item drops, turning the game into a grind sometimes. Each quest has certain possible items as rewards, but since it's random you'll end up playing the quest again and again until you get what you want. You either hate or tolerate this. If you don't mind this Monster Hunter-esque grinding it's probably not a big deal. You'll have to grind for experience anyway, since some of these quests and missions are brutally difficult, sometimes unfairly so.The biggest problem right now is the Xenoverse server. It's unreliable and goes offline at the drop of a hat. I've been able to play offline most of the time, but I've frequently been booted back to the main menu because the server went offline (luckily this only seems to happen while in the hub area and not during quests or missions) . I've also been stuck on the ""logging in"" screen 2 or 3 times. It's an issue I hope will be fixed. I don't see why I need to be logged in on the server if I want to play offline. Online matches work decently in my experience, some annoying lag sometimes, though you can do online battles even when you're in the single player lobby. You can also do online co-op for the quests (not the story), which is great!Graphics and performance wise there's nothing to criticize. It looks and runs great. Maybe some more AA would have been nice, but oh well. I noticed putting the glare to high eats up the framerate a bit, but I found it to be painful to the eyes anyway.I could go on and on about the things I would have liked to see more of, like bigger roster, voice acting for the custom character, more destructible terrain etc. Maybe a possible sequel will deliver that. What's here is totally worth full price if you're a Dragon Ball fan. Gave me a serious fangasm for sure. And trust me, I didn't talk about everything that makes this game so awesome. You'll have to see for yourself."
,Recommended,323470,15012844,"Posted: 22 March, 2015",all,Agimond,"I must admit this game is pretty good but at the same time it has a few niggly bits that irritate me.The story mode itself is impressive, I 100% enjoyed the campaign missions from start to finish and the story was well done with all the action packed interaction with the DBZ universe that you would want your own character to have.I love the combat, I love the customization I love the Mentor system and I love the nostalgia this game has ripped from my childish heart and thrown back into my face giving me a renewed love for the Dragon Ball Series in general.The problems start for me when you get to the Parallel Quests (PQs), The Dragon balls, The Transformations and the large neglect of the simple feature of charging your Ki in battle.To kick off the rant lets go straight to the major one for me, or rather the major pair, Transformations and Ki Charging.In Xenoverse your character can have 4 super abilities and 2 ultimates and 1 evasion skill. Now the Evasion skill is cool, Its costly to use but grants you instant escape from deadly situations as long as you remember to use it (and use it wisely). No issues there, but then we get on to the supers. Kaioken, a transformation ability which as we all know grants you alot of power with a massive strain on the body, This is utilised as a Transformation that grants you a small increase in stats that constantly depletes stamina and should you at any point run out of stamina you are thrown back into ""Normal Mode"". Great, but its a super skill. . . . Not a stand alone skill slot. Well I can live with that I have 4 Super skill slots after all but then we move to super saiyan, No explanation required here but the transformation to super saiyan give allows you to spam and I mean NON STOP CONSTANTLY USE ONE AFTER THE OTHER any skill that requires Ki and they don't use up energy, Instead Super Saiyan itself constantly drains Ki but if your only in SSJ1 then the depletion is very slow, and its placed in an Ultimate slot, So first off the issue is, Why didn't transformations get their own skill slot and their own key binding. This would have made alot more sense and I can't sit here and pick off all the bad and good points of the implemented system but I guess if you play it yourself you would probably agree with me in the end that the Transformations needed their own function. Next, SSJ, Over powered and not the somewhat balanced unless you use it right kind of way, I mean out right game breaking, sure you have to get to the right saga and unlock it through PQs or buy it from the shop but once you get it you can steam roll the rest of the game (and i know, Thats how I completed it the first time) by simply equipping SSJ and Final Flash to your ultimates, Charging your ki to the max at any given time, Transforming and spamming the living S*** out of your target til it dies. This is also a tactic used in PVP sadly which turns DBZ into a long range sniping game rather than its original Martial arts style fights.This brings me on to the next one which is charging your Ki, You can charge your ki in the game, Yup indeed you can, If you equip it as a skill. In all other previous DBZ titles that I have played charging your Ki was a bread and butter skill that everyone could do and it didn't need to be set as a skill or anything, Now if your looking to charge ki it must be set as a Super Skill. Sure ok 1 of 4 no problem, but then you want to add Kaioken... Now your down to 2 skills slots, and the Saiyans have 3 skill slots and a transformation. It may seem like I'm calling out the saiyans as overpowered themselves but the actual base character stats and abilities at the beginning of the game make for good even fights. Its the progression that eventually breaks them up and sends saiyans flying to the top of the pile (Fair enough thats what the dragon ball universe did but this is a game, should it not be a level playing field?).With those out of the way lets move on to the gripes that people will indeed share with me, Parallel quests, the main thing you will be doing in the game because you will probably hit a wall in one of the story mode missions and need to beef up.  The hold all the skills, Items, Costumes and other things that you will want for your character or to unlock new clothes/setups for the preset DB Characters (Which cannot be editted btw, you mearly select different setups).These PQs are a Grind fest, and unfortunately its an RNG fun fest, You could be there minutes, you could be there hours, it all depends on what the game feels like at the time. This turns what is a key component of the game into a Key Flaw and you will feel the rage within your first day or 2 of playing and you will feel it sooooo hard.This leads on to the Dragonballs, Dragonballs can only be collected from Certain PQs and only if certain conditions are met for some them, RNG is back with a vengence with these little blighters, I got really lucky with my first set and I aquired the whole 7 in 2 days (2 6 hour sessions) but after that I have hit the mother load of walls and aches and pains and rage session and just disappointment. I have 3 Dragonballs and have not seen another one in a week, I played for about 3 hours each day and I only played the missions where the dragonballs or rather the ""Time Patrollers"" who you have to defeat to get them, Appear. Its too much and I'm repeating the same things over and over and it has got really tedious.But now that the b******* is over I can move on to a suprising conclusion. The game is irritating, It is sometimes soul crushing but I would not stop myself from buying it if I had trunk's time machine. For what its worth its a great throw back into Dragonball. The Custom Character interactions with the Dragonball universe made me feel awesome, Immersion was there, the fun, excitement and fan girlish screaming all included. Although I went in depth on the flaws they are the only ones that Irritate me, everything else about the game is brilliantly done.Overall 7/10, Worth the money, Worth the time and if you can play multiplayer with your friends, even better."

There is something about screaming off the top of your lungs to suddenly spring sick abs and pecs along with a sweet gold dye job that allows you to brutally maim and vaporise your greatests enemies.Dragonball Xenoversecapitalises on this tempation by allowing you to create your own Dragonball fighter and take him, or her, out on a cruise through DBZ history and beat up everyone.Dragonball Xenoversepushes something resembling a plot, which is highly unusual for a DBZ game. You're mighty warrior, brought forth by the eternal dragon to help Trunks patrol the past. It appears that some overdesigned bonus villain is causing trouble in and accross the Dragonball Z timelines. You are sent back in time to prevent any horrible changes to the timeline and to save the world in the process.It works. Dragonball has been retold so many times that it is nice that they actually took the time to find a excuse for fighting Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Buu again. Because Dragonball is currently being revived in Japan (á la Frankenstein's monster mind you, with new parts sewn to it) it also includes the new stuff that barely makes any sense on a power scale; but we'll roll with it because no one is going to complain about extra content in game.The game revolves around combat. You control one guy/gal who can fly, punch and shoot beams from his/her hand. Over time you learn new moves like the iconic Kamehameha, Galic Gun, Final Flash, Spirit Bomb, Death Beam and the ""Big Ball of Destruction"". Your character levels up and you can allocate the points to your liking. Want to shoot more beams? Pump more points into Ki. Need more oomph? Put some into attack. You get the gist. At the very beginning you get to choose and build your character. You get to pick from humans, saijins, nameks, buus, and frieza's race (they didn't name them...) Each has its own ups and downs, but the end result is up to you entirely. I went with a frieza in the hope to transform four times in a row while making deragatory remarks at my foes. But, alas, only Saijins get to go blonde. Friezas get fast, very fast. So fast in fact that my final build focussed exclusively on chasedowns and pinball style beatdowns in favour of big beam attacks. It's fun, and even if you feel like you mess up you can collect the dragonballs to redo your design. Your character will quickly take a place among the steroid enhanced cast as you mingle with them and fight alongside.The game can be divided into three different modes. First is the story mode; which as mentioned sends you back in time to fight a major battles again. Second are the Parallel Quests. A large collection of battles against the CPU. Each battle contains a different challenge for you to tackle, but most of it can be brought down to: beat up the enemy -fast-. You can do these quests with up to two other players. Completing quests unlocks new attacks, costumes and other powerups. Last, there are the VS modes where you fight other players.Diving into the game will quickly show you how Japanese this game is. Hardly anything is explained to you. The past two decades in game development created a distinctive rift between western and Japanese games. Where western games are generally more refined and contain clear instructions on what to, the Japanese games generally are filled to the brim with content and fan service without a single hint on how to unlock any of it. This the daunting problemDragonball Xenoversepresents. Especially on a western developer focussed platform such as Steam, this can come across as a bit of an obstacle. Luckily punching stuff does wonders, but getting in deep, like knowing where to get the attacks, the costumes and the hidden trainers will require you to search the web. The lack of a proper learning tool quickly alienates newcomers, especially the ones who try VS first and quickly find out that the cool battles they were looking for are not here. Most battles revolve around spamming beams faster than the other player.The uncommunicative nature of game is found more jarringly in the unlock system. The entire system; no matter how good you are at the game, is based on luck. Everything drops at random. Many legends circle the web about how to force certain drops, but the methods are so far apart you're never able to pick the one that works. The randomness of the game is rather annoying. Especially if you want your character to learn Frieza's Death Ball, but the game won't drop it; even after playing the same mission over and over again. Much worse, the hidden stage missions also trigger at random. So you're not even sure if you can actually roll for a drop. This could have been streamlined by actually making drops related to the method used to beat the enemy; like killing Cell with a Super Kamehama would force a drop from Cell. Instead the game would have you shoot Cell with said beam 100 times before giving you something you didn't want in the first place.The drop system will turn people off by the dosen, however, the game's presentation and content will ensure people will keep coming back for more. Each character is modeled and shaded pretty well and it really emulates the modern anime style. On the other hand though, sound effects and animations are a bit lacking. The voice actors from the anime reprise their roles in both English and Japanese which only adds to make the Dragonball universe come to life.The game also comes with ready to ship DLC in the form of GT chapters and the latest film release. Be forwarned as the content is not even close to justifying its pricepoint; especially since most it is tucked away behind the aforementioned random drop wall; even after you put in you're hourly wage.All in all,Dragonball Xenoverseis an excellent Dragonball game that is sure to satisfy fans. The content is rich and the chracter creation will keep you coming back to build a new guy for a while. The presentation is tight and inclusion of the original voice actors is a real treat. On the other hand, the drop system is unfair and the game in general is unwelcoming to the uninitiated. Still, I can recommend the game to fans of Dragonball and people who want to play an explosive beat 'em up with friends."

You, as one of the Time Patroller, must intervene and re-correct the changes.STORY SPOILERS BELOW - BEWAREYou later find out that the two people named Mira and Towa are causing the distortions in an attempt to free the Demon Realm to their world. In addition, Demon God Demigra is attempting to break out of his prison and destroy the Time Vault to change history in his favor. You and Goku then face Demigra in the final battle. Towa takes the last remaining peice of Mira and swears revenge against you and your allies.Gameplay/FeaturesThe game uses a 3d movement system, complete with a lock-on mechanic that locks the camera on the opponent. Maps are varied and open, with one even traking place in space! However, only a few have destructable environments, such as the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and a few others. USING A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The controls are simple: X for light attack, Y for heavy attack, RB for blocking, etc. Special moves are displayed by holding the Right Trigger and pressing A, B, X, or Y, as well as Ultimate moves, that require both Triggers to be held down. The attacks and speed of which the game plays makes you feel like a total badass against the heroes and villians of the series. Characters even chime in during battle with generic yet sometimes entertaining dialogue. Later in the hub world of Toki Toki City, the player can go into different quests to grind and level up, visit shops, or battle other players.What I HatedThroughout the story mode, I found there were a few random difficulty spikes, especially near the end of the game. Some characters even have special parameters applied to them, such as the opponent or opponents never flinching(♥♥♥♥ing Beerus and Whis are annoying with this)In addition, you can't preview any clothing or accessories before purchasing them, meaning you'll have to rely purely on your knowledge of the series or else you'll have to buy it and hope you like how it looks. Oh, and Saiyans are BROKEN. When a player goes Super Saiyan, they have an unlimited amount of Ki. This means most versus matches against Saiyan players will devolve into dodging Ultimate Move spamming.Final VerdictDragon Ball Xenoverse earns an 82/100.The gameplay is fun, fast-paced, and will make you feel like a tank, but there are a few things holding it back from being closer to perfection."

That being said ill just be honest and that can be that.So... First off...Fighting mechanics so far seem to be pretty simple to learn if you go through the tutorial, given that you experiment once in a while with different button combos (How i learnt to super move). Fighting in teams can get a bit hectic to say the least and some large boss battles can one shot you with out telegraphing their moves at all.Online so far has been ok, not much lag as long as you connect to higher connectivity rooms. Not met people to emote yet but thats not an issue. Matchmaking can be quick or it can be slow. Most of the time personally its been just slow enough to irritate but never enough to stop me playing. You will want to jump into the first room you see as they seem to fill up fast at the moment.Items and customization wise the game seems pretty good so far although there isnt that much considering you probably want to look unique. I know eventually the publishers will probably be updating and adding more via DLC....maybe some free, i dont know.TL;DR I'd say i recommend this game to any anime fan or Tenkaichi(3) fan. If you didnt like Tenkaichi's fighting style then im going to go out on a limb and say this game probably wont be what you want. If youre looking for Budokai(3)'s fighting in this game youll be disappointed too. Otherwise its good. Honestly first impression wise id give this a 8/10.Done. The Review is over. Stop reading.

It's hard to believe, but they did an amazing job recreating DBZ in a 3D space with beautifully crafted models and environments. While watching some of the cutscenes it almost felt like an improved version of the Anime.+ Story-wise Dragon Ball fans can rejoice. This game includes all of the most memorable scenes from Dragon Ball Z, some from GT, and some new content with new characters to fight against.+ Voice-actors directly from the show for essentially every character. I love it!+ The combat system is fantastic. It's fast paced and action packed without having to remember long button combos like in other fighting games. (Last DBZ game I played was Budokai 3, I felt this game's combat was very similar)+ Tons of skills and abilities to learn. You can choose to be a close-ranged brawler or a long ranged ki blastor. It's actually pretty fun to try out every new skill you come across and find the best setup to your liking.+ The game is quite challenging but can be very rewarding once you learn the mechanics.+ Lots of content, 20hours++ Plenty of extra content, including a hidden Saga where you fight Broly- Personally, I did not like the whole ""time travel"" story line. Time is being distorted, and you must go back in time to various era's to ""correct the timeline"" by helping defeat various memorable foes.- I found that creating your own hero felt a bit out of place... I would have much rather enjoyed playing as Goku or the actual characters that fought in the time line events instead. You sort of just appear out of nowhere, and everyone is just like ""who the heck is that guy?""- The Difficulty and Grind.  This is my biggest issue with the game.  Basically the story-missions are reletively short, so they decided to severely up the difficulty as you progress to the point where you won't be able to win. You are supposed to stop every so often and do side-quests called ""Parallel Quests"" repetitively in order to level up your character and unlock new skills. Unfortunetely, these side-quests mainly consist of refighting the same exact enemies you fight in the story.- RNG Drop Chance....skills and items are basically connected to Parallel Quests, and you have a random ""chance"" of earning a reward from doing a mission. The chance is very low and mixed in with other items. The problem with this is that skills that every DBZ fan wants, like Kaioken, Super Saiyan, etc. have a completely random chance of dropping during a particular mission. This means you can literally spend over an hour replaying the same mission over and over just to get a skill. (You CAN NOT buy these skills from the shop until far later in the game)- I came across this by accident, but there seems to be an overpowered glitch involving the Blue Hurricane skill, the game somehow slows down and enemies get hit for an incredible amount of damage. (Spoiler: Super Saiyan + Blue Hurricane = Win)- The ""Resurrection 'F' Pack is a bit overpowered for new players. I bought the Bundle Edition, and the game literally gives you some of the best gear in the game, and lets you play as God Goku, Vegeta, and Golden Frieza straight from the start making Parallel Quests extremely easy."

The story.The story is somewhat a fantasy come true for many old fans of DBZ. They really did a great job with this.Jump into the iconic fights that DBZ fans grew up with. History is being changed and you're fixing it. You even have your own important fights, making you feel like your character gets their existence reasonably well established in the universe.Muscle memory.Controller recommended. The gameplay can be a strain on your hands at first and something to get used to. As the sequel is gonna expand on the gameplay mechanics a bit, it might be good to get familiar with the ""basics"" in this.Most notably!!The hero (your character) of this game, will appear in the story of the sequel.You will be able to transfer your character from this game over to the new one, and they will appear as a holographic statue in the new hub city, aswell as in person. (They'll possibly even have their stats and moveset carry over, and be available in your random battles. This doesn't seem to be confirmed yet though)How important this is to you, you decide. Otherwise the role seems to just be some poster character the developers created.Xenoverse could be considered a 3d fighting game. It lends itself to the MMORPG genre a bit with its online hub area, but it's relatively small in scale and this hub is rather dull.The game can be played solo as a story game all the way through, but as the game is designed around being online it can feel empty if it's not filled with other players.Xenoverse has had a list of problems such as hit detection being bad in PvP and battle timers being too short. These things among many others have been improved in the upcoming sequel.Overall I can still recommend Xenoverse, since it was a good game and most downsides could be excused, due to a small development budget.But I can't really say there's much reason to get this game besides the character transfer.Wait for Xenoverse 2."

All fantastic games. Dimps always stuck to 2D style fighting but their foray in 3D style like Spike's Tenkaichi/Raging Blast is wonderful, leagues better than Spike's and on their first try to boot.PC version wise, this is a fantastic running game.I highly recommend this to anyone that has been playing the yearly releases of Dragon Ball games since the 90s.Hopefully someone at Bamco decides to bring the Budokai HD collection to PC as well!I'd also like to add, the first DLC is really underwhelming, but there is apparently more to come so that's a good start.Also I'd like to address a few things. Avoid PVP for now, It's just a mess of bad connections and there are a (few) people who a trainer to edit their stats. So for the moment until everything is fixed don't expect a consistent online PVP experience.Another thing, is meta. You can't avoid this with any online game. People will find and use the most broken things and all you can do is simply play around it or find out how to combat it. Dimps still has a little ways to go with patching so don't expect balance at the moment.Also, why so little Nameks? Everyone is a Saiyan grill that just spams ki attacks? Where is the variety? If there is another game in the series the Create a Character can be more expanded upon to stop people from being so cookie cutter. Just my 2 cents."

Dragon Ball Xenoverse takes on different story than creating it based on manga or anime. You are playing as customised Time Patroller. You can play as Saiyans (my favourite), Humans, Namekians, Majins and I cannot remember the other race similar to Freeza. There are some references from anime through out the storyline (I should watch DBZ anime again). The graphics are great, similar anime style with scars and bruises on their face when they are getting beaten up. The sound design is straightly authentic from anime. But the fighting mechanics aren't great. Because you keep spamming with weak and strong attacks, there are not many variety of fighting style. They also have like super moves like Kamehameha and other support buffs like Super Saiyan, Kaiokens (There are many variation of buffs available). They have side quests (Parallel Quests) to do but they are repetitive really, fighting against a villain, fetching Dragon Balls and repeat. But I found quests are difficult, even for not Parallel Quests like beating SSJ3s Goku and Adult Gohan (Goddamnit Goten you're annoying little bish). They also provided like an item customisation, clothes with attributes, capsules (potions in general), buying new super moves or support buffs, etc. They also dropped items randomly during your Parallel Quests (RNG too). There are around 20 or 25 rosters in Xenoverse. But sometimes, it needs to be unlocked by following the Main Quests and Parallel Quests requirements (I haven't unlocked all of them yet). You can play Multiplayer as well with your friends or fight against them but I had no chance to play with randoms or fight against random players. You can send items to your fellow friends with your items you want to give.+ Pros+ Authentic Sound Design+ Around 25 plus rosters+ Art style of the game+ Storyline of the game- Cons- Repetitive Side Quests (Parallel Quests)- Boring fighting mechanics- Difficult enemy AI (Again, SSJ3 Goku and Adult Gohan)- Keyboard and Mouse aren't recommendedFor the final conclusion, the graphics, sound design, unique storyline and characters on this game are great but repetitive side quests, boring fighting mechanics and difficult enemy AI made me want to put the controller down. Other than that, I recommend to buy this game if you are a DBZ fan like myself. Right now, 50 bucks for this game is so much for a repetitive content. Buy this game during big sale ($15.99).

I honestly do not understand why some bash on this game with sayings like ""It sucks! enjoy your wasted EU/$/Pounds. After near 3 hours in and 1 spent on the char creation, I can say that it's at least a decent game in my opinion. Not to mention that I did not meet any bugs to speak of in this short first impression in it...unlike other....you know...black sheep, with missing face models? know what I'm talkin' about? just sayin'.Anyway, the gameplay feels, how should I put this, natural but a bit convoluted. The statement about the controller was not a joke by the way. I have never used a controller to move the camera around and such in any game since I game on the PC and don't own any consoles. I would mark it down, but that would not be fair as I am just not used to this tipe of control scheme. I also say a bit convoluted because, again I am not used to using multiple button holds to bring up other menus and such.The things that you can do in the game pretty much sum up my expectations from what the devs wanted to deliver. Yes, it may have been nice to have other things here and there in addition but I feel that that's just nitpicking. You get to buy gear, which is also visually represented on you, special equips, like the scouter and such and of course, your custom character can have pretty much a mish mash of all the specials and ultimates that you want to. Want to be a sayain, using special beam cannon in super sayan 1? You can do it. That's about it for now. I may return in the future with a more firm grasp on this.For now the final verdict is this. If you have been waiting for it and didn't raise your expectations through the roof and was realist about the game, then buy it. If you are a die hard DBZ fan, definately buy it, you get to fight alongside all your favorite characters or against them too, as them or as your own custom char from different races and with diffterent skills and such.

I love it, but pulling a blizz expansion launch on us with server capacity/other server issues is a mark down in my point of view.Getting a good extra 7 hours or so in the game I can say a bit more. Of course, I like it even more. If you want an easy time for all the rewards this is not the game for you I can tell you that. You will have to farm and farm for some skills and stuff but I find it very rewarding in the end when you do get it. Simple as the stages are, I still get this feel of an epic battle every time I do a mission.There are statements that the Dev/Publisher are working on the server stability issues and such and let's hope that they fix it soon. My oponion is still unchanged, though you may want to consider waiting for a server fix just a bit to be sure you get a better experience."

Combat is not as in-depth nor as cinematic as Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 (the best DBZ fighter, in my opinion), though the game is still fun and it brings the new experience of fighting with or against your friends in a battle with several characters fighting simultaneously.Another aspect of DBX that brings some added enjoyment to the game is the ability to create your own characters.  The characters can be humans, saiyans, namekians, majin, or friezan.  As you progress through the semi-unique, not overly impressive story and fight your way through repeatable parallel quests, you'll unlock new gear to equip (which changes your appearance) as well as abilities.  Nothing made me happier than when I finally managed to unlock Galick Gun on my saiyan.All in all, this is an enjoyable game that is significantly more fun if you have friends to play it with.

I bought this week one in excitement for the release. I've played the game to storyline completion, and completed almost half of the PQs so far. I've generally enjoyed it, but frustrations are building and I'm no longer certain this was a good purchasing decision.PROS:+Customer characterization is cool! You can play as multiple character races from the series, including Frieza-type aliens. Customization allows for specific builds which employ moves or skills from multiple DBZ characters, allowing for an interesting fusion of styles. There's a variety of cool costumes that call back to even the most obscure (such as an outfit Bulma wears on one Dragon Ball manga cover, Arale from Dr. Slump's hat, and the hats Goku and Krillin wear when they attend their first Budokai Tenkaichi).+Control scheme is simpler and more approachable to those who may not be as experienced with the DB fighting games.+There are new, original characters for the game's storyline, including the Supreme Kai of Time and Demon God Demigra.+In the multiplayer lobby, you can goof around by doing hilarious character poses, like the Ginyu Force poses, or Great Saiyaman's entirely too elaborate poses.+At its strong points, combat feels great, with the exaggerated sound effects, combos, and dramatic camera angles adding a lot of excitement, reminiscent of the show.PROBLEMS WITH ONLINE PLAY:Online play is a complicated, fickle beast. There's a lot of problems here.-First, you have to play online unless your internet connection is off. There's no offline option within the game settings. It will always log you onto the servers. This can be aggravating when there's a lot of server downtime. It can take a long time for the game to boot because it spends a while connecting to the server. Even in single player lobby, if the servers go down, you'll be booted from play and have to log back in.-Connections can be very unstable. Characters lag across maps and sometimes freeze in place, or enemies don't spawn in. Sometimes the quest will simply freeze upon completion, until one character forcibly closes the entire game. Often, one or more participants will not receive credit, experience, money, or items upon completion. While grinding for items with friends, this can be very frustrating. I am doubtful that this is entirely to blame on my internet connection speed, and feel that measures could've been taken to deal with the issue.OTHER CONS:-Item droprate is utterly brutal. Some equipment is purchasable for large sums of zeni in the in-game store. However, some of the more desirable equipment must be unlocked via Parallel Quest. The problem is that it's highly specific and randomized. Quests have secret requirements in order to unlock extra battles or equipment within them. There is very little information to go off of within the game as to what these requirements are (sometimes context or character relationships could provide insight). Sometimes, when you do fulfill these secret requirements, the battle finishes early anyway. And if you do complete the requirements, you still have a random chance of getting the item. This can be extremely time-consuming if there's a particular look or build you're trying to create for your character.-The difficulty curve can be awkward at times. Computer AI can vary from relentless to completely ignorant. One battle, I might get stunlocked into a corner, another, I might be able to stand next to my opponent and freely charge to super saiyan without so much as a single glance in my direction.-Some design elements feel cumbersome and purposeless. You are required to walk to whatever game option you want to play. While the idea of Tokitoki City is nice in concept, in execution, it results in players taking one to two minutes to select play options as opposed to seconds. While grinding for item drops, this can cause a lot of annoyance (though the distance is shorter to the PQ desk).-Sometimes characters can become stuck on objects, forcing players to either end the game in the lobby, or accept a KO in matches.-Some gameplay mechanics aren't explained to the player, resulting in some early game confusion.I'm hoping that the developers will consider a number of the major issues, which have been vocalized numerous times by the community, and work to improve this game so that it can achieve its potential. For now, I would advise against most from purchase, though avid fans who are willing to look past problems may find themselves enjoying the highlights."

,Recommended,323470,15043078,"Posted: 24 March, 2015",all,Yureina,"A Dragonball game on PC? Yey.So this is a neat game where you make a custom character and play through most of the main battles of DBZ. The plot basically is about you being sent back in time to make sure things happen correctly, since some people are going back and messing with stuff. Not the most original plot in the world, but it works just fine as an excuse to go through the highlights of the series. Familiarity with the universe is not required, but will certainly help with understanding more of what is going on. This sort of game is best for people who already know DBZ and moreso for those who know it well.Gameplay involves alot of punching people or shooting lasers at them. But you prolly knew that already. You also level up and have to play with stats. And it works quite nicely with a keyboard and mouse. It's quite fun, and I found hours slipping away quite easily. Too easily at times. But I never smack games for being too fun that I have trouble watching the clock for when I ought to stop.But I do have to beat this game up for two things: RNG and progression-checks. The way you get new skills is either via learning them from ""masters"" (major characters who teach you stuff) or from picking them up in the Parallel Quests, or PQ's. Trouble is getting those skills (items too) is pretty much random, and it makes the game much more grindy than it needs to be. Progression-checks only make that worse by having story progression fights that pretty much require you to get extra levels to do successfully. Which means grinding PQ's for experience at some moments so you can actually move forward. And while the PQ's are pretty cool, I really don't like this sort of forced-grindage. Also the multiplayer PvP apparently is riddled with hackers, but at least you can still do co-op stuff without really worrying about such things.But ultimately, while that stuff is annoying, it won't stop me from recommending this game or playing it beyond the end of the main story (and there is plenty to do there). Perhaps I am biased because I have a positive view of this franchise, but I had plenty of fun with this game and probably will continue to do so. :D"

That being said a lot of the arcs had quite a bit cut from them. Which makes sense in the context of the games storyline.Playing co-op with friends is a blast, and probably the best part of the game in my experience. (Not like they make it easy though, more on that in the Cons.)As you play though the game you unlock signature moves from various Dragonball characters, which is pretty cool as a fan of the series.Graphics: Overall I'm very impressed with the amount of graphical options that are in the PC version of this game. Game looks nice, 60 FPS, heck it even has 21:9 monitor support.Cons:Online vs. is pretty much nonexistent since Xenoverse 2 released. There's nobody online to play against.Online lag is pretty terrible.Game gets extremely grindy, especially if you're an achievement hunter.Battle camera occasionally gets stuck in corners making it really hard to fight.AI is pretty hit or miss, and there are several ways to cheese through most matches.Online lobbies: I swear they make it as difficult as possible to play this game cooperatively. AfterEVERY SINGLE MISSIONyou need to:Wait for the end missions details,Wait for the town hub to load (where you talk to NPCs/shops and start single and multiplayer missions)Run to the multiplayer mission NPC.Talk with him.Create a lobby.Invite your friend(s).Wait for your friend(s) to enter the lobby.Wait through another loading screen.Wait for everyone to ready up.Wait for another loading screen.Wait for the unskippable battle intro to finish.and to top it off you can't even launch a mission in co-op unless the host player has already beaten it single player.While there is a lot of room for improvement, I had an absolute blast playing this."

I use a Dualshock 4 controller and the game recognized it no problem.

76561197985969179,Recommended,323470,14770371,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,PorkNasty,"TLDR: The biggest problem with the game right now is the servers.  There are some drawbacks in the gameplay department but the pros outweigh the cons.  If you're a fan of the Dragonball series and the world that Akira Toriyama has created then this game is a must buy.  If you don't really care for Dragonball but are interested in the gameplay it is a solid game but packed with fan service that will probably go over your head.  You will also probably be less forgiving of its flaws and may not get enough enjoyment out of the story and the Dragonball world to offset them.   Character customization is definatley the high point of the game, everything from looks to stats to skills is up to the player.Long review:If you like the Dragonball universe and the past Dragonball games then there's a great chance that you'll love this game.  There's a ton of fan service here for those that know the story well.  There's also a nice refreshing take on the old story with a new Time Patrol twist.  Your character feels like they belong in the Dragonball universe and they become important to the story of the Xenoverse game.  With the way they did the story it feels like your character is an important part of the Dragonball history and not just some voiceless, tacked on nobody that you get to customize.The customization is great too.  Being able to choose between human, namek, saiyan, maijin or changeling is a great start and there's a variety of body builds and looks that you can use to personalize your DB avatar.  It probably isn't the most in-depth character creation you've ever seen but it offers enough variety for you to individualize your avatar.  Each race starts with it's own unique bonuses.  Namek's, for example, get natural regen when their health is low.  Saiyans get a bonus to offense but have lower health than other races, etc...You'll get to dictate what skills are available to your character by earning them through quests or by choosing a mentor.  Your mentor will be a well known character from the Dragonball universe, they include heroes and villains, and they will give you quests to complete in exchange for learning their skills.  After you've mastered one set of skills you are free to move on to the next mentor (or, if you don't like the skills you're getting, you can select a new mentor at any time).  If you want to be a Maijin who goes Kaokenx20 and then blasts people away with Piccolo's special beam cannon, Krillins destructo disc and Vegeta's final flash all in one match, you can.  Feel free to change it up in-between fights as often as you see fit.You'll also have control over your stats.  Your character will receive 3 attribute points each level to put into Health, ki, stamina, basic attacks, strike supers (which are physical super attacks) and ki blast supers (which are energy attacks) up to a max level of 80.  It's completely up to you what your character will excel in.  You can specialize in ki blasts and have weak physical attacks or vice versa.  Or you can try to be well rounded and do a little bit of everything.  It's completely up to you.When you finish up the main quest line you'll have access to 55 Parallel Quests with a wide range of difficulty.  Each quest has a random chance to drop skills, items and gear relative to the difficulty and the characters that appear in the quest.  Your reward will be directly related to how well you perform and you'll be given a score that ranks your performance from D at the low end up to Z at the high end.  You can choose to do these offline with NPC teammates or online with other players.  You'll also gain access to pvp battles ranging from 1v1 to 3v3.  This is all in addition to the main quest line which can probably last you anywhere from 10-15 hrs depending on how adept at fighting games you are.  You can easily put 40-60 hours into your first character.There are some cons.  Right now the biggest con is the server stability.  Sometimes multiplayer is great, sometimes it's completely broken and you can't log in at all.  The game is also a bit grindy.  If you're unlucky you can spend a whole day grinding for an item in the same Parallel Quest over and over again and never get it.  You're also going to run into hackers who are giving themselves godlike stats to cheese you in pvp, but what game doesn't have this problem to some degree?  Very rarely, I've had missions where an enemy npc will get stuck in a mountain, where they aren't supposed to be and I have a hard time getting to them to KO them and finish the quest.  This problem hasn't occured but maybe 2-3 times in 56 hours of gameplay for me.There's a really good amount of content in this game and for those of us that just want a Dragonball world to get immersed in and be a part of this game will somewhat scratch that itch. The pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion, and there is enough game here to play offline if you absolutely had to to make it worth the $50.00.  More than likely in the worst case scenario, you would be unable to log into the ""Multi-Lobby"", which is a hub city where you can meet players and form teams.  You would probably still be able to queue up for online Parallel Quests with other players and online battles in a single lobby (a hub city populated by npc's that you can recruit to help with quests) but without the multi-lobby it is a bit harder to keep track of the people that you want to play with again.Overall this game is still worth the time and the price even if it does have some flaws at the moment.  If you aren't the biggest Dragonball fan and really don't know the story or care for the DB universe too much then I would suggest holding off.  The drawbacks will probably be a lot more difficult for you to forgive if you're not into Dragonball in the first place.  If you're a fan of the series and know the story like the back of your hand then the new ""Time Patrol"" approach is a nice refreshing take on a very familiar story.  The game is a grind but doing the same quest over and over for gear isn't so bad when your character is so versatile and customizable.  Part of the fun for me is changing up my skills as I acquire new ones to figure out what works best (and you can do this as much as you want in-between quests).  So even if the scenery doesn't change for a bit, your character can, and that can keep things interesting."
,Recommended,323470,14732730,"Posted: 2 March, 2015",all,Drakengar,"It's nostalgia bait, but it's executed in the very best way. Being able to put your own custom made character into the Dragon Ball story is the cherry on top.The combat, while fairly simple, is actually fun, fast, and very responsive.  The ability to have 3 on 3 fights in a large arena where you can fly around in is awesome.  The character customization also allows for you to equip moves and ultimate abilities from other Z fighters at any time outside of combat.Keyboard controls are awkward, but it works great if you have an Xbox (or similar) controller.There is also a small element of exploration in which you can search for items in the arenas, these can be used for crafting in your hub world.  While not necessary, since you can just buy said items, it helps to do that to save money for the large variety of clothing and accessories available for your character.  Most of which change your stats in some way.Overall this game has a lot of content for the player to unlock.  And a lot of bang for your buck.Before I go into the bad, the only other thing that I can say that makes this game purchase sort of iffy is the difficulty wall.  It's easy enough up until you beat Freiza, but then after that there's definitely a skill wall that you need to climb up.The bad thing about this game is the awkward interface and hub world.  For example, it's really awkward to have a 2 player offline fight.  You need to sign in, and then pick your character, then run through the hub world to the npc that'll allow you to do this.  There's no way to pick it from a menu at the title screen.The other  bad thing I can say about this game is that, at the time of writing, the online mode is completely broken. Often getting disconnected even while playing in single player."

,Recommended,323470,15058735,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,Meowmaritus,"If you liked the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball: Z, and/or Dragon Ball: GT series', ESPECIALLY if you liked the gameplay of the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series and the Dragon Ball: Raging Blast series, I can already tell you that you will LOVE this game. While the gameplay does feel like a little bit of a simplification of the fast-paced, EXTREMELY skill-based combat of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, this is only because the game is more about RPG-based leveling and MMO interaction with other players. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the gameplay is shifted a bit away from skill and a bit more toward strategy. However, the BEAUTY of this game is how it's still extremely fun to play, with MUCH more emphasis put on supers, making the fights seem more action-packed by giving the players loads of ki from melee attacks. This kind of shorter battle makes the online play more bearable, as well.The story of this game is just awesome. It's actually a totally unique story involving a new foe, who conveniently alters the timeline, requiring the players of the game to ""fix it"" (i.e. fight various battles from the original DBZ timeline but with changes). For these fixes, you are first shown a cutscene of the situation the characters are facing, such as a gruesome scene with Piccolo firing the Special Beam Cannon, impaling Goku but......missing Raditz completely?! O NO! Yes some of it is a bit cheesy, but overall it's really fun, with tons of fully-animated cutscenes (FULLY LIP-SYNCED TO THE JAPANESE DUB, btw), as well as an AWESOME soundtrack, featuring synth-based orchestral pieces that sound like the original Japanese soundtrack and the Bruce Falconer soundtrack had a baby that was this game's soundtrack (ok that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but still it's great).The thing that truly makes this game fun is getting to connect with friends and strangers alike and share your custom DBZ characters, playing VS matches online, and doing Parallel Quests online, allowing you to replay many parallel-timeline missions, which have various battle scenarios, some branching from the real timeline and others being completely changed (""what-if"" saga, anyone?). Parallel Quests allow you to have fun with your friends (OR by yourself), while leveling up your character and giving you Zeni, allowing you to buy skills, consumables, clothing, and accessories from the game's vendors. You can replay a single quest as many times you like, as there are not only RNG-based loot drops but ""ultimate"" finishes which you can attain by meeting various (unlisted) requirements for each mission, which are often simply absolutely reking the bejesus out of the mission and completely dominating the whole thing in a short amount of time.So, with all that being said, if you liked the anime itself and the skill-based Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast series' of DBZ games, you will probably have loads of fun with this game, likely playing it for hundreds of hours. However, if you don't have the extra elements of nostalgia as well as familiarity with the gameplay itself, this game does have its drawbacks, such as a lack of polish on a few of its parallel quests, and, especially with me coming from a background of playing lots of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, not the most impressive amount of equipment, but still a huge amount. Additionally, if you are a person who dislikes games that make you earn your fun by being extremely difficult (such as Dark Souls), then you will likely dislike this game as well, because that's exactly what it is: really challenging but extremely awarding.Even if you aren't a total diehard DBZ fan, taking the minor drawbacks into account and everything, you will likely still get a lot of enjoyment from this game, and for me to say that must really show a lot about how great this game is.My final rating of the game: 9.5/10"

Goku's mother, so you could play in 3v3 with Goku and his parents (Bardock and Gine))If you read the negative reviews they don't really have a solid ground.... they're mostly about connectivity issues etc. Since you have to be online all the time, I don't really see a problem with this as it makes it more fun.

,Recommended,323470,33067097,Posted: 30 June,all,Umitencho,"To put it plain and simple, Xenoverse is a step in the right direction. The video games were stumbling in the Raging Blast era and Ultimate Tenkaichi was basically hand holding you. Xenoverse is the second attempt at an creator your own character and play through their story in this franchise and does it right. The world doesn't feel empty and there is plenty to do(Time Patrol Missions) after the main story and DlC story has been beaten. Ironically, I used to focus on character rosters but I am so focused on my created character that I do not care that it doesn't boast the character amounts the Tenkaichi series did.Gameplay wise, I do feel like there are some misteps and balancing issues. For example, ki blasts that are post to track do not track all of the time and the Sayian race is overpowered. Once you unlock the super saiyan transformation, you unlock basically easy mode as it gives you infinite uses of your ultimate attacks while activated. This makes playing as other races particulaly hard when Saiyan #2045 is spamming Sphere of Destruction or Emperor's Death Beam.Another problem is the drop rate on items, clothes, and moves as well as the extra parameters of Time patrol missions. In short they are bad and even if you do the extra stuff in the TPM's they second set of mission parameters won't activate 100% of teh time and even then, any moves or items that need for the secondary missions to activate and be completed are not guranteed drops. This adds in a layer of annoying grind that you find in MMOs and RPGs. They have addressed this issue somewhat with the elder kai method, but getting the elder kai to gurantee your drops is rng as well meaning you are waiting a bit for him to say the right words, aka the golden fruit message.As it currently stands, there is a sequel to this game and unless you are an completionist like me or want to do the story mode yourself, it maybe best to move on to Xenoverse 2."

The only real issue here is that the game is not going smooth on the connection to the server, even for off-line play.

I will give better details here and update the cons list.Many enemies (AI) use very cheesy moves to escape a onslaught by the player part and even use moves time and time again that would be impossible for the cost (the close quarter defensive explosion, yes the one that cost 300 stamina). Some times, they will literally use them every single time that you even start a combo and in a way that is either impossible for you to actually do anything due being mid animation on a combo or forces you to do a very ""♥♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out"" strat to just spam simple ki blasts and kick the enemy away whenever they make a bee-line toward you.This can make some quests and fights get very boring or just result on a flat out lose due the time limit. And may all have mercy on your soul if you have made you character focused on hand to hand fights.EDIT 2: They have updated the servers, now is possible to stay online for lenghty ammount of time, but still some times it takes quite a while to be able to connect.Pros:+Game runs smooth as ♥♥♥♥+All the combos, skills and ki stuffs are very well balanced+If strung right, you can push out massive insane combos and ki blasts+On-line play is fun.

Most of the PVP players have moved onto playstation anyways, leaving the PC version practically deserted. The gear your character can equip has an effect on your stats, MANY of which contradict the very characters they are based on. Such as Piccolo and Bardock who're straight Blast type characters having outfits that weakens Blast type moves.The game was a decent attempt to bring us something new to the franchise. A new story, two new characters and the ability to create our own. But many things in the game needed to be double checked before release (such as the gear's effects) or even completely removed (such as the RNG and gear stats all together).The only reason this game was said to take 100 hours to complete was because of the RNG on loot drops. I'm here months after release and still haven't gotten everything. Not because there is so much to get, but because the game refuses to give me my rewards. I've lost track of how many times I've played the same mission over and over, only for it to not drop what I want.The final DLC attempts to fix the RNG problem with a Z Soul that dramatically increases your chance to get loot drops. Unfortunately, you have to be level 93+ to train with Elder Kai and max out his training before you can get it from him, and that takes a LONG time to achieve. Level 99 is the max and it takes like 60 or something PQ's to max out training with a master. By the time you even get this Z Soul, you've probably beaten the game, reached max level and have grinded so many times you've grown bored by this point!Also making people pay money for a better chance to get loot in the form of DLC was not cool."

A huge part of the game is playinc missions to collect coins which you can spend on costumes, accessories, and moves to use. So customization is a huge part of it."

But the main story got my interest in the What-If situations. I started doing a ton of research on the game to see if its any good, I even asked a friend and they said it was awesome. What really got me to buy the game is because it was developed by Dimps, the original developers that created DBZ Budokai 3 for the PS2 back in 2004. If anyone knows how to make an awesome DBZ game, its Dimps, with Budokai 3, Shin-budokai and a few other good games.Pros:+Really good story, alot of what-ifs, mostly lets the evil win+awesome combat and gameplay+tons and tons of skills and items for the ultimate character customization+five different character races to choose from, even the majin and frieza race are playable+easily one of the best soundtrack music in the series, but Budokai 3 still has the best music+very good voice acting, male voice #8 is best choice, everyone loves Ghost Nappa XD+online co-op missionsCons:-The story skips all of the androids saga,and goes straight the final fight with Perfect Cell. That means no android 16, no android 19, and no imperfect Cell-Diffcuilty can spike up to rage inducing levels. Beerus and Whis fight will make you wanna rage quit-energy charge is a skill, It should not have been a skill, it should have been a default ability-the so called enchanted armor is BS, it makes the game unfair-SSJ forms spams ultimatesOverall, I love this game, so totally worth the buy."
,Recommended,323470,17987305,"Posted: 11 September, 2015",all,Nirhowl,"First Impressions:Let me just start off by saying I'm definitely one of those 90s kids who grew up with Toonami and all that, so the nostalgia factor has been pretty intense from the moment I started the game up with Cha La Head blasting.  I'm not a DBZ fan in particular, but I did enjoy it.  I picked this up during the sale because I don't mind grindy, MMO-esque games, as long as they're vibrant and fun to play.  So far I'm not disappointed, but I can imagine if you're a fan of the hardcore DBZ fighting games that this might not be up your alley, since combat feels fairly simple once you take your lumps in the first few missions.The most appealing aspect was being able to make my own character in the DBZ universe, and there's a decent amount of options for the races they offer.  You can change armor and even armor color later pretty effortlessly, too.  They're all presets however, no sliders here, so that may be an issue for some.  Your race matters too, and some characters will take note of just who you chose to be.The world hub has some convenience flaws, like not being able to dash to get to where you're going faster.  You're given some decent preset motions and texts to interact with others, which helps bring your character alive a bit more outside the story's cutscenes.  It's a bit confusing at first as nothing is unlocked and you're vaguely told to go talk to everyone.Controller support is good, but I'm using a DS4 and the game insists on thinking I have a numbered gamepad instead of showing the buttons for a 360 controller, which is easier to translate in my head.  Once you learn what's what it's fine, but makes learning a bit difficult if you're a player who's going to be using a Dualshock.Running on a 970 on Windows 10, no framerate issues at all or tearing after I turned v-sync on.  Everything looks crisp, bright, and shiny.  Music's good quality and clear, voices are.. fairly what I'd expect, for better or worse haha.So far, it's definitely a recommend if you're coming in expecting a fan experience, but not some groundbreaking, amazing game.Updated impressions @ Lv. 50:Definitely leaning more toward recommending only if one is a DBZ fan.  The atmosphere and experience do make up for a lot of the flaws and some odd design choices, like slipping in super hard Parallel Quests in the lower tiers where it seems like the enemies never stop coming.  Frustrating stuff.  Combat gets a lot smoother as you power up and learn, but the game really does not hold your hand at all through the process of learning about armor, stats, and builds so you can succeed.  Being able to preview gear before you buy it would have been a welcome feature as well.Took me about 14 hours to get through the story with some Parallel Quest grinding.  Lots more replayability than just those hours of course, as there are still characters and places I have yet to encounter."

Or read on for a review of the highest quality, jk)This is a solid game that has respectable difficulty curves in earlier missions and solid early boss battles. This changes for missions later on but after a few hours of grinding you'll eventually succeed. However, being a cheap player and spamming blast attacks is not a bad thing in your first run though of the single player missions as the computer will be just as cheap - especially in multi-man battles (♥♥♥♥ you Super Saiyan Bargain sale and the last DLC PQ missions with Beerus and Whis,Thank you, ♥♥♥♥ you, Goodbye!)The equipment drops after missions reveals a strong catalogue of items and a decent range of variety that you'd want from a game based on customisation, but more could always be done. Appearance changes (without the need of Dragonballs) and more color customisation options for new equipment would be nice and hopefully they fix this in the sequel game. However, item drops and the like add a lot of replay value especially if you want a particular outfit or skill.The range of powers and abilities are good although there are a lot of irritating combinations that could potentially be horrible to face in multiplayer battles. Fortunately (and yet unfortunately) the multiplayer scene for this game is dead so this stops being a signifcant issue. The skill point system works well and the absence of a skill tree in favour of skills slots is a welcome change - it makes the customisation of characters feel that bit more personal.(tl;dr) [/b]Ultimately Sacrifice your fighter's pride and grow to love those Ki blast spam buttons young time patroller and I'm sure you'll save the universe.

,Not Recommended,323470,24527417,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Adaptoturd,"TL;DR If you look past all the flaws of the game it could be quite enjoyable. This is more of an RPG game than fighting game.Story is basically, you're the time police and you have to stop the changes of historical battles. You go through all the different Dragonball Z sagas. The rest you already know if you like Dragonball Z.Character customisation is fun, letting you choose different races, whatever colour you want to be and whatever look you want (within the bounds of dragonball anime art assets). The races are basically different classes you want to play as, Humans are a jack of all trades, Saiyans are glass cannons, Namekians and Majins are tanks and Frieza race are speedy. Although these races have base stats set out in different ways you can still customise your character stats however you want, so you can make a tanky frieza character or a speedy namekian.After character customisation though, the rest of the game falls flat. The fights are somewhat enjoyable, fun button mashing gameplay with a multitude of special abilities you can use alongside aiding items to help you and your friends. Unfortunately for me the combat feels extremely clumsy (although my friend says he finds it really fluid). I find the camera awkward to deal with when against a wall or inside buildings, the punch seems sluggish with every swing but you can do really cool combos with super and ultimates abilities before or after close quarter combat.Now the AI is extremely bad, coop team mates stand still and take hits while rarely attacking the enemy and on top of that they are usually involved in fail conditions meaning the game fails if they die. On top of that the checkpoint system sends you all the way back from the begginning of cutscenes (which thankfully you can skip). Also enemies CAN AND WILL spam you constantly with incredible ultimate attacks and CC breaks. The player also has cc breaks but you can't spam them that often as they have a time limit, it seems the enemy does not or it recharges faster for them. Another problem with the cheap AI is they have incredible amounts of poise, some tough enemies can just stand there perfectly fine while you unload huge damaging moves and it will barely affect them. What's weird is sometimes the enemy will be a complete push over and just let you stomp them. It seems that winning a battle is RNG depending whether an enemy will let you destroy them or constantly cc break and combo you.Also sometimes the game gets real janky, for example on a side mission with my friend, we were fighting Super Saiyan Goku and he used his ultimate (which he can quickly spam) on my friend hitting him directly, I was a good distance away from him (about a quarter of the map away) then suddenly my character was stunned and taking huge damage but luckily I didn't die.Then comes the loot system which has worse RNG than Borderlands. Trying to unlock something you want in a side quest? Too bad it's luck based even if you do all the win conditions. The game makes you constantly grind out side missions to level up to even be able to pass a main mission.For some reason you can't coop main missions with friends but you can with the side missions. Also this game has DRM, so far I've only been disconnected once and it was just after I beat a mission so I didn't loose anything.Throughout the game you can unlock all kinds of gear, items and abilities. You can get them by either beating main missions and buying them or getting lucky in side missions.All in all this game could be so enjoyable had it not been for the janky cheap combat with grinding RNG loot systems. It's more frustrating than it is fun."

,Recommended,323470,19864447,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,Dirk Dickbutt,"Dragon Ball Xenoverse is pretty cool I guess.Set after the events when Carrot fought some of the most powerful beings in the universe. Or during...Or before? Time travel is dumb. Anyway, something is going terribly wrong and many of these battles are ending in ways they shouldn't, and by that I mean the bad guys are winning. Vegetable's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ half-breed is some sort of time cop at this point and sees that he needs help from someone competent to stop the time lines from going all Back To the Future and he uses the seven dragon balls wish for a powerful warrior to help them beat up a hot demon lady and her husbando brought to life.And they got me.Ho boy.So yeah, in the first time in Dragon Ball video game history, you get to make your own character! Or if you're super lame you can try and recreate a existing character from another franchise. You create your personal avatar and then go on an epic quest through time to set things right while making the main heroes look really bad in the process. Seriously, it looks really bad when big tough villains don't even touch you. It's probably Vegeta's fault, the jobber.At the start of the game, you're given the choice of several races for your character, including: Human, Saiyan, Freiza guy, Namekian, and confusingly attractive chewing gum. But if you're anything like me  you made a human so you can punch Saiyan's in their stupid midget faces. I still gave him a helmet though because I worry about his safety. I hope he didn't get hit too hard.The game is a brawler of sorts, you take a third person view and have a melee attack, a ranged attack, a grab, as well as a super and ultimate moves set to your triggers, or keyboard. Surprisingly, for how simple it is, Xenoverse's combat is fairly fast and exciting, giving you a feel of the high octane fighting from the TV series and manga. Though, depending on who you ask, for better or worse, the game somewhat lacks the crushing and overpowering strikes the series is known for. You can send someone back or knock them down sure, but you won't be punching people clean through mountains or power bombing them into the ground with the force of a few atomic bombs.Though I guess that may be for the better. The combat is focused, sure, but it seems like the Xenoverse servers has problems keeping up with what's going on. Lag and stuttering is a constant, or at least it was for me and a few other people I know. Sometimes attacks didn't come out right or your moves don't synch up with what your opponent is doing. But this is pretty much absent in Xenoverse's PVE combat.While competitive fighting is an option, you can also take on missions with your friends for experience and loot. Through the main game and some DLC, you can go on an abundant of missions with your buddies, and sometimes this is the only way to unlock certain moves and transformations like spiky hair, and spikier hair. Actually, I lied, your hair doesn't spike, it just changes colors. I'm sorry I did that to you.Xenoverse is probably the best kind of fanservice, though, like comic book team ups or the imaginary fights after I eat those strange mushrooms I found out in the woods. Having player made characters in a universe like Dragon Ball team up or fight each other almost feels like its own series of sorts. I, myself like to look up names of characters I fought on the dragon ball fan wiki just to see if I beat up some important fan fiction character.Xicor: Evil son of Goku? More like Xicor: son who just got all of his teeth knocked out of Goku. Super Saiyan 5 didn't do much for you, did it?But should you play, Dragon Ball Xenoverse Raging Blast Ultimate Tenkaichi Budokai Butoden Hyper dimension...Uh... Final Bout? I think I got them all.That depends, do you like Dragon Ball? If yes then you probably already played it. If no, then no, you stupid stinky idiot. Xenoverse is a fan service game, its for people who like the series and have either grown up with it or adopted it along the way. The combat can be iffy at times and I've knocked out Kirito from Sword Art more times than I liked to countAnd I'll do it again, but the story and team missions alone are enough to keep you invested for a few hours. That and it's always fun to see a human trained by Yamcha beat the snot out of a Super Saiyan with little effort.

But before you rush toward the purchase button, please read through my criticisms and ask yourself- are any of these issues deal breakers? If you're a fan of Dragonball, they probably will not be. If you are not a fan, well... Read on.The hub world, Toki Toki City, has a fair share of issues. Not having an option to move faster in town is kind of irritating, especially when you need to visit several locations. This is exacerbated by the fact that the game already has quick move controls. Being dropped half a map away from the parallel quest desk after each one you take part in is a serious drag. If we could get that changed out, that'd be great. There isn't much to do in Toki Toki City overall, which is really too bad because it's interesting visually. I feel like they could have mashed it all into one or two sections and have lost very little. Maybe they figured they needed the space for players to meet up?The battle system is hardly flawless either. Control seems a bit sloppy, and comboing is unintuitive- I keep kicking the air behind me when I instinctively try to mix up a combo. Fighting multiple enemies is a pain well beyond the measure it ought to be, even when you're several levels above your targets. Combat is very much about being more powerful than your opponents, and not enough about beating them out through skill, which dissapointed me. Though I've heard talk of counters and such, the tutorial is NOT clear enough on this point. Speaking of the tutorial, a mention of how to use items during it would have been nice. I got through the Cell stage before I learned how to use them.The designed character seems pretty weak too. Your avatar being a 'mute' with no personality is rather disappointing. The option to pick an overall personality (cocky, cowardly, brave, rowdy, exciteable, possibly others) and giving them a few lines based on it would have been nice. Instead you only get to hear certain attack names. The only ones I've heard my character use are Kaioken and Masenko, though I haven't used many, and have not made it very far into the story. Also, I created a female saiyan, and while the other characters recognize my race just fine, she has been addressed as though she's a man on multiple occasions. It breaks the immersion pretty bad. Also I was pretty disappointed when I found that equipment has an effect on stats- I would sooner have kept it entirely cosmetic, so I could pick and choose what bits of outfit to wear without it affecting my capabilities in battle- Especially considering how hard it seems to be find sets that boost atk and beams at the same time.All that said, I'm having a lot of fun with it despite the flaws. Landing supers and ultimates is satisfying, and the story is fresh even to long time dragon ball fans. There are lots of skills and items to discover as well, so there's a lot to do. But really, I'm just glad I didn't drop nearly $80 on another Ultimate Tenkaichi!"

I remember the entire Dragonball Z Series without question all the way untill the Cell Saga.

Only in this kind of story could my punch-buu ever exist.As I got closer to the end of the game, however, Things got incresingly difficult for no real reason.  I had maxed out my hand to hand combat and was dividing my other points as I saw fit.  After at least 20 attempts at the boss I finally beat him, and with that unlocked my other create-a-character slots.  I went on to create a Human and wanted another punch character after seeing their moveset.  I found out that almost every other race(barring namekian) has just flat out better punch combos.  You effectively hinder youself by not playing what your race is good at.Maybe it's just me, but I was a little disapointed and upset finding out that there where almost required ways to play each race.  That and grinding out armor/moves in PQs only got harder with there being a cap on your max stats.  And once I had finished the story PQs were all that were left, as im not one for pvp.Durring a sale it might be a worthy investment, but otherwise I think I have to say stay away."

,Recommended,323470,16329224,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,Blue!,"Quite a lot of fun but still with some problems that don't seem to be getting fixed any time soon.Online can be very laggy, combos can stop just because the enemy floated away somehow, or you weren't even actually hitting them as the hit detection can also be terrible when playing online, then there's the RNG of getting items/gear/skills, which can be ontop of other RNG known as ""ultimate finishes"" which even if you can trigger correctly may not even happen!Stats on clothing also ruins a lot of customization options, especially if you want to be a Ki user, as most clothing is geared towards melee/striking damage.Other than that the game is a lot of fun, the story has you going through the DBZ story but not just dropping in as Goku or Piccolo, but with your own created character in which you help the heroes of the show fight off powered up enemies in many of their forms.Personally I would like to see more expansion on this, many parts of the Saiyan and Frieza saga are playable (but still skips two of Frieza's forms), but when it comes to the Cell and Buu sagas, you mostly go right to the end and skip quite a lot of build up, such as fighting Cell's forms, or andoid 19 and 20 who don't even show up, along with seeing andoid 16 who is absent as both a playable character and in the story itself.Also needs more forms/enemies in the games, and some more of the movies being played out would be great.All in all, if you're a DBZ fan this is a very fun game, or you can get it on sale, but I just really hope the next game takes the issues the community has with DBXV and fixes them in time for the inevitible Dragonball Super era game they will release next."

I've played a few of the fighters at friends', and an RPG or two on emulators.It's a very flawed ARPG. There are omissions of characters and mechanics that are kind of sore for me. Transformations like Kaio-ken and Super Saiyan are an understandable difficulty to balance in a multiplayer game, but are nevertheless unsatisfying to me. The necessity of grinding for items/skills to flesh out a character would only be a hassle if you didn't need to level up your character to even approach the missions that yield the good stuff. Having to grind to get to the grind is a pain and a half. Not to mention that the drops are random.That said, I am having a ball with it. Most of all, putting together a character, dressing it up nice, and wandering around the Multi-Lobby like its an anime convention.

For those people... I can't recommend it highly enough.The graphics are perfect (It really does feel like playing an episode of Dragon Ball Z), the combat is, for lack of better summary, excellent, the story was incredibly well done (Historical battles are faithfully represented, cut scenes closely mimic the manga, timeline alterations are tasteful and fit well), and Cell's voice acting is at least 30% better than in the TV show.Now that's all well and good, but the avatar creation and character customization take the cake. Placing your hero alongside the Z Warriors is pure, concentrated childhood wish-fulfillment. The feels you'll feel the first time you go Super Saiyan are hard to describe, but fall somewhere between ""Boner-rific"" and ""Worth the price of admission"".$50 is a small price to pay to go Super Saiyan.

Overall, this game is a standout and unique experience within the DBZ universe compared to most DBZ games that just rehash parts of the series.After completing the entire storyline and close to half of the side missions, the skill sets are varied, and you can build a truly unique character as far as abilities.

,Recommended,323470,14716224,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,[SIN7]\m/ Dean \m/,"Amazing to finally have a Dragon Ball game on Steam, and I like many others on steam hope it is one of many to come. However this review will not be quite as glowing as the other reviews as I’m going to give the developer’s some tough needed love on certain aspects of the game.Gameplay and Story:Gameplay is overall excellent, you can start by making your own character from the the different races that been “Majin, Saiyan, Human, Namekian, Freezer’s Clan” apart from the last two each has Female and male and the game has just enough slots for each type of character and gender for you however you must first beat the game to unlock all the slots. From my playing and findings I find each class to have its own uniqueness to them however in my honest opinion you just can’t beat a good Saiyan, specially one who knows Super Saiyan 2 and certain moves, as they naturally have the strongest strength and Kai averages making them very powerful and can be even more powerful with the boots such as going super.The game consists of 3 major gameplay implementations, the story that is okay, its accommodated by some nice cut scenes at certain points of the game like the Anime however I noticed the frame rate of those cut scenes to be noticeable and low but it was just cut scenes that were enjoyable. Most of your time you will find yourself doing PQ short for Parallel Quests, these are the side quest that you must do to grind for items (and when I say grind I mean, chuffing grind for them) and grind for levels specially at the later stages and finally your online PVP system that is sadly plagued with hackers at the time of writing this.One of the finest parts of the game is getting the gear and new moves, getting the get up you want really makes it Fashion Ball Z but is regardless an integrated part of connecting to your character. The best way to think of this game is a very strong solid pillar of what to support, however as your hours of the game start to delve into it deeper you start to see the support structures holding it up are a bit weak and or lazy in many areas.So moving onto some negatives on the Gameplay; The tutorial is basically non-existent, the game did tell me how to grapple an enemy but I soon forgot and it was half of the game before I relearnt it to deal with touch enemies, normally I would have look at the Skill list to learn all the moves, sadly it doesn’t exist, if it does I have not found it. There is a Skills List but all it says is “Y X X X” for combo basically, that’s it and this is very disappointing as if you want to Master combat and haven’t played any of the games say since Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 you are going to be left perplexed, I still don’t know how I do a vanish chase but sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.Another flaw I must mention is the hub you spend your time in the game, it’s a little too big and empty and after you beat a PQ it puts you right at the pods and you must walk all the way back to the PQ area to get another or do the same one again, this is just lazy, put me back or give me an option to pick another or retry.Graphics:Nothing much can be said about the graphics, they are decent and nice looking, the game itself runs perfectly fine however I have one graphical bug that sometimes the Ki moves show, and sometimes they do not. Some fixes fix this temporarily so waiting for a patch from Nvidia or the developers to resolve this.Overall I loved the many hours I have already put into this game, I never thought I would like a Dragon Ball game again since Budokai Tenkaichi just because the wish the combat system was like those games as they were perfect but Xenoverse does a great job at nailing this combat even with the lack of proper Skills List that I won’t hold my breath for.Overall I give the game a 7/10, harsh love has to be dealt to learn from mistakes but would recommend this game to hard core fans such as myself as it is very enjoyable when you take a small blind eye to the flaws.Pros:-	Lot of content such as items and fighting moves-	Good combat system-	Nice graphics-	Combat is fast and at time hecticCons:-	Lazy corners were taken with the support of the game-	No proper Skills List-	Lazy spawning and making it awkward and time consuming for the PQ-	Some bad voice acting in the Story, all mainly from trunks"

You are meant to do side missions, improving your time and ability each time you do them, for the experience, money, and item drops.

76561198047502811,Recommended,323470,24801374,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,killamrix88,"Gonna keep this short-ish since Xenoverse 2 is coming soon, so this game is gonna be somewhat irrelevant after that I imagine.But let's just put it this way: I have 180 hours in this game. I love it. I also hate it, but I mostly love it.The fighting is fun. In one way, all the characters are very samey. You have fast attacks and heavy attacks, but it hardly matters which ones you use, and you have basic ki blasts which are only kinda useful and don't do much damage. However, it's the supers and ultimates which define your play style.Depending on the skills equipped to a character, you can make some fairly unique and differing play styles.So, to boil this down, I'm just going to say that I really like this game, and that if you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z you'll probably enjoy it. I'll list some negatives and then let you decide if you should buy it or not after that:1. Grinding and RNG. You can create your own character (which is awesome) but you must go through things called Parallel QUests in order to gain experience to level up (boost your stats) and to earn a majority of the clothing and skill options. Often, a single mission can have THREE layers of RNG (random number generation) to get through to see if you'll get the skill or item you want. Some of these missions are also kinda long, but never longer than 15 minutes (if it passes 15 minutes you lose due to running out of time anyway...) Replaying these missions until I got everything is about 70% of the reason I have nearly 200 hours in this game. (I suppose it says something either about me or about how fun the game is that I was willing to put in all that time... I think it's mostly me unfortunately...)2. Multiplayer is dead. Few to no people left playing the PvP stuff, and not too many doing coop either. Also, multiplayer has some nasty lag. More so than a lot of other mutliplayer games in my experience. Sometimes it's bareable or even not too noticeable, oethr times it actually breaks the game entirely.3. Horrible lip syncing. I think the characters were only animated for the japanese voice acting. It's a little funny actually... but a bit annoying as well.4. Voice acting is inconsistent. Some people, like the main villain, have great voice acting (really good, honestly in my opinion). Unfortunately others, Goku for example, have some pretty... average at best voice acting. Just seems really awkward at times. Your personal character only has a few voice lines, and that's only for certain attack names in battle. You can hear your character shout ""KAMEHAMEHAA!"" but they don't speak (audibly) in cutscenes. The few times they ""talk"" it's totally silent with some hand gestures... which is a little weird. Understandable I suppose, but weird since everyone else has a voice.5. Some pointless customization limits. 99% of clothing will bost/lower certain stats. THis means that if you REALLY want goku's clothes, but are using the stats it lowers, you're either out of luck or will have to make some sacrifices to your power. Also, only a few original clothing items can be recolored. All the character outfits (Goku's, Vegeta's, Buu's, etc.) have one set color pallete... which means mixing and matching can have some really awful color coordination that can't be fixed.6. The AI is god awful. Just absolute trash. I've seen my allies square off against an enemy, and they'd jsut sort of hover in a circle staring each other down instead of fighting. Your allies are often a distraction at best, but can actually make your job harder at the worst. THe only good thing is that your allies highest priority (as long as they're ones that you picked to help you on a PQ) is to revive you if you get KO'd. They're very reliable for that... and nothing else. Only on some missions will the enemy be a challenge, but that difficulty is usually artificial in one of two ways. 1: They have ""super armor"" which makes them immune to flinching upon being hit, or, 2: they outnumber you and will just gang up on you and keep you from fighting back until you find some breathing room... and then your only real option is to fire back with as many big blasts as you can muster.Once you get some skill with the game and/or a powerful character, a normal 1v1 will probably be child's play.I just wish my allies would stop shooting ki blasts at the enemy and making my skills miss due to some annoying invincibility frames...7. A few characters are missing that would have been nice to see. Also SSJ4 Vegeta is unobtainable as he was a pre-order exclusive...So, in conclusion, why is this game fun? Because it's some f***ing fantastic fan-service. It's pretty, it mostly plays well, and you feel like you're IN Dragon Ball Z and GT. Seeing your character be thanked by Goku and stand beside the Z Warriors is really something special. Having someone say ""With then, I think we really stand a chance"" and knowing that they're talking about YOU is really cool.The story is refreshing, the comedy is there, and it's just a fun ride. Growing your first character from a weakling just barely on par with Raditz to then challenging Majin Buu and other godlike beings is a great experience the first time around... and probably a second or third time so you can watch your character in the cutscenes with all the cool gear you've collected through later PQs.. . . and if you're still transformed when a cut-scene starts, you'll appear transformed during most cutscenes. . . it's a nice touch.It might not be the best DBZ ""fighting"" game, but it's certainly one of the best ""DBZ"" games in general if you know what I mean."

While you can take most reviews with a grain of salt, I'll never fail at telling you how it really is while still keeping it short. :)I have never played any of the other Dragonball games, but I follow the series. After seeing the positive reviews on this game, I figured I would try it out. If you're a Dragoball fan, it's kind of a no-brainer. It's quite great. I do agree with some of the negatives about the combat system; it seems abit....easy?However, I'm not a hardcore fighting game player so the combat system really does not bother me; I bought this because I enjoy the Dragonball series. As far as those speaking of it feeling clunky, i'm not sure what they are talking about. The combat feels extremely fluid and streamlined as well as the game it self. (I am using an Xbox one controller hooked up to my computer. I have no idea how this game feels via kb/mouse.) I love the art design and graphics of the game. Anyways, I'm drunk and rambling, so here is what i'm trying to say in short.If you like Dragonball, you will like this game. If you don't follow the games or the series, it will likely be off-putting. While the combat system is...minimal, if you were to play online or with friends, it will still take some skill to master. (albiet not nearly as much as a complex game like Street Fighter.) But I'm not sure this game was made with a competitive scene in mind.I now have a scouter and look like a badass. 10/10"

76561198214592032,Recommended,323470,25053359,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,phillipshead,"With the sequel right around the corner, this may not be worth picking up even on sale unless you really wanna get that DBZ fix; if by chance they do throw it on sale, though, it's worth a shot. I got it at full price with relatively little disappointment.On the whole, the game's mechanically sound, and the single player campaign is a lot of fun. You might think the whole ""re-living the past"" storyline is trite, but they manage to make it work in a fun and unique way, even if it's accompanied by some standard anime cheese. But don't go into this thinking you're gonna get the same experience as Tenkaichi 3, no no. There are similarities and differences, most of them likely changed to accomodate the multi-fighter system and the online capability. To break it down:PROS:* Solid gameplay and tight controls, the most important element to any fighting game.* Somewhat interesting storyline, though it does get a bit boring at times. Still, the presentation as a whole is well done.* Online element with built-in VOIP, though as always, online experience will vary. The online being there is a cool feature, but in my experience I rarely found people playing. I can't count functionality as a demerit though.* Most (if not all) of the FUNimation English dub voice actors reprise their roles.* Like previous titles, there's a plethora of unique dialogue for when certain fighters are against or paired up with one another.* Very well animated.* Highly customizable created characters. There's a ton of special moves to toy with in your character build. Note that you can always change your moves, but respeccing your stats requires you to collect the dragon balls and wish for ""a second chance at life.""* Oh, and yeah, you can still collect dragon balls and make wishes. I recommend looking up what each wish does before making one as some of them are a bit underwhelming.* Plays great with a controller.NEUTRAL:* Super Saiyan forms are broken, but do allow for an easier way to get through the relatively short campaign. In SS, you can spam your ultimate ki blasts or what-have-you with only a slow drain to your ki rather than spending bars (easily off-set by having a ki-charging move). I say this is a neutral because in a way, it makes sense--saiyans have always been broken in the series, with almost everyone else in the cast taking a backseat (or ultimately getting defeated). Granted, they did allow multiple Kaioken forms for everybody's use, but a stat boost pales in comparison to ki blast spam. I look forward to seeing what the sequel does with the other races' super forms (here's hoping humans get something unique).* Wonky difficulty spikes that may require you to grind out your character a bit (looking at you, Beerus). This too is a neutral to me because, well, that's what DBZ has always been about, training to get stronger. I'm okay with that I guess, but it gets tedious.* Grinding dragon balls is also tedious. It's easy, just repetitive and time-consuming. But it's not necessary, so, also neutral.CONS:* You can't create a new character until you've completed the campaign with the first one you made. I've never understood why this limitation exists, but let's just say I'm glad I chose a saiyan for my first character.* You can't create custom movesets/outfits for classic characters. You can switch between presets, of which there are plenty for most of the main cast (though you have to unlock them), but no customization. For a game that innovated on making a completely unique character with full customization, I was a little irked to discover that I can't make my own custom classics like in Tenkaichi. Feels like taking a step forward and a step back.* Servers just seem generally devoid of people for parallel quests (PQs)--that's not just now, they always have. I'm not sure if that's a server-side or client-side issue or what. If you wanna have some fun online, find a friend or two to play with.* On that note, if you do get to group with someone, there's no sort of ""add friend"" option afterwards, you just go your separate ways.* The drop rates on some abilities/items can be frustratingly low for how long some of the parallel quests take.* Nitpicking: city hub and character select music is annoyingly repetitive. Pretty sure they're both just a 20-30 second loop. They tried spicing the city hub music up by adding a seamless extra layer of percussions or something to it when you're visiting a shop, but that definitely fell flat. Character select music being repetitive is one thing, you're not likely to spend a lot of time on that screen. Definitely spending a lot of time in the city screens though.Overall, Xenoverse succeeds where it counts, but most importantly, it's a solid DBZ game us PC saiyans can enjoy, and I look forward to the sequel. Speaking of the sequel, cool thing to note, you can apparently transfer your character from Xenoverse into Xenoverse 2. Little bit more incentive to pick this up before the sequel arrives."

If you love Dragon Ball and have always wanted to create your own character to adventure through the story with your favourite characters, then this game is... good, but not perfect.The graphics, art-style, stages, controls and music are all very nice and you’ve a good amount of options for your original character, but it's plagued with some minor issues that can slightly ruin the experience. Like how they didn't bother lip syncing the characters, the overworld is cumbersome to navigate and GOOD LORD THE GRINDING. You spend a lot of time doing it and you pretty much have to if you want to stand a chance as the story progresses. I hope it'll all be addressed in the sequel. Random drops are also a big pain to get what you want. Also, this is just me, but sometimes it can be a bit difficult to get your bearings when you're flying and warping around a fully 3D environment.But, if you can get past all of these issues, this game is incredibly fun and if you've got a mate who loves DBZ as much as you, nothing beats creating characters together to fight each other and complete the large amount of challenges in the game. So if you're a fan of DBZ and see this game on sale, I'd recommend checking it out. If you like it, there's a ton of content for you to enjoy, but trust me, it'll get frustrating sometimes.Edit.

For some reason you can't use powers there... and running the hub is a bit boring, you can only create 1 character until you lvl alot... I mean this is not an MMO.The fights are fun, but they could be better, could be more satisfying, this may be due to the LVL thing. In most fight games you dont have levels, here if you are fighting a higher lvl COM he will naturally block and evade and it gets frustrating. I think power up and vanish should have their own key, and some actions are not rebindable.I knew the game would make you ""grind"" levels, but it is ok because the fun is in the fights anyway. On the positive you have everything else, you can make your character and train whatever skills and powers you want. Combos are great. Great graphics, optimized, 60fps. awesome japanese voices and cool story. 8/10"

First of all the online here in Australia is completely either dead or broken because I was not able to find one match throughout my whole time playing and that was probably the biggest disappointment because I was really looking forward to that. This review and score is just based on the singleplayer and overall it was decent at best. The gameplay doesn’t come close to tenkaichi 3 and budokai 3 on the ps2. The fighting feels very formulaic, it doesn’t feel organic like the other games I mentioned and it lacks the impact. It’s very hard to explain but when someone gets hit with a Kamehameha it doesn’t feel like they have just been hit with a very strong energy attack and the melee just lacks the mmmph of other games, its overall much more stiff and it doesn’t flow as nicely.  Creating your own dbz character, customizing his clothes and skills and experiencing the story was the highlight of the game, not the gameplay itself. However even the story I found disappointing at times because a lot of the big battles from the show are very rushed and fly by in less than 10 minutes like the frieza and cell fight and your character feels so out of place in a lot of these fights, it could have been handled a lot better. But there are some great moments in there that make it all worth it. The Beerus saga makes it worth playing alone.6/10 (Decent)"

Other tahn the expected oddities with specific graphics cards, it runs at 60fps with no slowdown at max settings for me. The controls are responsive and intuitive for the most part. You can do keyboard controls (I don't know if you can change them because I'm using a controller) and the controller has many different options (but no individual button changing). The default controls make sense and I haven't felt a need to change it.Graphically it looks fantastic. It looks like a great transition from the 2D anime to 3D cell shading. The voice acting is the original people from the show as far as I can tell and it's as good as it was back then.The story is very goofy and dumb and more just an excuse to allow character creation while revisiting the big fights of the Dragonball series starting from the Saiyan saga. It also has a reimagining of various scenarios through the Parallel Quest system, which is basically just more fighting with a bit of reasoning on top of it.The character creation is varied enough, you get slider options for height and weight (which just means how wide or narrow your character is) along with a selection of the races that have different stats and abilities. You can change the color of your hair and skin and there's a large range of colors there. You also get equipment through missions and shops and can customize your character that way too. It's limited but not terribly so, you can still get a personalized character and I haven't seen any characters similar to mine.The online mode is extremely fun. Playing with a friend and being able to just wreck the CPU is unbelievably fun. You just do it for the Parallel Quests and can't do it for story mode, which considering the difficulty of the story missions makes you wish they had allowed it.The game is flashy and chaotic and fun. If you liked the old Budokai games then you probably already own this. If you like fighting games and DBZ then you should get this. It's a fantastic port of the game and the online component is great when it works. Unsurprisingly, it being the launch of the game, the servers are getting hammered so there's a few problems with that at the moment but that won't matter in the future."

However, some more work could have gone into the lip-syncing At times the combat can get a little ech, but this is coming from someone who's playing the game with a mouse and keyboard. They could definitely have added some characters, it would have made a lot more sense plot-wise. But when you look past all that, this is truly a unique experiance that any Dragon Ball fan would enjoy (not counting the scattered continuity errors).P.S.: If I had to some this game up in 7 words, it would be ""Dragon Ball OC Generator: The Video Game""P.S.S.: I know full and well that this game isn't being updated anymore, but they should really go back in and fix a certain mission in the Ginyu saga.

Xenoverse feels more like an RPG brawler than your average fighting title. The controls are not overly complex and ultimate attacks are only a button push away which makes Xenoverse a very easy game to be introduced to. Giving your friends a fighting chance will not require hours and hours of one sided matches. Though one can say the combat lacks complexity, there is no denying that duking it out in matches feels fantastic. The game is responsive and fast paced.The RPG elements are strong for a fighting game.Customization is alive and breathing here, character creation is impressively well done for such a title and is easily 'the shining star' feature of Xenoverse. Quests are engaging and plentiful. At times Xenoverse feels more like an Action RPG / Fighter Hybrid and if you are open to this then you will be enamored by what Xenoverse offers.

TONS of missing fighters, monsters, and transformations from the roster, compounded by ridiculous inclusions.

Nah, probably not.Those encounters happen rarely (in my case) and if you are lucky to get a drop no one says its not one you already have.I am sure you can imagine how frustrating it is to try and get a full set of gear (body, pants, gloves and boots)... let the grind begin.Fazit:Even if the game can probably be beaten in a single day if only the necessary levels are played (and grinded) it is still a fun game. Trying to max your char(lvl80), getting the skills together you want and boosting your stats with the right gear to break your opponent with powerfull attacks gives quite the satisfying feeling as long as long as you have the patience to roll the dice a mio. times.

If grinding levels, key items hidden behind double RNG, and repetition are for you, then I can safely recommend the title.Otherwise, Xenoverse is only for the most hardcore Dragon Ball Z fans blinded by sheer nostalgia. There's just too much BS you have to sift through to find the gold. If you are just a casual fan, either wait for a STEEP sale ($20 or less) or the inevitable Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which ideally will correct and streamline many of this game's wrongs.I'm not really sure why the game is getting such widespread positive reviews... it's NOT a good game.  Maybe people are really excited to make their ""Original Character Do Not Steal"" DBZ fan creations, so excited in fact that they overlook all the game design travesties committed in Xenoverse.Go in knowing what kind of game this is.  This isn't as straight forward as the Budokai or Budokai Tenkaichi series, and there are frustrating game design elements at EVERY turn.Ultimately it feels wrong to tell someone not to play this game.

It creates a feeling of fighting along side of our favorite childhood heroes instead of controlling them, like most games of this type does.Pros:+ Creating your unique character+ Fluid and engaging combat+ Lots of skills to pick from+ Excellent skill combos+ Great roster of characters to pick from+ Excellent replayability+ Re-living childhood+ Good storyCons:- Repetitive side missions- Costly DLCs- Mostly dead PvP sectionOh, just to mention, if by any chance you are considering to buy this game without watching anime first, go and watch anime first!"

This game encourages ki blast spam as the primary method of doing damage, unless, since the lag in this game is truly awful when you play online, you only play by yourself and get really good at the advanced movement and melee skills the game doesn't tell you how to use. Be warned however that the way this game doles out difficulty is mainly in giving opponents super armor that keeps attacks from stunning them, and prevents throws from connecting.Othen than all the cheating the AI can do, the PVP players can do, and the awful lag outside of anything but a perfect connection to all players, it's tons of fun to make a character and do some big beam blasts at and with some of your favorite characters from the series. It's a shame none of the buffs in the game actually do what they do in the show, but it's fair to assume you, the patroller, as the recipient of a wish, learn skills but use them differently than the canon characters in the Xenoverse.First time I played through the game I did it alone, and it was fun enough. Online parallel quests are fun too, just don't expect to land a lot of melee attacks, and certainly none of the combos you figured out online. Even when the servers go offline I think I'd probably still jump in from time to time."

I was a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z as a kid and I have always enjoyed playing the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai games so of course I was excited for a PC Dragon Ball game that allows you to create your own character. And I can tell you that this game is worth the wait. This game has a great fighting mechanics as they are easy to learn and very fun.The graphics are very nice and fits the art style nicely. But the biggest draw for me is the story. We finally game a DBZ game with an original story. Going though the original DBZ timeline and seeing it change and offer new possibilities was very enjoyable. The voice acting was also good but I wish my created character actually spoke some lines of dialogue. Why choose a voice for my characters if they don't speak to people. While this game has a lot of pros it also has some cons. One major con is that the online multiplayer is somewhat unbalanced with some characters being way to overpowered. But since they are still updating the game at the time of this review, I hope that they balance the game more.  In conclusion, rather you are a DBZ fan or not, you will have fun with this game."

,Not Recommended,323470,24372794,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,ΩMEGA.K,"Like so many others I will offer the opinion that this is definitely not a fighting game. It's an RPG with fighting elements that are more appropriately called button bashing.The story mode of Xenoverse is both very easy and very short, however it redeemds itself in allowing you to- create a character of your own, customise said CAC, battle with/against friends and allow you to go Super Saiyan. It has other redeeming qualities but those are the top few for me.Create a character is great because that is the 'hero' you play as during story mode and you can choose from a handful of races (Majin, Saiyan, Human, Namekian and Freiza Race) as well as add custom features such as special moves. Levelling up grants experience you can assign to your character (Ki, Health, Stamina etc). Hot tip- don't listen to anyone for PvE as your character can be built into anything you want (Ki blaster, Melee only). You can even have a mentor in the form of Cell, Goku or Hercule/Mr Satan.Parallel quests are the bread and butter of your cac levelling and are side missions unlocked through various means. This is where it gets frustrating. PQ's are one easier method of gaining new skills, clothes and abilities (the other being buying them in the shop) BUT the drop rate is RNG and therefore you are never guaranteed ANYTHING...except small mix capusles (long story). So in my example my Saiyan can't regen Ki unless he hits people, thus I need to charge ki...which I need to earn (as an ability) through MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE PQ's.You can also team up with AI's and are often forced to protect them. They are useless and unless you have to keep them alive, then they are nothing more than fodder for you to have space to charge up.TL;DR-Buy it if: you love DBZ, it's on sale and you can tolerate a fair bit of grinding."

FIVE MINUTES!If you do manage to get to and beat Super Sayin 3 Goku in 5 minutes,you then go to the next area,where you fight Super Sayin 3 Gotenks, during the fight,Super Sayin Goku and Vegeta show up,after beating them, they turn into Super Vigeto.While fighting Super Vegito, Super Gotenks gets back up.This is all one mission, and beating this mission,is the only way to get the ""I...I'm Okay"" Z-Soul,which you need if you want to finish your training with Gohon and Videl.There are several other missions with this same impossible setup.Like, ""It's like a Super Saiyan bargain sale""This mission has made me stop playing the game for good,and removed it from my favorite games list.I HATE how game makers think that making it so everything has to be farmed,adds re-playability.All it adds is annoyance, frustration, and reasons to stop playing.I'm not going to do the same damn mission hundreds of times hoping for that rare drop.I've got way better things to do with my time.It is just more repetitive farming garbage."

If you can even log in, you'll be kicked after doing a few missions.- Convoluded stats. No explanation for what any stat does, and the only way to redo your stats is by gathering the Dragon Balls, which can take 2-5 hours to farm all 7 of (Because RNG is amazing).- RNG. All I really need to say here. It ruins games.- While there ARE a lot of moves, most of them don't scale linearly with your damage stat, so you'll find yourself using a much smaller pool of abilities for maximum damage.- AIs are wonky. Your allies as AIs are borderline braindamaged, even in the storyline, and your enemies spam evasive/recovery moves like crack addicts. The only big challenge is actually landing a combo on an enemy AI.- Unflinchable boss fights. In a fighting game about combos and locking down an enemy, it completely defeats the purpose to add enemies that cannot be flinched in an easy way. Not only do enemies become bullet sponges, but they become unflinchable and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to solo unless you abuse Z-Souls or items, BOTH of which form bad habits.The Ugly:- PvP is a mess of hackers, abusive Z-Souls and glitch exploits. I'm staying clear of this until they fix it. Like, to give you an accurate image of how BAD the hacking is right now: 1 in  3 players you meet will be a hacker in PvP. Unlimited energy. Unlimited Stamina. Unlimited Health. Because who buys a game to NOT HACK, am I right?- The final boss in the storyline is such a huge letdown of a fight. Instead of adding meaningful or cool mechanics, they simply made him a huge, unflinchable waste of time."

That's may just be me though.Missing a lot of characters and transformations that were In Budokai Tenkaichi 3 but not in this one.Short fights unlike Budokai Tenkaichi 3 because of the HP.There were attack duels in Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Kamehameha vs Kamehameha or even Galick Gun for example, in this game, it just won't do anything, it will either hurt the enemy or do absolutely nothing (depends of the character, that's a negative point, really bad).Not many stages, most of the original stages aren't even in there unlike Budokai Tenkaichi 3.The soundtrack was better in Budokai Tenkaichi 3.And so on but of course, Xenoverse has good points that Budokai Tenkaichi 3 do not have.8.5/10"

Trunks is dumb in the story but it was ok. fight a few enemys new and old and i was fine with the way it played out (besides SUPER ARMOR ENEMYS. STOP DOING THIS TO US AND YOUR GAME!! NO ONE LIKES THIS. this one is worse becaues you have to do a ___ amount of damage before it goes out. BUT YOU CANT. BECAUSE THEY CAN KILL YOU WHILE YOU ATTACK.i havent found a great solution to beating this except running and gunning. lame.) but the story it self at one point attempts to force you to grind by increasing the level of the enemy quite fast near the middle. Im fine with slight grinding but the game has a terrible grinding system where its missions which get old after 2-5 clears. but epic on the first :D. The mission system is standard 100% nonthing much to be expected. The hidden bosses are OK but still standard as far as misson systems go. click a mission. has the list of drops. go in. try to find the extra boss(most games i play have this ok :/) . kill it. cry because you dident get super duper extra 500x green kamehameha. *REPEAT TILL EYEBALLS FALL OUT*, i dont have 100 hours but the story could be completed very fast if it wasent for grindfest. the games is worth max 20$ if it were up to me. problem is i dont think the price is going to go down. BO2 is still 60$..... total 6/10. the story would be less hindered if you dident have to stop half way :""/. tho the pvp is good besides elsword type lag. you shouldent buy unless its on sale. if you really want it go get it but even elsword has more play time to me at least."

Trying to be competitive in this game will kill the excitement extremely fast. From what I've seen this game needs a lot of team work so try not to make enemies out other players if possible lol.

Make a Namek, make a saiyan, make a krillin. Beat up some guys and fly around. It feels good to do this, and you get new powers as you do missions. If you want all the powers and all the clothes and everything, well, you gotta grind, which is a mixed bag for people. I like making characters, and I like Dragon Ball, so this was a very good game, and I played a lot of it. Flying around, fighting, and using powers is fun. It's not perfect but it works well enough. There's multiplayer vs but I haven't done much of it and it's probably bad. The game is not remotely balanced and you shouldn't expect it to be, which is fine.There's a lot of questionable decisions that can make things frustrating on the collection end of things. Not only are ability drops random for the most part, but also the Mentor system is random as well. You can't decide who to be your mentor, you just have to wait for them to randomly show up. This is the most annoying thing for me about this game, because while drops are random for skills, at the very least you are actually playing the game, and the skills are tied to specific missions. The DLC adds mentors but a couple of them I haven't even seen or gotten the chance to train with yet, because they show up randomly, among the pool of your old mentors too. This is probably my biggest complaint with the game.it's good fun otherwise. tldr, if you like DBZ at all get this game."

Ever since they fixed issue about a few days ago, I have NEVER been kicked out of the server. During the launch date, the server were not stable and had gliches. After a few quick fixes, the server is good and running on my end. I played for 4 hours straight and left the game running for 20 minutes while having lunch and still had a strong server connection.Also, for any complaining about the story, the game wasn't supposed to be about giving the entire story like in previous games where you played through the whole story over and over again. In this game, it concentrates on the ""What If"" scenarios and alternative endings. In a pevious review, I read that someone was complaining about how your character does not interact with the storyline and you simply disappear. I confidently say that is not the case with this game. For example, when you are facing off against the head boss, Goku appears and helps you to beat him. The dialoge is all there and at the very end, Goku even offered to fight you. Like seriously. There are tons of interactions, including with Trunks.Finally, I cannot (and I mean CANNOT) stand anyone who complains about the online fighting mode. People complain about how it is unfair to versus against people who are higher leveled than you and stuff like that. Seriously...if you are entering an online battle and you are level 30, you might as well quit now. Wait until you beat the entire storyline and complete a decent amount of the time quests. Also, make sure you train with many of the masters (like Andriod 18, Cell, Vegeta, and so on) in DBZ and master them to unlock very good moves. This is simple. Just be patient and wait until you are strong enough (like around level 55 or above) before even considering playing online. Unless you and a friend are just having a friendly, non-competitive fight.My Rating: 9/10"

I would also like a hair change between normal to super sayian my characters hair didn't change and I cried for a day because I grinded for 6 Hours trying to get SSJ. But the character creation is where this game shines and FINALLY a new DBZ story instead of the same rehashed story we always get. The fighting is SUPER fun but at times it got a little clunky but it was simplistic and made it fun for 1 v 1 matches locally because you could easily teach your friends. So overall this is my favorite DBZ game Sequel please.

,Recommended,323470,14873103,"Posted: 13 March, 2015",all,Philtastic,"Definitely a B-tier production but what a game with decent attention to detail! The gameplay is fast paced but easy to play, hard to master. I would liken it to Super Smash Brothers in that it has a roster of familiar characters that are fairly unique (along with your created custom character) and the technical barriers to playing it are very low (no memorizing weird button inputs required for specials) such that it becomes a game that you can both jump in and enjoy flashy moves right away but also has a high ceiling for skill.PvP is quite unbalanced as is but that's ok: the main attraction is the great story mode that mixes up the manga/show's storyline with hypothetical scenarios which your created character needs to fix and the ""Parallel Quests"" which are side missions based on events in the story that can be played in coop with up to 3 players.The base graphics are a mixed bag where character models obviously had most of the love put into them while much of the backgrounds and props are very simple. The art style captures the feel of the DBZ show while doing its own thing. Many of the textures are very fuzzy and lose detail at a distance but forcing 16x anisotropic filtering in your drivers really helps clean up the game and, because it performs very well, you might even be able to play it at 4K at 60 fps which is what I'm doing on a single Radeon R9 280X.Overall, an amazing brawler/fighting game that would be quite good even without the DBZ fan service but makes good use of the Dragon Ball universe.

76561198013955014,Recommended,323470,14699980,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Sagetim,"This game is great. It's basically a fighting game that they bolted multiplayer on, and the end result is that it plays like an updated budokai with online multiplayer. When the servers aren't lagging, action in multiplayer is fast paced and having players on your side is extremely helpful. In single player mode, lag doesn't really factor into the equation (though if you're online and playing single player, you might find yourself disconnected due to lag, generally after a mission has completed and you've got your rewards).If you want to play it offline? just go into steam offline mode, and start the game up. It tells you 'hey, we can't connect, so the online stuff isn't available' and works just fine. While offline, action is fast paced, and the parallel missions can be very difficult because, at best, you'll be taking two computer controlled characters in with you to help out against the challenges you'll face. And the computer players can be Very dumb. But they are rarely completely useless.That said, the game just came out and the servers are busy crapping themselves over the high volume of players. I've only crashed once so far. All my other problems with the game stem from server connectivity issues. I look at this like a new mmo just came out, because there's probably a comparable number of players trying to do online right now, and I've found that at night, the server connectivity issues and lag seem to ease off a lot (which I would assume is because there are fewer players online). I doubt that this will continue to be a problem.In the end, the server lag isn't going to stop you from being able to enjoy the game, or at least it's not going to keep you from playing through story mode and the offline features. It Will be nice when that problem clears up, however. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes dbz games and has been disappointed by the ones in recent years that have been so bad.Edit: Oh, right, I forgot to mention that the game is also well made enough that even my cheap little 8 dollar gamepad (a third party PS3/PC controller) works just fine with the game. I would imagine that it works just fine with any console game pad as well, but lacking access to such things, I haven't had a chance to try and test that."

The combat feels as true to the source material that you could probably get and the created character campaign portion is inventive (written by Toriyama, expect nothing less than great). The new MMO-esque social hub has replaced a traditional menu system and I can understand how it can bother someone who doesn't want to run for 10 seconds to get to a certain menu but I appreciate what they've done with it. Ultimately it all helps add to the emersion into the DBZ universe and make you feel like a character in the series and not just a videogame player. It might get more annoying later, but for now I like it. But that is not the game...that's just a social system and the game is awesome. I looked at most of the poor reviews and none of them really gave any valid reasons for not recommending this game. People whined about the game having an MMO hub world as a menu, or that the game was too hard. Or that they didn't understand where to go. ♥♥♥♥ing read the text instead of button mashing through the tutorial and then writing a poor review because you're too impatient to sit through 5 minutes of guidance. The controls are just fine, you can't custom edit the control scheme but the defaults are just fine as is. There is no problem with the target lock system if you know what you're doing and don't hit the wrong commands to switch targets. This is a DBZ fan's wet dream and it's on the mother♥♥♥♥ing PC.Cons- This was developed primarily for consoles so the social functionality you would expect for a PC title just isn't there. For example there is no textual chat bar anywhere, the most you can do is edit preset responses, It's easy to play wioth friends if you have them on Steam but difficult to link up with those that are not on your Steam friend list. Also, because this game has to cater to last gen consoles there are a lot of things that are limited such as loading screens between the 3 areas of Toki Toki city (the social hub world) and the destruction of environment animations disappear shortly after destruction. However the game still looks beautiful. Hopefully the next installment to this game will not be built for last gen consoles and these issues would quickly dissappear.9/10"

The battles feel nice, the character customization does it's job well, and the story adds a new interesting spin on the DBZ story we all know. They did a good mix of fighting, and rpg mechanics. You are able to equip up to 7 skills, and put skill points into 6 different stats. The skills are easy to use, but it is when to use them that takes skills. The hand-to-hand combat feels nice, and you can string together nice combos, that can string into more combos.The story is nice, but really short. There are few missions in the main campaign, and they don't cover most of the story. They hit all the main points of the DBZ story, but they leave out things like cooler, and most of the movies besides broly, and bardok. They are costumes from other movies, but no missions/characters.The multiplayer is fun, and works farly well. The servers are haing problems right now, but that will be fixed soon. There are some cheap tactics that people can use, and are annoying to deal with. Most of the time though you will have a far fight.The game is not perfect though. Some missions have you fighting a 3-5 on 1, and the computers will stagger you, and basically make it impossible to move. It is possible to deal with it, and win but it can be very annoying to the player."

I was a HUGE DBZ fan once upon a time in my kid years, but playing this just brought it all back to me. First off, being able to customize my own DBZ character, that's pretty damn cool. Secondly, being able to fight in pivotal points in the DBZ timeline was like a trip down memory lane to me. The story itself is predictably ridiculous as per DBZ tradition (brought Trunks in early, yes!) I just earned Super Sayain 1 and yeah it is pretty OP, but is a great trump card when you're back is against the wall. Some things I don't like is that you need to beat story mode to unlock more custom slots which is annoying, no training mode to practice moves and while the custom character options are great, not as great as I had hoped. Luckily, it seems some of these issues will be fixed in DBZX2. So if you're looking for a great DBZ game, this should satisfy you until the sequel comes out.Final grade: A-"

A must buy for all Dragon ball fans, but maybe not if you are not into the series.STORY:The story focuses on your own created character. You can choose between a Saiyan, Earthling, Namekian, Majin or Friezas race. You are paired with Future Trunks to stop villains from destroying the timeline. You will fight battles from the Saiyan saga to Battle of Gods. The voice actors from Dragon Ball Kai all reprise their roles. Overall the story is plenty original and  probably the best that can be done from a Dragon Ball game.Gameplay:Unfortunatly gameplay is where this game struggles. While its always nice pulling off a Kamehameha or the distrcto disk. The actual combat itself is very shallow. Combos are down to when you stop pressing a light attack and start to heavy attack. Also if you go super saiyan you get unlimted ki attacks meaning you can literally break the game.As this is an RPG you will have to complete side quests to reach a high enough level to continue the story. However there is also a massive grind to reach a level. (Unless you purchase the DLC when you get missions you can complete at a level you shouldnt be at. I managed to go up four levels in one mission because i played a DLC mission that was meant to be endgame but was too easy. There is also a master system where you can get charcters from the show to be your mentor. this can unlock new moves for your character. Yet the progression is way too slow. I went the whole story mode with only two mentors.CONTENT:At around fourty characeters, a story mode and a lot of side missions. DBX is certainly not lacking in that department. i have put in fifteen hours and have still only scratched the surface.While it does have its flaws Dragon Ball Xenoverse certainly is a fun time. Maybe pick it up in a sale or wait for the sequel that is coming out near the end of this year."

,Recommended,323470,24563598,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,Twilight,"One of the issues that has plauged DBZ games from the start has been that they have repeated the same story over and over again making for a bland and predictable experience. Xenoverse switches up the formula and allows you to create your own character and the main plot point is that you go out and fix some of the ripples that have been created recently throughout time. The character customization and variety is very satisfying and extensive, allowing you to choose from four different races (Human, Saiyan, Buu, and Frieza) and apply numerous cosmetic changes (most of which also alter your stats). The level progression of your character is similar to that of an RPG with experience gains and stat points that can be applied. The quality of the combat is very subjective, personally I really enjoyed it as it's very fast based and action packed while other people seem to find it repetitive and annoying. Watching gameplay should help you decide if you like it or not. Ultimately I don't think this game is worth buying for $49.99 but I definitely recommend picking it up for like $20 if it goes on sale as it will provide you some solid hours of entertainment."

Warning though the game's lack of tutorial makes learning some moves annoying before learning the command(like throwing and teleporting) but other wise is a good simplistic combat system for casual gamers to enjoy with enough depth for those more adept.The create a character while minimum is pretty decent(Wish there was more) and to make more then one character you gotta use the dragon balls(kinda annoying really)The game has HOURS worth of content and unlockables and is well worth the money without any of the DLC.So yeah if you are a DBZ fan and got a decent rig I recommend this game highly"

These are random item drops for everything collectable that can take forever to farm.The Hub World is unnecessaryCertain moves are OP and the system encourages specialization in certain playstyles. Spamming is encouraged.A character is unavailable due to it only being allowed via preorder. This should be buyable as cheap DLC.Still, it is perhaps the best Dragonball game.

I've been a Dragonball Z fan for as long as I can remember, and whether you are a fan or not, I think this game will be a fun and satisfying experience for everybody. The game is able to run very smoothly even on my laptop, and I rarely ever have any issues with playing it.The only game in my library that I've played longer than this title is Skyrim, and that's saying a lot. There are plenty of things to do in this game, so it'll keep you busy for hours upon hours. The game has full controller support, so and the controls are thankfully very easy to learn, as instead of having to pull off annoying combos, you can just use the trigger buttons to access your Super and Ultimate moves provided you have enough energy to use them. I have had some issues with the game responding to my button presses and a little bit of input lag, but that might just be my computer or the graphics settings.This game looks pretty, plays well, and is all and all a very fun game to pick up and play. My main criticisms are that sometimes the RNG is terrible and it makes trying to find masters or gathering Dragon Balls or getting certain item drops from quests rather tedious, which can sometimes make playing them feel like a chore. Another thing I would have liked to see was an option in the clothing and accessory shops to preview what you're buying. You dont get to see anything but the name and stats of the clothes you buy, so you either have to look it up online, or buy it blindly. If you dont happen to like it, your only choice is to just deal with it or sell it back for half of what you paid for it. Some quests are also almost unfairly hard, and some of those quests are ones you must get from NPC's, so you may not bring support characters or finish the quest online with a friend until you beat it once by yourself. It wouldnt be so bad if it werent for the fact that some of these involve characters that like to spam their super attacks so much you cant even move and get comboed from full health until you die, one of these quests being one where you have to fight at least 15 characters by yourself to complete it.Complains aside, this is a really fun game, and an interesting take on the story in the DBZ universe, and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially a DBZ fan."

Though my bone to pick with this game is the voice actors, they're from the Kai, the original in my personal opinion were far better, like the ones from older Dragonball Z games, they got it perfect with Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and they had a spell of pretty crap games, cause Bust Limit was only up to the Cell Saga, which annoyed me and Raging Blast and Raging Blast 2 lacked that fun factor like Tenkaichi 3, Ultimate Tenkaichi as well, that was fantastic when it came to character customization, but it felt slower than the originals, as for the multiperson fighting on this game, I don't rate it that high, but the sheer speed of this game during fights is what makes this game epic, so all in all, 8/10 from me, the timeline from Saiyan Saga through to Majin Buu is fantastic, downsides? Voice actors and the multi character battles, it should feature a tag-in style, but I can understand where they come from with your own character saving history..clever idea, so I can understand why multi character battles are needed, that's all there is to it :D"

On the other hand, it's a gamers frustrating sequence.For anybody that has grown up watching Dragon Ball, or is a really big fan of the Dragon Ball Universe, this will give you a lot of cool moments. Story progression where you think ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is cool"", Customization that leaves your jaw dropped, animations that are fluid as water, side quests where you are living your childhoods dream. I mean, c'mon. We all wanted to do a Saiyan Invasion one time or the other.And for the most part, this stays true for the whole portion of the game. You will always feel reminded that this is a Dragon Ball Game from fans to fans - and you can absolutely see the passion just soaking you in. Just so much love in the detail as been put in regards of presentation - one could say this is the best Dragon Ball Game in that regard yet.But then. there is a part of the game where you will just want to smash the controller into oblivion. Quest Designs where you do not feel challenged, and yet you cannot solve the mission. Simply because you were underleveled, or because Gohan did not help you when you fought off Buu (screw you Gohan, I hate you forever because of this). Or where you are simply waiting for it to end, and you feel like you have figured it out but have to repeat that step 10 times to continue. Luckily, this problem rather arises towards the second half of the game - but it's a huge issue that seriously demotivates a player. The only reason I ultimately played through was because I was intrigued by the final part of the story - which was  then kind of a letdown personally speaking.The combat is a really two edged blade. On one hand it feels fast(given you play in 60 frames and on high settings), there is a lot of speed and movement is really flexible. All the special attacks also feel very powerful, and have a lot of unique touch to them, where they would feel more like pallette swaps in past entries. This is a huge step forward in comparison to any DB game.The big problem is however: It's broken. It's completely unbalanced. I played the game through with roughly 3 techniques - Super Saiyan 2, one of the Ginyu Forces Ultimate Attack and Charging. And I beat everyone with that technique. And I eventually HAD to play it this way. Normal attacks later on would not help because of Evasive Attacks and Guard Point Armor. Just attacking would result in me losing. But this way I had to escape, charge, hope that I won't get hit, go to the enemy, do the Ultimate, escape, charge, etc. . Not fun. Not at all. There is no challenge, no strategy or unique problem solving involved in this.Still, with these problem existant, there is no doubt how much work has been put into this game. The sheer mass of content is incredible, the cutscenes are good, the voices are done very well, the costumes are amazing in variety, you can create completely different characters in playstyle, and it essentially plays how you imagine and always wanted a dragon ball to feel like. It's amazing... and frustrating. Especially because the lookout does not play at all like the actual game, and more like an MMO, which is unfortunate. Going from shop to shop is slow, finding teachers is tedious, and starting the quests is boring. DOING the quests is cool, but having to walk for 1 minute to retry a side quests is just plain bad design.Do I recommend this game?Yes, under following conditions:-You are a really big fan of the dragon ball universe-You always wanted to be your own dragon ball character-You like customization-You like RPGsNo, under following conditions:-You have never heard of dragon ball before or never really bothered with the franchise-You dislike leveling-you want a challenging (and fair) game-You want a complex and always suprising combat(you will get the first, but not the latter)Considering who this game is aimed to, i will give it a thumbs up. But always consider what you want from the game. I had my fun, but I wish I had stopped playing a little earlier. My initial reaction was big suprise and great joy, but the longer I played the less I saw. Prepare to see the same."

The fights are more intense as you'll find yourself battling against numerous opponents at once (with backup.....sometimes) who can all dish out some pretty devasting blows in team fights! (apart from Krillin, he's still as useless as ever). Don't get me wrong there will be times where you are trying to beat the same guy 5,6 or 7 times but it's the kind of game that you won't put down until you demolish that guy!.The story is great and has some fantastic content for old & new Dragonball fans a like, you'll find yourself battling through the same sagas we all know and love with some nice, cool twists. And trust me, they won't disappoint!. Also the fact you can create your own character from a number of races is something the Dragonball games have been lacking in previous years!.If you're like me and love the Dragonball series/games then I can safely say that you'll spend a fair few hours on this game!.

DRAGON BALL Z! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!(::)Will add TL;DR at bottom of post if requestedBackgroundIt should be known that I have been an avid DragonBall [DB] aficionado since childhood and my views are going to be slightly biased. That being said, I can't think of any other words other thanThank you Bandai Namco & Dimps; Finally!!!I’m not even sure how I can accurately express the joy I’m feeling from playing this game, in addition to the extra vivacity I feel when I’m reading all of the other positive and supporting reviews on Steam.Before this game, the most significant DBZ titles that I passionately played the most with friends were""DragonBall Z: Budokai 3""and""DragonBall Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3. The reason why I’ve played those titles the most is because on my PC, I’ve had the luxury of running the wonderful PCSX2 and Dolphin Emulators on my PC to get as close to a “truly native” DBZPC experience.Ever since 2007, I have become envious of all of the franchise’s new releases on other platforms, and I had no intention of buying a whole separate console just for a few games. (I had [and probably still have] a slight PC Master Race ego… even though I was running CONSOLE emulators). Xenoverse [XV] finally fills that void. NOT ONLY because it’s just simply a DBZ game on PC, but because it really is a heartwarming love letter to fans and a respectably fine-tuned experience.GameplayBy now, if you’re still playing a DragonBall Z game these days, then you most certainly aren’t doing it for the story. Instead of once again watching Goku and his friends kick everyone’s♥♥♥♥♥in the same fashion that we’ve known for years, XV incorporates time travel into a plot about Dragon Ball's history, and how it's being changed by an unknown force. Venturing to different points in the well-known timeline, it's up to you to set history back on its intended course. To help fix the alterations of time, you play as your own custom character. Choosing from a selection of five different races, which includes the ”Frieza Race” [Unisex], Namekians [Unisex], Earthlings [M & F], Saiyans [M & F], and the Majin [M & F]. The character creator isn't as deep as say, Skyrim’s, but there are enough options to keep you satisfied.XV is more of a role-playing game than a straight up brawler.Even though I personally have never touchedDragonBall Online[Damn you Korean SSN requirement!!!], it definitely plays much more like it than say,Budokai 3. However, it's not just a button masher or a game of chance. The gameplay is amazing and actually requires skill. The fighting system has blended the best of the Budokai franchise, and tossed some Tenkaichi influence in there as well. The result is a fantasticfast-paced,fluid, and balanced hybrid of the two games I have so passionately been emulating on my PC.The nature of being an RPG helps stay true to the series, because “Power Levels” throughout the story actually mean something.Most importantly though, is that the entire experience feels fresh, and I love how the developers focused on adding a sense of community with the online Toki Toki City hub. That's not to say that the title's only playable online, though. It's perfectly enjoyable if you prefer to be alone.Despite all of the other wonderful things XV has to offer, the core of every DragonBall game is going to be its combat. At first, combat seems quite limited, and admittedly, the start of a new game and its tutorial are quite slow. You make do with the same few basic combos, a couple of generic techniques, and fights may quickly become repetitive. However, if you stick with it, battles really begin to open up as you unlock & make use of longer combo strings, eye-watering super moves, and teleport to your heart's content. I find it very fulfilling.DesignXV comes laced with a catchy soundtrack, iconic voice-acting featuring both Japanese and English voices, and fluid animations. The game has a very feel to it, especially during its combat. XV is a gorgeous game. All of the classic sound effects that you are familiar with are here as well. I would have loved more destructible environments though. In addition, in comparison to the battle locations, the Toki Toki City, while still true to the DB universe, feels it lacks the same quality as the environments do.ConclusionOverall, the DB universe is off to a solid start this generation thanks to XV. There’s still plenty of room for improvement, but fans are going to find plenty to love with the latest chapter in this long-running saga that tells the same story but with a different spin.[In addition, it is also one of the best anime PC game “ports” I have ever seen, supporting resolutions up to 4K & variable refresh rates for 120Hz and 144Hz monitors.]"

The choice of Buu-race, Human, Saiyan, Namekian and Frieza-race. Tons of nostalgic memories and moments from Dragon Ball Z. This rattles off just a little of Dragon Ball Xenoverse's offerings.The game starts off somewhat slow, yet entertaining. Other fans like myself will find themselves staring in awe at the intro and several cutscenes made to look much like the episodes. The difficulty ramps up quick, but whilst hunting for items in Parrallel Quests, you level up and gain enough ability to overcome the difficulty relatively easily.Whilst it is still early days, and the game loses connection to Xenoverse's servers on a rather regular occasion, it is a very solidly built game.I would like to see the ability for two people to play with controllers, on the one PC, and work through the game together... But that's probably being a bit picky.Worth the money? If you are a die hard fan YES!...If not, I suggest waiting for a sale to bring it around the $40USD mark.

Decent character selection, tons of moves, fun scenarios to play, and the controls are really simple*. Way more fun than the traditional 1v1 figher type games; the open levels and multiple enemies do a great job of making you feel like you're reliving an episode from the TV series.Playing co-op with friends is a ton of fun, although it's fairly cumbersome and clunky to set up a session and invite friends. You have to create a new lobby, and then invite your friend(s) through steam every single time you want to start a new mission. No real party system, and no way to add more than one mission to a queue. Definitely annoying, but not a deal breaker. Also, I highly recommend going through the graphics settings and removing the refresh/frame rate cap. It looks fantastic with higher frames in singleplayer, although it will still be limited to 60fps during online play.Maybe not quite worth $50, but EASILY worth picking up whenever it's on sale (I got it and the DLC on the summer sale, no regrets here).*Disclaimer: Get a controller. No. No, no, no. Seriously. Do not try to play this with a keyboard. Good news: It will support a PS4 and Xbox One controller, so if you have one laying around, it's straightforward plug and play."

The story is intersting, albeit short, but I love it because it's not the same story that ever DBZ game has, it isn't just playing through the story of the anime, but a new story entirely. I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to recreate their own fan-made characters in the Dragon Ball universe, we've all made Bass the Namekian, or Frigid, Frieza's crazy uncle, or just ourselves as saiyans. With Xenoverse, you too can go SSJ2."

Dragonball Xenoverse is definately made for the fans of the series, but it may be a hard game for people new to the series to jump into.Story: Bad guys are changing the history of DBZ and you have been summon to stop them and restore balance to time. Simple and fun, just like DBZ.Gameplay: For those looking for a detail fight system like Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Mortal Kombat will be disappointed. The buttons for combat are simply light and heavy attack, special Ki attacks, and special strike attacks. Stamina meter for blocking and dodging and ki meter for special attacks. The combat remind me a lot of a Super Smash Bro style game. By that I mean its fast pace and easy to get use to for any player.You create your own custom character from one of several races: Frieza clan, Namekian, Saiyan, Earthling, Majin. As you do missions you level up and can put your attribute points into stats (attack, special attack, special strike, health, stamina, ki). You can change outfits, equipment, z-souls (a special trait that activate during a fight), special attacks.The game main story mission get much harder, so you need to stop in between every saga and play a parallel quest to level up so that the next story mission is easier. Parallel quests can be played alone or with people online. Playing with friends online is where this game shines (mostly because the ally AI borders from being dumb as a bag of brick or your savior at times).Overall if you are a fan of the game series then you probably already have this game and playing it. If you new to the series it may be hard to get into because you only see part of the main DBZ story and it a warp version of it anyway. But don't let that detour you. DB Xenoverse is a fun fast pace game that is easy to get into and much fun.Now if you will excuse, it time to grind my character some more."

The create a character option is what makes this game the best yet, if you're not looking to create your own character...you may want to skip this purchase.2) If you enjoy fighting games, you will master this one in minutes. It's very simple and straight forward, you get a handful of basic combos to use which you can use to string together longer combos once you customize your supers. It's what can make this game repetitive, but also fun since you don't need to concentrate to enjoy it.Is it perfect? Hell no, if a teacher were to grade Dimps they'd likely get a B or B-...but it's the best we've got so far and is worth picking up if you have someone to play with. Single player in this game frankly sucks, the AI is about as helpful as a monkey's♥♥♥♥♥♥much of the time and the enemies you fight will either sit there and accept your punishment or they will make sure you have no chance to block or parry once the first hit lands. If I compare it to mortal kombat...you can go from pwning two characters at once to having your face shoved into humble pie by 3 Shao Khan hammers to the skull.If you're just worried if you're going to get your moneys worth with this game...in my personal opinion it's worth it. I believe I've got over 70 hours in this game so far and I still haven't managed to unlock all the moves...granted it's mainly because the reward system in this game is based purely on luck once you satisfy the challanges, such as ""Beat within 5 mins""...that's where it gets frustrating, when you complete the challenge and the randomized system doesn't give you the opportunity to get an ultimate finish at the end...and when it does you won't always get a new skill. Some like this feature, some hate it. It's really personal preference...same situation that Destiny has going, some enjoy repeating the strikes...others would rather swallow a live scorpion.I've mentioned some of the most frustrating things in Xenoverse already, so if you're not completely turned off...then you should probably give it a try!

,Recommended,323470,17038203,"Posted: 13 July, 2015",all,oddbasket,"Objective review:(Scroll for TL:DR version)DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE is a game where you can play almost every notable character in the Dragon Ball universe, but more importantly, you can play your own character out of 5 races of Saiyan, Namekian, Earthling, Frieza and Majin.General Gameplay:The game takes on the formula of an MMO's solo grind, complete with a social zone for casual interactions, but it is not an MMO.It has a solo only linear story mode called 'Time Patrols' where each Time Patrol is a mission that places the player in every notable battle against familiar enemies in the Dragon Ball story from Z onwards. In between, a player may need to level or gear up whereby he can do 'Parallel Quests' (henceforth refered to as PQ) which are mini missions that again places the player in familiar situations from the Dragon Ball world except these situations occur in a parallel timeline where conditions and enemies skew from the original story. PQs are the only way to earn equips and can be done solo or with a team up to 3 players.Here's how the game follows the MMO model, every equip (Skills, Clothes, Z-Souls) drops from a PQ while some common ones can be bought from the vendor after unlocking the corresponding PQ it drops from, but the drops are RNG based, and there is even double RNG as the conditions (bonus objectives) to make them drop are RNG as completing them doesn't guarantee an Ultimate Finish to appear. This while adding a lot of replay value because the fights are generally fun, it can also get frustrating when you fail to get the drop you want repeatedly. There is limited trading in-game, but it is a leap of faith as you can only send a gift or receive one. To avoid abuse or fraud, trade is limited up to rank 2 rarity items, which also means the good items have to be farmed individually.Multiplayer:This is a hit and miss. While in a multiplayer lobby, you share the zone with other players where you can inspect them, team up with or challenge them.The server provides the multiplayer lobby and matchmaking, but game lobbies and games or matches are local hosted. The local hosting is where the multiplayer fails hard. The game has problems for players joining others in a different region, where requesting a join or inviting someone would fail. You will get a fail to join message if someone you've invited accepts or someone who request to join your team is accepted but the system fails, but the other party who requests to join a team and fails receive no notice. Also, I have never succesfully found a single game or match lobby being not in the server region, either none is showing up for me, or there are no players (which is doubtful). I have on rare occasions joined someone's team in a different region, but have remained on the objectives screen unable to start while I can hear the other player already fighting through his mic. This results in a very bad multiplayer experience for players in other regions, unless you have friends playing who are in the same region as you, which is odd since I am on a fibre connection and the experience harkens back to slow ADSL gaming.Final Words:The game provides good replayability by following an MMO's solo grind model, it took me about 100 hours to have unlocked every skill, character and equips. The builds could be better balanced, for example, for PVE to clear the bonus objectives, range is favorable while melee is hard sometimes to even just complete the PQ (unless it's your second character with equips already pre-farmed). Melee pretty much is the go to for PVP.TL:DR:Pros:Nearly every notable Dragon Ball character playableBe part of epic battles in Dragon Ball historyGood replayability (100+ hours to collect every skill, character, useful equips)Cons:RNG based drops can be frustrating at timesMultiplayer barely works for players across different regionsGame imbalances means the enjoyment quotient of range and melee builds is a variable experience"
,Recommended,323470,14685022,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Laiyenu the Bloodgaru Queen,"Well here's a short review.Pro's-DBZ game-Not to bad fighting system (overlooking a few op combos)-New story arc to get involved in (as in your own character)-Race Selection for CaC is neat with each race having different statsMiddle ground-OK Character Customization, I wish there was alot more, but as it stands now it works for the most part you can pretty much make any character from DB into this game the eyes / hair / everything is ripped straight from exsisting characters (No Videl hair though for some reason...)-Farming Skills and Outfits, could be toned down a bit but its not a HUGE deal because you'll be playing the game anyway.Con's-Fighting music is awful.-CaC does NOT allow any real PERSONAL choices, no Ki color, no Tail (for saiyans), no hair change for female SSJ, No making your own Attack (even if it was just copy paste with a changed name and Color shader)-Outfits, Outfits are the equivilant to equipment in RPG's they have stats and yes I would love to wear the schoolgirl skirt / top outfit all the time, but 4star outfit has +5 (instead of a +2) to my stats. Outfits should have been seperate and Equipment or more stat points should be given to fill this.-Outfits Part2, only some outfits can be colored to your liking, all the other stuff (again straight ripped from DBZ characters) can only be its original color.-Difficulty, some battles are extremely frustrating, others to easy, the final boss was a cake walk compared to buu and ginyu. Could use some tweaking imo.-Roster is smaller than previous DBZ games, pretty usetting.-Server Issues, they suck, like real hard, if your in single lobby even expect to get dissconnected every other mission and kicked to title screen, its like they made the server out of bubble gum and spare wiring.Overall I'm loving it, I just wish there was more CaC options. 6/10 Would bang Videl (Before she cut her pony tails off)"

In this case, knowing the series from a-z I do notice how that knowledge helps you in the sidequests a lot. (Grabbing ape's tails, tagging ssj3 before attacking)There is one weird thing that a lot of people see as a negative point:Before the game explains you which keys do what you have to beat 3 enemies (frieza, cell and buu) without knowing what does what exactly.The game plays away so natural that you actually don't need the whole explenation and tutorial to beat them, what they did here is show you how easilly mastered the basics of the game are before explaining all the details. In my oppinion: Awesome!The DLC's are mostly useful for online playing (pvp) due too the skills included in them, giving you wombocombo's that wombo the combo out of everything and everyone.You do see a lot of tutorials on ""how to powerlevel"", Don't even bother that way. Destroy the baby ape (takes 1 minute if you stay behind him and grab his tail constantly (keyboard E + Q / controlelr LB + B) and within 50 minutes you're max level)Lets talk some pro's and cons.Pro:GraphicsStory is spot onCostumizationLoads of secondairy objectivesControlls are easyIt's DragonBall!Con:Fast playtroughToo easyDialogs are buggy8/10 Very well playable and enjoyable game.

There are points of the game that should be revised like the server connection whos the bad point of this game. Characters is fine, but needs more from anime like dodoria and majin vegeta, dabura and others, the game needs more scenarios too, and world destruction is bad! The game needs more voices and character custumization, why don't in a DLC? the game is 8/10 because server connection is terrible and the game level design is terrible for a game of this generation and RPG style, AI saves for missions over 40 and main quests over frieza saga.Whatever, the team is doing a great job i hope more games from bandai and just on Steam!8/10"

As an avid gamer though, I feel there is much more room for improvement. That being said this is still a solid DB game and will keep you busy for hours on end, there are a lot of side missions to complete, ranks to achieve and the inevitable RNG that comes with claiming items. Creating your own character and building them up however you wish is a most welcome addition also and adds to replayability since each race/gender combo can be built differently. The game can be frustrating at times but what game isn't? Difficulty spikes, blatantly cheating AI, poor servers and terrible use of RNG mechanics are among the top frustrations I encountered.

(You may have up to 7 presets for easy swapping on character select screen.)-Play solo or with others. (You must play alone 100% til you clear the beginning tutorial sections.)-Get destroyed by multiple opponents....over and over again!*-*-*-*-*Info:I saw the Credits after a bit of suffering from some difficult adversaries.  I got to the ""end"" by about level 40 (It depends on how you play).  It was an interesting journey which made me definitely change my fighting style every so often.  But there are still plenty more quests to do and levels to gain.*-*-*-*-*Review:-Playstyle: Very fast paced, sometimes spam-like, but enjoyable.-Graphics: Simple and pleasant. Tends to be bright like anime (obviously).-Controls: Fairly decent. Using a controller makes my experience better for such a game.--Camera can get awkward depending on how close a wall section is to your character.-Replayability: Varied enough. Multiple races with different bonuses.  Different fighting styles / skills also add a large difference in how a battle is approached.-Entertainment Value:  Great for Dragonball Fans. Very good for fighting genre lovers.  But it can easily get boring if you tend to lose interest in battling against AI and/or other players over and over again.  Though you do have the option to choose if you want to be alone or not.-Multiplayer: I cannot comment much on this as I have yet to play with others. But I noticed there might be an NPC that allows you to play local co-op (Probably Versus) if you have more than one controller.  So I just think that is a very nice feature to have and mention.*-*-*-*-*Conclusion:If you don't have a crazy lust for this game at the moment like I did, then just wait for a discount price. You won't be missing that much.If your mind is bent on it, you love Dragonball / Z / GT / etc, like to play fighting games, just get it!

Yes, those fights are hard, but the first one I had trouble with was Beerus and Wiz, which is supposed to be a hard fight. I got frustrated, quit playing several times, then came back, looked at my stats and skills and respecced and chose new skills and suddenly the fight was at least doable. You can't put points into every stat, you have to figure out what you're good at and spec into it. Not even Super Saiyan God Goku has a super-high score in every stat."

Namco Bandai did a great job as always when it comes to anime games, so if you enjoy any of there other titles such as the Ultimate Ninja Storm Series and you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z I would definitely pick it up. The game is perfect for completionists, much like myself, but I found once I approached a part where I had almost everything in terrms of skills,clothing,accesories, etc. the game became very dull and while at times the grindy RNG seemed fun it got very old very quick.DLC:While the DLC is very cool, I would expect for the DLC being more than half of the games price it would add about 60% more features than what was originally included, which I found it VERY LACKING in. If you are a huge fan and you really want the DLC, go for it, it is definitely entertaining with what it adds. For the average DBZ Franchise fan I would only recommend buying the DLC if it is half off soley because I felt it was lacking in content and there was only 1 DLC Pack that really had all the good items and attacks.Recap:For any Dragon Ball fan this game is a must have and I would even go as far as to say casual RPG fans should DEFINITELY consider this one especially when it goes on sale. Unlike the game I wouldn't recommend the DLC for the average consumer.Overall Score(Purely game and not DLC): 8.5/10"

This is great for that personal touch in any game.- Skillset/attribute system. Speaks for itself.- Different clothing gives you different stats.- Very interesting storyline (although it could have been presented better)Cons:- Main character (your character) never says a thing during the entire storyline. One male and one female voice actor would have been fine, as long as we get rid of that stupid silent treatment during any and all cinematics.- The city is very dull, it acts instead of having a menu and it's very boring to run around. If it was all gathered in one area at least, it might have made us slightly less bored.- In the start it gives us a false feeling of an MMO, which is extremely disappointing when we realise it's not.All in all, I love the actual gameplay, but during the downtime there's nothing to keep one interested."

I am however, a big fan of Team Fourstar, which actually had a certain ghost character show up in this as a custom voice.Now, that all said? This is a great game if you are a fan of the DBZ franchise. Rather than use the overly complicated mechanics of Budokai Tenkaichi (Where everything has 3 different counter mechanics, good god), this goes for a more simple form of combat that's easy to pick up. You fly, you shoot, you punch, you use specials. What makes this one so unique is its character creation, as your character is the main character of the game. You'll get gear, level up, fight tougher foes, etc. Being a Japanese game, it's VERY grindy however and has bad drop rates on the stuff you'll actually want, so be ready to replay things a lot.If you're willing to put up with that though and enjoy battles that involve smashing people into mountains, unleash ridiculous energy blasts, and want to co-op with your buddies while doing so?

The game overall is very fun and you'll have plenty of things to do inside of the game. There is dlc coming out which of course no one is a fan of dlc but, it will include new characters, stories, and missions. There however are some very poor things that come with this game. Obviously this is a portfrom consoles and we have limited ways of speaking to each other ingame. I feel like their needs to be an update to make it more pc friendly and allow you to speak to each other by typing inside of the game like any other MMO based game does. The only other real issue I have with this game is inviting people from your steam friendlist to your party. But. there's a work around for this which you can just go create a new quest and invite your friend that way. Now for the things I enjoy about this game. The possibility for characters are pretty endless with custom characters, the missions are extremely challenging and you need to get your levels up and figure out how your character works in what situations to beat a boss. Overall this game is extremely good and is worth picking up if you're into anime or the dragon ball z series. It's a story based game but, contains a lot of spoilers for the story of dragon ball z so, be warned now if you wanted to watch the anime it will be spoiled."

What do you prefer: 2-D battles (Street Fighter) or dynamic battles (let's take Star Fox 64 multiplayer as example)?2. Think on how the Dragon Ball saga works. What do you expect from the battles?3. Have you ever played Dragon Ball Z Legends?Alright. I can say that I played some Dragon Ball games before in my childhood. Final Bout, which was weird but nice. Tenkaichi, Budokai and others, even for portable consoles. But none of them could reach the most Dragon Ball immersive game: Dragon Ball Z Legends. That game was a real replica of the DBZ's world in a video game. Free and fast movements, lots of hits, vanishing speed, mountains destructions, everything, teamplay (you +3 or +4 bots).So yeah. Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the new Dragon Ball Z Legends in gameplay aspects!Everything that very old game had, DBX has modern and better!You're free to run, to fly, to attack, to block, to dodge, to vanish, to ki blast, to special blast, to special attack, to joke, to juke, to anything. In a teamplay battle!! And on some missions, different events occurs based on different triggers during the battle (based on the anime/manga)! For example: You can win a battle against Frieza fastly, but if Krillin dies, then Goku appears in full anger and becomes a SSJ to help you!I can surely say that this is the second replica of the DBZ world in a game I've ever played!Now for the other features:[Graphics]I really enjoyed its graphics. At maximum config, it feels very smooth and clean, keeping that Anime feeling very well! The characters, details and effects, of course, aren't the top, but for a DB game they're perfect.And if you use low config, they're still cool. You don't really lose quality, you just don't get the best quality.[Sound]I found no problem with the sounds. I'd say they're pretty good for the game.[Story]We're ALL tired of repeating the Sayian, Frieza, Cell and Majin Boo's sagas. And yes, in DBX we play all that sagas again. BUT!! It's very like a game I've played before called Final Fantasy Record Keeper, for mobile, where the past is getting problematic and you have to go back and fix it. So you play the all-known story, but with some different events. I can say that it is the original story, at the same time that it isn't. In parallel, you have to deal with the villains that are causing this distortion. And you do all that with your own hero.[Gameplay]Already talked about that when I mentioned Dragon Ball Z Legends.[Problems]There are, of course, some bugs and weird stuff. But with the miracle of the internet and online gaming, this game is constantly being updated to add new features and fix bugs. =)"

It's now my favroite game of all time and easlily tops any other Dragon Ball Z game out there, and here are just a few reasons why! Now if you have played other Dragon Ball Z games before, the first thing that might have popped into your head is: phhhhhhhhhhhht please, Tenkaichi Budokai 3 had more characters! Well, i'm sorry to be like the 1,000 person to tell you this but most of those were just re-skins with the same copy paste moves, and they mean nothing. Or maybe i'm wrong and ""Full Power Energy Blast Volly"" is a totally different move on every character because it's a different color? It's your call. Every single move in Xenoverse is completely different and every single playable character has different combos! So which game really has more fighters to choose from? I think I know. Not to mention the fact that in Xenoverse all fighters have different stats as well :D. Not only that, but each fighter has defferent presets, with different moves and stats! Incredible right! Lets talk about spam. It's annoying yes, and it's there, and also guarentees you will win because spamming is a TERRIBLE IDEA in Xenoverse. It's just to easy to evade and counter. Lots of people complain Xenoverse is no fun because of spam, but in reality, it rarely happens ever. It's mostly just people mad at others for not using a melee build -_- Funny right? But I know of a game that has WAY worse spam that is almost impossible to not scream and rage from! What might that game be your wondering??? Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3! (I'm going to to lots of comparrisons with this game since it is considered, ""the best"") You just charge up for a powerful strike attack and use it. Then reapeat. Oh by the way it has a 100% of hitting you and does a truck-load! Good luck beating that! And you were complaining that there were to many spammers in Xenoverse? I can't believe it! Not only that but Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 only had wifi on the wii version! You could not play online at all unless you had the wii version. And that is the so-called best Dragon Ball Z game ever. Oh, and I thought I might want to add that 80% of the songs on that game were just moved from the last games... Dragon Ball Xenoverse has a complete sound track all of it own! And you want to know what happened to Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 3 in the end? The same thing that's happening to Xenoverse now. It was the best, (until Xenoverse) and people started to make up negetive complaits and exuses. So Bandai Namco decieded to dum it down a little, and advanced to Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 4, but because it was a little different,  tBhey called it, (get ready) DRAGON BALL Z ULTIMATE TENKAICHI!!!!!! One of the worst Dragon Ball Z games of all time. Yeah. I'm trying to prevent another one of those. Also around that time they were making the Rageing Blast games, which wern't actully bad for there time. Though most of that game was just cut-scenes. That brings me to the next amazing thing about Dragon Ball Xenoverse! The entire fight is in real-time! No longer must you sit there and watch your opponent start charging up thier x100 Big Bang Kamehameha to blast you off into infinity, but you can dodge and get out of they way during this process! Then there was another garbage game... Battle of Z. The most fun you will ever have constantly mashing the Y button! (At least on X Box)   Though there waz 1 thing it had... Amazing graphics!! Better then any other Dragon Ball Z game. Until Xenoverse XD, as just looking at the trailers for the game you already know it has the best graphics out of any other Dragon Ball Z game EASILY! Then... Dragon Ball Xenoverse had finally arrived! The only Dragon Ball Z game to not follow the origanal Dragon Ball Z story, like all the others, but instead have it's own! As your custom created character from the future must restore the Dragon Ball Z time-line back to normal! Can choose from 5 different races: Saiyens, Earthlings, Namekiens, Majin, and Freeza's race! And customize then with the TONS of different customizaion items in the game, and equip any Dragon Ball Z move! x100 Big Bang Kamehameha, yes. They have that. I'm not here to put any spoilers, I am here to intrest you in buying this product. From my experince, and many others, take are word for it. This game is truly worth it."

It harkens back to Tenkaichi days, as combat is centered on a 3D system as opposed to Budokai titles that are fought in a more traditional 2D format. As opposed to earlier titles, which for the most part ran through re-enactments of the original plot, Xenoverse focuses on telling a fairly new story. It's a hit and miss, and I can't help but feel that while it broke new ground for the series it falls short. Nevertheless, it's a fresh take on a genre of games that has thrived for years on repetitive mechanics.The gameplay itself is fairly interesting, as it focuses entirely on the custom character that the player creates. Customization varies greatly, as the player is able to choose from several races and facial features before starting the game. From there, as the player progresses, they are able to buy clothing and equipment that alters their characters' stats and gives them a number of different status effects. In addition, the player is able to customize their characters' abilities, with practically every move in the entire series being featured in some form.Overall I'd recommend the game, if cautiously. It's not groundbreaking by any means, but it certainly feels like the series has been given a healthy invigoration."

It's probably the best Dragonball Z offering that exists, but fails to exceed in respect to games as a whole. Satisfying fighting mechanics are almost overshadowed by a grind-based metagame, brutal and unreasonable difficulty that forces you to come up with cheap ways to win, and an online feature set that rarely seems to work correctly, even more than a week after release.Good:-Fighting mechanics can be fun.-Fairly elaborate character creation.-Large amount of customization.-Large amount of characters to play, with more to come (albeit paid).-Plenty to do.Neutral:-Story is all right, but not what I would call good.-The graphics are okay, but I seriously don't understand the appeal of having every character sheen like they're covered in oil. I think the aesthetic of the Naruto UNS series is the best of any anime game and wish more would try to follow suit.Bad:- The grind is real. Seriously. Prepare to repeat missions an unreasonable amount, until every line of dialogue within disgusts you, just to get the one move you want. Take that to another level if you're looking to complete an outfit (Considering most that you can buy are awful.)- The RNG mechanics behind rewards and special objective completion are infuriating.- Later missions start to pit you against multiple powerful AI, which sort of funnels you into the cheapest strategies you can come up with. Sometimes you will have 2-3 enemies spamming ultimate attacks in your direction, and you'll be hit with consecutive attacks before even having a chance to recover.- Basically everything online sucks. I have had some good experiences running Online PQs, but that is provided that I can actually find a game that doesn't disconnect, lag horribly, or end up being full by the time I select it. Most of the time I try to connect to the Multi Lobby I am kicked after a single mission, and am usually refused connection every other time.- I haven't bothered playing competitively yet, but I've heard that anything ranked is usually a matter of who is willing to go the cheapest route to victory."

You will love it if you are a Dragonball fan. It feels like a Dragonball game, and now you can put yourself in the game as well. Want to make your ultimate move Frieza's Death Ball but also want Goku's Kamahameha? Go for it. Want to wear Lord Slug's attire from the movie? Want to be in your underwear?(I'm judging you)Or mix and match attires from many other recognizable DB characters? Go right ahead. Want to bring Gogeta SS4 and Vegito with you into battle? WHO CAN STOP YOU? As a DB fan, I recommend this game, it's been a long time coming for a Dragonball game to arrive on PC.However, the game is not without it's flaws. I am not trying to bash the game, I just feel these are issues that hold the game back from being truly amazing. These are a couple of issues you should know if you are considering purchasing the game. As I love this game and I love the DB lore I will be extremely critical of this game because I want it to improve, I want what's best for it.The ending itself. I will try my best not to spoil it but my god, if they could sequel/dlc bait any harder they may as well name it ""DB:XV Part 1"".The depth of the game itself feels a bit shallow, the customization of your fighter seems a bit limited. With only about 10 eye types, 10 chin types, 12 hair types, 11 nose types (some are barely different). and 4 ear types It gets the job done but being a main selling point of the game it feels a bit incomplete. They couldve at least allowed you to morph your features or face a bit to give us variety. When you think about all the unique DB characters that existed and they could've copy and pasted a few of their features into character creation you feel a bit disappointed.They could've added more moves that obviously should be in the game but aren't which points to either DLC or they completely forgot about it.Some notable characters are left out of the game/story completely, including: Zarbon, Dodoria, Dabura, Dr. Gero, All Androids except 17/18/Cell, King Cold, Super/Garlic Jr., Nail, Babidi. Master Roshi, Kami/Popo, Dende, Pikkon, Chiaotzu, King Kai, Surpreme Kai. IF YOU CAN GIVE US APPULE WHY NOT THESE GUYS? Appule couldn't handle a shot of Raspberry Schnapps. They give us Cell Jr, Appule, pallete swaps of Saibamen, Raspberry, Videl (I've never heard anyone say ""Boy, I can't wait to play as Videl!"") But they can't give us some characters that are cooler and more relevant to the story?Not including characters/storylines in movies (which they did use a few such as Broly, Beerus, & Bardock) Some of these characters not included are: Janemba, Cooler, Tapion, Chilled, Lord Slug, Turles. Bojack.You look at Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 released in2006and the character roster of that game makes 2014's DB:XV almost pale in comparison. Not including the ones I named previously that appear in DBZ:BT2:  Kid Goku, Mecha Frieza, Baby Vegeta, Mercenary Tao, Super 17, Hirudegarn, Meta-Cooler, Salza, Zangya, Yajirobe, Uub, GRANDPA GOHAN, King Piccolo.The fighting aspect of the game is fun, if you have competent people to play with. If you're planning to play with AIs especially through parts where you fight more than one person, you're going to have a bad time. Your AI allies will watch you get gangbanged helplessly while they choose to float in mid-air almost brain dead. You will find yourself yelling ""GOKU CAN YOU F*CKING HELP ME YOU GODD*MN USELESS PIECE OF SH*T I HOPE YOU DIE"" You will also be infuriated that your AI allies will suddenly become competent and immediately attack once you start using an ultimate move so your target goes flying from your blast and you wasted your ki energy.As I cannot review the online aspect of the game fairly without flying into a rage that would make Angry Joe blush, I will hold off that portion of the review until they fix the servers.[reserved for online portion]The story itself is almost criminally short. If you do not grind your level up like the game wants you to and play through the story itself in it's entirety you will be left feeling gypped like you did that one Saturday night when you found out that $10 hooker was really a cop.MANDATORY GRINDING SHOULD NOT BE USED TO MAKE YOUR GAME LONGER. It feels so short which is a shame because there was excellent animated cutscenes like it would look in a DB movie but these are far too rare. The story basically sets up about maybe at most 2 minutes of in-game cutscene before the next fight. It's a shame to see how much potential this game could've had storywise, instead of going with just the required sagas that made DBZ, they could've added movie sagas, VASTLY change the story sagas since it is about changing history, fleshing out more cutscenes. adding more characters that should've been there. This could've been the ultimate DBZ game but it feels lazily done or made as simple as can be so they can cram as much DLCs as humanly possible.I've excluded fights that are with the same person just 'revived' and new fights part of a previous fight.The story mode is essentiallySaga Name# of FightsRaditz3Vegeta/Nappa4Ginyu Force4Frieza3Cell5Androids2Majin Buu5Beerus3Final Boss3"

As for Dragon Ball Xenerverse, I would have to say the issues I’ve encounter so far were glitches, server crashes and single player crashes, and, of course, hackers. However, looking beside these flaws, the game overall is fun. You could definitely role-play your character with loads of costumes to choose from, although the costume stats could affect your created characters ability, depending on what role you take. There is a lot of Blast and Melee Supers as well as Ultimate’s to choose from. Sadly, Sayains are the only race that could transform, though Frieza and Namekians have the ability too as well. My rating for this game would be 8/10. 2 points taken off due to their limited hair styles and creation as well as other abilities that could have been implemented into the game – I’m not sure if they would add those in later DLC."

Why? Because it's a fun Dragonball game--something we haven't seen in years. With a robust character-creation system--something we've never seen before. And an original storyling that's actually fun--something we've never seen before.Being able to create your own Dragonball character and go wild, levelling up, completing quests, learning new skills, etc., etc. is an absolute joy for any Dragonball fans. So while the game as a whole may still be inferior to the oft-praised Budokai Tenkaichi 3, it's a helluva lot better than any other Dragonball game since then, and is just as promising of a game as the first Tenkaichi is.If DIMPs can keep the license, I am very excited to see this series improve.

It's dumb because there's even an option for 2560*1080 in the settings but all that does is put black bars on the side.The levelling system sucks, I finished the story at level 40-something and you really need to grind to be able to keep up with the levelling pace of the story.The good:That being said, the whole game was hype and I enjoyed the concept of going back as a third party to ""fix"" the DB timeline rather than playing through the anime like in the older games. Combat was okay, though I found a broken infinite (Meteor Crash? the one that kicks them far away) can be repeated ad infinitum on a wall, and while you're Super Saiyan you can basically do this until the enemy dies since you have infinite Ki.Overall a fun experience, though a lot of tedious parts mixed in.

It's the first in franchise history to make the jump to PC, and honestly, it's about time. I could go on for hours about how much I've been waiting for this game and how much I love it, but instead I'll give the condensed version.Side Note: I'm a bit biased as I am a HUGE Dragon Ball fan, and I'll start by saying that if you're not a fan of the series, you probably won't like this as much as a fan. The game is catering to a very specific player base, and it does this well.PROS:+Game looks gorgeous, the graphics could have come straight out of the anime/manga.+60 FPS at max settings on a DB game = SSSSSOO MUCH YES+ Gameplay is simplified, but not as bad as Ultimate Tenkaichi was.+CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION - This one is huge, fans have been screaming for a proper character creator for years now, and UT's was pretty lackluster. DBVX's CaC system is extrememly open ended, and all of your 12-year-old DeviantArt OC fantasies can now come true. What's especially nice is that the custom characters are unique - each race has it's own strenghts and weaknesses, and working around them is an interesting challenge.+Story is decently engaging and interesting+TONS to do - Story mode, parallel quests, master quests, tournament mode, item customization, standard battles...plenty to keep the player engaged.+Takahata101 is a CaC voice. Look up Team Four Star or DBZ Abriged and thank me later.+It's DBZ. DBZ is just fun.+You can use a controller - THANK GOD, I don't even want to think about trying to play one of these games with a keyboard and mouse.CONS:-Port is rough around the edges - game WILL crash if it tries to hand too much, or even just in loading screens - it's clearly built for console, specifically XB1 and PS4, and this is probably why, but it's not really an excuse, given that the new consoles are so similar to a basic gaming PC.-LIghting engine can get harsh and obnoxious at times-AI can be a MASSIVE pain to deal with - getting bum rushed by every enemy on the field at once is not fun-Always Online - We've all seen the connection error issues, and there are times I just wish the first connection attempt at the start screen would fail just so I don't get kicked out later (which I think is stupid). I know Namco Bandai is working on this, and I'm glad, but I wish they had included an offline mode of some sort.-Game is HARD - this could be a good thing, and for me it is, but it's not always very accessible. Granted, it's not as frustrating as Battle of Z was, but it's still a pain sometimes.-Get's REALLY grindy at times - drop rates are a thing, and items YOU NEED for some quests or items don't always drop the first time, forcing you to grind the same mission several times. I just got done grinding two missions to get parts for a Z Soul and it was really irritating-The story is pretty convaluted - any non-DB fans are gonna get lost easily - this is some tricky stuffOverall, I like this game. It's frustrating at times and the crashing or logging off is annoying, but my experience has been general positive. I enjoy the game, and I would thoroughly recommend it...to a fan of the genre. Anyone that isn't a DB fan or doesn't care for the fighting games isn't gonna enjoy themselves much, but if you fit those two groups, this is well worth the buy, especially on PC. I truly hope they keep bringing these games to Steam, it's a whole new platform NB can open up to.In conclusion, 9/10 Gokus"

You can tell by being able to play one of the earlier PQ's as a level 70+ and just own them in a few moves).-A ton of content to get lost into for hours after completing the main game (but also during) known as Parallel Quests.-Loot drops (also a CON, see below).-Graphics match the show pretty much spot on, and the sound effects do as well (though strangely enough, some things do not have any audible playback in some stages/attacks).-You can have series favorites train you and teach you their moves, and they even commentate on the score screen after a PQ, telling you how happy/meh/disappointed they are with your performance!CONS:-Loot drops are ENTIRELY RANDOM and not really based off of your final score/rating at the end of a PQ (you could get a Z rating but get absolutely no loot afterwards). This requires you to farm PQ's to get items which can take forever, espeically if you're playing a very difficult/long PQ, only to have it drop nothing good, requiring you to play it over and over again until you get the item you want, which is extremely frustrating (at least to me).-Difficulty can range from simple to punishing in some PQ's (mostly depending on your level, but this can be a con if you're trying to farm a PQ and get good loot).-No option to preview outfits, accessories, etc on your character before buying them (which means you could drop 100,000 zeni on an item that sounds cool, but then you equip it on your character and realize you don't like it. Sorry, you're out 100,000 zeni).-Servers are currently unreliable. They are getting better, but why am I getting disconnected during a single player lobby??-Dragonballs. Why am I fighting Time Patrollers to get these? And farming them is pretty simple, though some characters will stop dropping the dragon balls, granted they even show up in the PQ (I can't get the Five Star ball for some reason, no matter which PQ I play with the randomly spawning Time Patroller. It's gotta be an issue on my end, but I've spent a while trying to get it and for some reason it will not drop no matter what I do).Overall, I would recommend this game for DBZ fans, and still recommend it to newcomers of the series. It's a blast to play, especailly with friends online (it makes farming PQ's much more fun and easy).8/10, would farm quests for Trunks outfit/Super Saiyan/10X Big Bang Kamehameha/Dragonballs again."

,Recommended,323470,14832970,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,Enthasius,"Having not played a Dragonball Z game for quite literally the better part of ten years, it was a combination of nostalgia, a PC release and the create-a-character feature designed plot that drew me to this. I bought the game as a pre-order on a bit of a gamble, and I'm happy to say that while at the time of this writing that the online's still busted, the singleplayer game is a real fun time-sink. The long and short of the story is that the typical Dragonball Z canonical story is being changed by sinister forces, and you're summoned to help save the day by going back in time and interfering in the bigger battles in DBZ with odd twists due to the aforementioned changes.Let's get the biggest drawbacks out of the way from the outset; besides the online issues, some difficulty spikes, some questionable voice acting, subtitle errors and all number of smaller quirks, this game was a joy to play. The graphics are solid, fitting the design of the original works in good, sharp 3d. There's an arena based on Namek's impending explosion that's a real treat to look at. The create-a-characters do look a bit on the generic side, but that's just the nature of the beast; All create-a-character games suffer from this, but thanks to the sharp cell-shaded graphics, your avatar certainly looks the part, especially when you get the right outfit.Sound-wise, the game certainly has the full breadth of the Dragonball effects; flying, charging, impacting blows all sound hilariously old-school, but in a way that works to the games benefit as a fan-focused title. That said, especially playing as a melee focused character, longer combos would trigger the heavy-impacting sounds which in fast-striking combos would make a real racket. Like I mentioned earlier, voice acting is quirky in all the ways DBZ and anime as a whole can be. The Japanese and English Voice casting is good though, pulling a lot of old talent back to reprise roles, but be warned; while the Japanese voices sound better as a whole, part of the joy of the game is the banter that occurs in-combat, and when you're fighting for your life, reading subtitles is less than ideal.Let's get onto the real meat of the game; the gameplay. Having not played a DBZ game for a while, I know a lot of people took issue with what's considered a 'simplified' combat engine but I felt it was fine. You're essentially given a three-district city-hub; an industrial/shop area, a side-mission and online central area where you both do offline and online vs battles and 'Parallel Quests', which consist of the small 'what if' missions that don't factor in to the main plot.The last area is an odd one; consisting of where you make wishes with the eponymous dragonballs, enter an area where the main story advances and you can re-do old story missions, and an area for local vs combat and another online 'World tournament' stage.Fundamentally, you start the game, do a few of the canonical bigger fights as Goku vs the villain of that arc with a gradual interjection of the plot's time-changing aspect triggering, before the plot allows you to make your avatar. You only have one slot to begin with, so be sure to give some thought as to what you want to play as, and it can be worth doing a little research about what races, and indeed genders, have what effect on your ability to fight. That said, as someone who played as a female saiyan (apparently one of the worst melee types in the game), who went out of his way to make as balanced a character as possible, with some specialising in melee late game, I never felt too hampered by my choices; indeed, with a blank outlook to start with, I learned how to handle the melee combat and only very rarely abused any of the games less balanced aspects.Being predominantly a fan-focused game, your avatar can be equipped with a lot of character specific outfits, as well as some new ones that are colour customisable, and a great deal many of the more (and less) famous moves in the game. Ever fancied having both a kamehameha AND the gallick gun? Go right ahead. Part of the fun of the game, and an aspect that detracts in a point I'll make later, is learning and adapting based on the skills you know and find as the game progresses. It took me a while to learn how to get good at the melee game in Xenoverse, but sure enough by the time I hit level 50 or so out of 80, I had some attacks that I kept for the rest of the game and I could fight off pretty much any enemy with ease, and smart tactics let me win when outnumbered.As mentioned though, you only get one character slot to start with. Once you finish the story, THEN you get the other slots, of which there are enough to make one of each race, and of each gender if the species allows it. The problem I had in this regard though was you have no option to re-do the actual story from scratch with a new character. While you can in fact replay these missions, the fact you have all the outfits and moves unlocked really dampened my will to do another 'play-through'. I'm sure there's a way to reset your save, but I don't want to lose my initial female saiyan character, I just want to learn and develop like she had me do rather than starting as a low stat master with the best skills.Still, while I don't know the exact time I played this game for, as I had to play with Steam in offline mode to play the game due to the broken online, it lasted me a fair long while. Part of this is because of the randomness of some of the gameplay aspects. It's both a blessing to some and a curse for all. Side-missions have extra objectives that vary from task to task, commonly things like beating it in a short time-frame or beating certain characters in order, but both generally improve the items you get from a mission (special moves, clothing, items you can use to make buffs and healing items for tougher missions and z-souls, items that grant unique abilities in particular circumstances, like buffs when low on health or slow health regeneration and the like). Thankfully few missions use the full extent of the typical 15 minute time-frame, but considering I still have, at the time of this writing, a side mission where I cannot get the bonus objectives to trigger despite doing it to the letter. I've tried this mission some 20+ times to the point where trying it now, the mission is hilariously easy to beat but the frustration of it never triggering the extra objectives leaves a bitter taste in ones mouth.The story missions are thankfully a fair bit easier, if only because they're pretty straight-forward. So long as you dedicate some time to do all the parallel missions a couple of times each I found my levelling met the pace of the plot quite handily. Make no mistake though, if you so choose, you can grind relentlessly until even battles against the most powerful villains of the Dragonball world are weaklings. I much prefer it this way; even if I didn't use it, you never know when someone might struggle and having an ability to reward patience with a slightly easier shot at the mission by becoming more powerful is a useful tool. Odds are even if you don't explicitly enjoy grinding, you'll likely accidently do it due to wanting a particular move or outfit.All in all I recommend this game, although I would advise caution due to the presently broken online, and the nature of the game being guilty of the usual anime-game trappings with the voice acting and not being for the typical player-base, fighting games or otherwise. If you're interested in a longer-term, slightly grindy fighting game with cool visuals, enjoy developing a character into powerhouse suited to your own play-style, and enjoy a unique Dragonball Z plot with you as the hero fighting alongside the majority of the heroes and villains, then I'd certainly recommend it."
,Recommended,323470,14771358,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,Boss weapons!,"It's been a long time since I had any hope for a Dragon Ball game. Xenoverse promised a lot but did it ultimately hold on to those promises? Well sort of yes. It did. This is my short and rather biased review of Xenoverse.Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the next game in the series of Dragon Ball games released by Dimps. People who have made fairly succesfull Dragon Ball titles in the past such as the Budokai series. The game's story takes place in a time when a group of people called the Time Patrol notice there are several fractions of time being disturbed causing history to change. Since violating the timeline is a bad thing and there seems to be a lack of heroes these days the Dragon Balls are used to summon a hero strong enough to help solving this time crisis. This hero is you.The game starts by the player creating his or her own Dragon Ball hero. There are five different races. Majin, the pink Buu looking creatures. Saiyans, everybody's favourite spiky haired monkey people. Earthlings, your plain general people on the earth (which are oddly missing all the animal variety of people you see thorough the show). Namekians, the green slug men from space. And lastly the Freeza race, everybody knows Freeza, right?Each of the game's races and genders have different stats so race does matter. For example Namekians are tough and generate stamina quickly on their own while Freeza race is extremely fast and has a stunning Ki attack replacing the regular Ki pew pews.You get to customize your character. This includes mainly the size and what your face looks like plus colouring the whole thing. The real customization after that comes from the game itself. There are tons of different outfits and accessories to buy using the inworld money Zeni which you earn by the truckload while playing. All in all the variety of user created characters is pretty good. It could be better for sure but it works as it is for now and you can see plenty of different people online, provided if you actually ever get online.You're then unleashed into the game world, TokiToki city, which is where everything in the game happens. In that place you physically walk in the Dragon Ball world, talk to people, take on quests, buy things and all that stuff. It reminds me of Fable 3's horrible Sanctuary in a way, but in this case it doesn't bother me since it's only a world you move in. All the important thigns such as choosing skills, increasing your characters attributes and putting on accessory or clothes is still handled through a regular menu options.Dragon Ball Xenoverse looks really good. The visuals are nailed very well and the game looks like the anime and manga. And they even got the lip sync done right this time. There's not much to say about the graphics. I guess the only part which I didn't like too much was some of the ground textures in TokiToki looking out of place and too realistic for a DB game but that's about it.The game opens up with the main quest for you to follow and once you advance in that you open up more options. For example when you begin the game the stores in the city are closed, but after a while you're introduced to all of this one by one untill you everything from shops to paraller missions are accessible to you. Talking about paraller missions.Along with the game's main story you unlock a large variety of paraller missions. These are ""What if"" stories basically where you end up doing plenty of different things. Each quest has its main objective and also hidden goals which you only find out by trial and error. Knowing what happens in the manga and anime though can help you unlock some of the hidden goals. Doing these missions is your bread and butter when it comes to leveling up your character. There's also a random loot system for each of these missions and you may earn rewards from healing items to different outfits and most importantly new skills, depending on how well you beat the mission.Leveling up grants you a level, which makes you stronger against lower level enemies and also gives you three skill points to share between six diffrerent stats: Max health, Max Ki, Max, stamina, Basic Attacks, Strike Supers and Ki Blasts. Putting a point in any of these stats increases their effectiveness and you can end up with a great variety of different stat builds which in turn lets you play your character the way you want.Fighting in the game looks very familiar to all of those people who have played Budokai Tenkaichi or Raging Blast. Characters soar in the air and shoot beams at eachother and punch themselves through walls. The way the fighting works has a simple beat 'em up formula to it, but don't let it fool you. Mastering it takes a while and learning what move set and play style works the best for you. The game has basic melee attacks light and heavy ones. You can chain these attacks together freely to create insanely long combos if you know what you're doing. In addition you have four super attacks which can be Ki balls, beams, explosions and the like or melee strikes such as the melee combos from the show some people might be familiar with. There are also supporting skills which get you out of troubles, charge your characters Ki or just generally make a particular situation easier for your character. You can also equip two special moves which are extremely powerfull but require a lot of Ki to use, such as Reccoom's Ultra Fighting what ever Bomber? or Kid Buu's planet destroying energy ball. Combining these is fun and works very well and I was positively surprised to see how amazing the fighting system is even with all its simplicity. It's not all good though. The controls can be frustratingly clunky to a new player and even after a while once you get used to taking your character out there to fight people it still feels needlessly sticky. Also Ki attacks aren't really what you would expect or what you've been used to if you've played any of the Budokai series games for example. The attacks are done right and they look the way they should, but the ""oomph"" is missing. No big explosions, no blinding flashes. Even the strongest attacks just feel dissapointingly washed out and simple. It's a bit like throwing beach balls at people. The impact is the same.The game is cearly meant to be played with friends and online. The AI in the game is horrendously bad. Not the enemy AI, the team AI is what I'm talking about. If you have NPC's helping you or you get to choose people from the roster for the paraller quests be ready to dissapoint and rip your hair out. The friendly AI is not only dumb and useless. It tries to help you. Emphasis is on the word TRY. More often than not your AI partners just get in your way, ruin your long, game winning combos or special moves and generally act as a constant annoyance. Luckily you don't have to take those people with you for the quests if you don't want to, but there are still the mission specific AI allies who are out there, looking to get themselves killed, especially if your mission objective is to... say, have that guy survive till the end.The online part of the game, at the time of writing, is still broken. You can't get online and it's no possible for me to interact with people who play the game online. So I have no experience of creating groups and taking on quests together. I managed to play a few one on one matches and a single paraller quest by being directly invited into a game. It provided to be good fun and I really enjoyed it the little time it lasted.As my final words I would suggest getting this game. It's hands down the best Dragon Ball game to come out in a long time and if you're a fan of the games, shows or the manga you most likely wont be dissapointed. The game has plenty of content to keep you busy for a while and once the online part of the game gets fixed to a playable state it can only get better."

Creating your own character doesn't just feel like a cookie cutter system. While base physical appearence is limited, you can bring your character to have a mixture of skills from multiple characters while specializing in melle based fighting, or range, Ki based power shots. Or a good mixture of both. While you have your created character that you go through teh story with, you don't have to use it for the side quest system, you can use any character from teh DBZ universe that you have unlocked (expansive list)With RPG elements in stat based equips and a point based stat system the creatable character will become a really fun element to have a choice to play.My one issue is the server at the moment, as its not the most stable, the game tries to connect to a server even for offline play to update leaderboards and port in NPC versions of other people's characters to populate the hub world.All in all I enjoyed the first few hours with it and will continue to enjoy it. Highly recomended. Money very well spent"

I was originally having issues with my controls, even keyboard. No matter how I adjusted the input values, I could never get them quite right. Usually It was always the camera that was off, always looking up, down, or to the side. After uninstalling it and reinstalling it into my main steam library (after the update), it seemed that most of the control issues were gone. However, it was still turning the camera straight up. I managed to fix this though, and have no problems with the game anymore. I haven't actually played it just yet, but I'm looking forward to it when I have the time.And for anyone having the camera problem you need to open the ""key_config"" file.Go to the start menu's search bar, and put in""c:/users/<your username>/appdata/local/bandai namco games/db xenoverse""and hit enter.This isn't case sensative, but make sure to put in the spaces.Then open up the ""key_config"" file, and change the ""Camera Up/Down"" values on each of the non-keyboard inputs to ""0"".This should make the camera stable, but I can't guarantee it'll work for everyone. But this will allow you to change input values if needed for other reasons.And if you ever want them back to how they were at first, just delete the whole word file. The next time you open up the game, it'll rewrite the default one.And I just want to say, I didn't recommend this originally because I couldn't play it with the camera spinning all the time, yet their were still people who ""thumbs-downed"" my comment because it was negative.

,Recommended,323470,14771291,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,nimblebanana,"It's nice to play a Dragon Ball Z game with an original story for once.  The fighting engine is actually pretty darn good too.  However, even though the game play is excellent, this game has some MAJOR flaws.  So much, that even though I recommend it, I would hold off on buying it until they patch out all the bad stuff, if you can.To the developers:1. Fix the problem with Z-Souls and other gameplay aspects working differently based on your frame rate.  (Ex: ""You can be the first victim"" giving you maximum Ki at the start of the battle when you're running at 30 fps, but only 3 bars of Ki when running at 60 fps.  There are MANY other souls with these types of problems, especially anything that does any sort of regeneration with the regeneration doubling or quadrupling at higher frame rates.  Also, Ultimate attacks doing different number of hits and damage based on frame rates is just bad design as well.)  This is easily the BIGGEST problem in the game and needs to be addressed ASAP.  SO MUCH IS BROKEN AT ANYTHING OTHER THAN 29-30 FPS !!!2. Make Ultimate Finishes CONSTANT.  It's absolutely ridiculous going through Parallel Quests and doing all the triggers to make the special Ultimate Finish event happen and finding out it doesn't happen because the random number generator says it's not going to happen.  It's either you make Ultimate Finishes constant or make item drops constant.  Since item drops are already based on a random number generator it makes no sense to make the Ultimate Finish event happen on a random number generator too, especially when there's specific requirements you have to meet to spawn the event in the first place.  It's like a double grind at that point.  Random if you get the event and random if you get the item from that random event.  This design is turning off a majority of the player base.3. Remove infinite combos from PvP.  ('nuff said.)4. Fix your servers.5. Allow us to type our own text in lobbies and in-battle.  This isn't a console game.  You already have voice chat while you're in a team, what's the deal with not allowing typing?  Word/Sentence select is so lame.6. Now this isn't a flaw, more of a request, but some day... Please allow Parallel Quests and/or Story Mode to be played offline cooperatively.  It's nice being able to battle each other offline, but c'mon... No coop play?I've got more, but those are the biggies in my opinion.  As soon as at least 1-4 get ironed out, I'd say this game is worth purchasing.  Until then, people, hold onto your cash... unless you're a DBZ fanboy/fangirl and just can't hold back."

,Recommended,323470,14780336,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,DaniTheHero,"This review was relevant to when this game was initially new.There's no reason in my opinion , to purchase this game now that's it's sequel - Xenoverse 2 is out.Before I even review the game I want to point out something important.This is the first Dragon ball Z game to be released on PC in years (About 10 years give or take)That alone is enough of a reason for you to buy it.Why you may ask? Because the second game developers and publishers understand that it's popular here as much as it is on console (they can make money from us PC gamers),then every new game will also be released on PC as well.Think about the Naruto ninja storm games. They released 3 for PC, and it turned out to be a big success. They also released Revolution on PC alongside the console releases as well.In short support this PC/Steam release DBZ game for future titles for the master race.Now for the actual review.As a person who has had the chance to play most of the modern Dragon ball Z games to date.I'd say Xenoverse is AMAZING.Granted it does have it's flaws, but it does try to be different in a good way, and it has succeeded.Pros:-Outstanding soundtracks! I've found myself listening to a couple when not the game.-An actual GOOD character creation (Looking at you Ultimate tenkaichi)-A lot of moves to choose from and since there aren't many ""bad"" ones you actually have a varity of choice, rather than everyone using the same ones.-The different races are actually fairly balanced and have a simliar pick rate. At first i thought the game would be populated with super saiyans, but i was wrong everyone is creative and picks different looks and skills making players actually feel unique.-Team battle done right. (Yeah looking at you ""Battle of Z"")-An actual challanging experience.Unlike most DBZ games you don't slide through every quest and mission with one attempt. I've personally spent dozens of attempts on a couple of missions myself and i enjoyed the challenge.-Very appealing visuals-The most SMOOTH game play i have ever experienced in a DBZ game for a while.-MMO Feel. Actual intercation with other players.-Towa's model-Steam release!Cons:-It's been quite a while and the server issues are still not fixed, so online may be a bit sluggish for now. (Ignore this once the servers are fixed)-The voice acting isn't really great. Granted most of the original cast was present, but the script and the acting itself was average from past games preformance's.-The subtitles are sometimes incorrect. Showing something that isn't relevant to the actual speech. I suppose that's a translation error.-The rooster isn't that large. And while I am aware that I'm obviously not gonna play EVERY character that BT3 represented. I do feel the lack of specific things bothering, such as ""Future Gohan"",Not SSJ ""Teen Gohan"",""Zarbon"" ,""Dadoria"",""Friezas"" 2nd and 3rd forms, and a few other metionables..-RNG factor. As much as I'm aware that Grinding and lucky drops are part of any MMO atmosphere. Repeating a task over 20 times just to receive something that isn't worth it gets on your nerves eventually.That being said that same RNG factor is present in AI battles.When sometimes a specific ""boss"" battle the enemy spams ultimates on you non stop making it impossible for you to win. Or the complete opposite  can happen and they NEVER use the ultimate and you win without difficulty.-HUB world has no sprinting/hovering and even though it's fairly tiny there's still 4 different sequences that are separated by portals which is fairly annoying. I get it that this was made cause of the consoles but any PC spec would be able to handle the game without this.-PVP is extremly fun,but not entirely balanced.Yes i have stated that the game is oddly balanced earlier in the Pros,but what i mean in by not balanced is,since most of the abillties are equally OP,you find yourself being completly destroyed against most combos,Since not ONE move is praticually op, but most are fairly broken you get to a point where most matches end in about 15 seconds."

Some clothes gives you other attributes that the one you are training which makes it kinda weird for me to be honest this is my biggest dislike about the game.-I only bought the normal xenoverse without the DLC and i can only create one character what i really dislike i dunno but i paid 50€ to see my other 6 character slots barred ?

I didn't know anything Dragon Ball, and I think I played one Dragon Ball Tenkaichi Budokai game on my ps2 a long time ago.I came across Dragon Ball Xenoverse on Steam after realizing that the last Dragon Ball game I played was actually pretty fun.I was anxious to buy this, so I watched some gameplay videos on Youtube. The game looked exactly like what I expected, and when I finally bought it and went into the game, it was out of this world. It was my favourite. I began watching the first Dragon Ball whilst playing Xenoverse's story mode, then Z, then GT, now Super. It feels like I've known Dragon Ball all my life, and I am now sitting at 1,700+ hours on Dragon Ball Xenoverse.This is a game you can relax on the first few hours of playing, create your own character, do the whole story, unlock everything, max your level, do all the Parallel Quests, make all the maximum wishes to Shenron, learn the basics, and then get serious and dedicate to online PvP. Learn all the combat tricks, the mechanics, and surpass everyone. This is what Xenoverse is about.You don't only get stronger with leveling. No, that's just the beginning. You get stronger with every new trick you learn, and I'm not just talking about the moves, I'm talking about how you can use them, combine them, find other uses for them. And you can never truly learn everything. There is so much to master, so much to test on dumb AI and then take into battle vs players.Even with Xenoverse 2 coming out, this will always be a game I will revisit and play, because I just don't care. I love it.And you should too, and if you don't, get it with Xenoverse 2. You can transfer your character from Xenoverse 1 to 2 later. We can all play them both as one masterpiece of a Dragon Ball game!Give yourself an experience worth every penny it costs, even if you don't know what Dragon Ball is, because I didn't either."

Character customization is straight up racist, which makes sense in universe but doesn't make for a great experience.Xenoverse IS good at character creation, with some caveats. If you don't play a sayain, you're not going to have a good time fighting them. as stated before, the actual combat is less balanced than a lopsided elephant on a unicycle, with sayains getting an early ability that allows them to have infinite ki, the resource that allows them to use supers and/or ultimates. this means, infinite ultimate attacks, which is just as fun as it sounds. Don't worry though, there is an alternative for humans/namekians/frieza race/majin and also sayains, if you pay for the resurrection F DLC, and i've had issues with that one not properly giving infinite Ki. This being said, i was able to make a 4'3"" character with flowing pink hair who attacked exclusively with grabs, and it worked until i hit super armor. For those unfamiliar, super armor  is the ability for certain NPC characters to withstand attacks without interruption, and makes them immune to any and all grabs.TL;DR: Fun game, not a good game. Game is unbalanced and has several extremely weak points. Xenoverse 2 looks better, let's hope it is, because wow i wanted this to be good."

On one hand, it directly targets and massages the nostalgia glands of anyone who grew up watching this show. On the other hand, the AI is simplistic and the way the game chooses to ramp up the difficulty on you is absurd and encourages you to use tactics that are not at all effective against real, living people.The game has been out for more than a week as of this review, and the servers are *still* unable to handle the volume of players that want to play. The game has semi-always online features, which can result in you being disconnected and losing progress, even if you only wanted to play offline, by yourself. There are workarounds, but both of them are tedious and should not be required to play in single player mode. Local play options are limited, and they force both players to awkwardly share a screen in a game where the desired viewpoint is directly behind the shoulders of your character.Many aspects of this game could be overlooked and even a lot of fun if only you could reliably bring friends along for the ride, but thanks to technical issues that plague this game, (including bugs that go beyond the server issues) that in and of itself is quite difficult. I am actually mildly insulted that this game not only had pre-order bonus DLC, but launched with crappy, broken servers and day one DLC.

It's a blast to create your dream fighter and take them online to face others in combat. And the single-player ""campaign"" although short is quite enjoyable.Ultimately though, it's the sheer intensity of the fighting and the smooth mechanics coming together well that make it a great game. The fighting just feels good, which is SO important for a game that focuses solely on fighting.All in all, if your a Dragon Ball Z fan, you probably already own it, and if your not, but like fast paced action, you'll probably still get what your looking for here.If you don't like Dragon Ball Z or Fast paced fighting games, then this isn't for you.Perhaps the only critical issues I have with the game is that it's too easy to hop into a 1v1 when you first join in only to realize the person your fighting is 40 levels higher then you... No wonder I'm getting smoked. Make sure when you first start if your looking for a game to look for an opponent that is Around your level, don't just jump in, unless you don't mind getting crushed.Secondly It's been difficult for me to find games from time to time and the Level gaps between different players really doesn't help that issue. Sometimes I wish that you could start a 1v1 match that ignores level difference, or raises the power of competitors enough to be a decent challenge. So that a Level 1 could fight a level 60+ and actually have a good competitive match, instead of just getting killed in one attack. I understand that this is true to the DBZ universe, but it's still not very fun when you can't find a good game because everyone is either way too high level or way too low level for you to fight fairly.Lastly, the Games I've joined seemed to have very little latency, which is fantastic. But I suffer from constant disconnects from the Xenoverse Servers, I don't know if that's just me or if it's the Servers themselves. But it is definitely frustrating to get ripped out of the game because you had a wierd server hiccup.At the end of the day though, I'd definitely recommend this game.

The gameplay is great, the story is refreshing and very fun to play through, and the amount of content in this game is praiseworthy. Character customization is very detailed. The fighting mechanics are smooth, and reminiscent of Budokai Tenkaichi series of games. Overall, the game itself is definitely a great investment for fans of Dragonball Z. However, Bandai Namco's decision to make the game require a constant connection to DBXV servers was a big mistake. The issue is compounded by the fact that (as of this review) the servers are either overloaded or completely unreliable, making it impossible for many players, including myself, to even play the game on their own. The way I see it, Bandai Namco has to make a decision very soon to solve this issue: either fix the servers proper and provide the resources to dimps to upgrade the infrastructure, or allow a patch to the sever connection requirement to allow single play without an internet connection. Either way, Bandai Namco should at least find a way so that offline story and parallel quests can actually be _played_ offline. I think it's fair to expect that from a 70 dollar game."

The animations are great, the graphics are colorful and appealing, and the controls are so damn smooth.  The online coop and pvp is fantastic, and there are plenty of special moves and combos to master with your own custom-made character.You do need to be familiar with the Dragon Ball universe or you will be confused by the storyline.**********************************************No Spoilers**********************************************Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the game DBZ fans have been waiting for since the 90s.  Forget about Budokai, Sagas, and Final Bout.  This is THE Dragon Ball Z game.  DBX hits all the right marks and doesn't skimp on the awesome; Dimps and Bandai/Namco have truly outdone themselves with this title.Those of you who enjoyed the Funimation dubbing will be pleased because the English version of the game has all the hallmarks of a Funimation dub: lines of dialogue are slightly altered, stilted/cheesy acting, and unsightly lipsyncing.  A lot of the voice acting is done by the original voice actors, and they use some audio clips from the original episodes.  It's par for the course and completely nostalgic.  I wouldn't change a thing about the sound design/voice acting.  The music is great too, classic DBZ music mixed with 90s power-metal and the original opening theme(""Cha-La Head-Cha-La"") has received a nice remix treatment.The game includes a new plot thread to the DBZ universe, which allows the game to occur as it does, and so you get to create your own character to fight alongside the rest of the Z Fighters.  This means you HAVE to be familiar with the Dragon Ball universe to understand anything that is going on, otherwise you will be completely confused.  The plot deals with time travel, allowing you to use your custom character, or an existing DBZ character to play through all the most iconic fights from the series.  Plus, after beating a certain fight/stage you have the ability to replay it for perfect scores and exp, or you can play through them with your Steam friends.  Playing fresh scenarios also opens iconic alternate costumes for the default characters (more than 30 characters from Dragon Ball Z) which also change the special power loadout for that character.The combat itself is some of the best around.  The controls(with a controller) are so smooth and responsive that this hardly feels like a port at all.  The camera changes, pace of the gameplay, and sound design lend themselves perfectly to creating an atmospheric fighting scenario.  The combat is very engaging, it's not too easy(even for veterans of fighting games) but the challenge increases perfectly with your gameplay progression.  You'll find yourself slamming through fight after fight, honing your edge, and begging for more combat.  It is simply stellar.Character customization is a little weak, the only features you can choose for your character are the same ones used to create the DBZ NPCs, so your character will likely end up looking like a main character with slightly different hair or eyes.  The simplicity of the customization is alleviated a bit with costumes, accessories, and other kinds of gear that is either beneficial to your stats, or just aesthetic.  Another thing adding to character variety is the good amount of character races, such as Namekian, Earthling, Saiyan, Majin, and even the Frieza Clan.The coop and pvp is nicely executed and very addictive.  You get the chance to play with Steam friends or perfect strangers as you team up to take down Frieza or Cell or whatever other baddy you want.  You can set up custom teams with your friends to make mission to mission binges that much easier.  The pvp are custom battles, allowing you to test your skill with your custom character or other DBZ characters against the thousands of would-be heroes online.  **Initially there have been some connection issues with the servers because of overloading and such, but it hasn't been a real issue, and apparently Bandai is working to fix whatever issues there may be.All in all this is a fantastic game, it feels like you are actually playing the scenes/episodes from Dragon Ball Z.  It's incredibly immersive.  The port is amazing and Bandai/Namco must be commended for it.  The nostalgia factor is high and the fact that they used a lot of the original voice actors just makes it all the better.  If you are a fan of the series then this is the DBZ game to end all DBZ games, and if they make more games(which they will) I sincerely hope Xenoverse is the yardstick by which these games are measured from now on."

The combat is so engaging!The story is ok so far, but at least you relive some of the show you grew up with, and the fact that duplicate characters show up in matches kinda seems odd. Like you can pick to have 2 gokus on your team but w/e, they are clones to me. lol.But the combat itself! really cool. My favorite thing is to teleport behind someone, combo move, then hit them to the floor as they crash into the ground, and unleash a energy blast. It all works fluidly! What was unique was that i can choose the type of character i wanted, like in race and gender, and customize them. I can tell it has replayability, since my first playthrough, I'm focusing on more brawler tactics than in energy blasts.Definitely worth a buy!"

Firstly, the RPG elements are a bit lacklusture, with your character not having any dialogue nor any choices to make in the game beyond who to take as a master. Also the fighting system is not particularly technical. Though that is not to say it's not a good system, it is exceptionally well polished and fun (A word thatg goes with this game like cream goes with strawberries) nor that it cannot be technical, It's just not quite Streeght Fighter or Tekken. Also the lock-on system can be slightly infuriating, but you can learn to live with that.However, none of that really matters because this game is seriously fun to play! The enemies are challenging without being impossible, the story is a new look at the DBZ universe, but is sufficiently loyal to the canon to please all but the most die-hard fans and whatever the mechanics may lack in the super-technical depth they make up for in being fun, polished and mixed, with the ability to have fights as epic as any in the Anime. It plays a bit like Raging Blast 2, just with more options and some major improvements. It's also seriously pretty, with some epic battle animations and some impressive-looking combos. It brings something new to DBZ games without losing the fun and brilliance of any of the old and will leave you with a serious grin on your face.Pro's:- Easy to play- Good story- Fun mechanics- MASSIVE customisation- Lots to do- Good PvP multiplayer- Well polished fighting mechanicsCon's- Not as technical as some fighting games- Irritating lock-on camera at times- RPG elements could be more deeply ingrained and polished- You will lose many hours of your life to this game trying to get Z rank on every Parallel questTl;DrAll in all a damned good game, and worth every bit of cash they're asking for, as a game in it's own right it's about a 7 but the DBZ-ness makes it more like an 8.5 to me as a fan. Not perfect, but well polished and damned fun to play"

It is filled with a lot of customization options and the story is actually interesting, since it follows a ""What if"" type of story line. Im not going to focus too much on the positives since there is so many of them and instead i will be evil and tell you what currently at the release doesent work that well.Issue nr.1Settings menu, especially the sound options... The game is quite loud and there isnt much you can do in game to change that. Instead of a normal audio slider its just 5 different steps. That poses a issue since even on the lowest the music is too loud for my taste. Same goes with attack audio. Just wish they used a normal slider like 0-100...Issue nr.2Connecting to the bloody XENOVERSE Servers... need i say more? Launch game, trying to connect... go make dinner, eat it, come back and its still trying to connect. I have to literally disconnect from my internet atm to be able to play the game. Another issue is that it kicks you to the start menu most of the time after you do a ""offline"" sidequest... Probably due to it trying to update leaderboards....Issue nr.3The camera.... Not really a issue, its just that the mouse settings have the same bar that the audio has so controling mouse speed to be able to turn properly and look around is hard. Also the camera is still way faster then it should be even at minimum. Just another taste related issue ^^Even with these easy to fix issues i will give the game a 8/10 and it also gets a ""I totally recommend this game!"" sticker. The game is really good and the variety in skills just makes it so  playable."

This game is simply the dream of all of us DB fans out there, this is the type of game us fans want and it is finally here.

U could even go for the boss at somewhere near 50 if u are confident enough. The end of the game is quite satisfying and so was the entire game.So as a final verdict, I am giving this game a 9/10, that 1 being some lags and glitches here and there otherwise it is a solid game.

You get to choose from different characters to use in Parallel Quest, after you've unlocked them of course. Not to mention the great graphics. Also the cutscences are pretty short and simple. I personal like that simply because it gets straight to the action. The controls are fairly easy to learn and after a round or two, maybe with a reference to the tutorials if you happened to skip something by pressing ""A"" too quick. After that I'm sure just about anyone cna remember the controls.

I miss how the old games used to try to teach you controls one at a time but here they throw crazy lists at you and hardly give you a realistic way to get comfortable feel for them.

It mixes elements of RPGs and Fight games well enough that you don't seem very much in games which is unique in its own way.You play as a unnamed custom created character helping future Trunks playing through the main storyline Dragon Ball Z, GT and Movies (GT and Movies are only available through DLCs) through time distortion created by familiar villians from Dragon Ball Online and GT. The main story line can be cleared quickly in about 4 to 8 hours which is short for a $60+ game however there are parallel quest which extends this to about 20 hours if you want to unlock everything.Character creation is decent enough although they could have added more variety, although races are unbalanced, saiyans being the weakest while Earthlings are overpowered as hell, while the other races are well balanced enough to hold on their own. Customization is bad really, really bad, limited selection of clothes and the clothes don't explain alot and don't really provide good bonuses, it would be better if they allowed you to customize the clothes yourself.Gameplay wise this game is meant to play with a controller which makes it a crap ton easier as the mouse and keyboard feels stiff as a stale french loaf which you can use to hit someone's face and make them bleed. Fighting is decent enough although it is nothing complex. In game AI is stupid and useless which could use improvements as they are easily dispatched with a KI spam character. AI battle assistance are stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥they are only good at helping reviving you but they are♥♥♥♥♥♥against their own when fighthing another AI.The game hub is tedious.Online for PC, is non-existant and broken as♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are cheaters everywhere with infinite health and ki and one hit kills you.

The game is all about fanfare.Game isn't super complex and finding a powerful strategy(IE: using ""Bwahahah got you"" pretty much can make you stay in Super Sayian form for much longer and it also raises defense when being struck by an enemies attack) Can make the game easier, but again this isn't meant to be super balanced(although they tried) it's all about making your own DBZ character and throwing them into the DBZ world. The multiplayer, to me, felt like they threw it in at the last minute to please people who care that a game has multiplayer.I found the game enjoyable, though I don't play it as frequently as when I first played it I've been playing for almost 45 hours so I feel like the game has entertained me for quite some time."

There is ALOT of both good and bad things about this game however... so check what people are saying before purchasing.The Pros:- Create your own character 5 Races, 3 of which have gender options (Humans, Saiyans, Majins) and 2 which do not (Namekians, Freiza Race)- Good Online Play in co-operative and against other players- RPG-style Levelling System (3 attribute points a level, Attributes are Health, Ki, Stamina, Basic Attack, Super Strikes and Ki Strikes)- Custom Equipment and Special Abilities- Simplestic but easy to understand gameplay- Doesn't require a controller (Keyboard + Mouse default bindings are very sensible when in battle)- Good Hub World- Original Story which builds on the Story of Dragon Ball ZCons:- Have to go go to hub-world after each parallel Quest, wasting 30 seconds each time to get back to the counter- The Online System sucks... the Xenoverse server is rather pathetic and it attempts to login each time you play, this seems uncessary. It could have had online game/offline game options on the start menu!- If you connect to the Xenoverse server, after you select your profile/character it will connect you to the xenoserver server even if you select single lobby, just to download other people's characters to populate the hub world with.- The multi-lobby is entirely pointless, it lacks basic chat features and only allows you to use pre-selected text and pretty much all features are available in the single lobby that are in the multi-lobby which includes online games!- There is a colour customization option for clothing but most clothing isn't enabled for colour customization- You can't see how clothing looks when browsing the clothing store or accessory store- Some crash to desktop bugs do exist- Online Gameplay can be very buggy with NPCs or Players becoming static and taking no damage- Ally NPCs can be near useless in quest and storyline battles, many do not block super moves and don't engage an enemy properly if they are focusing somebody else.- Humans and Saiyans are near impossible to see the difference between- Online Game Browser is slow for both parallels quest and battles , it is very unintuitive and if a room has filled before you get in it, you need to rebrowse ALL rooms again, it doesn't allow you to go back and check others, you also can not see what levels and races people are.There is overall a lot of technical problems with this game, but the gameplay and character customization make up for that. Hoping they can fix these issues in patches and/or DLCs."
,Recommended,323470,14805305,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Drakuaza,"The game is pretty much the best that has come out for a DBZ game. However it is not without flaws.I won't mention the things such as roster, audio or whatever that is more into the fanboy territory, but more into the technical aspect.LockThe game has problems with the lock system, 80% of the time works fine, however, there are times it jerks completely when the enemies go behind you or where there are multiple enemies and you want to target a specific one.CameraTHis one is related to the lock on, but the camera can be irresponsive a couple of times.PQThe online missions are a pain, not because of the server status atm, but more cause, everytime you complete one, you get thrown out to the entrance instead of being spawned infront of the npcs. The game allows you to do so, if you go into battles after one, you get thrown out infront of the npc, so why not for PQs?NavigationIt's more of commodity, it gets annoying having to walk, you cant fly or sprint or dash, just walk, to the sectors in the city. If you could access em via a quick jump menu it would be good.Other than that, its just fanboyism, how much it bothers the change of voice/music and so on, so that is to the individual preference.I'd say the game is a solid 8/10. Huge ammounts of content and probably becoming Super Saiyan with your MC is probably the most satisfying thingin the series after the first time you watched goku do it back in 1995(depends on your country)."

I like this game. If you're a fan of dbz you'll enjoy it. If you aren't a dbz fan you may not enjoy it as much, since you're thrown into the story expecting to know who's who, what events you're participating in, etc.Story wise, it's basically time cop. the bad guys are messing with time and it's your job to show up and fix things by making sure certain events happen. Mostly what if things, like what if raditz avoided the special beam cannon, or what iffrieza skipped straight to his final form instead of messing around with his other forms. Overall I enjoyed the story. It was amusing, fun and i felt a part of the DBZ universe.Also, you get to make your own custom characters. There's nothing like that badass feeling of being a namekian standing up to frieza, or being a saiyan fighting alonside bardock against frieza's goons.The graphics fit the game amazingly well. There are lip synching issues but those are forgivable, because lets face it. It's meant to be in japanese not english. Combat is fun and with the wide variety of abilities and stat distributions available you can enjoy all sorts of playstyles (close combat, long range blasting, etc).Now the game isn't all roses. there are some issues. The largest being the RNG issues trying to get gear and abilites. Basically you can run side missions for a chance to learn a new move (eg. kamehameha) or get clothing worn by somebody on the mission (like beat up goku and get his turtle hermit gi). Normally it isn't too bad, but sometimes you'll spend hours or days farming for a certain item or ability (i'm looking at you, Super Vegeta).Apparently there are server issues. I personally haven't had an issue with them, but it is something to bear in mind. It has online mode but you can still play without needing to interact with anyone at all, if you so desire. Admitedly your AI teammates will act like braindead gerbils, but you can still get the missions done. It'll be easier if you play with human controlled allies of course, but it's not required.PvP is a mixed bag. There are hackers about unfortunately. Personally i haven't encountered any, but i don't do ranked much. There's also a bit less variety when it comes to moves (slow, clunky moves become a liability while quick, easy use abilities are more valuable to have). There's also the complaints about saiyan players spamming ultimate moves, pose users with super armor, etc, but once you figure out how to fight them they become managable.So far endless mode is my favourite pvp mode. 6 players in the lobby, with 2 fighting and 4 spectating. Loser gets cycled with a spectator after each match, while winner remains until defeated (at which point he becomes a spectator). It's a good way to kill time, and if you form the lobby you can even set yourself as perma spectator if you just want to see people duke it out.3v3 and 2v2 games are fun as well.Overall my impression of PvP is fun. Be prepared to lose at first until you learn what works and what doesn't, as well as how to play against the different styles of players you'll face. Personally i recomend endless for pvp. It's good fun and you get to watch other people fight (and ideally learn from how they play to make you a better fighter).Anyway, short version of the above:I recomend this game and I have a lot of fun playing it. If you're a fan of DBZ i think you'll enjoy it too. I you aren't a dbz fan you'll probably enjoy it, but should watch dbz so you understand the background etc."

,Recommended,323470,24951811,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,DeathWantsMore,"I want to start this review by saying that despite all flaws Dragon Ball Xenoverse is definitely one of the best DB games out there and on top of that it's a first major DB release for PC, so if you're a DB manga/anime fan then just go and buy it, you'll be pleased with the amount of fan-service this games provides, it's really enormous.If you're not into DB-universe and just want to play some fun 3rd person brawler then keep on reading. Unfortunately there're a lot of negative things about this game and I must talk about them, so lets get this list going:Problem #1: RNG (Random Number Generator).For people accustomed to MMORPG games it's probably okay to repeat certain sequences for an eternity to get the desire result in the end, for me it's not. Here RNG runs amok. You have a quest which has some potential rewards, those are: mixing items, clothes, accessories, z-souls (trinkets with special abilities and stat-increases) and skills. Every single item is RNG based drop with a pretty low chance of occurring, some after certain event others after completing a quest. And on top of this RNG you'll have to deal with another RNG element called ""Ultimate Finish"", to get an Ultimate Finish in a quest you'll have to meet certain requirements (they're hidden by default in every quest) and even if you did everything right - it's again just a chance of occurring... And of course there're a lot of drops which could be obtained only by completing a quest with an Ultimate Finish. It means that you'll have to grind certain quests like mad for that one particular drop, honestly I'd rather prefer super harsh requirements for drops to occur rather than this mindless farming.Problem #2: Lag/Hit Detection.Of course this game features multiplayer, but it's pretty laggy. Even with 5 bar-connection you'll experience lag which will make you drop combos and it makes most of advanced stuff obsolete.Problem #3: Hackers.Yeah, PvP is an option but guess what - no VAC protection, you know what that means.Problem #4: AI.To put it simple - AI is very dumb, it can't even complete a simple combo most of the time. To offset this AI just gets more health, almost infinite energy/stamina to spam super/ultimates and later in the game - super armor so you won't be able to stagger it for a while. It's very cheap and just forces you to develop a single most efficient strategy against all that, making game extremely easy.Problem #5: Clothing System.There're a lot of clothing items/sets you can obtain but way too few of them are actually useful so you'll have to trade stats for fashion or the other way around. Would be wise to implement some kind of duo-layer system so you could use stats and look whatever you want to.Those are major problems I had with this game. But don't forget that you're getting a simple but extremely fun combat system, a ""Create A Character"" feature with RPG elements, a lot of unique characters to play as, a wagon of skills and other customization options as well as a fun and original story.My score is 6/10, despite the drawbacks I think this game still worth a try."

If your looking for something like the old budokai this isn't the game. This is pretty much a online dragon ball MMOish game many of us wanted.

Let me explain why.First I already own this game on PS4 and have beaten it, and I paid 60.00 bucks for that game brandnew.Let me tell you > ""This is the best version of  DB: Xenoverse BY FAR..""Heres why:-4k Support, at an unbelievable 60 FPS with all options on max, the game looks fantastic.Plays Fantastic.  I have this game on PS4 and its every bit as fun and fast as the console with WAAAYYY BETTER GRAPHICS and SPEED. It looks like your watching the show, except better.-SLI Support, works flawlessly... At least for my GTX 1080's... your mileage may vary, on lower level cards.-The story is actually good, and reminds me of a Season of DB that just never aired, but now has a game based on it, for some reason.-I got this on sale with all DLC for 18.00 bucks... Unbelievable Value!!-Replay is awesome, the fights are always fun.. Put it down for a couple weeks come back to it AND ITS AMAZING AGAIN with a new character.-I like to challenge myself to get Z ranking in all Story modes and missions by trying to take on the whole missiion alone, or take on extremely tough matches way past my rank.. it is possible to win, and get awarded big time in the very early on stages of the Story if you are good. The game doesnt lock you in place or hold you back. You can get that Kamehameha super move you want which can make your weakling level 2-3 fighter a beast, you just have to keep trying.- The DLC fighters and Gear are Good, especially if your a fan of the newer movies like me, you'll be happy to see the newest characters in the roster. And they are excellent when fighting on your side, The Ai is actually good on your team for once.-The training mechanism is AMAZING: Characters from the DBZ Universe show up randomly around town and offer to train you if you can beat them, and let me tell you its not easy to get some of these characters to share their Awesome moves.. you really have to fight hard for some and grind it out till you are strong enough to take them on the highest levels and finally get their Ultimate Moves.-The fighting is Simple and easy to pick up yet complex and requires strategy and reflexes and timing, knowing when to launch that Super move and waste your Ki or Wait for the big big Ultimate move, and when to launch it is sometimes the difference between winning and losing. Also being outnumbered is sometimes impossibly hard in this game and when you try like 5 tmies to win a fight and you finally do, and get that awesome power drop, from the big boss, thats when you smile because you knwo and feel you are getting stronger, Faster, and more skilled and it FEELS GOOD.-RPG Elements like Gear and uniforms that affect Power, Skills, Speed, and Health, Money to buy them, and special Spirits called Z souls can be equipped to allow you to gain amazing bonuses and Strengths of some of the most powerful characters in the DB Universe.. Want Friezas abilities? Find him , train under him, beat him and he will grant you World Destructive Powers, but then What aboiut SSGSS Goku??? Yeah he tough.. Goodluck.In Closing: Buy it and enjoy the Roster, Fun Characters, Fantastic Fights, Excellent Graphics< great story, and Epic Cutscenes. If your a DB fan this is for you."

Repetitive in a very bad way.Public multiplayer is basically dead.Anyone who enjoyed this has either moved on to Xenoverse 2 where they get to basically replay Xenoverse but slightly better/more features.I've owned this for, I don't even know how long. Can't bring myself to play it, I've got, as you can see. 6 Hours playtime.If you've ever read any of my other reviews, or know me and my tastes, if your tastes are similar. You might not like this.The lack of multiplayer players is to me the biggest issue, it's dead now, and sure you could blame it on Xenoverse 2, but it was dead even before Xenoverse 2 was announced."

I know there has only been one of three DLC that we are getting, but i was VERY dissapointed with the first one, and am really hoping they make up for it with the next one. We shall see.-Fly or dash in Toki-Toki. Dat Slow Crawl-Balance out the fighting styles and moves. It's boring watching everyone spam ultimates alll day, PQ or pvp for that matter.-Server issues.

I was thinking this game will be like MMORPG where you can see all the other players walking and talking with others etc and you walking around a world, etc. Instead, the game seems to be only in a limited location where you can buy items, enter to missions, etc, and one of the options is to do some multiplayer missions, where you need to wait for other players to join to a fight like any of the previous DB games.But aside from my missunderstanding about how the game will be, I like the way the game is.What I do not like is the multiplayer part due to you need to wait for other players, while is MMORPG you chat directly with the people and you know you are with people there to do the mission, instead of having to wait so long for someone that will probably never come, and you unable to know that, because you see no one. The game shows other player characters in the scenario, but they are just static, and you can pay them to join to you team, but I think those ones will be just the characters to be playing with Artificial Inteligence on your offline battles.So, the game is good to be played in single player, and once you finish the history, you can try doing online battles, but if trying to gain experience from online battles, that will just delay you a lot."

There is a story, albeit short & cheesy, as well as several side missions (over 50 in total) that allow you to play with friends or strangers online.  There is also a PVP element, however if you've come to play this game for it's PVP you'll be sadly disappointed since the majority of the community has left the game's arena barren & void of any activity.  To put it bluntly, the PVP in this game is not very good.This game shines most in it's customization & the co-op quests.  The downside to all of this is their network is still in disarray & you will most likely experience lag in any form of online play.  The lag can also break missions & cause them to glitch out becoming unfinishable. The combat is typical of most other DBZ fighters.  You punch people, blast them, & cast crazy super powers of destruction that can anihilate civilizations.  The downside to all this is the destruction element is lacking when compared to previous DBZ fighters.  You can't blow up the planets like you could in Budokai Tenkaichi 2, & you can't destroy very many buildings.  The only buildings you can destroy are the smaller ones that seem out of place in a giant city scape.GRAPHICSThe graphics are pretty much a copy/paste set up from older DBZ titles as well as from the Asian only DBZ MMO, with some added glow effects that are more annoying than they're worth.  I had to turn them down just because they made everything too bright & glowy.  You won't need a super rig to run this game at least & since there is a big lack of DBZ games on PC that may be a good thing for everyone who wants one.RNG SYSTEMThe worst or best part about this game is it's RNG system.  Let me explain exactly why this system is both good & bad. Ahem, first of all the game uses a typical RNG element for loot drops.  It uses this same element for Super/Ultimates.  Now, the part that's different & that people seem to be upset about is in order to get the 'best' items/skills in the game each mission has a prerequisite that you must fulfill in order to trigger the event to claim them.  HOWEVER, fulfilling the prerequisite only gives you a 'chance' for that event to occur.  You see where I'm going with this?  You have to fulfill requirements, then you get an RNG event that may or may not happen, THEN you have RNG again on what items will drop.  In short, RNG within RNG within RNG.  It's really terrible & it is a cheap tactic to lengthen the game when it's really not that long to begin with.  You can complete the main story & all the side missions in about 20 or 30 hours, less so if you're used to playing DBZ fighting games.  However, collecting everything in the game will take you hundreds of hours IF you're lucky with this games terrible RNG system.The plus side to all of this is that the game is overall fun & playing missions over & over again may be tedious & at times frustrating because of it's RNG system you will not ever get bored of the combat while doing said missions.  The combat is a joy & very fun, especially if you have a friend or two to play with you.  You ever sandwich an opponent between 2 kamehameha beams?  Well, me & a buddy did & when we did we couldn't stop talking about how cool it was.VOICE ACTINGThe game's voice acting ranges from great to down right bad.  There are moments where the voice acting seems like they did it in one take, while others are done very well.  These bad segments are few & far between, thankfully. The voice cast has people from the actual show as well as people from DBZ Abridged (Which is a great online series that I highly reccoment watching whether you're a DBZ fan or not).  There's even an easter egg from that show put in the game.OVERALLOverall this is a decent single player game with good RPG elements & a good character creator that will give you around 30 or so hours of fun DBZ gameplay goodness, or more if you decide you wanna grind & unlock everything in the game as well as earning the highest rank on every mission.  The online element lags when you group with random people, but works fairly well when you group with friends through Steam.  The group play is a joy if you don't experience any lag but very rarely did I ever get games with no lag.  The PVP is filled with cheap exploitations & some powers in this game give you a feeling that it was just added on as an extra feature since there is no real balance set up for it.I can only recommend this game for anyone who enjoy's anime fighting games or just wants a DBZ game for PC.  Anyone else may want to steer clear of it's RNG within RNG style dungeon crawl."

However its laden with issues right now, bugs galore, FPS settings fouling everything up, plenty of moves either outright not working like they should, or plain breaking the game. SSJ is completely over powered while not unbeatable, giving ONE race the most powerful skill in game, was a real downer for me. The greatest crime of all? Well i hope you like RNG, cause we got RNG for your RNG, and that is probably the games biggest flaw. RNG is a huge thing in this game, need to get lucky even if you fullfill requirements in a mission for the special event to occur. Then item you wanted might not even drop. Imagine in WoW if you got to death wing after trudging through the dungeon only to have him "" not spawn "" because only a chance he'll appear. That is effectively what this game has done and its really a terrible mechanic.Despite all the bad things i just listed, is some joy to sitting down and making my own created character/'s and back stories that go with them. To being part of the Dragonball world, and to see and meet those characters, and a story that is quite honestly, pretty darn good (and also stolen allbeit legally from Dragonball online). All in all if your a fan this is a great bralwer/fighter hybrid and best DBZ simulator you'll ever play. But if your looking for a "" deep and competitive fighter "" this is not the game for you. Balance is not even in this games vocabulary, and i don't it ever being balanced with out total system overhauls which we all know wont happen."

If you are a DBZ fan you will enjoy this game as well!Combines elements of MMO games with the game play style found in previous DBZ fighting games with the exception that you get to pick what skills you use. Decent graphics, storyline has some mistakes but they are very minor. The game isn't too easy, but it's not terribly hard either. Allows good customization for characters.If you aren't a fan of the Dragon Ball Z series then stay away! You will have a huge mob of haters! So don't even bother with this game. You will find this game incredibly boring. Very little is explained and it's not your average fighting game. If you know nothing about Dragon Ball Z you're going to feel lost and feel like the deveopers failed at providing enough user information."

One of the very few games I paid full price for; not a single regret about it.I do have some gripes (RNG is a bit excessive, lack of customization for 'DBZ' characters), but it's still a dream come true and it's not even a AAA title. Can't wait for a sequel!"
,Not Recommended,323470,23969006,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Dibzahab,"Let me begin by stating that I adore the DBZ series.  This game does a wonderful job of emulating that universe through amazing graphics, flawless voice work, incorporation of a rich selection of skills and lore.  Unfortunately, the game is hampered by what feels to be an aborted f2p progression.  Everything in the meta-game is grindy and driven by random chance.  Want to learn a specific skill?  You've got to luck out into having a certain master spawn, accept his tutelage to the exclusion of all others, then wait until he offers you an update quest.  The updates come randomly and the skills are rewarded randomly from a drop table.  It's pretty ridiculous.To put my complaints into perspective, this is a fighting game that requires leveling up.  Some of the skills don't become available until well beyond level 80, which is precisely as obnoxious as it sounds.  The game also features consumables... seriously, can you imagine having to buy mana potions in Mortal Komat?  It's just one more way the game gives off a failed f2p vibe, and a huge, gigantic detriment to the gameplay at large.The actual combat is... unique.  All characters are fully capable of movement in all three dimensions.  This is cool in 1v1 matches, but the campaign frequently has as many as six characters running around at once and the ""lock on"" targeting systems are too clumsy to support the gameplay.  The stages themselves are strung together with clumsy portals, so instead of seamlessly flowing from one arena to the next, you've gotta' fly around in 3-space searching for little portals to enter.  It's just not particularly well designed.Complaints aside, the game does have its charm for DBZ fans.  I've dumped about 15, somewhat enjoyable, hours into it at this point and will probably continue to tinker from time to time.  For this reason, I had to debate whether to give a recommendation, but in the face of much stronger fighting games (Injustice is my current PC favorite), I've gotta' give this one a thumbs down."

Each character feels diverse, the combat system is very fun and has appeals for casual and harder core players, and the story mode is surprisingly interesting.This is why it is a bleeding shame that BanDai turned it into a P2W DLC fest.You may not care if you do not plan on playing PVP at all. If not, I completely recommend this game. However, for the full DLC package of $10 per package with 2 DLC packs out now and another one on its way, the price for winning becomes very steep very quickly. These DLC packs include equipable items and super moves that go against the design of the combat engine and make winning matches versus those without the DLC free. Some of these include a Z-Soul that recharges your stamina when your opponent deals damage to you, a super that freezes your opponent for a set amount of time and disables their ability to vanish or use escape moves (which no other move in the game disables, including *paralysis moves*), and a DLC fighter (Nuova Shenron) that is strictly better than all other default fighters.It's unacceptable and blatant P2W, which is strictly unacceptable for a game that already costs $50."

(e.g. Vegeta during Saiyan saga to Buu saga)+ Ressurection 'F' DLC content, including Golden Freiza.Cons:- Online matchmaking is close to dead at this stage. (By the time of this review)- PVP is unsurprisingly broken and crap.- Special/Ultimate Attacks are the only defining factor for characters.- Combat could be seen as shallow as a result.- Prepare to hear players spam their attacks continously, and give you little opportunity to contribute in a quest.- Your character only goes up to Super Saiyan 1 in appearance.- Loot awards are mostly random- Special quest conditions are only activated randomly even if you fulfill them. (e.g. Fighting Super Saiyan 2 Gohan requires beating everyone else first before Gohan. Strangely, the game will only acknowledge that you did this 25% of the time)Conclusion:If you held off on Xenoverse, it may have been for a good reason. Still, customising and developing your own hero/heroine may grow on you. In the UK at least, finding viable matches for quests and PVP is quickly becoming hard as a lot of players have already have moved on from the game.If a Xenoverse 2 has (ever) been announced by the time you read this review, you may be better off waiting for that."

The online features are also good but the server keeps crashing and this will annoy the heck out of anyone which forces you back to the main menu even if you're playing by yourself unless you set steam in ""offline mode"". The game itself is grind heavy and unbalanced which favors spamming ultimate techniques rather than playing it strategically and the AI is lacking in the more challenging missions.

,Not Recommended,323470,22261437,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Ryuko,"This marks my first steam review and on a game that I've played extensively to boot. I'll get right to the point, this game is very two-faced in int's pros and cons. On one hand if you're an old fan of the dragon Ball Series this sort of RPG/Beat 'em up gamestyle will feel very nostalgic and rewarding. On the other hand the game suffers significant online play issues that can seriously kill the expoerience if you like engaging in PvP. I will not get into huge detail on the game mechanics themselves but rather highlight some of the main high and low points that have both kept me hooked, and have somewhat drained my interest.First off the main pro of the game: Character customization. You can choose a number of cosmetic features to make your player look the way you want. Far from perfection, but a big plus. You can also change out the move sets on the fly and as you acquire more moves you can narrow your selection to those that match your playing style best.The con: You will find a lot of players criticize the actual game mechanics which are valid, but the chief downside to this game on the PC is that the online play was very poorly designed for handling cheaters. A cursory look at the leaderboard for ranked battle will show a number of scores that out-digit the games' ability to accurately read them. I don't know how active the online play was immediately after release but If you're looking to move your way up in the ranks the top 20 scores combined with the current inactivity of ranked effectively makes the venture pointless and unmotivating. I've run into several cheaters who have also freely used trainers and cheat engine scripts in online play to sway the outcome of pvp matches,This cheater problem is not so much an issue for PQs at least but to do any productive PvP almost necessitates networking with other players to get a decent experience, something already pushed by the games very limited fixed chat function.So in summary your gaming experience is going to rely heavily on your goals when you play it, and how well you can adapt to the poor handling of cheaters. The game can still be very much enjoyable withe the right people, but there are hurdles to climb in that really makes the $50 price tag on this game less than desireable. If you buy - get it on sale when its cheaper.As much as I enjoy the game very much and would otherwise rate it positively; given my lengthy experience with it, I'm going to grade it as ""not recommended"". Far from the worst game ever, but it badly needs an update of some kind to block trainer users who take their infinite HP hacks into online multiplayer."

By the time you've gone through namekian story mode you're probably already addicted to the gameplay.The online is consisted of 3 map parts that includes item & cloth shops, battle stations, tournaments and online quests (co-op). What makes xenoverse appealing from previous dbz games is it's time patrol story that revolves around correcting the dragonball timeline from invaders, you'll be playing lots of ""distortion"" scenarios that are both surprising & challenging. My character got busted so bad halfway through the game that it will force you to use healing items and strategic gameplay, don't even think of skipping those features. Best of all, i can get my friends and other players to help me with those quests if i'm not able to finish it alone.That sums up the basic gameplay features of Xenoverse, i hope other's will explore the game until they liked it as much as i did.

Maybe my expectations were too high.Pros:-Its dragon ball-fast paced combat-Runs smooth-no crashes or stuttering-can't recall a time a ran into a bugCons:-Combat gets old quickly-I found the games story mode unnecessarily difficult and quickly resorted to cheap tactics like the infinite combo (light, light , heavy, heavy) and super saiyan ult spam-The walking around in the hub world to get to story mode and other gamemodes felt cheap and boring, I actually would've preferred menus to it. (didn't even know there was a local splitscreen mode until I beat the damn game)-I didnt even bother with the gear because it felt like a waste of time (wore the dlc goku outfit the entire game) Would've liked more customization like transmogging or something.Thoughts:I wish the game had some mechanics from the previous Dragon ball games like- Beam battles (spinning the analog sticks for the stronger beam)- Permanent transformations (ascending from super saiyan 1-4)- dodging like from Budokai 3 (A skillful alternative to blocking that would drain stamina with no dmg penalty but needed to be timed)- Burst clashes (When you clash with an opponent and engage in high speed combat). It would be cool if you had to press a sequence of buttons and the first to finish it would be the victor of the clash.I feel like the game was missing these mechanics and just didn't have much need for skill.

Start grinding to try to get stronger to defeat super buu, Grinding missions just as hard and in some cases harder than the mission you're grinding for, Get teamed up on by Goku and Gohan get killed then frustrated then break controller and stop playing.I love what this game was going for but it fell short instead creating a game too frustrating to be played.Overall score 6/10 great idea but poorly executed."

If you're already a fan you're going to love this game.Oh, and Male Voice 8 is TFS' Takahata101 in Nappa's voice... and not only that but they let TFS write completely unique and original dialogue for Male Voice 8 that's different than all the other voices. Throw a Destructo Disc and your character yells ""PIZZA!"" in Nappa's voice. Other golden attack gems include ""GEOMETRY!"" ""Cat loves food, yeh yeah yeah yeah!"" ""Space Australia"" ""Slow-your-role punch!"" ""I don't even know!

Then it became apparent that this game has a LOT of bugs that will impact your game to the point where a lot of u WILL rage-quit. Ofc these flaws aren't apparent till you have a feel for the game, thus you're already past your ""2 hours or under limit"" to refund it.Here are the bugs/problems:(these are most apparent in multiplayer)1. All the AI have a AOE break-free ability that costs 300 stamina per use, but yet they seem to be able to use it non-stop.2. The AI are incredibly fast when chasing a target. If you and a friend are fighting 2v2 against AI and the 2 AI are goin for your friend, it's damn near impossible to chase the AI fast enough to keep them off your friend.3. The AI also are completely invincible while blocking, you are not.4. One AI can grab you and as he's spinning you around to throw u, another AI can shoot u with an ultimate, THEN the one that threw you can follow up with his own(imagine if there were 3, it DOES happen, quite often). Red-headed step-child doesn't begin to compare to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.5. The AI are also invincible when totally layed down on the floor, you are not. So they can ult you while ur down to do tons of dmg. But if the tables are turned and you ul tthem, they recieve NO damage. If they're bouncing you're fine but if they're down, do NOT ATTACK. Ur just leaving yourself open when they get up.6. You cannot even make 1 alternate character(an alt and main) till you complete the game(which takes at least a week of constant play). If you want to try another build, u MUST delete the previous character before you can create another one, or beat the game and then you can make them.(this is just fkin dumb imho)7. You CAN'T TYPE IN CHAT. All you can do is use the preset questions/comments to coordinate with allies. The game does have VOIP but 9/10 ppl have their mic disabled since there is no PTT button, ur mic is constantly on or off. AND you cant even talk to ppl unless they're already in your party and in a match. This limitation on lobby chat just boggles my mind as to ""WHY?""The Xenoverse server also has all kinds of issues:1. Kicking you for being afk even when you're literally moving around2. Many disconnects3. Making you pvp against ur friend JUST to invite them to your team4. Making you wait on the server even if you're playing single player mode5. The server can't keep up with input except for the person hosting it. You'll see enemies rubber-banding like mad6. Sometimes the game COMPLETELY locks up, won't even allow you to open a menu to close it. You have to wait for  the server to catch up(which literally takes 10min or more) or End Task in Taskmanager. This happened 3x today.This small book I wrote above is just the beginning and is all true. I'm raging but all these are FACTS that happen A LOT. I fkin loved this game at first but those bugs are game-breaking and there's just too damn many of them.Trust me, even if you're like me and LOVE DB, do NOT BUY THIS GAME!"

I had dreams... I had faith they would get this right. Now... I have nothing. Nothing in DBZ. Remember when you first got your PS2, and the DBZ games came out? Remember when you used to sit with your friends do flashy moves, and just enjoy the game? Those days... DEAD. Just go screw this game, and get the Naruto games, or One piece your better off.Let me be straight with you. THEY ALMOST GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT. Almost. Everything is NEAR perfect. Then they decided to copy MMOs, and the last DBZ game that decided to allow character creation that was released in the US. Insane grinding, and then grinding some more because future content is too hard, or too gimmicky, or too cheap. Yeah its worst case scenario here.What they got wrong was the combat system. They threw out what made it beautiful, and enjoyable to watch for lower grade stuff for online play. Then broke it further by making it so boss battles remind you of old Warframe Boss battles... Whether its temporary time periods where you can't shake them up, or multiple burst to push you away which should be impossible, or too many enemies on the screen ganging up on you its basiclly poor game design at its finest.The Developers of this game got lazy, and stopped trying basiclly. They couldn't come up with inteligent content, and stuffed it chock full of stuff they thought people would like. Ok look ALL THE OTHER BANDAI GAMES DON'T SCREW UP LIKE THIS. They really need to take lessons from the OTHER GAMES. Naruto doesn't screw up this hard infact all their games are pure blissful joy. You don't create more and more impossible situations, and force the player to grind this hard when its NOT EVEN AN MMO. The developers failed designing the missions, and the combat system creating a painful game that makes you miss the old PS2 games, and how they were oh so wonderfully designed."

There are lots of clothing options but the majority items are copies of existing characters clothing and can not be recolored. Character body types are simple rescales meaning proprtions are way off if you want to make a kid/chibi character. The whole CaC process really feels more like lame in game DBZ cosplay rather than having a unique character.The developers also opted to leave out a TON of playable characters and instead made their clothing available for custom characters. The only problem, as prementioned, is that the tools to actually make 95% of the characters just arent there.Another thing on clothing is there are stats attached, meaning you''l be lucky if you can wear what you want without it messing up the stats you gain as you level.Those stats can however be stacked and combined with with customer movesets for some very imbalanced combinations which do not seems to be a top priority to balance.This means you can beat someone up the entire fight as they stay stationary and infinitly spam Ki attacks. However, if they get one lucky hit it can kill you. Not fun.Beyond imbalances there are also a TON of hackers with things like infinite ki and all maxed stats.This has resulted in the PvP aspect of the game dying. Almost noone does it. Meaning the only think you can reliably do is PvE and god the AI in this game is horrible. They'll run directly into super moves and fail to deflect the easiest of attacks. The only way it can be even a little challenging is when they give the AI super abilities to compensate. Such as insanely fast stamina and ki recharge rates and Immunity to push back when taking damage. If youre up against a Super Saiyan AI they'll even have infinite Ki and the spam it... a lot. Still not challenging unless it's a 3v1 fight.So, again. Do not buy this game."
,Not Recommended,323470,20018456,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,[HOD][SpiderFudge],"This game is terrible for many different reasons. Online modes are extremely boring and don't really add anything to the game. Unfortunately some game modes are not available without internet access (like tornament modes). The ""game lobby"" is an annoying saucer dish that you literally have to run around in to access the different game modes. Good luck finding people to play if you don't have every single add-on.I wouldn't even mind some of these annoyances if the designers turned the entire DBZ storyline into diarrhea. There is tons of missing voice dialog (which was also terrible) and blatenly altered/removed scenes.

,Recommended,323470,14948873,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,[IG] RDMT,"This game may not be for fighting fans, but DB games never have been.The story of this game is pretty cool for a Dragonball game. Rather than just having you play through the story of Dragonball Z (with a little GT thrown in there in the DLC), your created character has to fix anomalies in time that change the course of the timeline, mostly caused by the villain of the scenario being powered up by the main bad guy. The fixing of said anomaly consists of you beating the crap out of the altered individuals of the scenario until the events play out as you'd expect.The style of the game appears to be more towards the recent Battle of Z game, but the fighting is imbalanced as all getout.  It boils down to ""does my opponent have a barrier attack and/or do they have an ability which lets them not stagger? No? PunchpunchpunchpunchpunchULTIMATE! Yes? Crap. Circle around and blast them for a while, get a few cheeky hits in to buld meter, ULTIMATE!"" Once your character gets stronger, even these issues become essentially moot. Often you'll be put into team battles, but the AI is...not exactly advanced. It seems they never use their ultimates and spend most of their time circling the opponent and getting punched.Where the game really shines is the creation suite. 5 races to choose from, some with genders, all having different base stats. Thousands of different outfit pieces to equip, which boost different stats and in many cases can be color customized. Lots of different Z-Souls, which give you different abilities such as increased movement speed, faster Ki regeneration, powering up certain skills, etc. Items that can be used in battle to regain life for you as well as your teammates, cause a regen effect, revive from a KO, and other effects.These can be bought in-game in some cases, but are earned mostly through Parallel Quests, where you go through an area of time with a predefined goal, usually just punching people until they fall down. But hey, you can dress up a Frieza Clan member in Bulma's clothes if you want! (Gives a nice boost to basic attacks, too.) You also have the option of being mentored by several DB characters, from Krillin and 18 to Goku and Beerus. This will get you skills you normally can't buy. These areas give plenty of replayability as you try and get your created character absolutely perfect.All in all, if you're a Dragonball fan, you'll enjoy the customization the game provides and will be able to ignore the flaws with the fighting system as you relive, and fix, the Dragonball timeline. If you're a serious fighting game fan, you still may enjoy the customization aspect, but the simplicity of the fighting system may be a turnoff. I'm in the first group, so I very much enjoyed it."

Combat is entirely tied up in min-maxing which also limits choices for character themeing, as everything in the game is weighted with stats.Your interactions with series characters is also extremely limited, both by the story, as well as the extremely limited character pool mostly padded by alternate version of the same character with a different move set. Something already done by the costume selection menu making it especially redundant for anyting beyond super ficially making the roster look larger than it actually is.I've put 65 hours in to the game, around 3 hours of that is experiancing actual new content. Fun can be had with it, but it is ultimately a grind that does not reward skill, but rather punishes the persistant with dull repetative content."

Predator that shocked the strategy game industry by proposing 8-bit graphics, and you have to play with a dreamcast controller to use any of the controls. But, once you get into it it starts to get pretty good. The character creation has a lot of bugs in it, like with the xenomorph race, I can't give myself a big alien head like that one guy from the movie had. I want to look like alien like King Kai in his third form. Overall, once you get past the fact that you can only be Alien, or the green guy ""Flute"" from the anime, the beatemup style of the game feels really nice. You can use a lot of the iconic attacks from the show like Gum Gum Pistol and Rasengan to make your character feel stronger too. But once you're done flying around and punching things like the character dragon ball, it leaves an empty void in your soul that makes you want the game to be so much more. 1/10 IronPichuGames~ ""Not enough Goku alternate slots"""

,Recommended,323470,14959832,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Kodyd194,"Out of all the Dragon Ball games I have played, Xenoverse is probably my favorite.  Story wise it takes place in the future of the series, having you travel around time correcting errors in the time stream. The game features character creation, its pretty detailed compared to what I was expecting, and features 5 separate races.  There is a good deal of gear and tons of ability's to put on your character as well. Most of the gear and abilities are acquired via side quests, but there are shops to purchase, items, gear and skills at as well.  You can party up, or solo most quests.Xenoverse is a game I really love, but it is not without its flaws.One big downside to the game is cheating, cheating is real and its a problem (super stats anyone)? This coupled with unbalanced skills and gear (it feels like every patch something new breaks in some op way) makes PvP public games pretty un-fun.  To top it off It seems to me that PvP is dead most of the time anyway, so this is probably not a game you will want to get if your a ""hard core"" fighting game fan, or want a DBZ game for the PvP aspects.When the game released it had terrible server issues, and im glad now that those kinks have been worked out they can work on balancing and patching the other known bugs players often compalin about.  I just hope, some time in the future they give the game anticheat, because as it stands I find this to be a pretty unacceptable level of cheaters in the game.Overall though the game has a story similar to the game Dragon Ball Online, and the fighting feels pretty unique and unlike most fighting games out there, as you wont find any combos you need to remember, or anything like that. Its a simpler take of a fighting game, coupled with full 3d movement and Rpg elements just makes this a blast to play, especially if you have friends who can play to!"

This makes the fight very slow, unlike Budokai or Tenkaichi.The only plus I can think of is that you can create your own avatar (human, saiyan, namek, frieza, buu), and the graphics. Otherwise this game has gone backwards. Too glitchy, buggy, unbalanced in terms of stats. Combat feels clunky and broken, sometimes your beam connects with the enemy but nothing happens, or your character shoots in a wrong direction.Also, maybe I'm missing some settings or something, but for the life of me, I can't find an option to extand local games to more than 90 seconds limit.I hope the next game will resemble the Tenkaichi a bit more.We never asked for much, just a remastered Tenkaichi game with the new characters."

Its really good but there is a lack of custimization in my opinion. Not just on the character but also with in game clothes. You are 99% most probably gonna see someone else looking the same as you.Its not just the custimization, its great to be able to make our own character and all but its so easy to get over powered with them. Now if you play on your own its a bit more of a challenge but if you play Co-op then its just stupid easy. I love co-op and i like it to be relaxing and all but its too easy and barely lasts, it feels pointless playing with others because of it.Big problem in this game is balance, PvP and Co-op is affected. Certain skills and also races can easily make you over powered, to the point where you will get bored fairly quickly and also be annoying other players. Super saiyans can spam ultimates as much as they want, you will find many people doing that in PvP just so they can win. I'd advise not to bother with PvP, in fact if you want this game to fight against others i would avoid this game. Another thing i've seen is a certain Z soul which heals you stupid fast when your Ki is full, it then makes the person really hard to kill. That is just two examples, they are more. Basically people can become so overpowered co-op isn't at all challenging or in PvP the person is just to hard to kill or simply cannot be touched.Ok next is the clothes, each item of clothing has certain stats/skill points on it, you cannot choose clothes that you like and have the stats you want, you will be forced to wear certain clothing. To make it worse you will find that there is only 1 or maybe 2 items of clothing with those stats. So you may get the stats/skill points that you wanted but there is no room for fashion, you will have to deal with the clothes you got those stats on. You may find clothes you really like but they may have lower skill points. No room for comprimise.Last thing that a lot of people will probably hate 'the grinding'Instead of having drop rates this game works with RNG, which basically means nothing is guaranteed. You can end up doing something for nothing. Even more painful is the fact that it works with missions as well, you can do all the hidden conditions of a mission so you can do the extra part of the mission (which is the only way to get the Z rank in missions) but it is not always guaranteed to happen. Meaning that you will go out of your way to do all the secret conditions of the mission to either try and get the good gear or to get Z rank in the mission but it will not always let you do the extra parts of the mission resulting in your time being wasted unless you are just playing the mission through. In any case be prepared to grind a lot in this game, for gear, dragonballs or Z rank in missions because nothing is guaranteed.Pros:The character creation, it has flaws and can be improved a lot but its still great to finally have a decent create a character. I just wish there was more options. A warning to you all though, Saiyans hair does not change form when going super saiyan, it will change color but not form. And all other races Human, Majin, Namekian and Frieza race only get to use kaoken. There is not other transformations.The story. Its not the same reused story like all the other games, its sort of but with a twist. Time is being messed with and all the iconic parts are being changed. Instead of things happening as you all know them to, you will travel back in time to correct them due to a duo that has been altering past events. You will work alongside all the characters you know and love, and save them in the process. Its nice and interesting not to have to replay the same stuff each game for once.The mix of RPG, MMO and fighter. Its different but its fun. It brings new life to DBZ games but can still use a lot more improvement because of the issues i said about before. You start in a central hub called TokiToki City, this is where you will see and meet others, choose quests, team up, hang out etc. Aside from the server issues its all great with this, however the issues with the server have been quite bad for most people, but that will be fixed eventually. If you want to play online right away i'd advise to wait a little before buying since they are still sorting the servers out.I've had fun playing but i've got bored easily because of the un balanced part of it. I love co-op but it doesn't last, PvP i won't bother with because its just too unfair.This is my first review, i felt like writing you are lucky to be seeing this, my mind is going blank so thats the end!You owe me cake"

,Recommended,323470,17624254,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,Weegee,"Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the best Dragon Ball game OF ALL TIME. All other Dragon Ball Z games are a cash grab so huge they fail to deliver a good product. Xenoverse, however, delivers a great game that is original. The story goes as follows. Something is messing with history, so Trunks summons Shenron to bring a warrior strong enough to defeat whatever or whoever is causing these distortions in history. You, the protagonist of this game, is summoned and is now your job to fix the distortions in history. From the very momment you enter this world, you are given an original plot line, which is different from the many other DBZ games. Which is why this game is so good, it delivers originality to the series. Next, the visuals are outdated by most peoples opinion, but the sacrafice was well worth it for that anime art style. Finally theres the gameplay. There is a simple fighting system that you would expect from a DBZ game. You can fly around, shoot KI blasts and punch. You are allowed to bring capsules on all of your fights that have effects such has healing you and your teammates and make you stronger. If these capsules didn't exist, this game would be impossible, but this feature also allows for more epic fights. The hub world of TOKI TOKI city contains shops, offline, online, world tournament and local fighting desks, shops, the time nest and paralel quest desk. Which brings me to the three modes of the game. Battles, which is standard in DBZ games which involve opponents fighting each other for fun, time patrols, which is where you do the main story and paralel quests where you can go alone or with friends to an alternate time line where certain people were to lose instead of win or it is in sync with the timeline. It is confusing, I know, but it just works.  Overall I give this game a 9.9/10 and a definate buy with DLC. Why this score? BECAUSE WHY CAN'T I F****** HEAL BARDOCK AND TRUNKS WHEN THEY JUST SIT THERE AND LET THEMSELVES BE KILLED AND CAUSE ME TO LOSE THE F****** MISSION."

For example one mission where you fight 3 guys at once, get past them somehow, get past another 3 and then face another 2, but they are both SS and spam beams constantly. I literally got caught in a loop where Vegeta and Trunks kept spamming one beam after the other and I couldn't get out of the beams to recover and I had just used a full health recovery and my character has a level 100 health. I mean this isn't even challenging, it's just cheap. Also, very disappointed in the fact that the game isn't multiplayer friendly at all. No chat, almost no way to form teams and play with your friends. Cannot choose the server you join, almost guaranteeing that you cannot find your friends in the game.

For a new player or someone who's not used to fighting games it cane down to random button mashing. If you want to play it for the single player experience you essentially are doing two types of missions, which will feel quite repetitive. The game does get a plus for having customisable characters(although not to the extent i'd like to see). The game also presented a bunch of RPG elements such as trading and selling items, battling other players, running around hub areas, customizing your character visual and its attributes etc. The Graphics wasn't impressive but wasn't bad either, but one thing is for certain is that it didn't look like it came out in 2015. What made some of the experience dull is that you had to take care of one or many support characters which often joined you in your journey and you often ended up failing if they died. It could get quite messy if 3 characters where attacking the enemy at the same time, not knowing what was happening because of visual effects and body blocking. All in all i wouldn't reccomend the game as it doesn't bring much new to the table and because of its poor combat system"

I immediately retried (I didn't level up or change anything at all) and as soon as I got back in, Frieza whooped my♥♥♥♥♥and I couldn't even get to the 2nd part, when he transforms. Somehow the computer opponent got 10x more vicous, and I couldn't even land a hit.This happens constantly, and it is so extremely annoying.But otherwise, it's a fun game. The only mission so far that i'm sure everyone hated, was trying to protect Krillen and Gohan while on Frieza's ship. You will sit there for half an hour, KOing the same 3 enemies over and over. Then Guldo shows up, you get him to alow enough health, and you don't even get the satisfaction of killing him, he just runs away. Then you sit for another half hour killing the same 3 enemies.Seriously, that mission wouldn't be near as hard if the AI for Gohan and Krillen didn't suck♥♥♥♥♥ They're dumb and weak, and if one of them die, you lose.That's another thing, the AI is stupid as ♥♥♥♥, seriously, they are DUMB. I was trying to complete a mission where you're on Frieza's side, just trying to get rid of all the Z fighters. (and Vegeta) The goal here was to get my character to learn how to become a super sayain, to do that is to kill Krillen first, Goku turns Super Sayain, then kill Goku. Well, as I would attack Krillen, Goku would attack me. Seriously, the entire time Goku is telling Frieza off, he's attacking me. And Frieza is doing NOTHING, I look over and he's just standing there!I end up killing Krillen, Goku goes super sayain and he goes BALLISTIC on me.

The game takes a turn to a completely different prespective similair to Another Road for PSP.It uses a combination of these games:- Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team (PSP)- Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi (1 not 2 or 3)- Dragon Ball Z: Shin BudokaiThe main aspects are from Tag team and Tenkaichi and removing alot from the previous games to make up for the graphics and high end processor power. Basically, everything in this game is merely cosmetic.What is good about this game?- Various selectable characters, including your own avatar!- Custom Created Characters with their own stats.- 3 Vs. 3 Gameplay battle. Somethign that DBZ has really had and needed.- Gameplay mechanics and smoothness of game is well balanced for 60 FPS.What isn't good about this game?- Transformations once again, are limited, very limited (You can only carry 1 transformation, transformations are one-time execution and cannot charge Ki to sustain them. This is not how DBZ is).- Skills are bound to one avatar, skills won't change on transformation so you end up having only 1 setup.- 7 Slot System returns from Budokai series with downside. You have 7 slots to setup your moves and abilities, but are restricted to certain sections, including a transformation (4 Super, 2 Ultimates, 1 Evasive).- No Saiyan Overdrive System, characters will reach a very low-limited power level, max Level of 50, 150 ATB Points.- No secure online system, cheating is inevitable. 999 ATB stats on all attributes. Go figure.- Repetitive Combat Strings with no Cancel/Trick Moves or strategy (You can continuously use the same attacks: XXXXY (repeat) till out of stamina or your opponent stops you.If there is any hope of truely getting the DBZ feel out of the next game, these are the recommended changes that would improve it:- Return Budokai or Budokai Tenkaichi style Battle Strings and System (Basic Attacks, Smash, Charged Smash, Ki Charging)- Skill System to Raging Blast, Tenkachi 3, Budokai 3. Transformations should be separate from Move List, and characters should be leveled up higher in order to be able to achieve higher transformation systems.- Restore Ki Charging (Not a Skill on a wasted slot)- 8 Slot System (4 Supers, 4 Ultimates, of 2 Ultimates being Evasive, Defesive attacks or abilities) These slots should not take transformatons.- Transformation Slots (4 Slots) since this game uses D-Pad, it can use of them directions for transformation menu and then use the (XYAB) buttons to choose your transformation, limiting characters to up to 4 transformations.- Restore Overdrive system, lose your transformation if you get damaged too much without rest or counter attacks, a fatique meter ( or if stamina reaches 0 ) you lose your transformation. Allow transformations to boost your stats by training in those transformations instead of leveling up your base form.In all the game is okay, but it not a comparison to what Tag Team was like, or Raging Blast 2. Better luck next time. Hope Dimps, or Namco Bandai make a better game this time."

There is no dodge ability, replaced by useless 'evade skills' that you can almost never use. When your character is hit it staggers him/her and without the ability to dodge you are left with relying on the unreliable 'evade skills.' As a result, breaking a combo is almost impossible. Ultimate attacks are regularly interrupted by AI controlled opponents, which ultimate spam you in turn in said 3 vs 1 fights. Don't even try super saiyan. It drains your ki. While it does give you unlimited use of supers and ultras, once you run out of ki it drops you out of super saiyan and completely depletes your stamina, leaving you helpless. Kaiyoken is the same way, except it drains your stamina.I give the game 4/10.

It sports both an Offline and Online play modes: these play modes are a PvE-style story line and a PvP mode like your classic fighting games. Characters can be customized in both appearance and skill, so you can really create the character you want. Alternatively, you are not forced to use your character during the Parallel Quests (they are a repeatable mission you do for items and XP) and can use any unlocked story character instead. The use of the player character is required for the main story line. You start with one customizable character, but once you do a complete playthrough, more character slots are unlocked. Other features include:- Ability to create teams in game.- World Tournament for PvP events.- Voice chat.- Collectable dragon balls which can be used to unlock new characters, lots of cash, items, combat moves, skill point resets and character visual do-overs.Positives- Most, if not all, of the original english VOs from the series, plus it covers characters from the start of Z to GT series, plus the latest movie.- Easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay.- Customizable characaters in both skill and appearance.- Does not require online connection to play.- Fun, intense combat.- Items are shared between characters, no need to re-farm items or cash.Negatives- Netcode seems to be spotty. Desync and lag issues.- Camera is a bit finicky at times.- Crash-prone if steam overlay is enabled.- Servers are frequently down, but fortunately you can still play the game.... but requires steam to be in offline mode first.- Can be grindy. RNGesus does exist in this game which can make getting items frustrating.[h2]Conclusion[/h2]This game is a must for anyone who is into all things Dragonball. If you are patient and can deal with the fact that the online servers may go down without notice, then you should have a good time in game, especially if you have friends to play with. Hopefully the developers/publishers add more resources into supporting the game to buff out some of the release-week issues."

Punch and beam attack things and win. It's worth it to mention that the same tricks that you learn on a character, won't work in the next mission against that character, and will NEVER work on another player unless they've been heavily drinking.The best part of the game is easily the standing in the lobby with friends trying to overthrow the Ginyu force by doing their poses better than they do."

The fighting mechanics left a lot to be desired in terms of responsiveness, accuracy and overall gameplay feel. Movement felt constrained and clunky. Arenas are needlessly large. Special moves are hotkeyed, meaning that the skill ceiling is depressingly low. Character types are very constrained in terms of playstyle. The gameplay felt needlessly broken up thanks to the hub area. Tutorials are mandatory, and teach new players practically nothing.Overall, I found my two hours with Xenoverse frustrating and disappointing.

,Recommended,323470,20707613,"Posted: 23 January, 2016",all,OptiKristic,"Warning: This review may be slightly influenced by my love for DBZ, so be advised.Now I've played through this game three times, each time just as enjoyable as the one before. I highly recommend this game, but theres some things I should mention.Pros!This game is a great fighting game, and as with most fighting games this one is best with a controller rather than mouse and keyboard. Why I suggest using a wired controller for this is because of the way this game works, most of the time you'll be in the air fighting rather than on the ground. Without a controller it takes a bit of getting used to manuvering while flying, like rising and lowering your altitude to get closer (or further away) to your target. This leads me to another reason why using a controller is supreme. Ultimate and Super Attacks. I have to say this was probably the most fun to experiment with when your playing XENOVERSE, as your ultimates and supers can pretty much make or break your character depending on the way you go with character customization (I.E: using a ton of melee based supers when doing a Ki based character) I suggest you mess around and have fun getting your ultimates the way you like it. Now I can go on for a while about the great things in this game, like character customization. But theres somethings you should know if you plan on playing Xenoverse.Cons:*Sigh* This game is really awesome, but some of the features can ruin your fun. Lets start with least favourite feature of this game...Random Number Generator... Oh where do I begin with this pile of crap. RNG is used for the drops in this game, which can lead to hours or days farming for a super, ultimate, item, or a piece of armor. This is probably what♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most in this. I spent hours farming for Super Vegeta 2 (one of the transformations) and still haven't gotten it. Even though I've gotten Z-ranks almost every time I did the mission it was on. So I spent upwards of eight or nine hours farming for it, and at some point gave up on farming for it. So if your playing through this and hoping for a certain item be prepared for either really short or a really long farming state.Partner AI is another bad part about this game, sometimes they'll just be useless and at other times they'll be helpful. I honestly couldn't figure out how their AI works, but be prepared to revive them a few times. This brings me to my next subject.Some story missions in this are annoying as heck at times. I'll give an example, theres a part in this game where your character has to defeat 20 enemies. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. You have to constantly protect Gohan and Krillin from getting killed, 'cause if they're killed its an instant failure. Oh and the missions don't have checkpoints, which makes this tedious along with their horrible A.I.Okay I can go on for a couple more paragraphs on the good things and bad things about this game. But overall, the good outweighs the bad. So what rating would I give this game? I honestly would give this game a 8/10. I went into this game wanting it to be my GOTY for 2015, but I found it in my top 10 of the year. This game would be a 9/10 if it wasn't for some of the annoyances with the Parallel quests (Due to their occasional repeating of objectives), RNG, and partner A.I. If you're going to get this game I'd suggest getting it with a friend because its much better with friends, I also suggest waiting for a sale and getting the Resurrection F DLC along with it. Now go, have fun with this game. I know I did. :D"

I wouldn't even go as far as to say it was good. But it was fun. It was so fun I'd be playing with my mouth open saying, ""wooooaaaah"" like I did watching the Anime when I was 10. It's such a broad term but this game is cool. It's cool and it's fun.My favorite part of this game is being able to play as your own custom character. It was so awesome being there with my favorite characters as we relived the challenges Goku and friends faced throughout the show. The move system is so well integrated and worked smoothly. Character customization in the beginning lacked a little bit but overall it was solid.My biggest problem with this game is the lack of substance in the enviorment. The hub world is boring and bland, NPC's without any heavy voice acting made everything feel empty. The cutscenes were enjoyable but felt awkward when the game tried to make it seem like my character had any relation to the other characters. This game could have really benefited from a voiced protagonist or at least dialogue options. I felt like I was on a linear path the whole time and my character's feelings really didn't matter. The lack of choice in the story made me feel like a puppet rather than a hero. Towards the end, the game is really pushing a buddy system with Trunks. Which would be fine if my character had any sort of personality. But he didn't, so every push at friendship and connection felt forced and awkward.However, the game makes up for it's lack of enviormental substance with the combat. The fighting wasn't the most complex but as I'm pretty bad at fighting games I accpeted this with open arms. Combat is insane and chaotic. It feels amazing and it's extremely smooth. The way the custom skill sets work allow the player to make their own combos and play styles very easily. There is so much depth in the combat but yet it's so simple. It's fun, it's cool, and I enjoyed it and really that's what really matters in games. It was well worth the $12 I paid for it during the Steam Summer Sale however I wouldn't recommend buying it full price. It'll keep you entertained for at least 3 days to a week which is well worth a sale price.Dragonball Xenoverse earns a 6.5/10"

,Recommended,323470,14676302,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Grand Central Station,"I'm not really a Dragon Ball Z fan. As a child, I was never into the whole ""screaming 'till my hair grows 'n glows"" shtick, and all of my friends would talk about the Kame-hame-whoosits at the lunch table with me staring into the infinite.Knowing this, why did I ever buy this game?Really, all it took for me was the concept of character customization.I don't know anything about the Dragon Ball Z universe, but judging by how long the show has been going on, the amount of movies it has produced, the enormous fanbase the series has garnered, and the number of games it has created, just the thought of a dirty peasant like myself making a character that bounces around and inserts himself into this grand menagerie of bulging biceps and pulsating pecs fills in some sort of... primal need that I never filled in as a child. Making me feel involved in important parts of such a long-lived series is the sort of Skyrim type immersion I really enjoy in a game.The character customization was pretty standard in terms of depth, with plenty of different facial features and color options to choose from. My only minor gripe is that I can't make my Earthling character smile, he's just stuck in a permanent scowl, like somebody just ate the last donut. Like I said though, this is only a minor gripe, and I'm sure there are different options for the other races.In terms of gameplay, I'm a complete novice when it comes to the Dragon Ball Z themed fighting games, due to the aformentioned lack of interest as a child. It was impressive on how easily I was able to get into the mechanics of the game, even with the extremely frenetic pace of the combat. Punches roll out extremely fast, I zip around everywhere in the blink of an eye, and HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥I JUST SHOT A MAGIC MISSILE OUT OF MY HAND. Due to the cathartic nature of this type of combat, however, I more often than not forget about blocking or evading my enemies attacks, and just throw myself into the enemy with reckless abandon - but I'm sure that's something I'll eventually learn as I progress through the game.One really annoying feature, however is the dowsing ability gained when your character gets a scouter headset thingy. I understand the part about using the scouter to see enemy players' power levels, but using the scouter to locate and pick up hidden items in each area is just plain tedious. Scanning around in first player mode to locate hidden nodes and then slowly hovering to that location (as far as I know, you can't fly fast in scouter FPS mode) completely breaks the flow of effortlessly zipping around like a jet plane and beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of other people. I just hope that all the items that are found this way are merely consumables and I can just bypass looking for them altogether.The way the game ties the fighting and the customization and stat-building together is through a central hub. Here your character can buy new outfits, accessories, skills, consumables, and other stuff I didn't bother looking into yet. I'm not a huge fan of having outfits that provide stat boosts in a fighting game like this, since it limits my choice of customization. I would've much preferred some sort of non-aesthetic equippable that provided the same stat boosts instead to allow me to wear the clothes I wanted without worrying about optimizing my character for a specific fighting style.I can't really comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game, since I didn't try it out yet, but if I'm correct, I can join up with up to 2 of my friends online to tackle more difficult missions and punch some bodybuilders together. It's an beat-em-up style multiplayer experience I can get around. Also, if me and my friends get bored being carebears, we can just try to beat each other up with our self-inserts, or using other prominent characters in the series, like the other Dragon Ball Z games. Neat.As a person who doesn't really understand the Dragon Ball Z universe, do I recommend this game to friends? That depends. If I know that my friends are Dragon Ball Z fans? Sure, I recommend it if they aren't going to break the bank with the 40$ current price tag. For the 10 people out there that don't know anything about Dragon Ball Z? I have to make sure they like screaming, punching, and long trips to the barber."

But that's such a satisfying thing - you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, transform and then just send everyone to hell without breaking a sweat."
,Recommended,323470,18045675,"Posted: 15 September, 2015",all,Daniel Newgate,"One of the best Dragonball games i have played. I especially enjoy being able to create my own character, however i feel alot more could have been added to the editor. For example looking at the editors in Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Monster Hunter (3ds), and so many other games; it just feels like they didnt spend much time thinking about the freedom to create.The gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the Naruto games, this makes Xenoverse much better than the previous Dragonball games due to the characters being able to move and switch between opponents with ease.The story is extremely short but is well thought out. After the story its mostly grinding for exp and completing missions to unlock everthing, unlike the old Budokai Tenkaiichi games which revolved around the story telling it chapter by chapter in great detail. Xenoverse shows the story somewhat as you try to save the past and keep history on track. But there are many battles and characters missing. I just hope that any future games in the Dragonball series reflect on this as its a crucial point for Dragonball games to allow us the fun of playing through the adventures we all remember from the old Dragonball glory days. Just because Dragonball Super is ongoing doesn't mean you should forget the past ( except GT, just let it die).Overall it is still a very fun game to play, especially for big Dragonball fans, and i would reccomend buying it if you are indeed a big Dragonball fan."

I want to clarify that I had never played a DB game before but had always wanted to... WOW. This is a pretty fun game.Story: everybody should know almost everything there is to tell by now, but Xenoverse manages to keep it fresh by introducing the time travel elements.Gameplay: even though it can become a button masher fairly quickly, the customization offered for your character (skills, equipment, items) is quite extensive. You get to choose a race too, so if you want to be a Namekian or a Saiyan, or something else it's entirely up to you.Graphics: after tampering a little with my settings I found that the game can look pretty impressive, but it still has the restraints of being an anime based game. Still, this is the best looking Dragon Ball game up til now.Overall, I've had some good hours of fun (currently around 18 hours played), and even though some things can be improved I'm happy with what I got for the price.8/10"

Probably won't get the refund, but I still felt compelled ask. The first game on steam I've felt that way about.Can't really recommend this game. I'm a huge Dragon Ball fan at heart, have been since I was a kid. It had been so long since I played a Dragon Ball game that I figured it be worth a go. I watched and read a few reviews that held this game in high regards, so I thought I was in for a treat. Once I started playing I was genuinely having fun making my own character and helping the Z warriors throughout time. However the fun stopped shortly after that. One thing that is not really stressed enough in reviews is the amount of grinding and repeativenes in this game. Due to this I couldn't even finish the main story with enjoyment. I got to a point where the only way I could progress the story was repeating the same combos and using the same overpowered moves and that was just boring. The opponents become so powerful that by trying to fight them by any normal means was out of the question. After realizing that I decided to grind a little to level my character up to be better than my opponents. Only to then realize that to level up in a decent amount of time I would have to do higher level quests, only makes sense. The thing is these quest which were right at my character's level were so frustratingly difficult because the enemies were overpowering me and my computer allies, which were Beerus and SSG Goku. Freeza, Cell , and kid Buu were over powering Beerus, SSG Goku, and I to the point of ridiculousness. At that point I had to give it up. So I'm now done with this game."

However offline play works flawlessly.
76561198070927099,Recommended,323470,16592563,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,RoscoGriff,"Disappointed. As a long time Dragonball fan I had high hopes for this game. The reason I bought it was because I read that the Dragon Ball Online MMO beta was taken offline, to be replaced by this new project. This is nothing like it. I also hadn't played BT3 or Raging Blast for a while so wanted a DB fighting game fix. It serves really only as that. Anyway I expected something like the BT series, and although it is similar it isn't quite the same.Customization: It does take aspects of DBO in that you can choose different races. Character customization has alot to offer, although sometimes you do see alot of clones walking around, you be the judge. The character needs more specialization than just putting points into particular attributes. I remember being able to unlock special abilities in BT3 (for example immune to charge attacks etc..) and build characters with them as you would imagine them to be. Argueably this made those characters pretty OP which could be a problem for online, but we'll get to that.The controls are absolutely diabolical. The whole ctrl/alt thing to do supers and ultimates is frustraing. I ended up rebinding them to my naga mouse, so at least I use my thumb and can keep up with the game instead of having to stretch my fingers into some wierd position to be able to sit on WASD, Q, R, shift, ctrl, alt and space. This ""fast paced"" type of game is not designed for those types of keybinds.Graphics:Camera angles become a pain when you get put in a corner, or your enemy is directly above or below you, or you're in a small arena (eg. Frieza's ship). Basically the camera angles suck, except for when you are far away from your enemy in the middle of a field. Other than that the graphics are the same as I'd expect from any other Dragonball Game. It's interesting that they have some scenes where there is actual cartoon animation. Wish they'd have done that alot more instead of using the in-game animation.Gameplay:Plays like BT/RB series games, over the shoulder view. They've changed the way transformations work now. Super Saiyan is now more of a buff than a character change. Before if you transformed you'd have an entirely new moveset, whereas now you have the same moves, just more power.Has a fair bit of ""end game"" style content in the form of having to repeat missions in specific ways to unlock items. That I do like. The story missions seem pretty short, but it makes up for it by offering a diverse amount of ""parallel missions"" for you to do. You can do these parallel missions offline, or online co-op.Which brings me to online play:Hardly existent. Sure you can see players in the lobby, most of which are AFK. Now I'm not even going to sugar coat this one - the server this game is hosted on, is absolute dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is constantly lagging out, or just unavailable. When you go to do an online parallel mission, it takes way too long to search for a ""quick join"" match, and by the time you have actually found a match and you go to join, the lobby is full, kicking you out of the entire thing only to have to search again. Alternatively, people seem to not understand what ""private slots"" are, and you find a lobby only to be kicked out by the person that is hosting is and saving a place for his friend...Now lets talk about chat. There is none. Well there is.. but there isn't. Users can use some wierd ""auto text"" messages, which can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥when there is a 10 year old spamming the same auto text over and over again in the lobby, and all you can hear is the annoying sound that plays every time someone puts a message in chat.... and guess what?? It can't be turned off. Massive fail on that one.Don't ask about online battles, because I pretty much refuse to go near them. After playing online on BT2, BT3 and Raging Blast, I learned that online battle is not a test of someone's skill, it is a test of who can spam the most OP super and ultimate attacks. I will not be going anywhere near that♥♥♥♥♥♥..This game is a watered down, console based version of what could have been a very, very successful Dragonball MMO type game. I recommend it, but only because it's Dragonball. Apart from that, I'm pretty disappointed with the way it turned out."

Is it worth 50€ price tag you may ask?Depends if you are ready to grind so you can actually finish the storyline and DLC quests. Since you will be creating your very own custom character at the start of the game, you will also be leveling it up during your adventure.Besides the storyline there are lots of things you can do, like completing Paraller quests which unlock more skills and equipment for your custom made character. There is also option to help other players by teaming up on paraller quests or play against them on PvP but what i've heard it seems this game has some amount of cheaters and spammers.Pros+Lots of content+You can create your own character+You can become a student of famous Z-fighters and even some Villains+Most of the key characters are in the game (even some from GT)Cons- AI seems to be unfair at times (Enemies might block or completely evade ultimate attacks and take no damage at all)- Music sometimes stops while fighting and taking distance on enemies- Storyline writing and jokes characters make are terribleI rate this game 7/10, you might want to wait for sales until you buy this one though."

,Recommended,323470,14858223,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,Bashfluff,"You know what my favorite arc of Dragon Ball Z is? It's the Android/Cell Saga. Alternate timelines are my favorite part of any story. I picked up a PSP to play Shin Budokai - Another Road, because it featured my favorite DBZ character, Future Trunks, in an alternate timeline dealing with villains like Majin Buu. That's how you make an easy spinoff that isn't a rehash, I thought. Then I played the game and wondered how they managed to do one anyway.--Plot--Dragon Ball Xenoverse is unapologetically a rehash. You fight the same fights and follow the same DBZ storyline as a member of the Time Patrol! You create an original character and go back to fix events in the DBZ universe to how they're meant to go. Is it inaccurate to call it a rehash, then? Well, yes. Much of it has been removed.Maybe I'm being unfair. Some of it has been altered. Vegeta doesn't kill Nappa,  Ginyu switched bodies with your playable character, and Frieza transforms straight into his final form. Still, this doesn't change compared to what the cutscenes show you.  I want to fight two Oozaru at the same time! I want to fight alongside Goku in Vegeta's body as he fights the Ginyu force! Hell, why not have Goku die and have secondary characters rush to bring him back to life on Namek? There are so many possibilities, but the game bring any of that to the table. It doesn't even bring much of DBZ's plot to the table, either!When I say content has been removed, I meant it. Early DBZ games would bring you each and every fight from a certain character's perspective, but Xenoverse only puts you in particular sections of the timeline. So instead of fighting Nappa as Gohan, then as Piccolo, then as Goku, you fight him once. This gets particularly galling when you beat Frieza and then skip the entire Android saga.What? The entire saga? Why is it that you have less story content than fighting games that came out almost fifteen years ago, Xenoverse? The What If saga in Budokai Tenkaiichi 3 were better than this, and that was only a fun little aside.  So the game's plot doesn't reach its full potential. It's spread too thin and doesn't get up to much until the end. A great end, but the only time I felt invested in the story at all.,In short, it's bland and lazy.However the side missions provide a barrel of fun. You can fight alongside Raditz as any character you want to beat up Goku and Piccolo and Gohan. Help Guldo make the cut so that he can join the Ginyu force.  Play through the ♥♥♥♥ing Android Saga. There are nice little nods given through dialogue depending on which character you choose to fight as or have on your team, and more than once, I was surprised on the sheer amount of character interactions there. More than that, you can play them in online co-op, unlike the story!Not to mention, it covers everything and then some. Absolutely sublime.C--Gameplay--Did you ever wish that Battle of Z came out on the PC? You don't need to gather up the dragon balls for this one, because here it is. Its a button masher, but it's a hectic and fun one. Repetitive, but somehow never boring. You have quick access to a variety of super moves and ultimate attacks to have fun with, and the flashy displays never tire. However, the game fumbles this advantage with truly awful character customization, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai, and a nightmareish difficulty. Not to mention a variety of tiny niggles that make the game more frustrating than it ever has to be.You get to pick your own race, gender, height, and build, all which have a massive impact on your stats and playstyle. The game doesn't balance for any of them. Take Saiyans. I played as a male saiyan and took on the slew of baddies with basic melee attacks, but I soon found myself losing, because I was running out of help too fast. Turns out that my buddies had sat back and were just watching me get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked because I was being too aggressive for the AI to keep up. Then, I played as a female saiyan--a character with virtually no health and with punches as effective as a feather duster--and stood back firing super moves, and my AI partners kept knocking my opponents away from me. Of course, they didn't do much damage, so eventually the enemy would get tired of kicking their♥♥♥♥♥and appear right behind me for the K.O.Fantastic.The more you build up your character, the easier it tends to get, but the game pulls no punches--fairly or not. While your partners' AI tends to hang around useless unless you want to fly so far away that they have no choice but to fight, the enemy AI have no such reservations. You will get teamed up on by two or three characters at once and be left to do nothing but be stuck in an unbreakable combo and then die constantly.  It becomes the luck of the draw, trying to f get your partners to engage with an opponent so you can go attack the remaining one to go 1v1, the only even matchup. I suspect this difference in AI was made in order for the player to feel like they were completing missions and not their partners, but this was perhaps the worst way I've ever seen developers tackle this problem in a game.In the side quests, since they're meant to be played with multiple people, this problem doesn't even exist.Now, on to some nitpicky criticisms. DBZX wants to be an MMO, you see, and that means scattering everything around a hub town. Want to play a side mission? Go to one of the three areas, find the NPC, scroll down the list, then pick play. Don't worry if you forget, because after you complete a side mission, the game will throw you off somewhere in that area. You'll have it memorized by the end of the game.You're free to use items in story and side missions, but they don't stack and you can't put the same item in multiple slots. So if you unlock the MEGA HEALING CAPSULE, you can only use one of them per fight. If you want another healing item, you'll have to settle for THIS MAY HEAL 25% OF YOUR HEALTH BAR. DON'T YOU WISH YOU HADN'T PICKED A RACE WITH ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HEALTH CAPSULE. More than that, if you die, you're dead. No matter what the senzu capsule tells you, there's no way to revive after dying. That's only for the side missions. On top of that, items that heal your allies are the same deal. They'll only work in the side missions.Maybe you want to mix your own items? Best of ♥♥♥♥ing luck to you. Walk across the map to the mixing station. Look at the recipes--which you can find no where else--walk across the map to the item vendor to buy ingredients. Walk BACK across the map to the mixing station to mix. Or if you're not dumb, just pull out your Z wallet and buy healing items from the item vendor and don't bother.There's an excellent mentor system to teach you special moves and that provides real flavor to the text in the story, but potential mentors show up at random, two at a time, hidden somewhere in the city. Oh, and the game doesn't tell you the requirements to unlock certain mentors. Have fun. Also you can only level them fast in the side missions, because this game hates you.But the most damning sin of all is progression. Maybe, you, like me, think that after certain story fights, you'll unlock special energy moves in the skill shop so you can get more and more powerful. Budokai had a system like this, where after particular fights, the game would say, ""Bing, you've got a capsule! Here's what it is, how much energy it costs, the character who can use it, how rare it is, and its favorite food."" Instead, special moves only unlock after you complete an arc, and there are few of them to choose from.They're drops from the side missions only, and a few of the mentors only give you your ultimate in exhange for items in the side missions! Is that what you want us to play, developers? You seem to be ♥♥♥♥ing over the main story mode in favor of it left and right. In a word, yes. That's where you'll get your money's worth. Forget the main mode and do that.C+"

I say casual because the fights are generally you just fighting a hacker with infinite health, stamina, and ki. Until they install some kind of anti-cheating, I don't recommend trying to play much ranked multiplayer battles.The fighting style is less... punctional? I guess in comparison to dragonball z: bukakai tenchai 2 and 3. You are not able to do as many combos and the fighting system in my own opinion is much less complicated and streamlined in comparison. What really matters is the builds of the characters. Even the clothes that you are wearing can effect your stats and your combat style.Some of the cons that really stand out to me are the fact there is no diffuculty settings. In my own opinion I wish we had something like the COMs on the PS2 era games where you could turn up the level and have a challenge from the COMs. Here they are all the same difficulty and once you get used to the game its almost boring just repeatedly kicking the COMs butt in 1v1 battles.I wish you were able to have more options as well in the singleplayer battles. All you can do is 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3. You cant face a horde of Goku's by yourself, the teams have to be even which also lowers the difficulty.All in all its the storyline and side missions where this game shines,"

It's even weirder when the game also ranks you for performing well enough in a fight, yet this does next to nothing outside of giving you more money, XP and a shiny Z button to feel smug about. If you're going to grade people on how well they spam their Big Bangs and Spheres of Destruction, than why not just give them all the items listed on a Parallel Quest if they achieve Z rank?However, the potential is still there for Xenoverse 2 to take the runaway success of this Goku Simulator and truly make something corny and beautiful."
,Recommended,323470,15250422,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Mawndough,"The combat in this game is a lot of fun. I give it a 7/10 for the way it handles, though I have some minor nitpicks. Enemies tend to follow through with combos when you evade behind them, which often means you evaded for nothing. At least it feels that way for me. When an enemy falls to the ground, there doesn't seem to be a fast way to get to them to my knowledge. You can drop to the ground straight down, but if you need to approach them from a distance going down, it feels slower than going up or horizontal. I'm not sure why.The story is nothing to write home about. Probably a 6/10 for me. It goes through all of the DBZ sagas and puts them in a ""What If?"" scenario where the villains are made stronger by some outside force. Some of the encounters in the main storyline felt unfair if you try them immediately after unlocking them. You're sometimes pit against 3 enemies at once, and when going after one, the other two attack from behind and stagger, making it rare to complete a combo or use a super attack effectively. I later learned that I'm supposed to grind Parallel Quests and old story quests to level up for some fights.For instance, fighting against Frieza the first time, I was level 16 and getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. After gaining a few levels from re-rurunning older missions, I beat him at level 21.Another annoyance is that some enemies (most captain-y enemies like Ginyu or Vegeta) have a ki explosion that acts as a combo break. It hits in an AoE around them, does some damage, and makes them invincible for the duration of the animation. It wouldn't be too bad, but the animation for it is shorter than a quick attack. That also wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that these enemies have a habbit of spamming it any time you approach. I've had a fair share of fights against Ginyu where he used the break 4 times in a row. Sometimes they zoom up to you just to use the break. If you're not already guarding or far away, you're going to be hit by it.The way stats work is fine. Another 6/10 aspect for me. It's nothing special, but if you spread your points too thin you're going to have a hard time in the game. You generally want to focus on either strike supers or blast supers, then either your ability spam evades with stamina or spam supers with ki, then the rest into health and attack. You can respec in the game, but you need to gather the dragon balls which can take a few hours of grinding.The way you get abilities and gear in this game are garbage. 2/10, if even. When you complete a parallel quest, you have a chance at getting a piece of gear or super/ultimate attack (which supers/ultimates depends on which quest) when you defeat an enemy. You are not guaranteed anything. You can get duplicates of gear pieces, but once you learn an ability, you just have it. There's also a thing in these quests called Ultimate Finishes which trigger when certain criteria are met, like beating the mission within 5 minutes, or killing a certain enemy last. Some of these criteria have achanceto proc, and some gear/abilities have achanceto drop when that criteria is met.Example: You must beat 3 guys, then 2 guys, then 3 more guys, but leave a specific guy for last. There is a chance that he will go super saiyan. This happens maybe 10-20% of the time. When you beat his super saiyan form, he has a chance to drop the ability to go super saiyan for your character. I got him to go super saiyan probably 20 times, and did not drop it. Luckily, this is one of the abilities you can buy from the skill shop for a bunch of zeni once you progress far enough into the story, but this is not the case for the vast majority of abilities.Equipment stats are weird. You'll often get stuff that increases the damage your strike supers do, as well as your max ki and stamina, at the expense of your blast super damage. Meanwhile, other gear increases your blast super damage and health at the expense of your strike super damage and basic attack damage. Most of the early game clothes are zero-sum: +1 blast and health and -1 attack and strike. Later gear seems to start throwing it away for some play styles while keeping it in place for others. This is just an observation from the store clothes, as I haven't gotten a ton of quest gear drops.The game is a lot of fun at first, then you hit the first brick wall and have to grind a bit to beat it. Then you hit the next brick wall and do the same thing. Then you have a close call or two but nothing that can't be handled. Then the final boss is a joke that can't damage you if you're not blind. Then you've completed the story and aren't at the level cap yet so all you have left is to spam parallel quests to get to level cap and have a chance at gear and abilities until the next set of quests comes out. Overall a 6/10, no real desire to play too much more once the story has been beaten, unless of course I'm going to play with someone else."

It loses its fighter game elements into mmorpg elements in some aggravating ways. I love mmorps but this game takes most of the genre's mistakes; not its strengths. The mechanincs are very one dimentional, the dialogue is outright bad, and the voice acting is disgracefully out of tune with what's actually happening on screen. This is much less of a dragon ball fighting game and more of an mmorpg with dragon ball fighting game elements. I want to like this game SO BAD because it has so many great things going for it. There's a ton of content, the art is beautiful, and the level up system is outright perfect. That said online matches are full of exploits, the grinding levels are not designed with fair mechanics, the soundtrack almost never fits the mood of the scene, the engine is riddled with bugs, and the fights have no payoff whatsoever. In summary: it's fun to fly, punch stuff, and shoot beams. Just don't expect any sort of polish or excitement. Oh and if you want to enjoy most of the content you'll need several friends with the game and you'll all need to get a lot of dlc. You'd be much better off buying raging blast 2."

Also that season pass is just embarassing but to be expected of Scamco Badguy.I had a lot of fun with it though, but because of the previous statement I can't recommend it to others. I suggest waiting for some form of sequel, there's potential to extend the content and fill up the roster even more with some fan faves that were missing such as Zarbon, Frieza form 2 and 3, Imperfect and semi-perfect Cell, Cooler and Janemba.Also stats being tied to items is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.But some positives:Despite the 2 button combo system that is the same input for every character, everyone has a unique moveset which is quite cool for a roster this large.The game sounds great and if you take the time to disable some annoying modernisms like HDR and bloom you can enhance the game by adding texture filtering and anti-aliasing via Nvidia Control Panel / Catalyst to make it look great too.A better matchmaking concept than Monster Hunter............................ what the Hell Capcom how many years have you been working on your multi-player centric games?????????????????Also shoutout to Longcuck for not listening to me."
76561198068668598,Not Recommended,323470,14746196,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,Shinrai,"Right now I just can't recommend this game, as much as i would like to. The Idea of playing the DBZ Story with your very own (kinda)unique character is great. And the fights would be a lot of fun, if it weren't for the huge Problems this Game has.But first of, the good stuff:Pro:Great visuals with rather low system requirementsfast paced fightscreating your very own Avatartons of Skills to choose fromgreat and easy to learn controlscons:HORRIBLE Serversthe extremely jumpy difficulty(sometimes way ro easy but next mission is Dark Souls)buggy super Attacks, they sometimes vanish, enemys ignore them while standing right in the middle of them and other thingsway to much grinding for too little rewardLet me go more into detail about the cons here.1. The Servers are so bad that 90% of the time you can't even start the game. Either it never let's you play the Game (even the single player demands a server connection) or you get kicked out after a few minutes.  Getting into the game is the real challenge here, not the game itself. They said the fixed the Problems on 4.3.2015, but NOTHING has improved.2. The difficulty just doesn't know what it wants to be. One mission that SHOULD be hard is so easy you could almost do them half asleep and the nex mission in line is so hard it makes you wanna throw you controller/keyboard into the next grinder. I don't have a problem with high difficulty, the problem is more that there is no difficulty progression, just radomly unfair missions.3. The grinding. It wouldn't even be that bad if you could grind with a definite goal, which you can't since EVERYTHING in this game is random. It could take you dozens of runs and hours repeating the same mission over and over again just to get a specific Item/Skill. I's all just luck.As my closing words let me tell you, this game COULD be great. One of the best if not THE best DB game out there. But right now it's practically unplayable, has way too many frustrating missions and the AI is mostly as useless as a wet slice of toast. So, right now i would recommend waiting until they fix the servers and some of the rather big bugs. Until then, i recommend staying away from it for now.This review is subject to change, depending on the work the put into fixing the problems."

Some difficulties in different matches, the ranked mode is really challenging! I have to say many people are profession when it comes to this game.

Xenoverse 2 has fixed all of those issues, and added more combat features ex.Snap vanishing. Save your money, and buy Xenoverse 2.

I can post this review.The Dragon Ball Z saga has pretty much run itself ragged, as players can only throw a spirit bomb at Frieza so many times before the novelty wears off. But this game brings it to a whole other level, time travel and alterations to the original Dragonball timeline with wildly different outcomes? Is such an idea any good? Surprisingly, yes. Yes it is.The story goes like this (Ill try to not spoil stuff) Clearly, somebody is messing with continuity, in a manner that borders on illegal Dragon Ball Z fan-fiction. The wrong asses are being kicked, and there are chronal shenanigans afoot.And that’s where you come in.You can create your own Z-Warrior, or Namek or Majin or even a Frieza Race character all with different stats bonuses etc. So to keep things as short as I can. While Dragon Ball XenoVerse is still very much a fighting game at its core, said core now also boasts some RPG features and amazing customization! That’s not to say that this game isn’t without some problems, stemming from a various Japanese design. Some of these are cosmetic, but other times you’ll find yourself stuck in a corner thanks to an irritable camera, or having to grind your way through optional quests in order to survive a main quest.PROS :1 - the character customization and RPG elements are done great2 - the story is awesome and there are five races to choose from3 - The gameplay is smooth and fast + you get a 60fps and 4k resolution!4 - And compared to previous Dragon Ball Z games such as Burst Limit and Ultimate Tenkaichi, the combat is much, much bette though this is my personal oppinion5 - 3 vs 3 with friends !!!6 - The game also makes use of your own avatar while you’re offline, sending it randomly into parallel quests as an optional mini-boss, who can earn you some experience and other rewards when you’re not playing.7 - many other featuresCONS1 - sometimes camera can be a tad irritable2 - as well as the servers are irritable right now3 - The learning curve can also be a tad bit steep (especially for newcomers to the Budokai Tenkaichi DBZ games genre)4 - The AI, which makes your AI more worthless than Yamcha sometimes5 - Not really destructible enviorment, repairs itself etc.ConclusionBut sweet Shenron, is XenoVerse is a gorgeous game. Characters pop, battle scenes are truly epic and the action never skips a frame and characters look like they’ve been ripped straight out of the original comic books and anime series.There’s still plenty of room for improvement, but fans are going to find plenty to love with the latest chapter in this long-running saga that tells the same story but with a different spin. In my personal oppinion the best DBZ game that came out after Budokai Tenkaichi 3Deffinently a MUST buy for hardcore DBZ fans and a really good game to start of if you want to get in on the DBZ train!7.5 / 10"

I have loved DBZ for years now, and I have been through a few other really good dbz games.  Each one I wished I was able to create my own character.  Dragon ball xenoverse was the game to get to fulfill this wish.  Like amlost every other dbz fanboy, I wanted to become a freaking super saiyan.  So I play through the game, and I clocked over 150 hours.  And to be honest I had a lot of fun playing this game.  I eagerly got the season pass to collect all the new characters and new abilities.  But after the last DLC, I realized that this game, isn't good.  It isn't good at all.  Now I know what you're thinking, yes I liked the game, and I played it for a long time.  But the only reason I continued to play this game, is to make my super saiyan more and more powerful.  I looked over all the bad things and focused on the only good thing I found in this game.  After all the dlc was out and after I completed the game, got every character, this game is down right boring.  I only find myself playing this game for about 10 minutes at a time, because there is NOTHING else to do.  Yes I could restart the story with a new character, but that would be way to boring.  The story isn't memerable and I really don't feel like starting ALL over from the beginning, just to give me more playtime.  Now lets start with the story.  You are a hero wished in by the dragon balls to save the DBZ universe by traveling through time.  You get to be the hero of the crucial points in the story, which is cool.  But even when the ""Timeline"" is changed, it doesn't change all too much, so really I found each mission just a replayed version of the actual anime.  And the campaign is not easy.  I am a good player when it comes to fighting games, but this game freaking cheats.  Here is an example,  you are level five and you're new to all these controls, so instead of having easy to hard mission, it goes from hard to IMPOSSIBLE!!!  In one of the first missions you fight raddits.  Ok he wasn't bad, I died a few times, just figured it was being new.  So i grided a little more and went to the next mission.  This is where I got so frustrated.  It pinned you up against napa and vegeta, and sometimes they both decided to tag team you, completely ruining the mission.  This took me ten god damn tries to complete.  IT IS WAY TO HARD FOR NEWBIES.  Now this gets much much worse.  Eventually you reach a spot in the story where you have to fight BERUS and WHIS.  AT THE SAME TIME!!! This mission is impossible.  On your team you get a worthless trunks who runs in and gets himself killed, then you have to deal with two freaking gods.  Adding onto that, they love to spam their ultimate and murder you OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!  You are forced to get rid of all tactics and turn super saiyan and spam your super moves to kill these idiots.  Not to mention if you dont, you can barely break through their armor to stun them to prevent them from attacking.  So you throw one punch, and you get beaten sensless by two gods.  After I mastered the spam technique the rest of the game was a pushover.  It became way to easy.  finding that the ""Harder"" missions became easy when I went super saiyan and spammed my attacks.  ""but why didn't you fight regularly?"" because much like that other mission, you couldn't break through their god damn armor to do any real damage, making the mission impossible to complete.  It was a joke of a story, but it gets worse.  Let's start with the tournaments section, that doesn't exist.  Not once have I ever heard of the game actually hosting tournaments, EVER.  Ok so how about the online multiplayer.  That also sucks.  No matter how hard I look there are either one, and most of the time no one playing.  And even when you do find someone, the game either crashes and disconnects, or you can't fight because the lag is terrible and you can't do anything except hope that you hit him!!! Not to mention that 99% of the people who play online use the same super saiyan trick as they do in the campaign.  So basically, you can't win.  The only thing that you have left is the offline version of the game, playing by yourself or with your friend.  Oh and BTW even if you play with your friend, they can't get their personal character to fight you with, that's exclusive to only the ONLINE GOD DAMN MULTIPLAYER WHICH NEVER WORKS!!!! So most of the time you play this game by yourself destroying the crap A.I.  This is so boring, this is why I only play the game for about 10 minutes, it gets boring to fast.  Last but not least, the character selection.  You'd think that in a large game like this, there would be a ton of characters to choose from.  Well what you get is a ton of different skinned GOKU's to choose from, and a pathetic amount of other characters to choose from.  Why couldn't they have added more people?  It's not that difficult,  I found myself wanting to play these characters, and most of the time you only can if you mod the game.  Even the DLC characters are generic and boring.  THe only good one was the SSGSS dlc for goku and vegeta, adding yet another goku to the long selection you have.I love the DBZ universe dont get me wrong.  But this game is a pathetic example of the franchise and doesn't live up to the expections we deserve.My rating for this game is a 4 out of 10This game trys to hide all it's bad with the one good thing, the character creation.  And when I say character creation, I mean super saiyan creation, because that's all i see.  The story is bad, and could be impossible at times.  the multiplayer servers suck as well as the community.  And playing by yourself isn't fun in a fighting game.  You're supposed to fight your friends and have fun.  This isn't fun, this is boring, this is frustrating, this isn't good.  Unless you have a brother/sister + a console, dont get this game for the PC.  It's not worth it."

The smooth graphics and the storytelling are probably this games high points. The rest pretty much sucks unfortunally.  This game is plagued by poor design. You're unable to adjust game difficuty and some of the quests are really damn hard.  There are certain fights you cannot hope to beat legitly and must really on exploiting some glitch or cheap tactic.  This element really kills immersion.  The fighting isnt all that great either.  Super attacks rarely hit at all and when they do hit they do no damage.

Health, Ki (how many bars you have so you can do more super or ultimates attacks without needing to charge), Stamina (for dodging attacks and using evasive skill), Basic attack (punching), Strike Super (melee based super and ultimates), Ki Blast Super (enough said).Cons:-Though I don't find this a problem because some do I'll but since some do I will say about how the character doesn't talk but does hand and arm movements that other characters are somehow able to understand.-The devs can't seem to get the servers working properly-You connected to the server even when not playing in the Multi-lobby-The server is able to boot you from their single player lobby (can be gotten around if you disconnected from the internet at the main menu or starting the game while steam is in offline mode)-I hear that PvP is very much full of hackers and people who uses bugs or cowardly tactics-The item drop rate is to low I know it should be every time but still the drop rate is to low in this game-In PQ there are requirements to get an ultimate finish and some of those requirements are so darn annoying and the reason I bring this up is because even when meet the requirements the ultimate finish event may just not happen and if you combine this with the extremely low drop rates, well Good Luck getting anything that is an ultimate finish item.-Some of the Z souls are affected by Frame rates and I'm not just talking about how they made it so the ones that increase something do so by how many frames have passed but how some items won't work at higher frame rates.There are many things that could be much better in this game but what game doesn't have things wrong or others that could be better at least overall its a pretty good game but till the server problems are just about completely gone unless you're a big DBZ fan I would say hold off on getting it."

Even single player requires online, which causes lag spikes occasionally, and slow transistions.  Once I was able to play offline when the server was down, and there was a VERY noticable difference.Next the meat of the game is the PQ or Parallel Quests.  These are where you will battle and grind up, and try to get hidden objectives to unlock special fights.  While I don't mind grinding, these are esentially broken.  More then half the time, the hidden objective that you worked so hard to obtain will not activate.  No better rank, no better chance at items, just level end with you very upset.Last but not least is the production values of the game.  Some cutscenes have flubbed lines, your character has no speaking lines save for stock grunts and yells, and worst of all if you are playing a female character everyone referse to you as male.These qualms will probably never be fixed, so if you want to spare your time and money, I sadly would suggest letting this game pass."

A lot.But this game took a moment of my childhood and crushed it slowly over the course of two hours.When I saw this title go on sale during the sales I thought it was a golden opportunity to jump in and grab a title I had been waiting to play for some time.I have nothing but regrets.The game does what DBZ should do: large environments with plenty of ground and aerial combat, fast fighting and flashes of sound and fury as players jump from place to place. But was that enough?Dragonball Xenoverse sets you on a story as a new hero, a saviour pulled from the reaches of time and space by Shenron, the Earth dragon, to intervene in the villainry that is besieging the DBZ universe's timeways.That's when it started to fall apart for me. Like when you look at a magnificent piece of architecture and start to notice the small imperfections that ruin the larger image for you.The poor storyline butchered an already well established volume of canon through a time traveling story that was so convoluted that you wonder how anyone at Funimation could endorse it. Oh, that's right. Money...The voice acting was lousy, and the greatest moments in DBZ history were watered down to rough cuts of dialogue during the fight that had just begun.In all honesty I thought it would be like Burst Limit, but with a unique story arc and would retain the great moments in their entirety.I was wrong.If you have a fondness for DBZ and want to maintain that don't play this game."

,Recommended,323470,23238631,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,Captain Mack,"I beat this game after about 37 hours and I gotta say, it kicked♥♥♥♥♥ There were times when I felt like Vegeta, blinded by rage, and other times when I felt like Goku, just having fun in a tough fight. I think it's an awesome game and I feel like compared to other Dragon Ball games, it really captured what it's like to fight in their universe. It's not a side scrolling beat-em-up or a 2.5D figher, it's a fighter that exists on a full landscape in which you could possibly be figthting 5 enemies at once (an actual fight).I know some people didn't like it, but I thought the addition of custom characters really made this game. Personally speaking, when I play a game, I like to feel like I AM the character, I don't like feeling like I'm controlling a character. That's why I love games like Skyrim so much while disliking pretty much any MOBA ever made. I didn't feel like I was a coach watching Goku save the world while telling him how to do it. I felt like I was helping him in a fight he'd otherwise lose.Something else I thoroughly enjoyed was the Master system. The Master system basically let's you train under one of Dragon Ball's many character in exchange for their occasional assistance and skills. I trained under Vegeta and learned many of his signature moves that helped me a ton along the way. You can train under all of them over time which let's you rack up an awesome roster of cool skills. I enjoyed that a lot I thought it was an awesome addition.Now that's not to say this game was perfect either. As I said, this game took me about 37 hours to beat. However if I were to go back and start over from the beginning with my current stats and abilities, the game would probably take 3-4 hours to beat. This game suffers from what I think many many games suffer from. Using difficulty to increase the length of an otherwise contentless game. I know people have pretty much accepted that grinding is something you have to do in most modern RPGs, but I personally never fell for that. You wanna know why Skyrim is such a well-loved game? Because you can get 100+ hours out of it without having to do a lick of grinding because there's so much content. Dragon Ball doesn't have that. I spent most of the game grinding because between every chapter of the game there's a huge difficulty spike. That's not to say it's a bad game, but I would have much rather seen new story arcs or more parts to each chapter.Another issue I had was parallel quests. Parallel Quests are basically different variations of the actual storyline that you get to play for fun and rewards. But for me their main use was for grinding on something besides the plot. See when I was first learning about Parallel Quests I thought it was gonna be like the Dream Log from One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3. See in the Dream Log, you get to experience missions that would never happen in the actual storyline. Luffy and Doflamingo could be fighting to stop Ace and Nami from escaping Impel Down. Bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy stuff that is insanely fun. Instead I found that Parallel Quests were basically alternate timelines of the original Dragon Ball story. There are a few that are pretty crazy, like fighting off a bunch of Cell Juniors while searching for the dragonballs. And others like where I literally just did the final battle with Frieza but instead of Goku, it was me. Both games were made by Bandai Namco so I feel like they really missed an opportunity to do something similar to the Dream Log but instead I got Parallel Quests which are only fun the first few times, after that they're just grinding material.Overall, I think this game deserves a 7/10. Awesome fighting, Customizeable character. Too much grinding, not enough real content"

The graphics are beautiful, the fighting is flawless, fun, and really gets you into the fast-paced high power fighting that we all love, even on a keyboard and mouse (which is what I use) there are very little problems, and those problems can be fixed with rebinding keys if needed. The hub world is simple to navigate and, like the rest of the game, looks amazing. The story is great and the characters all feel very unique, giving any playstyle a chance to shine. The character creation is amazing and so much creative and cool things can be done with it. My only gripe with this game is that the difficulty shoots up very, very fast. To counter this you either need to throw yourself at the same level until you beat it, or you need to go grind off of side-quests for experience so that you can level up your stats, which can end up taking a long time. If you can get past this minor flaw, then Dragon Ball Xenoverse is an amazing addition to the Dragon Ball games, and deserves to played by any fan."

Tried resurfacing them, nothing. And yes, I had two, because one was a replacement for the broken first disc. So, wanting to play this game again, I turned to Steam. Was glad to see it on sale.Holy ♥♥♥♥ I've been having the best experience with it here on PC.Something's just... Different. It seems to challenge me, but every challenge is clearly beatable. On Xbox, it kinda got to a point where it was either a breeze or at an impasse due to difficulty spike. Here, it doesn't seem to be the case, and while I'm not sure why, I like the change. It handles well when you've remapped the controls to a scheme that humans can use, and it's a pretty good time. But so as not to be that long-winded, here's a list.PROS:+Aforementioned challenge+Character customizer, while limited, allows for neat results+It's just plain fun+Music's pretty good+Graphics fit pretty well with the Dragon Ball styleBut of course, the game has made some quite questionable decisions.CONS:-Some missions have, as mentioned, intense difficulty spikes, and the reason is usually because of non-flinching enemies-Some missions with crowds you have to fight can be easy, but are annoying nonethelessThat's all I can really think of. It's likely because I don't look too far into games beyond gameplay, because I'm a simple dude, but in any case, the two cons listed really can get to you if you're not of the temperament to handle them. But all in all, Xenoverse is a good, fun game that I definitely recommend picking up. Of course, the sequel's out too, and I've heard it made some pretty good changes, so I also look forward to getting that. But I digress. It's a good game for those who enjoy Dragon Ball fighting games, and I do, even if I'm not really a fan of the show itself (It has some interesting things about it, though, and don't get me wrong, I don't really hate it).In any case, I'm glad to have this game back, and I'm glad I'm getting out of it what I'm getting."

,Recommended,323470,23776263,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Big dick Bazuso,"So I've finally gotten around to reviewing probably one of the best Dragon Ball Z games to date. I have about 50 odd hours on the game and I'm working with a friend to 100% the game. Where to start really. It has a weird sort of MMO feel to it, where you can have people wandering around the main hub world and they can strike a conversation with you asking to fight etc.  One of the main selling points to the game though is the fact that you have an avatar, you get to design you're own character in the iconic Dragon Ball style. This immerses you in the story and gameplay more as it actually feels like you're taking part in the fights and you're not just a puppet master for the other games characters.Speaking of which there is a ton of playable characters, most of them having alternate ""Costumes"". These costumes change the look of the character, the moveset and the stats. With this it feels new and refreshing every time you fight someone, whether it be an NPC or another player. The movesets are massivley diverse, consisting of powerful Ki blasts and devestating Strike attakcs. The customizability of your avatar is insane, you have the initial character creation at the start, you gain 3 skill points every time you level up which you can put into Health, Ki, Stamina,  Basic Attack, Strike Supers and Ki Blast Supers. The main thing that you're going to pay attention to though with said stats are the bonuses you get from different pieces of equipment. You can buy different clothes for you avatar to change your look but mainly to give you different boosts in some of your stats. You can also buy accessories to add some vanity to your avatar. The main meat of the game is it's gameplay. It plays very similarly to Battle of Z. Now I know that wasn't the best Dragon Ball game but the combat in this game fixes everything that Battle of Z did wrong. You fight in a sort of open arena, not being constricted to the traditional 2D fighting plane that most fighting games have. The actual combat itself is a bit dull and repetetive however. You only have 3 real buttons to fight with, Light attack, Heavy attack and Ki Blasts. You have your super moves though aswell as these 3 different types of attacking. It's a bit dull but it's simple and the Super moves are the main thing that make it fun. The Super moves and equipment can either be dropped by completing certain missions in the games side quests or buying them for in game money at the games stores. This money is super easy to get, you get thousands of said currency for finishing any mission in the game, whether that be main story or side quest. Speaking of story, it's surprisingly good. It's an original story that explores the ""What If?"" scenarios of the series. Alot of the story follows the plot of the actual Z series with a few twists and changes here and there. The last few acts are where things go off the wall with the ""What If?"" plot element. The game also has a few DLC packs, adding costumes, accessories, story missions, side quests and playable characters. They're decently priced on their own but you can also buy the season pass at just a lower price and get all of them instantly. I've touched a bit on the controls but overall they're pretty standard. Really well done for the PC port though, but I prefer to play with a PS4 controller because I'm a peasent.A bit off topic though but one of the most impressive things about this game is after over a year of frequent playing it i've only encountered one glitch that wasn't network based. Me and Vegeta somehow ended up inside one of the mountaisn in the Mountain stage in the Eternal Rival quest. He clipped through somehow and cause I was targeting him while my friend was targeting Goku the game somehow clipped me into the mountain too. I beat Vegeta and Goku tried to fly into the Mountain to try and get to me. I was really surprised that it took over a year for my first real glitch to happen, This game is honestly really well made. This is the jist of this review honestly. It's a damn good game, really well made and there's barley any down sides to the game. I fully reccommend getting it since it's on sale at the moment."

Where it falls short are it's combo systems, lack of characters that are nessicary for the story but including those not even really needed. The GT portion of the game is also unneeded (and we all know why) and the games combat gets repitive. Grinding quests to level up your character got old very quick. However the game is worth the buy overall, and I'm sure most DBZ fans can get a kick out of this."

The fighting is fun and while the input for combos on everyone are the same; the presentation and animations vary greatly.

And its always fun to make a new character with a different race and make a new build to see what you can come up with. Obviously this game wont appeal to people who aren't already fans of Dragonball. This game is NOT a good fighting game with Dragonball as the theme. Its a semi fighting game thats also a semi dragonball simulator. Definitely a must buy for Dragonball fans. Its presentation and gameplay its just good enough and enjoyable enough to keep bringing you back. Although its not as technical or challenging as something like Budokai 3 or Burst Limit; its definitely in my top 3 all time favorite Dragonball games.Now, on to the negatives...PVP is literally busted. Yes yes, Z-souls are busted, a lot of them have been nerfed or fixed but Z-souls made PVPing absolutely terrible in the first weeks. But what also makes it busted are things like the Stamina Drain or Blue Hurricane or SSJ players who as soon as the match starts, charge up, go SSJ and start spamming you to death with ultimates. Most of these people also put 100 points in ki blast and ki energy. There are ways to stop this, but its extremely annoying when coupled with the fact that some people are extremely laggy and you cannot stun them or break their guards. I had one match where I constantly dash charged my opponent to get a combo going and they werent stopped once or took any damage. But they were able to land every single hit on me and crush me. Lord help you if you try to do a 2 on 2 PVP battle and one of them is an Ultimate Ki spammer. Or even both. Anything more than 1 on 1s with people you don't know is a bad idea, unless you're very organized with a friend who can play a specific playstyle while you use a different one.  But honestly, PVP just feels like more of a chore than it feels like just having fun. Another negative aspect to this game is RNG. Everyone on the forums will tell you just how awful (or for some wonderful) it is. You could grind your heart out for hours on end for Ultra Fighting Bomber and it will never be guaranteed that you will get it regardless of achieving all the hidden assignments/goals. Its all random but your chances are somewhat higher when you play online with other people.I already made a review on this but next is DLC. The first pack is terrible, its about 30 minutes of content and 3 PQs to grind... for weak stuff like the Devilman outfit? Like who really was aching for the Devilman outfit to be in this game? As DLC? It would have been fine if it were in the vanilla game but this trivial stuff theyre including in their DLC is lame. Not worth 10 dollars at all and the coming DLC also does not seem worth full price. But thats what happens when you buy a Japanese developed game: The studio doesn't listen to what the community wants they just pre package DLC and release it as time goes on. They really need to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together when it comes to ""DLC"" as they call it. Because their definition is very jaded to what would normally contest as DLC.Overall, if you disregard PVP in its current state; this game is probably a strong 8/10. With it, its a 7 or even 6/10. Its kinda funny to see so many people say PVP is the end game. Well its a pretty terrible end game if all PVP consist of is who can out stamina or out ki blast spam you. Customization could be better, I'm fairly displeased with the fact that going super saiyan, your hair is the exact same as your base form but just golden now. Also the lack of certain Saiyan hair styles. (Vegetas, Cell Saga Trunks [the pony tail], Gokus instead of a wig, Gohan, Broly, Paragus, Goten, Trunks). Also disappointed to find that no other race besides saiyans were balanced to get special transformations. Xenoverse is like the blueprint to a dream Dragonball Simulator game. You will get hints and touches of what it could truly be but for a first attempt its valiant. This is the first Dragonball game I was excited to be released and greatly followed its progress and development. I'm one of those guys who only really liked the classic side view 3D fighters... The original budokai games, Shin Budokai and Burst Limit. So I took a risk with this, a risk I hadn't taken on Dragonball games in a long time because I was constantly disappointed with the direction they were taking the fighting games, starting with Tenkaichi.Ultimately: Buy it if you like Dragonball, but don't PVP."

You spend a few days levelling up your guy to 80 because thats the only way youll hold your weight only to combat someone using a regeneration z soul.The way the people go about the match is this, they punch you and then run away for the entire match while regenerating health and dont actually ever fight.

You will end up using always the same combos. The game is more a big MMORPG, with a not so good battle system. But what is worse, the thing I hate the most are DLC. Is always nice to see more content, but they are too expensive, considering that they give you characters already presenti in game (GT pack 2) .

There is always an obvious best combo to spam, and you can only assign up to 4 abilities. The way stats are allocated makes it to where all your abilities should have one focus in mind (all meelee, all Ki etc). There is no character in the DBZ universe that has ever just fought with exclusively Ki or exclusively meelee. It is incredibly detrimental to the experience. I played all the budokai and tenkaichi games amoung a few other DBZ fighting games, and I feel this game is the weakest of them all. Not a single ounce of fun was had for me.You have to grind for hours just to unlock one of hundreds of abilities. You have to grind for hours to level up.The game was obviously made with co op in mind. I can't imagine having any fun with this game playing solo. Despite that, the co op combat is a mess. Someone meeleeing an enemy will make it very difficult to do anything. I feel like they designed their whole idea for leveling and character development with co operating and competeing with friends in mind, then completely neglected to come up with an optimal combat system for this gameplay."

I wanna god Damn refund this game should have been free cause it's a joke of a game.  No wonder hardly anyone plays this game anymore.  Funny how many people bought this before launch myself included thinking it was gonna be the best dragonball game so far.  What a let down,  give my money back or so I can only wish lol.  Everything Dragonball is a joke anymore ever since they got in trouble for making dragonball and dragonball z and gt of showing off to much of a joke reason for anyone to get in trouble by.  What happened to dragonball z the original day's?  Inleast I was 12 to 14 when I watched both on cartoon network and wasn't scared of it one bit but enjoying it so god damn much.  I hope Dragonball super rots in hell and comes up with a better villain than a purple cat or dog villain that if he eats pudding or other tasty food than he won't blow up a planet so childish, what are we 2?  Second worst villain is freeza coming back to life as if we haven't seen him enough in dragonball z already, but freeza with 24k gold?!  What are we making anime wise anymore?  Who the hell would make a villain look like 24k gold and not put any effort into making him look better?  Idk maybe this is only me blabbing but I feel like what's his name?  The writer who wrote dragonball, dragonball z,gt,super has gotten lazy writing dragonball ever since the gt saga that supposedly people claim he wrote part of that story himself.  Dragonball is lost and gone for the good old days fans.  Give up hoping it will come back cause it won't.  Dragonball super has the same villians beerus and golden freeza from both the movies they made.  They are only adding more scenes to make both 2 movies as if they had 9 hours added onto both of them or however many episodes they will make Dragonball super.  But yeah Dragonball is a joke since dragonball and dragonball z were the only two series to truly keep you glued to the screen and then they just stopped airing it due to that stupid what's his name writer.  The writer must of had a screw loose because who would go write another manga and maybe manga's and yet they turned out less popular and then come back and almost force yourself to write it for the fans to try and make some decent cash but rushing his used to be good thoughts of a series that used to be better then any anime even nowadays now falls below them, how sad though truly.  So many people are stupid and anoying and make the most what the ♥♥♥♥ choices and yes they are truly baka dumb bunnies.  Enough typed just anoyed at what the hell happened to such  great series to fall this far since I still rewatch dragonball and dragonball z even today onkissanime.comI can see that gt isn't as good, super so far is just alright but not much new since the movies came out first and if most of us that watched both movies spoils this t.v. show since the stupid dragonball super is the same plot and villians from the movie I mean who the ♥♥♥♥ decided to make the plot and villains the same as the 2 new dragonball super movies and release the movies awhile before the t.v. show was even announced.

,Not Recommended,323470,24470924,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,PinkPony,"Having played most, if not all of the PS2-era DBZ games and Sparkling, I must say I'm very disappointed with this one. It lacks all the energy and speed that the earlier Budokai games had, with you mashing out the same basic combos over and over, leaving you to punch, knock away, follow, and repeat over and over. You can get strung into a unblockable (once one hits) flurry of staggering ki attacks, and if you're versus more than one person at a time, you might as well turn the game off. The locking-on is abysmal, and I've lost matches purely because I wasn't able to target the person I needed to. And let's not forget that when you teleport behind an enemy doing an energy attack to avoid it--assuming your block/teleport button works, which it doesn't always-- you will still be hit for full damage by a forward-firing beam despite being 180 degrees behind them.The game's tutorial--given to you after no less than three full fights, which feel awful because you don't know what you're doing--is so bare-bones that it doesn't even explain basic mechanics like deflecting ki, requiring almost immediate reference to player-written guides, which is proof of incredibly bad design.Running around the hub-world is boring, the Parellel Quests are already getting repetitive after 6 or so, the graphics have that ugly GT gloss that the series now always seems to have, and while I chose not to buy it myself--the DLC is a disappointing rip-off. More time seems to have been put into the customisation than the fighting mechanics, which I could understand if this were some lavish MMO, but this is a game I will be playing solo, and for 'that' it feels hollow. Speaking of MMO design, all items rely on RNG drops and grinding the same levels over and over again, and progression in the main story REQUIRES grinding for XP in patrol missions, which is the definition of lazy pacing and length-padding.This is a game with a good concept and bad execution. Most of the new voice actors are fine, but so far Trunks, Frieza and Cell all stand out as being completely terrible.EDIT: This game has unskippable cut-scene, such as entries or revivals, which halt gameplay - but not pause it. If you were in the middle of something, it will be as if you just stopped playing, and any special attacks will be cancelled. Get into a fight where lots of people come in? (like the final Captain Ginyu training mission) You won't get a single special attack out, and you'll waste all your ki because of these cutscenes. I lost two ultimates in a row because someone entered after I started it. Absolute garbage. This game needs to stop pretending like it's a real fighting game but giving ever item stats too - I want to customise my character, but I'm locked into a certain set of clothes because of my build. Same thing for alternate costumes on main characters.There is also no option to retry a mission if you fail. You must endure the failure, listen to a character tell you you're♥♥♥♥♥♥ go back to the hub world and manually start the mission all over again. ALSO, all dialogue refers to you as a male, regardless of the gender of your character, and the single-player missions always refer to you as if you were part of a group, though you cannot co-op for the main story, as far as I know. There are also really botched translations in parts, and bizzare moments when your custom character speaks to others but makes no sound - which you might consider standard, but your selected voice speaks attack names, so why not the odd scentence too?

I spent 80$ on the special they had going could not get it going on my laptop with a i5 clocked at 2.4ghz 12gb ram and intel 3000 gpu and yes the gpu does bottle neck but i can play many many games on lowest settings and they'll run smooth like butter. But on the second day of owning this i immediatly returned and did not receieve a refund until 3 months later. Besides the fact of lame customer service they could'nt add the whole DBZ story as they would in the boudakai series and the physics are buggy on an actual gaming computer with the latest top model amd card and a quad core i7 the animation made it appear as if the floor was sliding under the characters feet as opposed to the character walking upon it. So imo its not even close to a 50$ game so 80$ was a bad joke and paying it was my ignorent mistake but i feel for the DBZ name and the ""create your own character system."" Which feels like a generic K-RPG with a huge budget. lol. I love allll DBZ games even the early nes ones but this felt like a fluke.

If you're not a dragon ball fan I'm not sure you'll enjoy it, especially considering the connectivity issues.The main highlights of the game are the constant 60 fps, the fun gameplay, the colorful style, and the way it gives that Dragon Ball feelingAs I'm writing this the servers still aren't functioning properly, so I can't really include information about the online mode. Almost all my playthough was made offline. Took me about 30 hours or so to finish the main story plus some side missions and a bit of grinding.The bad:- Mediocre graphics- Balance issues- Issue with the vanish command- Extremely bad connectivity (currently)- Many characters are missing (Frieza 2nd and 3rd form, Yajirobe, Tapion, etc.)- Files are right there on your computer... seriously, what?- Grinding can get annoying- There's a weird learning curveThe good:- Silky smooth 60 fps no matter what- Responsive controls- Captures that Dragon Ball feel- Stylish, colorful graphics- Fun combats - this is the most important point. Combat is addicting as hell- Plenty of battles, quests, masters, secrets, clothes... plenty of content- Fun, engaging story- Supreme loli of time- Some missions are actually difficult. There is a sense of accomplishment when you finish some of them- One scene at the end gave me chills. If you love Dragon Ball you WILL love this game"

For as easy as it is to land energy attacks and for as difficult as it is to land strike moves the amount of damage is vast. That and when you get missions to have to defeat 3+ enemies while protecting someone and you cant do a damn thing because they all run away and fire tiny little blast to basically lock you down and interupt every little thing you do...its really freaking annoying. and its just one enemy that does it, its all of them.  yo are sitting there in a timed mission to kill one guy and all the computer does is run away. and if you do catch up to him as a striker they can constantly spam an aoe blast back to give them even more time to run away.  For as much as i actually like the playstyle. i dont recommend this game to anyone. theirs some serious balance issues. and for all the talk of multiplayer (if it ever works) you cant even have your friends assist you on some difficult missions. or have fun in storyline with others.

The drops are RNG and the events that procure the drops are RNG too. Prepare to play a mission over and over again for literally hours before getting the drop you wanted (which is even worse with clothing since you only get pieces of the outfit listed in the mission rewards every time you get the drop). Drops include transformations, super & ultimate attacks, buffs, clothing, and healing items (yes, healing items. you get what type of game this is now?).Do not choose any character other than a Saiyan because SSJ is the only useful transformation. Kaioken 1 and X3 are absolutely useless and while X20 gives you unlimited stamina it runs out too fast. With SSJ you can stay in it the whole match since you can charge it back up limitlessly, and you can spam ULTIMATE ATTACKS (that's right, not just supers, but ULTIMATES).You just want to do exhibition matches with the canon characters? Well, first off you can only do local multi on the World Tournament stage. Second, you have to unlock all the characters through story mode. In which you have to grind the side missions excessantly if you even want to have a chance to beat bosses. Plus, you have to gather the 7 dragonballs 3 times to unlock SSJ4 Gogeta, Super 17, and Omega Shinron. To do this, you have to play certain stages that have Time patroller enemies in them.

There are so many small things about this game that just make the experiance not fun. Many of the fights are unfair and require you to pull of secondary objectives that are impossible because your team ai is garbage. The RNG this game has is astoundingly horrible, where you are not garaunteed to get any item for doing a parallel quest nor are you garaunteed to get the secret fight of a PQ even if you fufill the requirments that triggers the event. The hub world is flat and boring and far too big for you not to be able to at least sprint. You can't even teleport to a specific place and must instead jog to the places you need to go. If you want to reset your skills well I hope you're ready for a grind fest because the only way to reset your skills is by using a wish from the 7 dragon balls. You get the dragon balls by beating ai controlled player avatars in certian missions but they arent garaunteed to show up and if they do they may or may not give you a dragon ball for beating them.

,Recommended,323470,14780227,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,Nanny,"Before I get to the actual review, I want to say that I don't recommend this game as a must have. It is deeply flawed but I do enjoy the game despite its flaws so I do ""recommend"" it. However, $50 is too pricey for a game like his.Some more details are at the end.Pros:-Dragon Ball that is not 1v1- Lots of moves-Not too simplifiedCons:- Graphics- 1 accessory slot- Deadly Tokitoki city- jerky controls- only 4 super moves and 4 ultimate attacks can be equipped- (no weaponry)- voice acting- no varied movesetsGraphics and Tokitoki CityThe graphics are much too simple. Its not a problem with cel-shading. The city is much too big and too little detail. It resembles a game in its early stages. Some characters move around, most others just stand there. Its pretty much a dead city. Not lively, not full of much detail.I understand some of the rationale behind making a static city but to me, it comes off as poor design and laziness.  If the cel-shading doesn't allow for intricate details, then make this more compact. Giving too much space to move in a matrix-like emptiness isn't fun or atmospheric.1 Accessory Slot/equipmentI know this isn't tekken but still, one of the selling points of DB:Xenoverse was its character customization. Character creation was a little lackluster but I'm not complaining about that. The accessories however, is a different story.Accessories include decoractive swords and caps. I haven't unlocked any other types but I imagine that there could and should be more accessory types.Is it that difficult to have an accessory slot for different parts of the body? They already have 4 seperate equipment slots for the torso, legs, hands and feet so I don't see how an accessory slot for the head and back will make much of a difference.One could argue that excess accessories could overpower the player (equipment have stat boosts and debuffs) but that can be easily solved by removing stat bonuses for the accessories.Besides, I haven't had an accessory that boosted stats yet anyways.Jerky/Irresponsive Controls (Keyboard user problems but some aren'tkeyboard only)I'm writin this as a keyboard user. I've played many other combat/action games and one game that has a similar attack scheme was Dynasty Warriors. The attacks in Dynasty Warrior seemed to flow nicely but the normal attacks in DB seemed to be very stiff and rigid as if it were in early stages of programming.Its hard to put it into words but trust me, the attack flow in DB:Xenoverse could usea lotof improvement.I have two examples.One is pulling out during an attack. Every animation in DB:X has to be completed in its full cycle unless interrupted by an enemy attack. This is reasonable for a few attacks like Double Sunday or Galick Gun but for normal attacks, this comes off as poor design.Another one is some irresponsiveness in chaining normal attacks with supers. I'd try to use Meteor Crash (a super move) a few times and it just takes seconds before the game registers the ctrl key, leaving me vulnerable for those few seconds. Sometimes it would register the ctrl key but it won't register the mouse click. Do I click too fast? No. I click after the ctrl key registers and after the buttons say that I can use that super but nothing happens.Only 4 super movesRestricting 4 super moves is very restrictive. And it makes for a less interesting battle than it could be if more super moves could be equipped.First off, normal attacks are all the same for any created character of the same race. There is no learning new normal attacks or new normal chain attacks which means that if you enter the a battle without using any ability, all the battles will have the same look.I understand that the game was designed around a console controller but even with the console controller, they could have had 2 skill sets of 4 for skill swapping during battle. Not that difficult. I've seen other older games do it. A control scheme would not impede gameplay like some people think.I'm a keyboard user and I still think that the game could use an extra button for swapping skill sets in the middle of battle.The only thing that would hold this design back is whoever does the programming for this game. As I said earlier, key responsiveness is poor and whoever did the programming for that did a poor job.Voice ActingDBZ voice acting has always had poor acting in my opinion. But I feel like they use that as a selling point. They all sound like uneducated rednecks.Hey, the voice acting is the same as the anime but they could have tried to move forward instead of keeping the same voices. Most of the viewers are no longer children. No need to entertain us usng poor voice acting.No Weaponry/Extra movesetsThe problem here isn't about not using weapons as much as learning moves from other charactersOne of the features in this game is having a master who will occasionally offer missions to the character for new moves. But in DB:X, the only customizable moves are supers and ultimates.Normal attacks do grow boring after a while since the order pan out the same way.Not using a sword isn't a killer but I've always wanted to have a Trunks character who can use the sword or something. DBZ had only a few characters with weaponry but weaponry was still there. Its not like the weapons have to have stats or anything. Its about the movesets.Again, I enjoyed the game but I feel that the game is deeply flawed. Buy it when it hits the bargain bin though since its definitely worth somwhere around $20-$40"

I've been a dbz fan since i was in my early teens and im 28 now, i've played almost all the games that came out on console so sure enough i was waiting for this one to come out. I bought it pre-order on steam (a gold and silver costume and ssj4 vegeta big whoop) but anyways i played thru the game got to level 30 and was finally able to buy Ssj skill from the store for 40k in game currency.So here i am being like YAY I CAN GO SSJ now!!! so the excitement is there most deffinetley however,,,I equip the skill and rush off to do a parrallel quest, as soon i get in i power up and unleash the kraken if you will...The skill goes off and a very short cutscene on your screen of your characters becoming ssj happens, 1-2 seconds longthen the horrible dissapointments begin...First thing i noticed right away was my hair turned golden ""check"" i had a gold aura ""check"" ok good so far...spikey hair since my normal state was the ""android 17 looking one"" which i would expect to look like future trunks when ssj right?NOPE! NOTHING!!! my hair stayed exactly the same all it did was turn gold! this never happend in the show and all saiyans got spikey hair when going ssj! I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at this! ultimate tenkaichi did it no problem...What could possibly be their excuse to leave ssj tranformations on our characters in such a lazy state!its like telling a FPS fan to play old school rainbow six on nintendo 64 where there was no gun on screen or animation when you fired only the sound (which was horrible to begin with) and seeing bullets hit where you aim...imagine CoD game coming out where all you did was see your aiming reticle but no gun in the corner...there was absolutely no reason to make this game this way and ontop of no spikey hair thats not even all the shortcummings of ""Super-Saiyan"" which the entire game is all about is the saiyan race...aside from only a hair dye job, being in ssj drains your ki REDICULOUSLY fast!!! I tested the numbers and i got 1 ki bar every 7 seconds i had 4 bars so i can be ssj for 28 seconds... holy cow!!! wtf!first episode goku went ssj he stayed ssj for the entire frezia fight and then some! but 28 seconds... sure... the people paying $50 wont mind right?Also i did not see any dmg increase what so ever from being ssj i did the same dmg as if i was normal... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t yet againNow there was one perk which was pretty stupid and unrealistic if you ask me was when ssj, you lose no ki from doing super attacks so spam away! ya cause theres episodes from dbz when goku just stood there doing kamehameha waves over and over again... I only remember gohan doing that in the saiyan saga and he fired several masenkos trying to hit his opponent and gohan wasnt ssj for that...Its a video game it needs game elements... it needs race balancing for the pvp... you could say those things sure but the fact remains that SSJ is a HUGE power difference in the show and a INSTANT game changer unless your facing seriously powerful foes,  most cases ssj 1 was seen as a 15x stronger form then normal state, if i saw my self in game doing 15x more dmg from simple punches then ya i would deff feel like i went ssj but come on that would make fights so easy it wouldnt be fun anymore...Well thats why goku wouldnt use ssj unless he was getting his♥♥♥♥♥beat and needs to be on par with his enemy...thats how goku saw using the tranformation as, a tactical advantage if he needs to fight stronger opponents...Every hardcore dbz fan knows that as far as the real power of a ssj transformation being portraid in a game correctly, was only done so few times you could count them on one hand...Its just a real shame that fans are paying $50 dollars for a watered down ssj form that imho isnt even worth using...If i was developing the game i would lower the ki drain to maybe 1 bar every 1-2 minutes and remove the no ki drain from special attacks, once its done draining all your ki then it would start draining your stamina and after no stamina you would revert...What i would do to simulate ssj in this game is ssj 1 would add an additional overlapping health bar over your previous and if you took dmg befor going ssj then the overlapping bar would have that amount missing to reflect that...As far as the ki any players that played the rpg games on gameboy advance would recognize the ki bar that overlaps the original and the new bar is the ssj energy and it slowly drains and when spent you would revert, they can show this bar and your orig ki bar would drain from using specials but would not effect the ""ssj bar""If players continued to fire energy attacks after having no Ki then it would drastically drain the ssj bar...this would balance out the toughness and energy boost when going ssj, as far as the harder punches i could only suggest either a 50% inc from your normal punches or some sort of stat boost to the players basic/strength and ki attack valuesLast thing would be a cooldown for going ssj again if you powerd down or had to revert, maybe 60 seconds or so maybe longer.As for ssj 2 all you would need is to increase the % or stats for the dmg you deal ontop of the ssj values and add a diff looking ""Ssj bar"" or you would see the ssj bar charge then another ssj bar ontop of that, losing to much power could then force a revert to ssj 1 or just revert completely.Same steps for any ssj 3 and so on but imho ssj 3 would have to have a much faster drain to maintain since thats how it was in the show, and everyone knows ssj 4 is its own transformation and is not an advancement from how ssj 1 works, it was a combination of ssj power and the Oozaru form being combines and then somehow reverting back to normal size after being Oozaru...ssj 1 and 2 is all i would really need for a custom character since i dont really care for 3 or 4 but thats just me, if the dev's want to make those forms avail to saiyan players thats their callHowever as the game is now I dont really see any change from going ssj other then being able to spam beam attacks and such until the few seconds go by and i revert...Alot of people are saying that they have to many playable races and costume pieces to deal with and didnt have time to make ssj hairs for all the hair styles, but to me that sounds like a weak excuse when Ult Tenkaichi did it no problem"

,Not Recommended,323470,14745358,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,Retterkl,"At the time of writing I have 9 hours played on this game, and I think it is important to capture the feeling around 10 hours of gameplay as many people may only be asking for this much time from a game. I'm going to also preface this review with the fact that I am a massive Dragonball Z fan and have not owned another DBZ game, though I have played a couple.Pros:-The game is very stylistically in keeping with DBZ and it transitions a 2D anime into a 3D playable game very well. I think that all the attacks look great, and the scenery is pretty nice.-The story is an interesting take to a very cemented series. Adding in behind the scenes villains allows everyone to play out their favourite fights from the series while also giving new circumstances.-Once you've figured out combat you can have a good deal of fun with it. It's pretty satisfying landing a Gallick Gun on 2-3 enemies at once and seeing them fry.-The game has a lot of potential for online capabilities and a succesful competitive scene. Also there is room for lots of DLC.-Movement is very smooth, I have always though it would be difficult to implement DBZ style flying into a game but the boost system is calibrated perfectly.Cons:-The combat is too repetitive for the difficult nature of the game. That is to say that the game is naturally hard to complete story missions without grinding your character up, and to grind your character up you have to play story missions already available to you. There's not enough varience in combat to keep this all interesting, and fights often play out the same which can get very boring if you have to keep retrying levels.-The menu level (i.e. TokiToki City) is just pointless and long. Having to physically run to a loading screen to have access to the shops is thoroughly pointless. It feels as if the developers are trying to make it into an open-world RPG but there's only one of each shop (item, clothing, accessory) so that falls flat. I would rather have that space allocated for something more interesting and put the shops in the menu.-All story and mission oriented features are weighed down heavily by clunky and outdated UI stylings. This feels like lazyness on the animators part, they could quite easily (just for the main storyline) put everything into cutscenes which would then play out like the anime, the reason why the majority of people have bought this game. Instead you have to sit reading bland text that doesn't even auto-finish, you literally have to press a button to get the next sentence. It doesn't even have a roundup (what I mean is a game like Skyrim you could skip every word of a conversation and be told what to do next in your journal, in this you are forced to read to know what's going on).-I don't know what's going on with multiplayer but they seem to have the slowest servers. Searching for a match takes an age and so far I've only managed to join two games, one was a co-op parallel quest which played out great and the other was a vs match which was laggy. I put in the pros that it has potential, which is certainly does, but right now it looks like a mess.-The game needs more flavour to battles. The choice it gives you at the start is 'do you like to be up close punching or at the back with Ki attacks', but surely you could add in at least one more choice? Unless using your specials (granted you can do it a lot if you just land a few punches) Ki blasts consist of weak short bursts that go in straight lines, not exactly the most riveting part of the game. They're only really effective for staying back if you've got someone else on your team holding the enemy still. The game could do with more 'stuff'Overall I'm saying don't get this game unless you're a fan of DBZ and are going to anyway. I've had fun, and am actually having more fun the more I play, but if I wasn't a massive fan of the series I would have stopped playing after an hour."

,Not Recommended,323470,23959389,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Potwinski,"Once again, anime potential is wasted on flashy, shiny, dramatic visuals and fanservice. I hadn't played a DBZ game in over 10 years and I wasn't really surprised to come back to the exact same combat formula. Combat felt exactly the same, offered barely any more attacks.Pros:Nicest looking DBZ game to date (as expected).Quite a number of unique characters beside clones/transformations.Kinda cool tutor/mentor character system.Some nice vanity gear but a lot can't be colour-changed :(Decent new voice acting.Can run very well on an old PC (on low settings).Cons:Stupid annoying AI.The same basic, repetitive, boring combat as old Tenkaichi games, and actually feels more clunky and slower.1v1 is boring and anything more than 1v1 is complete chaos. Buggy, glitchy, unsynced, imbalanced. Some attacks take weird priorities over others and it's just a noisy mess.Poor quality cutscenes with sometimes out of sync sounds.Sometimes the English voice acting is missing, replaced by Japanese due to poor QC or just bugs.A lot of cloned characters that should be condensed into one.Awful unimaginitive, incredibly boring story - it's trying to make you fix the chaos to make the story how it should've been - ya know, actually, a NEW UNIQUE story would be GREAT. MAYBE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND NOT 30 YEARS OLD?Not only is the story lame, it takes FOREVER to work through, and becomes legit IMPOSSIBLE if you don't grind Parallel Quests to level up and gain those tiny stats or better abilities. All fights are boring and tedious button-mashers. No AI is clever, they're just HP sponges. And who wants to kill 20 frieza soldiers while trying to stop your suicidal dumbarse AI from dying, hence failing? No one wants to fight the saiyans, frieza, androids, cell then buu in 2016.Character creation is reeetaaarrrded - stats differ between races AND genders, AND in more ways than the game actually tells you. Saiyans are simply stronger because of Super Saiyan, and these racial stat differences (and equipment stats) make such a tiny difference that it's not worth working on, and just going for vanity gear - wasted ""builds"" potential. If you don't stick to what your race is designed for, you'll feel weaker. Some race's combos just suck in comparison too.There are cookie-cutter OP ability combos that you basically just wanna combine or you'll be weaker.Character creation is good for colours, but hair/face etc is all crap and limited - again wasted potential.[WARNING: To make more than 1 character, you have to finish the story. By the time i grinded it out, i was too sick of the game.]Few battle zones with not much to destroy at all.Basic online mode which takes far too long to unlock and barely explains when it does. Huge wasted potential for a possible great community feel. It feels SO DISCONNECTED that the players lagging around you may as well be NPCs. Can't even type to people; have to select from very limited pre-made messages. This place's kid/child/baby-like music isnt DBZ at all and is bloody annoying. Making a party is a hassle and everything is slow. Apparently a lot of online PVPers cheat too. Online missions also break the game like 5% of the time and force you to quit at the Clear screen.And Xenoverse 2 is coming out and I bet all the above shiz is the same. Lazy money grabbers."
,Not Recommended,323470,14713432,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Jearbear,"My dislike of this game comes from two sources primarily, and why though I would not personally recommend this game to anyone, I can understand why some people are enjoying it.The first part of my dislike, and what I suspect a major portion, is that this game was not what I expected. I realize that this is a poor reason to dislike a game, so take what you will from this reivew. I was hoping for another fighter similar to the original Budokai (non-Tenkaichi) games. Instead what I got was a sort of Monster Hunter-ey MMORPG fighting game, that like most Monster Hunter and MMORPGs is very focused on grinding. Now I am no stranger to the grindstone, I have played numerous MMOs during my life and generally enjoy the game mode. However it just does not seem to fit the DBZ genre for me. The previous games, though they did have some level of grinding to them, I still remember grinding out the World Tournament in all three Budokai games to get Zeni to buy capsules to unlock breakthrough capsules to have them maybe sometimes randomly appear in the shop. But that was more just time commitment and a little less on the ""man I sure hope Recoome drops his pants cause I really need them.""This was the other source of my issue with this game, is that it wore down and completely destroys any 4th wall between you and the game. You are almost always and constnatly aware that this is some odd video game and not you flying around punching people at super sonic speeds. The previous 3d fighting games did a much better job of maintaining this, as even grinding out the tournaments still felt more organic than doing the same mission again and again hoping for Recoome to drop his pants, which as it turned out I also needed his shirt too but that's another story. Most of this game is about triggering poorly indicated bonus events in side missions which then run a chance at dropping new moves, clothing, and use items. Now, normally this would not be an issue for me, if that wasn't crucial to the functioning and success of your character. The clothing has stats, which effect how good you are at punching or taking a punch or how hard your lasers hit people. Likewise your starting abilities are also rather weak, requiring you to grind out new skills from these quests if you actually want to hold a candle to fighters later down the line. However this will end up with you using Piccolo's blast attack, Kaioken, Recoome's fighting pose (and trousers) with Gohan's super headbutt thing that he did to Raditz. The result of this is that isntead of feeling like a unique character, you feel like some horrible patchwork monster stitched together in Gero's lab from footage data of Goku's battles. You fail to feel like a unique personality within the Xenoverse.This brings me more to complaints about MMOs in general, and that is the lack of uniqueness of your own character within the MMORPG portions of the game. Because abilities and gear effect your performance, you are incredibly limited in the customization of your character. Though agreed there is more varriations avaliable for ability choice, but if you want to punch things and not really focus on lasers then your gear choices are limitted to sets such as the Ginyu Armor (my dilema) as that increases your punching, punching skills, and ability to take a punch. However, I personally have always enjoyed the look of Piccolo's outfit, you know with the big ol' white cape and such that Gohan also wears? Well alas that decreases my ability to punch and instead boosts my laser abilities, of which I have none. Now this is also fine, I can see that wearing some clothy turbine thing won't provide as much protections as super space armor, and that's fine, that's an issue with MMOs in general of being limitted in gear choices, however what's worse is that you cannot change the color on any of the gear items. Making your character essentially the exact same character with just a slightly different head on a different sized body all wearing the same gear with similar ablities of mixmatched other character's moves.All in all, the gameplay is fine, if not a little frustrating, and if you are a really really big fan of the Dragon Ball universe than maybe you can stomach the other terrible aspects of this game and sit through it for the MMO time commitment it requires. I however am going to go dust off my PS2, put in Budokai 3, and enjoy my weekend playing something that isn't this steaming pile of borrowed garbage.Overall rating: 4/10."

The supers have a massive deadzone in the time it takes to open and close the menu (why they don't just auto combo out like SF or the old DBZ games is beyond me).Your knock down state has a variable time to it, so you can't properly defend. If something gets in the way of the drop animation you continue falling anyway.Ultimates and super moves, which you can't knock your opponent out of, can suck you in so that if you're behind your opponent's character model you can be vacuumed through his back infront of him and wrecked by a super you'd already dodged.Ignoring any vacuum even: supers are worthless.Frame data appears to completely arbitrary.There's awful issues with super armor.If you're using a controller about 75% of the time it will only show the keyboard bindings.The AI is awful. Your support AI don't group onto you or chase your opponents with you, while the enemy AI will just gangbang you.The games has the most inefficient case of menu-AIDS I've seen for a while.It's extremely repetitive (want to fight Cell and the Ginyu Force 10 times? You're in luck).Audio mixing has issues, silencing any component of the audio - if say you get sick of hearing the same line of dialogue over and over and over and over and over and over again will lead the music dipping when the dialogue is meant to play even if it's been muted. This appears to be the same for other audio options.Several times, when the FPS was over 60, the game would randomly stutter and this appeared to happen regardless of whether or not I was in battle.The timer continues to run when new enemies enter the battle, you can't skip their entry scenes and while that's going on you can still be attacked.Often at the start of a fight, even if there's only one opponent, you don't autolock on and so can be instantly blind sided and caught in string.Item usage is clunky, when the item UI is out you are literally defenseless, 99% of the items in the game are entirely pointless.Often when you've completed a match the dialogue audio won't end in a reasonable time so you're stuck listening to nonsense (while the timer is still active, for some reason).There is a very low diversity of music.Going from infight map to infight map is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The geometry constantly snags the character model.Opppnent combo strings can hit you if you happen to be behind an ally even if you're outside of your ally's hurt box.Quite often you can be blind sided by an enemy who is above who you can't lock onto.The old DBZ games were garbage, but they were fun garbage and even though they were broken there was still some tiny iota of a proper fighting game in there.

Other than that however, disapointing game. This game is basically the exact same thing as Boudakai Tenkaichi 2, but with hundreds of glitches, bugs, and disconnecting issues. I have been trying to connect to the game for the last 3 hours but I can't play... Didn't I already pay 50$? Now I still can't just open the game and play when I want? I just disconnected from the game after every parallel quest 5 times in a row. I would not spend 50$ on this game if I were you, wait until it is on sale and it might be worth it because the gameplay idea itself is fun, but the fact that ""lock on"" doesn't actually have you lock on or fly toward the enemy is just stupid... I lock on and guard, and I'll guard facing the opposite direction from the enemy?... When I try to move to a portal or item literally right behind me, the game forces me to turn around in a huge circle and I literally move further from the portal/item, it takes forever to go where you want and face the darn thing. Half these fights just have the opponent flying away from you for over 15 minutes and it's impossible to just touch them. Boring, frustrating, connection issues, energy attacks are better than physical attacks, this game needs a lot of work. Shouldn't have been put on the market like this. Only thing that I truly enjoyed so far, was making my own character and playing with my friend online. Everything else about this game just tells me that it was rushed and it was not ready for sale. I honestly prefer the PS2 games over this right now."

It's grindy as hell because of the sloppily implmented RPG progression system mixed with the horrid RNG of loot. It has zero quality of life as far as mechanics go. An example of this is when you are trying to purchase clothes for your character. It would have been nice to be able to actually ♥♥♥♥ing see what the clothes look like before purchase. Combat seems finicky at best. It's clear that there is a skill ceiling here, but the RPG leveling mechanics drag it down so far into the mud that it's just a chore to play half the time. Most of the time you are getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked it's because you just are not high enough level (which seems to be a constant in this game) despite it being a ♥♥♥♥ing fighting game. The Hub World is pointless and a exercise in tedium. It's just a barren area designed to make you feel more connected to other players (as their avatars appear in this area). This is where you go buy your gear, talk to your trainer, and initiate all gametypes within the game. The problem is that navigating this place is awful, as you are limitted to jogging at a very slow and clunky pace throughout this really unnecessary area, which just adds time to the already grindy and time wasting experience of the game. When you complete a mission, you have to wait for the loading screan, pop back into this♥♥♥♥♥♥hole, and then jog all the way back to the mission area like a ♥♥♥♥ing bafoon. All of this could have been replaced with a simple menu or (if they really wanted a free roam area) they could have allowed you to explore it with the same controls and mechanics as the fighting game itself (primarially being able to ♥♥♥♥ing fly). However, easily the most wretched of problems this game has, is the constant ♥♥♥♥ing connection issues. I have not been online ♥♥♥♥ING once since purchasing this game. It REFUSES to connect (likely because they have a higher population on their servers then they expected) which is god damned unacceptable. It actually wouldn't be such a ♥♥♥♥ing problem to never be able to access the online portion of the game, if it weren't for the fact that the game constantly tries to go online. Which means, every time you try and log into your character, you have to wait for a good solid 5 minutes for the game to connect to the Xenoverse when you know damn well that it's not gonna be able to. The amount of time wasting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game is astounding. On top of everything there is general laziness with the plot and story missions and so on.tl;dr RPG mechanics turn this game into an uphill battle grindfest. No quality of life for menus or shops or anything. Story is lazy. Hub world and other time wasting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t makes this game a test of tedium. Connection issues make the online mode more of a legend than super saiyan, while still impacting single player in a negative way some how.I really want to like this game, but I find it giving me a headache more than anything.

He sure doesn't understand why we can't fight together. Dragon Ball should be about bonding with your friends and loved ones, on my wall I have a scroll depicting Goku and Gohan riding together on Nimbus, that bond between a father and son is grown through the adventures you take on together, this game decries this, the most poignant and beautiful theme of Dragon Ball.I feel like I've been taken advantage of, should I buy another PC and another copy of Dragon Ball Xenoverse so my son and I can do this together? ♥♥♥♥ no.And what of my friends? We all need to buy copies and play online, but my friends are content playing single player using my shared game library so there goes that notion.My computer can handle all my goons at one time, I think the developer added a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fluff when they could have made a stellar game worth the investment if they added local co-op and versus.I wanted to believe they would add support before the game was released.If youdo not carefor local co-op and versus or have no need then consider this a recommendation, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the best realization of the Dragon Ball universe yet, creating your own character and seeing them come to life is a realization of a dream I'm sure a lot of us have had.but it sure does ♥♥♥♥ing suck that I'm not excited about this game anymore.UPDATE:You can currently play 1 v 1 local multiplayer matches on one map, you cannot set any of the parameters, and it is restricted to a 3 minute time limit.So when and if the developers add more functionality to the system which apparently does work, I would probably have to change this review to a 'thumbs up', local Parralel Quest play sounds great so I am hopeful.UPDATE:Had a night with friends over fighting 1v1, it was a blast, can't wait for more functionality so that's it for good news.Otherwise this game is a lot of staring at the Connecting to Xenoverse Server screen, and then jogging to the area of the game you want to progress, to get a Disconnected from the Xenoverse Server screen where you start this little process over, everytime you spawn at this entrance pagoda of this stupid time-complex.I'm very close to changing this review to a recommendation, just seems like another rushed release.

Fun and addictive combat. Character progression and race variety. Transformations, coop, PvP, and live events. There is even a unique story for you, the player, to have your mark on the Dragon Ball Universe, and it's actually very good! I can honestly say this is easily the best DBZ game I've ever played.I still have to complete all the bonus sagas and gain another 20 or so levels before I hit the max level, and I've already invested a lot of time into the game. This isn't even including the future content that will come from the three DLC packs, which will offer more time patrol missions (main story), parallel quests (side quests), more special moves, more playable characters, more costumes, more mentors, etc. This game is going to have an incredibly long life, as long as DIMPS continues to support it.My only criticism is the online connectivity is incredibly unstable as of now. Sometimes it will work. Other times it won't. Luckily, you don't actually have to be on the multiplayer lobby in order to do coop and PvP with friends. That being said, it is rather frustrating to not have one of the major components of the game working as intended. Hopefully, this is something DIMPS will have sorted out sooner rather than later.It's certainly not terrible to the point of being broken, but online stability definitely needs some attention. Other than that, if you like Dragon Ball, enjoy a fighter/MMORPG experience, and always wanted to make your own story and character in that universe, this is the game for you. Even if you aren't a fan of the show, there is A LOT of content to be found here. I highly recommend this title. Great game."

Makes no sense and is very inconvenient.Not being able to alter the colors on the majority of outfits greatly deters from the joys of custom characters.Lack of outfits for majins, nameks, and freezians also deters from the joys of custom characters.The story just rehashing DBZ episodes instead of doing something original is not to my personal liking.The gameplay is fun, but feels as balanced as the arm strength of an olympic masturbator.The art style works nicely, but halfway into the story they stop animating mouths to go with words, and it is clear the further into the story you get, the less work was put into polishing it, or making it cohesive.The session based arenas are no substitute for a well designed and exploreable world. A matter of personal preference.Drop rates are a joke. Having poor random chance of getting a drop needed for a master quest, skill, or outfit, is frustrating, and needs at least quest items and skills to be re-vamped. I could deal with equipment pieces being the difficult part though.The gameplay is extremely repetitive. It is all combat missions of kill this, or those in various orders and conditions. This is seriously amplified by the necessity of completing the same PQ multiple times, and there simply is not enough variety in both number of quests, and type of quests.It captures the DBZ style of combat pretty well with all the over the top moves and combos, feels a lot like how battles played out in the anime.On the whole, it is fun, but it is also mediocre at best. This game would be worth it for $20, but $50 is way too much.

,Not Recommended,323470,14701104,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Mountain Man,"EDIT: Since everyone voted down my review because they can't comprehend how an unplayable game could possibly be a bad thing, let's pretend for a second that the servers aren't terrible and that the game works as intended. Here is what you need to know:PROS:- Decent imitation of the art style- Functional port with few bugs (UPDATE!!!: APPARENTLY IT APPEARS THAT SERVER CONNECTIVITY IS LINKED TO FPS, ALONG WITH THE EFFICACY OF IN-GAME ITEMS AND PERHAPS EVEN DROP RATES, HA HA IT'S LIKE DARK SOULS 2 AGAIN SO DISREGARD THIS PRO)- Option to turn off the embarrassing English dialogue- Probably the first (only?) Dragon Ball game to feature a custom character without being a Street Fighter ripoffCONS:- Hub world replaces your menu, forcing you to spend up to 40 seconds (I counted) before you can even begin loading a story mission... After you've already loaded the hub. If this were a menu this would take less than one second.- Even when servers work, the matchmaking takes a great deal of time to start a game up and, generally speaking, it's not even worth it to play with other players unless you go in for a versus match.- There are actually very few customization options for your custom character; additionally, the best race is the ""Saiyan"" because it can transform and then repeatedly throw out super ki blasts everywhere constantly, effectively giving it about 100 times the reach of other races. As far as equipment goes, you cannot customize it whatsoever, and you must only wear the items that fit your build. In other words everyone of the same build will look the same - a (better be female) Saiyan with a certain set of equipment and barely varying physical characteristics.- The combat system is simplistic and button-mashy. Combos are all the same between races except for animations, and given that your only real defensive option in the long run is a retaliatory ""evasive skill"" that staggers your opponents (which you will only be successfully using to break a combo once in a blue moon) the bottom line is to attack ASAP with no regard to your health. This means the race that is best at attacking - the Saiyan - is the best race. In some of the single player games if you are under attack by more than one enemy, as happens almost every stage, there is the possibility of being endlessly comboed forever and this will definitely happen to you at some point. Locking on to an appropriate enemy when two or more are in range can be a nightmare.- In addition, combat depends heavily on meta-Dragon-Ball-mechanics like health potions, equipment, trinity-style ganking, and killing enemies with the charge up of a skill rather than the skill itself. What this translates to is a gimmicky and rather janky corruption of what you might have read in the comic or watched in the show.- Grinding is pretty much necessary to beat the story, which probably shouldn't be surprising since the game is based off of Dragon Ball Z and the subsequent embarrassments like GT and Minus, but it doesn't even take the appearance of real training. In order to get the best equipment you have to play some missions as many as 50 times, and when they each take about 5 minutes to complete, not including the time it takes to jog over to the mission terminal, you can see how this can neatly pad out the game by about 4 hours just to have a slightly greater ki capacity, for example. Meanwhile enemies in the story inexplicably gain the ability to resist any stunlock, even in the middle of melee super attacks, and gain health and attack strength at a rate disproportional to what one could attain naturally through leveling, so you must also grind for experience like a traditional JRPG.- You will want to beat the story, because this is the only way to unlock additional character slots. In other words you must grind in order to have more than one custom character: perhaps for at least 10 hours or more. You must also beat the story to unlock the full functionality of the hub world (aka slow menu).- The story is GT-level, adding more business with demons and kais and what not. Somehow Dimps managed to write a story that makes it plausible for a custom character to interact in some classic battles, but in perhaps the laziest way possible. If the characters are capable of time travel then why not go back far enough to erase the possibility of Mira gaining power in the first place? If Trunks wished for a warrior strong enough to correct the errors in the timeline then why is grinding necessary? Why didn't Trunks just wish for the strength to do it himself, or immortality, and then do it himself? Basically just a Star Trek: First Contact (read: excuse for an action movie with cheap sets) storyline.- The music is totally forgettable except for the stuff they drill into your head at the login screen and hub. The former literally sounds like a track from an EA sports title and the latter actually sounds like something you might plausibly hear in the Dragon Ball/Z/GT soundtrack, while the rest is bad 80s porno music, not unlike Dynasty Warriors, but worse. Too much guitar, not enough synth, brass, woodwinds, or synth drums. Sounds more like the Saliva/Breaking Benjamin-loving soundtrack of the Pioneer and early FUNimation releases than Dragon Ball.- Without so much padding, the story would be less than an hour long. This is not a joke. In this regard it is like a fighting game (but not MK9 or 10 or Injustice because, you know, fighting games with extensive single player stories have never existed).- If you make a mistake with your build, you also have to grind for the ability to respec (dragon balls).- To illustrate just how much of an RPG this is, I once went into a fight against 3 of the Ginyu Tokusentai with my character who had beaten Freeza single-handedly and 2 perfect Cells alongside me. I lost. There are no difficulty options, only character levels.- ""Hercule""- If you care, there are various typos regarding some adult baby who still doesn't understand the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" despite developing a game that simulates three-dimensional classical dynamics.- The control scheme is utterly unintuitive and cumbersome. Block is LB, which only activates after a second or so of character idling (fitting in with the idea that defense is useless), even if you are locked on, you still can't always fly a direct path to your target when there's nothing between you (usually when they are directly beneath you), switching targets is practically random which is pretty much death when there are more than 2 enemies within a few feet of you (in the story mode there's a stage where you must fight 5 Buus, kill yourself), and the DBZ-zanzoken flicker ability which is said to be directional is barely functional, merely making you reappear at the same spot after disappearing. Do the devs realize that this move represents the characters moving at a radial velocity that can't be tracked by the eye, not just disappearing?- You will experience a wide variety of fake difficulty mechanics. Many enemies vs. you, numerically hard enemies without precedent (take the fights against ""Hercule"" for instance), etc.Character limit. You get the point."

It has its ups and downs but overall I don't think its worth the $75 i spent on the game with the season pass. You're better off waiting for this to go on sale before you get this game.Cons:- Open world feels very empty and useless time waster having to run alot- The game crashes alot even when not in multilobby causing my crash midway through a mission- The fighting seems more like a juggling and whoever can stunlock with the most people vs a target- Camera seems to be all over the place in flight battles causing you to not know where to boost sometimes (even with target lock which doesn't help all the time)- No binding of keys so you can change what you would like especially found it annoying on my gamepad- The Lock on system overall needs work, very hard to change targets quickly especially when it becomes utterly fast pace that you can't counter when everyone is clump together- Teleport dodging system needs consistency (sometimes I teleport right in front of face of whom I am fighting and doesnt help if they were attacking from that side to begin with)- CHARACTERS, it may be just me but I prefer older DBZ games where each character was able to turn to different super saiyan forms (Characters seperated already based on forms EX: Cell and Cell [Perfect form] etc)- The custom character skills should have more descriptions or show what they look like instead of having to try them out in battle just to see what they actually do.- Needs a better online chat (Premade chat built in / no typing)- The grinding is over the top and not something I would like in a fighting game- Some boss fights are unbalanced/broken (a quick boss special can easily take you down to 1/2 hp  or in mission where you protect someone and the enemy AI randomly focuses on that npc; they can literally bring that npc from full HP to 0 in 1 second with the Ultimate causing you to fail cause the npc did not block or move)- Needs more checkpoints in certain story missions (Having to replay 6 different parts to get back to where you were doesn't seem right)- The items/costumes seem like alot but most seem useless and you end up just using one or two sets for awhile.- Server stability seems really poorly managed basically down most of the time causing you to play in offline mode- Single player mode should let you play in offline and not force you to log into their servers just to play in offline settings- The fighting in the game (Explained more in detail in the bottom of the review)Pros- Very detailed and descriptive story built in on top of the original story- Animations of movement and skills look amazing- The co-op feature to do missions was very inticing and a joy- The voice work for the most part was well done except for in the lobby (random reused lines on different chars)- The rpg aspect of gettting items and leveling up your char was great- The music of the game was the best I've heard- Destructible terrain- Funny Dialog during the fight with the allies you withOverall, did I think the game is fun? Yes in most aspects. Would you rate the game a 10? Nope more like a 7 out of 10. Would I reccomend this to people? Yes but only if the game is ONLY ON SALE unless you were a hardcore dragonball fan to begin with but if you were then you would've gotten the game regardless. The downloadable content I feel is not too worth it and doesnt make that big of an impact at all to the game entirely. If you were thinking of buying the game then please consider waiting till things get fixed otherwise it isn't worth the money you will invest.After playing through the story and doing many fights, I have come to a conclusion that the fighting system in this game is a disgrace and is nothing like the PS2 DBZ games that I have played in the past. The whole fighting concept in this game is 3 steps - 1.Charging your ki and then transforming to Super Saiyan ----> 2. Spamming your Ultimate till your ki runs out or the person your fighting is dead ----> 3. Repeat step 1.  Thats the whole fighting in this game in a nutshell, fistfights are almost non existant as spamming Ultimate is more effective."

,Not Recommended,323470,14687205,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Straph,"This review is based on my opinion and mine alone.  If you disagree fine, just don't go ranting in a comment to me about how you are a fan boy/girl.  I love the Dragonball series I'm just very critical of games.  If you have something constructive to tell me please feel free I always appreciate good feedback.So there is an offline, and online mode within the game itself.  You can choose to play an offline battle, or online battle while in the game.  Even the story mode is 100% offline unless you join a party.  The main issue I have is that the servers are regularly down or you can't connect.  Since the search for server feature is before you even get into the game which causes you to have to restart the game.  In most cases you have to play while offline in steam.  Very annoying since I have friends that I like talking to and playing with from time to time.  They need to fix the server connection issue, or at least make it to where you don't have to wait for the server to connect to play in single mode.Now for the game itself.  The game is rather fun to play if you enjoy Dragon Ball Z style combat and themes (which I do).There are a few things that bug me however.  The limited choices of races available to play at start 5 which isn't bad I was just hoping for more.  The Kai, Cell, Andriod, even being able to play a Mr popo type would have been awesome.  The negatives and positives with races kind of kills me.  The fact that the only form transformable race is Sayan... when in fact every race has a unique transformation available.  Pretty much the whole series is based on transformations.  Every bad guy/good guy has some sort of transformation during the series/movies.  Kind of upsetting.The gear is more important than your stats.  The fact that a level 10 with better gear can beat a level 20 with not such good gear is off the wall stupid.  I tested this extensively with my nephew who is 8 and barely knows how to play the game as the level 10 and would usually beat me simply because of the gear.The 1 player slot until you beat the game completely detracts from the game as I want to try a few different options before I make a main character.  The 1 slot alone frustrates me to no end.  Another reason to make the game offline as well as online.  The gear gets super expensive and some of the accessories have no meaning what so ever other than to look cool.  So spending money on them is 100% nongame effecting, and your scanner that you get in the start of the game is the same as any other one you could buy other than color.I also notice that you have to grind for a lot of the gear inside quests as you can't purchase many of them in the store until late game after you have beat specific levels (making the gear useless for the next few levels).  Also there doesn't seem to be good gear progression unless you grind a set out (completely random gear peices for one side quest).  You might wanna strap your grind face on for gear you really want for hours on end.  I've been trying to get the freeza era vegeta uniform and keep getting the gloves over and over.  Would be nice if they fixed it to where you could choose a peice of the set if you are awarded equipment.The game mechanics need a lot of tweaking for a game that is 100% battle I'd expect the battle to be steam lined so well that it would be flawless.  Many of the ranged attacks don't hit a majority of the time due to bad progamming.  While you are right on top of the person with a beam attack it does no damage or very little regardless of you hitting the oppontant because it's not connecting on the game mechanic level to hit the other person.  Making some cobinations really useless, and some skills not worth investing time in (mostly ranged attacks).  Also makes the battles very similar in nature (all melee).  You won't be able to avoid the melee aspect even if you are trying to play a ranged type.There is one defensive move that is annoying as Kami.  The AI (or lack there of) will spam this super bubble over and over regardless of energy levels.  It being a 300 ki move for you to use.  So you won't in some cases be able to get a full combo off for a few minutes at a time.  This must change in order for the game to function.  A boss that can spam a 300 ki attack 10 times in a row and you have to waste a build up to use it once to possibly avoid an attack that would one shot you.  Yeah broken much?The AI on your team also has an advantage to get to the enemies before you can by being able to lock onto them without line of sight or range.  You however cannot do this unless you see the enemy and are within close range.  Making travelling to fight an opponent very frustrating.  As well making some quests very difficult to beat simply cause you run out of time.The story is amazing, however the English voice acting is horrible (Japanese is fine).  So it makes you want to skip everything and just read the setnences before they speak.  You had one job voice actors.  Also there are no lip movements while they speak which is creepy, and broken.  The animated bits are intersting and nice, however they are few and far between.  A lot of the animation from the series is glossed over, which is sad because that is the best part of DBZ.The UI is old, and looks like one used in a PS2 DBZ game.  Someone either didn't add a file correctly or the UI is just that bad.  There are even buttons that aren't named correctly within the UI and it took me a while to get rid of the menu so I could see what the gear looked like on my character before eqiuping them.  There also isn't a feature that lets you see what you are buying.  You are kind of taking a guess as to what you are purchasing hoping it won't look ridiculous on your character.  Which a lot of it does look odd, and you end up just buying every clothing option anyway.The graphics are pretty good for the type of game it is.  The one thing I don't like about the graphics is items tend to go through clothing, or even your person from time to time.  Seems like there wasn't a good polish for the main story line as there are a lot of scenes that have items going through cloaks and such.There are 4 or 5 areas to explore while not in combat/story mode.  The jump feature while in town mode is useless as you can't even jump over a small bench (you can fly.. right... you can't while in town).  The town is small and there are duplicates of some stores, and combat areas that simply don't need to be in the game making it larger than it actually needs to be.  You can walk in a circle around the town in less than 3 minutes.  Might be less depending on route.  Kind of boring.There are a few features that aren't even available yet such as the tournaments local or not.  I would like to see a local co-op added as well with split screen.  Would be epic to play this game in local co-op.  Hit or miss with co-op currently.Overall feels like an alpha stage game that really didn't have a good beta test.  There are a lot of things that need to be polished and tweaked before I would call this a finished game.  This will be an awesome game once they fix a lot of the issues with it.  However don't pay full price for it as you'll be disappointed by the state that it is in now.  I rarely buy full priced games anymore because of issues like this.  Game developers have gotten into the habbit of rushing the release of a game when it's not done yet.  Wasting my time, energy, and money on a game that dissapoints me, and leads me to not buying a full price game from them in the future.  I grew up on Dragon Ball Z while in Japan in the early 90's so it was a gamble I was willing to take.  The fact that their first DLC will be in March 2015 not even a month after release proves that this may indeed be a money grab rather than quality game as I was hoping it would be."

When you load into the game after completing some starting events, you are allowed to enter the ""Multilobby"". The Multilobby is a hub that is instanced with a few random online players liven up TokiToki City. Upon trying to look for a connection to this server, there is no Timeout request before it gives it seems. So if it doesn't detect one, you are just stuck ""Searching for Connection"" until you forcibly close the game with Task Manager.  In one of the first few quests, after completing the objective to kill Great Ape Vegeta, his body just laid on the ground and the quest was unable to be completed. After 10 minutes the game failed me from the quest and both my brother and I lost all drops.In short, after just a few hours of play, this game has becoming increasingly irritating to play. Everyone has been praising the game up and down through their love of DBZ, which I share mind you, but there are just some things that need to be addressed before you drop $50 for the game. Is it fun so far? Absolutely, it is DBZ and it feels pretty much like Budokai 3 fighting style with the specials altered a bit. However, the PC launch needs a few patches and a little time to iron some things out. Hell, you can't even preview armor on your character from the shop... It is just really frustrating when you are disconnected over and over from Single Player and when you try to get back into the game it locks up. Just some simple things that need to be patched in so that when YOU finally pick up the game, it seems great from day 1.Wait until a price drop or news that big patches have come."

One of the best things about the games are the fighting mechanics, simple to learn, hard to master. It's not finished. The best I can describe the controls are clunky, slow and too diverse. For me the best controls were from Raging Blast (1 and 2). Too be honest I have barely scratched the surface of the game. I'm just on the third mission on the Frieza saga, and another one of the biggest letdowns is the AI. Undependable and awful. What happened to 1v1??

That's the least of this game's problems. It has terrible controls, a terrible storyline, terrible translation, and an uncountable amount of grammar errors. Even quests were often wrong, not listing all of the characters to be fought in text, but listing them in character icons at the bottom. To add insult to injury, multiple playable characters have the option to switch their outfits, but it's often thesame outfitmany times, only with small stat changes. The pre-order DLC is terrible, consisting of two classic saiyan outfits,in pure silver or pure gold. It's tacky beyond belief. The bonus SSJ4 Vegeta character is also terrible, playing into the same scam with multiple choices for ""outfits"" that are, again, the same thing. So he only has one outfit (visually). The $25 DLC package? Although not yet released, it mostly consists of a few more playable characters, which you shouldneverhave to pay for in a game like this. My last issue was that I was never able to connect toanyoneplaying the game. Online quests were down and I was told thatno onewas online. This game is an insult and a slap in the face to all DBZ fans. I had such high hopes for this, but everything was terribly implemented. The only redeeming factors are the options to customize your own character (again with multiples of options and bugs), and the graphics, but in my opinion, there are way too many issues for these things to make a difference. If you want to play a DBZ game, stick with Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and do not buy this garbage, especially for $75."

It is very cool to play as a custom made character with legendary moves like the speacial beam cannon and the kamehameha but that is really the only fun that the game really has to its name. After finishing all of the story missions you get to play over 50 parallel quests to get clothes and moves for your character. But all of the moves that are given from these have a random chance of dropping making you spend hours to get that one move.

,Recommended,323470,16999621,"Posted: 11 July, 2015",all,Charlie,"I haven't even watched any of the Dragon Ball seasons and I enjoyed this game. I had some basic knowledge about the Dragon Ball universe and I still enjoyed the hell out of this game.The very first thing, which is creating your own personal character, seemed like a really cool idea that the other Dragon Ball games, from my knowledge, did not implement. For people who actually watched the anime, I can only imagine how cool it would be to have your own personal character fight against various other characters found in the Dragon Ball series.The combat system is simplistic but very satisfying. It honestly feels like you are coming up with your own combos and there seem to be only a few problems with the camera (which surprised me because the combat is relatively fast paced.)I feel like one of the things that people may not like about this is the fact that you have to run around the hub world, Toki Toki City, a lot to access pretty much anything in the game. Even if you want to play with a friend locally or online you have to run around the city to the specific area which will allow you to do so.As for the amount of content in this game, it literally feels like it's endless. There are SO MANY THINGS that you can do in this game, and for a person who likes to complete everything in a game, it's amazing. You can make multiple other characters after you beat the game, and there are tons of missions to do even after you've beaten the game.There is an amount of grinding, but for someone who's played WoW and many other MMOs, it's not much at all. Just don't expect to smoothly go through the story without doing anything else extra like missions. It will be extremely difficult. Whether or not the grinding is a detriment to your experiment or not is entirely your opinion.I'm not going to talk about the story simply because I don't have very much knowledge about the Dragon Ball series, but from only playing this game and not knowing anything else it seemed really good.Overall, the game is definitely at least something you should consider. The only complaints that I have is that you should be able to customize your character a bit more than it's restricted, and the grind can be a bit tough on people who haven't experienced something similar before.If you haven't watched Dragon Ball, then it might be a bit of a gamble. You might have a similar experience for me or you may just not like it. But it's definitely a really fun game for me."

You make your own character at the start of the story who at lvl 50, after hours of grinding, is still weaker stat wise then Hercule then go up against altered fights from the main series (which is actually very well done).The first thing you will notice is the input lag, especially when going from dashing to guard or ki balst to anything.Players familar with fighters like MK or SF will feel very out of place especailly without any form of guard cancelling.The AI is abyssmal when it fights other AI, and only shows any level of competence when facing you. To counteract this, the game gives them more of every stat and will often see you outnumbered, where the lack of defensive options really shows. Simply put it is impossible to guard against 2 AI if they are agressive enough, though often one will be randomly floating around in the distance somewhere.Another strength that a lot of the high end opponents have is super armour. This means that the opponent will not flinch until you do a certain amount of damage first which can get really tedious and in certain fights that have multiple parts (that you do not restore your already low health by default) can be game changing. Imagine a fight where you beat you're opponent, then they come back with a friend, then by themselves again with a power increase when they have 6x your health AND super armour. It gets very old very quickly.In terms of performance the game is smooth, sitting easily at 60fps with an acceptable (not great) graphics range.This game could have been amazing but between the absurd grind, clunky controls for a fighter, woeful AI (especially friendly), this game will quickly outstay its welcome unless you are a diehard DBZ fan."

It strikes a good balance of story and interaction along with that thing Dragon Ball fans have been craving in a game [CHARACTER CREATION].Creation is a little limited in my opinion and the choices you make during creation only have a small and limited effect on eventual character outcome. I have come to realise endgame you can end up being forced into certain build types to be able to compete with high level players and beat the later missions. Those builds are almost all entirely based around blast supers and there is little to no emphasis on the actual fighting. Even the beefiest of characters have to rely on long range attacks to get anywhere. But all in all you do get some nice options and if you really don't give a toss about ranking you can do what you want. One thing to note is that when you make your first character you have to complete the main story before you can make any more characters.The story is ace. It's original but maintains the real feel of Z. I won't go into this too much so I don't spoil anything but it's really worth enjoying.The paralell quests were a nice distraction doing various different battles, even siding with villains etc. They do however become the ultimate ballache later on when you have to farm them forever in the hopes of an item dropping (especially Dragon Balls which become ridiculous when you have 6 and the drop rate plummets). That said when the servers are stable you can have fun hammering these quests with friends or strangers. The online system is quick and easy to jump into for both the pve and pvp stuff.The graphics were ace. I don't like the gloss applied to everything personally but I can honestly say it doesn't really affect anything at all. Nothing feels out of place, there aren't any environment issues (that I've encountered) and the whole thing maintains a steady 60FPS even on my dated cart (GTX640).It's not perfect. It feels like it's lacking something, it feels incomplete.But it's Dragon Ball and it's not Battle of Z (a complete an utter dog♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game abortion) which is awesome.I'd give it overall an 8/10 as a Dragon Ball fan BUT, I'd only get this on sale.

I did get the feel of being someone in that universe who wasn't just fodder and could get things done. Kudos to the game for that.Why don't I recommend it?I constantly felt underpowered. Running a parralel quest of my level, approximately Lv 18, going on a quest of my level feels like suicide as I'm constantly juggled by multiple enemy AI. The transformations feel like they have no impact at all. Kaio-ken just seems to drain stamina instead of having a meaningful impact on my damage output, and SSJ transformations just give you infinite Ki for a short period of time instead of amplifying all attributes for an extended time. Why bother with them at all unless you want to spam super moves and then be left vulnerable? Blocking never works. Apparently there is a delay time between when you push the block button and when you start blocking. Who came up with this idea?The biggest bugbear in the room with this game is that it ends up being a drawn out grind amplified by randomness. Want to wear a specific set of clothes? Endlessly run quests where they will drop in the hopes that you'll get them or you gain the money to buy them! Best of luck to you if the shops don't carry the item in question. Need updated gear so that you will have the stats you need to get things done? Back to the quests for you! Need a new super move? Back to the quests for you! Seriously, if I wanted to grind for stuff, I'd play an MMORPG. At least there the game usually has less ways to screw me over.I'd send this one in for a refund if it hadn't taken the game 30 hours to show it's true colors, thus making it something I can't return."

I got exactly what I wanted from this game.You play through the DBZ storyline (from the tv show). I made it to the Androids.-Enjoyed making my own character (OBVIOIUSLY Namek, they are the coolest).-Enjoyed the cut sceens, story flowed like the tv show, with my memory filling any plot holes.-Enjoyed teaming up with villans at times.-Enjoyed the huge areas and possible combos, and blocking.-Enjoyed the customization.I find alot of negative reviews talk about the multiplayer, possibly the PVP being unbalanced. Honestly, I don't care at all about the multiplayer.The single player is what made this game, and what made it worth the $80 to me, personally.TLDR; if you are a DBZ fan and want to create a customizable character from 1 of a few races, then play through the story of the TV series, along side your favorite heros, then get this and enjoy it.I compare this game to South Park: The Stick of Truth. It stayed true to where it came from, the graphics fit really well, and the gameplay is exactly what is exepected (in single player)."

Cleaned it up, fan boy'd again.""  10/10 - Kleenex ]Game is a lot like the Budokai series in the sense it's very simple controls used in a complex manner.  Tight controls; large variety of characters to choose from, and custom characters!  Excellent single player (it's all I've played besides a couple attempts at multiplayer, which leads too...)Servers have a lot to be desired, even after all this time and hearing about the launch day failures of the Xenoverse servers.  I disconnect often; and can't hold a strong connection to play online.  I'm more than certain my internet is more than capable of handling the load, as I can play plenty of other games w/ excellent latency.Outside of the online play (which is basically a main draw to a lot of people); the single player campaign is perfect for a Dragon Ball fan.  It's campy, it's clichè'd, and cheesy as can be, but it's Dragon Ball and as fans it's what we want and expect from one of our favorite series.Definately a grab for Dragon Ball fans hands down, perhaps not so much for people who are looking for a good installment to add to their fighting game collection as the server/network is not stable enough for true competitive gameplay.  Would love to see improvements and more World Tournaments with true pool of good players would make this game worth every penny when it's not on sale.Overall I recommend this game, if anything just for single player.

The battles are very unimaginative with little to no fun factor you simply chase your opponent around tring to strike him with your fists or occasionally a kick, very rarely you can shoot an energy attack which is limited to only 3 special attacks.

Ever since I first saw Dragon Ball Z, I've wanted a chance to transform into a super saiyan and this game gave it to me (although, sadly, not into SSJ3 or SSJ4). I was a bit let down by the fact that the transformation doesn't spike out the character's hair. Based on my personal experiences and what I've read about the other games (I don't own a console), this is definitely one of the best DBZ games out there. If you're interested in purchasing a good Dragon Ball Z game, then Dragon Ball XenoVerse is definitely a good choice.If this game ever gets a sequel, the developers should conduct a survey about the things that people liked about Dragon Ball XenoVerse and then work to improve those.Here are few things that I would add to this game:- Currently Dragon Ball Heroes only characters like LSSJ2-4 Broly- Transformations for each race (double-arm transformation for humans, 2nd-5th forms for Frieza's race, Super Majin for Majins and Super Namekian for Namekians)- More Giant opponents like Giant Namekians with their antenna working the same way that tails work for Great Apes- Golden Great Ape Broly- Super Saiyan transformations that spike out the hair- Super Saiyan 3 and 4- The Ability to reach a god-level like Goku and Vegeta have (SSJG and SSGSS for Saiyans, something else for other races)Despite the lack of those things mentioned above this is a very entertaining game and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the world of Dragon Ball."

I WAS WRONG.One thing I have to say about this game I absolutely hate, fighting 1v3 and SPAMMING KI BLASTS. When i was doing the bardock fight, jesus h christ. I'd get so mad I'd go after the guy who threw ki blasts at me. Other then that it has been pretty amazing. Another thing however that I did hate was I couldn't really get any good skills, even when doing the parallel quests and getting farther in the story. Yeah, I do have super sayian, but having final flash or something would be nice, but yet again that's where the grinding aspect comes in.Other then that I found the game great, defintely an 7.5/10. Not an 8 because of too many ki blasts.The grinding aspect of it is a little tedious, but that's where playing with people comes in. Once you beat it making a new character is easy, as well you have a good grasp of what you want to make and I think the skills that you have the choices of are great, the downside I will say to the combat is that you seem to have to decide whether you want to be a complete ki build, or a strike build, BUT that is why there are multiple character slots so you have that option to make both. Having multiple races is nice, but lets be honest here? A lot of people are going to choose sayian, which is completely understandable of course, but I do recommend making other ones as it does give a little bit of diversity."

I'll say the amount of moves you can have with you also limits how you play and the fact that some moves are inheritly better really limits your creativity. If you like Dragonball and you've been the type to make up your own characters before, it's fun to play around with the different races. The core gameplay is enough to carry you through the story, but anything after that is just there to test how insane you are. The online scene might be fun... maybe. You'll have your moments being your own character going through the story. If that's enough for you, you can get this.It's not bad, but it should have been better."

It holds many of the same concepts like the team battle system but it doesn't feel like your forced to carrying your team all because one person made a single mistake. Although the battle system is a bit flawed due to the nature of Super Saiyans, the combat is pretty enjoyable and a bit deeper then it actually seems. Things get really interesting when you go with a more physical character instead of relying on using your Ultimate over and over again. That is something else to talk about, custom characters... THIS is a function that I and many other people have been waiting years for and even though it was first in Ultimate Tenkaichi, this game does it right... Mostly... The customization options are amazing and there are so many things you can do. There are only 2 things I wish could have been done better, hair and clothes. Anime is pretty notorious for hair but your character surprisingly doesn't have many options if your a Human or Saiyan. I also don't like how the males and females have different hair selections considering the options they have are pretty gender-neutral. Also Super Saiyan only turns the user's hair gold, it doesn't actually change it's shape. The clothes have problems in two different areas. The first is pretty well talked about being that clothes have stats. This sucks because it means you are not making clothes to look good but using them for stats. Either make clothes have no stats or allow the player to have seperate slots for what clothes are being used for stats and what are being used for show. The other issue is that most clothes can't be colored. Any clothes used by a character can't be recolored in any way meaning not only will many people be stuck with the same clothes for stats, but they will be the exactly same color too. The main problem with the game though is the RNG(Random Number Generator). This item drops in this game are so filled with randomness, this game might as well be called Dragon Ball RNGenoverse. It annoys me to no end when I complete a mission 10 times and I still can't get that 1 super attack or that 1 piece of clothing I so want.This game overall is good, especially compared to last couple games that came out but it has some obvious flaws. Xenoverse feels like a huge step in the right direction but still needs a bit of touching up. DBZ has a pretty good track record for great sequels to stinker games, Budokai 3 and Tenkaichi 3 are two of the best DBZ-based games ever and both of those had pretty flawed first titles. I have high hopes for a Xenoverse 2 with more customization and many of the flaws ironed out. Despite that, this is a game every DBZ fan has to play at least once in their life, if only for the ability to make your own character."

And that's all made worse by the dedication to making the game multiplayer -- the hub area is infuriatingly slow to navigate and the addition of multiple characters to a single fight (which turns already hectic and confusing fights with a wild camera into a nearly unplayable exercise in frustration), and constantly connecting to the servers slows the game and increases loading times.And it *could* have been amazing, if the devs hadn't been lazy and had just learned some of the basics from earlier games like Budokai 3 and Tenkaichi 3. This could have been Tenkaichi's openness and speed combined with Budokai's balance and expanded rpg elements, but very basic mechanics are a mess and the grind is more likely to crush your nostalgia than inspire it.Truly only for the most hardcore of fans who need a new DBZ fix and can't play either of the aforementioned batter games."

If you read my reviews nostalgic is common word used in games that are quite honestly a part of my childhood. That aside, the game itself is fast paced and insane. The action is fast and the combat system is setup so that over a thousand different posibilities of defeat or victory are possible. What I mean by this is that whatever two, three or four characters are fighting, the combinations of different moves like destructo disk or wave clashing along with smaller other mele moves put together calls for chaotic fun combat. In English, get the game its really fun, just about every character is here and unlockable. Missions are great and worthwhile to unlock characters.

Another big problem is the ping on the servers, im not sure if this is for everyone but whenever i try to join my friend to do a parralell quest or battle we would always be lagging behind but dedicated servers could fix this so i woudn't have to connect to xenoverse servers but im not quite sure if that would work because i am definately not a programmer, it would also help with the cost to update the servers and make them faster on the other side because most people would probably be using the dedicated servers.

So far i haven't had a lot of trouble with latency i just dodge whatever random guy is on the Red or Yellow and queue up with either friends or people who are at least in the green.Well if i were to rate this game i would say 6.5/10It has everything a fanboy from dragonball z could ask for, but some minor issues keepit away from a perfect 10 i just feel there isn't as much as i could ask from a game i spend 80 euro's onso i hope that it will keep inventing more ways to stay fresh as the times come, maybe implement some stuff from the new Dragonball Super anime and maybe add Super Saiyan god transformations or if not all of em :)Because lets be honest we all tried to go super saiyan once :P"

Online is flawed, d/c sends you back to title screen (losing all progress) and community seems dead, there's so few people to play with.Give DBZ Xenoverse a chance if you like Dragon Ball story and like rpg/fight mix games...

The companions are pretty useless there only use being distracting them while you charge up for an attack that even though goes right through the enemy doesnt count as a hit but if you are behind a person shooting an energy wave you still get hit. it seems as if there are endless penalties put on you but not the bots"

The only reason I can think of buying it is 1) you happen to be a fan of dragonball and 2) you wanna see what xenoverse 2 will bring. This is kinda the trend with dragoball games iffy at first but gets better with its sequels . Now with all that said xenoverse isnt entirely a bad game, the base game minus dlc is pretty hefty and for once it actually feels like the game is actually complete, without the dlc 'clap clap' also xenoverse brings with it a new take on the dragonball games, time-travel. Create a character is great, takahata101's voice is there, practiacally all moves for your character are available, the ""real-time-action vs cutscene type action is nice"", Nappa but for every right action xenoverse takes, it takes one step back. the others proably mentioned alot but the two big things are RNG on top of RNG and pvp. I wont speak for RNG on top of RNG as that speaks volumes but let me say this for pvp, xenoverse is proably the only online game where lag is good; lag armor. Again  if you happen to be a fan of dragonball (and can live without pvp) and can get it for cheap then sure buy it."

,Recommended,323470,16587762,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,T-Bone Biggins,"Much better than expected. I did not watch anything Dragon Ball for something close 15 years back in the days of Toonami. Not a super-fan, yes I liked it as a kid and grew out of it. I know some kids from school never grew out of it, ever. Not a problem to me. I'm not coming into this game as a fan of the series, I'm looking at it purely from gameplay perspective.Honestly? Wish they did the bits where you wander around town better. Shorten the walking distances or at least let your character fly faster in town instead of just running at a (comparitively) slow pace. Going between shops and other places takes way too long. Story I am indifferent to but the writers came up with a neat way to re-do a lot of fights from the shows without breaking the canon, you have to go back in time to fix alterations made to the past like Goku getting beaten when the Saiyans initially invaded etc. and with your help things are set back straight while you are hunting down whoever is trying to alter the timelines. There is lots of customization. Like a crazy huge amount. Tons of moves though at least half of the ones I unlocked so far are just not useful or extremely circumstantial. You can make a wider taller stronger character or a thin and smaller fast character, there are a few races and each gender of each race has statistical differences even. Everything seems well done for the most part, lots of tiny details.Gameplay itself is great. Not sure why, this is the first time I really got into a fighting game for years. This one is fun. The controls can take a quite a bit to learn since there is more to this game than simply punching like light strikes, heavy strikes, charged heavy strike to break a block, grappling, blocking, teleporting behind someone or quickly teleporting short distance to the sides, just so much it can be overwhelming for the first few hours. I would hate to play with with a keyboard and mouse and suggest a Windows 360 controller since that has native support. The only gameplay nag I have is how you must repeat missions to get some random drops like certain moves or pieces of cothing you want, and since it's random you might have to play a mission several times over and still not get what you want. Lots of people suggest save editors for this exact reason, no need to waste your life doing the same thing over and over. I did not go down that route yet, the game is still fresh to me and I don't mind a little bit of grind for exp and stuff. But once I get to the point where I don't want to repeat missions I will do that.As for online the co-op is awesome. PvP is not. Firstly don't even try PvP unless level 99. Period. Otherwise you are going to be beaten on the basis of stats alone. And from what I heard even if you get to level 99 then you will still lose several fights due to lots of people who have played this game and a prior one similar to it for a very long time. Not to mention lots of the top fighting builds are the same thing, there are a few specific stats like basic attack and stamina that matter much much more than the rest and builds that do not max those two stats out are at a distinct disadvantage. So the game isn't balanced for PvP. I did not buy it for PvP. I was honestly happy to learn there was a form of co-op anyhow. I'm playing singleplayer to get better at the controls mostly and will hit the co-op a bit after that. I'm surprised I'm having a lot of fun playing this game but it is what it is. Still expensive though, buy on sale like I did. I don't think this qualifies as a game worth $40 or more. $30 seems like a more than acceptable deal, less is best."

On the flipside, the final few missions are refreshingly original.- Voices/mouth movements...ugh....- Understanding that this is probably intended to be a very family-friendly game, the inability to communicate to other players directly limits the MMO experience."

I've waited, and waited since I started to rewatch the dragon ball series, for a good game to com along. It has everything I've always wanted, you get to battle through the entire Z series and most of GT, you get to fight along side your favorite characters, bad or good guys. You can even play as your favorite characters. The ability to create your own character is an amazing addition as well, the only downside is the level of customization is quite limited to say the least. The graphics are as good as it can get for recreating the dragon ball art style, all the animations, ki blasts, fist fighting, is all the way it should be. They even managed to get the same voice actors, except for gohan but thats to be expected. Thats not to say it doesn't have its short comings, I really don't like that you can't go through the stages of super sayian, plus your create a character can't even go ssj3 which is very dissapointing. You're very limted on what moves you can use during a battle, which is fine but to change your moveset is not very intuitive and the names are not a great description of what the move actually does, maybe a short clip of what it does would be helpful. The story is really good, the idea of someone going back in time and chaging things around, really allows story freedom when it comes to how you fit in with the dragon ball world. The story is some-what gimicky at times but so was all of dragon ball, so I can't really knock off any points for that. To sum up what I'm getting at, this game will certainly please any dragon ball fan out there, and if you're still wating to pull the trigger on this game, don't wait just do it. You won't regret it."

The PC version, has enchanced graphics and a higher frame rate to boot but that's common on PC titles vs Console titles. The character selection is awesome and the gameplay is what a fan will love. However, the battles can be a little frustrating at first until you actually get the hang of the game (i.e When you have to help 17 and 18 fight the Z-Fighters...) The only part I would honestly change is the GT parts of the game but... that's just a fan preference.The amount of mods that you can add to the game can add new life into the title and doesn't rob anyone of their normal game experience as they only override the character slots on your end, not for all the players. The customization that comes in the Vanilla game is kinda lacking but makes up for it with different clothing styles and different types of fighters you can create like a Melee character or a Ki Focused character. Any way I really enjoyed this game on PS4 and I'm learning to enjoy it again on PC! Highly recommend it to DBZ fans and even non fans as it is a pretty solid fighter game."

Parallel quests, which are side quests that try to extend the story, never really feel like story content. They feel more like extra battles with zany challenges.In my opinion it is just good enough to be worth a purchase. It would be nice, however, if it was more like Tenkaichi 3 and character creation had better depth outside of costumes and accessories."

76561198045623034,Recommended,323470,15405620,"Posted: 16 April, 2015",all,Eatpancakes,"Before I say anything it's important to note that this game much like is predecessors receives a ton of scrutiny because every fan boy out there thinks they know whats best for a game and how it should be made with unrealistic expectations and broken game mechanics for the sake of their little hearts.I like this game. I was skeptical upon news of it that it would fall in line with many other attempts to cash in on this franchise and ultimately give a half hearted game without the gameplay we are all looking for. After seeing gameplay for a bit and then actually purchasing myself I'm please I did. The game is not without hiccups though.The storyline is original and helps bring a personal immersion for the gamer that former titles failed to capitalize on. The ability to make your own character or even play as the Z warriors and even villains allows the nostalgia to come alive for anyone looking to live out there gaming fantasy of being in the Dragonball Universe.I believe the inclusion of an original story, player immersion, customizability, and a collectibles system make for a game with very good replayability. Different builds, fighting styles with both a PvE and PvP aspect allow for a wider arrange of gaming for the player. If you're the kind of person who is a crazed completionist then there are tons of items and skills to collect in the Parallel Quests, which is probably where the most meat of the game is.The downsides? Charging is a skill that must be equipped when you get it. You only have 4 skill slots, two super skills, and 1 evasive skill. I believe that charging should have been something native to players or even a passive skill that could be unlocked at a certain ki attribute or something besides eating up a precious skill slot for something so common among the universe.It would have been nicer to see perhaps a split in the skills where Physical skills and ki skills are seperated so that even a physically adept player could still perform a few signature ki attacks without crippling their build or vice versa. It waters down the gameplay a bit when the reptitive nature of the same techiques are seen. Also each skill doesn't really have a rating and you have to trial and error each one to find out how effective it is, I worry this may lead to some balancing issues.Transformations, not enough of them. It seems to be something pretty much exclusive to Kaio Ken users, and Saiyans. It would have been nice to see other races get some power increases. (i could be wrong about this, but what I've read thus far says otherwise). Also of note for transformations is that they take up yet again precious skill slots. So if you want to transform and are capable you'll be down another slot which leads to a serious decision making process for your build and once more waters down your options and makes your playstyle a little more generic.Through it all though I have had a good time with the game throughout, the grinding for collectibles or for a Z rank in missions is something that I can see people getting frustrated with and I'm usually one of those people. The ability to do missions with a friend or even a couple friends though makes that more fun. I haven't had the frustration yet with the game and that leads me to believe that despite the negative remarks on this game I believe the Devs did a good job. There are still things that need to be balanaced or sorted out here and there but nothing that updates can't fix.I give XV a 8/10I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the DB universe and even those who aren't as hardcore of fans."

Now I want to talk about some of my opinions of this gameStrength:1. New storyline, similar to dragon ball origin, but not exactly the same.2. Many combat skills and two main types to go, melee combat and Ki combat. Personally I prefer the second one. Ki combat seems to cause a lot more damage than melee combat and require less game skills. I find that if I equip supper Vegeta 2 and Spirit Bomb, I can just use these two skills continuously and beat my enemy. This is maybe a small unbalanced point.Weakness:The multiplayer function is totally ** for players outside US and EU. I can NEVER EVER find any room to play in. I am living in Singapore, and I guess there is no servers outside US and EU. And almost half a year passed, I didnt see any improvement in the multiplayer function.

The fact that one cannot directly chat with other players is saddening.  Instead they give you some predetermined phrases that you get to choose from.

I had to grind so I was twenty levels higher than the mission characters, and had to completely change the way I prefer to fight.The attribute point system bothered me, as I didn't understand what most of the stuff did.

Overall I think this is a worthwhile game if you are a fan of the series and dispite all it's flaws, I have 350+ hours on it, so I think it was worth my money."

SPOILERZZZ IN DIS THING.]But in all cerealness,  this game is pretty good. There is a lot of moves to get and use and it can be a real time waster.Yada-Yada is good and wut not.Somethings that they could add and or approve on:-Ki Spamming. I know I know, im gonna sound like a butthurt kid over the internet that is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off for random stuff. Well, I think Ki-Spamming is a bit OP. Being able to spam Rising Beam Cannon, eating off a huge chunk of health on the enemy, and they wouldn't have been able to block it.-Character Slots. Minor thing, just want to be able to move characters around in the slots-NPCs in Offline PQs. In Offline PQs, you are allowed to have 2 npcs as followers in the fight. However, they scale off YOUR stats and levels. Don't believe me? Create a new character and try selecting a NPC while at a low level. They will have much worse stats then they would if your character is a higher level. It sorta breaks the feeling, when a Beerus is worse than a Gotenks. Its sorta like having Cell > Mr. Satan. Mr. Satan is luv, Mr. Satan is lief.-Connecting... plz wait. I have no problem with this, but then again, most people complain about this and I do see why. I don't get rediculius (redenkuless? Redonkuless? ehh w/e) loading times such as over 5 minutes.-Final Boss. The final boss is easy as ship (Poop). Think about it this way, when you have gotton to the Beerus Part, you would know how hard the game became. Heck, even when I was fighting Nappa at an early level I was having trouble. But all that is just thrown out the window at the last boss. First, healing items. They can be used a total of Four Times, One for every slot. With the ability to heal on will when at low health, you can legit cut off almost all damage taken. Along with this, Majin's can heal with quick sleep, making them practically able to fight as long as they want. Next, the boss is only a SINGLE target. You can juggle him for long periods of time without any others attacking back.  He is considerablly less harder than Whis and Beerus Combo.Thats all i remember about that i had real issues about."

76561198051136047,Recommended,323470,15603256,"Posted: 28 April, 2015",all,Ol' Uncle Sheo[Gurren],"TL;DR This game isn't perfect. It has A LOT of issues, in fact. But y'know what? I can forgive all of them, because it's the first good Dragon Ball game we've gotten since Raging Blast.This is one of my new favourite titles. It's become my go-to ""I'm bored"" game, and I can see several more hours in my future even though I've already completed the story and all the parallel quests.... Just for one simple reason:It's WAY too much fun.This is what we all wanted Ultimate Tenkaichi to be. Moderately in-depth character customization, tons of skills and equipment from the series, a fun questline that isn't the same Dragon Ball Z story we've redone a hundred thousand times, and kickass graphics that, though arguably outdated, fit the art style of Dragon Ball. It's bright and colourful and simple, but not overly simple.The highest point of the game though is its nearly perfect combat system. You'll find yourself in intense grapples across relatively large maps, seamlessly switching between exchanging melee blows and blasting powerful Ki blasts at each other, and spectators from afar will be able to watch the air around you and your opponent visibly ripples with the sheer force and speed of your blows, watch the incredible fireworks as your beams tear past each other, and see the skies darken as your opponent goes Super Saiyan before your eyes. You'll find yourself jumping out of the way of attacks, outright blocking them, snap-vanishing behind your opponent as they fire, avoiding them altogether with afterimages and Instant Transmission, and occasionally simply breaking them out of their powerful attacks as they charge. It's difficult to explain why, I guess, but it really does feel like playing an episode of Dragon Ball Z.Beyond this, the multiplayer is pretty awesome. Keep in mind that the game is region-locked however... So you're not going to be able to play with your friends in Austria. This might not seem like a big deal until you do the math and realise that 1,000-3,000-ish players per region isn't NEARLY as awesome as like a trillion would be. There's also a lot of lag and connectivity issues, and a ton of hackers, and a ton of spammers.... But you shouldn't really be expecting anything less from a modern AAA online game.Oh yeah, worth mentioning that the business model is dubious. All of the DLC are, to my knowledge, already included in the game itself. They're just locked until you pay for them. On the one hand that means no compatibility issues/compatibility patches, but on the other, that's just a♥♥♥♥♥♥move.The UI is passable, but some things need work. You can't preview how an article of clothing looks before buying it, and searching for items in a mission and viewing power-levels is just really annoying(I won't get into that because that's a pretty minor part of the game that you frankly don't need to do), but the important stuff like your Ki and Stamina and Health are clearly visible. Super/Ultimate Attack menus are also easy to read and access once you get the hang of it.The one thing that's unforgivable with this game is the character roster. It's pathetically puny, only including characters who made appearances in the already wimpy storyline, and even then not all of them. You'll find key characters like Cooler, most of Frieza and Cell's forms, and Androids 16, 19, and 20. Instead we have Cell Jr., SIX forms of Saibamen, Appule, and Raspberry. Really?!Overall, the game is far from perfect, but it's the best we've gotten for a long time. I recommend it to any Dragon Ball Z fan, but... As for the general consumer, you might want to look elsewhere unless you just really like anime-style arena fighting games."

Spending five minutes attacking an enemy without him loosing any health to your attacks is not an uncomfortable exception , but a sad standard. It gets worse, when all players need to focus 1 enemy. Since the Companion KI offers a poor replacement in the really Challenging quests, it can be quite frustrating when you try to farm the quest for that one specific item/skill.- Game graphics:Not outstanding in comparison with other beat em ups , but remains 100% true in look and style to the DBZ series. It does a good job in making the fights look like straight out of the anime. Just without the content stretching monologues :P.-Weak KI:This is less apparent on the opponents than on your allies. most of the time , your KI teammates will be no more than floating meatshields, hardly using any of their Super and Ultimate attacks , despite having a fully charged special guage trough the whole fight. Same goes for regular attacks aswell. On opponent KI (in quests), this is beeing ballanced out by giving the enemies boosts , that ignore basic game mechanics. Those range from heaps of extra HP , to unlimited SSJ transformation time, unlimited special attack pool to auto guard and Flinch negation. That's not necesserily a bad thing, until you enter the endgame quests and find yourself stunlocked in constant ULTIMATE attacks from 3 Super Saiyajins with limitless KI pools, 5 times your HP and total ignorance to the damage you deal them, while your KI teammates twiddle their thumbs.-Communication has no Type chat:There is a Voicechat for groups and quest teams. So once you have a group going , you're cool. Until then , you are doomed to communicate with premade sentences only. No typing availible whatsoever.+Longevity/Versatility:Quests keep up the challenge level by offering a variety of weight on keeping your allies alive- beating someone fast enough- and sometimes collect key items on the go. tough droprates for skills and equipment , that are also bound to secret unlock condition within the quests will keep you busy for hours to come. In addition, once you finish the storry mode with your first selfcreated saiyan/namekian/frieza/human/majin buu character , you get green light to create about 8 original characters in total. Before , you may only play your starting character , and the original anime characters in ""parallen quests"". You may also pick one out of a dozen characters of the series as your Teacher, earning four of his trademark skills by passing his personal quests.+Character customization:The game offers a wide variety of equipment pieces with varying status boni/mali. Many of them can be bought from the NPC with questearned currency , many more are gained after spending hours farming quests . Same applies to Skills originally appearing in the series.+/-Gameplay:Simple standardized controls for all characters , combined with fast paced battles. The input commands dont vary between characters, but the tied skills and their purposes do. No complex thumble twiddling input commands to remember there."

The story is not the primary selling point though - xenoverse boasts character customisation, a large roster of characters and the ability to do quests online with friends, as well as face off against one another in combat. Fights are fast and frantic, and improve upon the typical tenkaichi formula with multiple characters facing off against eachother at once. If you are a dragonball z fan, this game is a must buy. For someone unfamiliar to dragonball z, I can still recommend this game as a fun fighting game, though obviously you wont be as invested in the characters and the fights that ensue.There are some cons: the servers are still quite laggy, there aren't really any movie characters apart from Broly and Bardock and the dlc so far is just an outright rip off. Regardless, the core game is great, and I can easily look past these minor flaws for what feels like the best dragonball z game so far. That being said, I do hope they introduce more movie characters in further dlc packs. They are doing some GT based packs which is fine, and it is rumored that they will be introducing some new characters from 'revival of f'. I recommend staying away from the dlc until it is on sale.

CONTENT!!The below reasons are all relevant to the amount of money paid for the game vs. what you get in the game.Reasons for not recommending DBX FOR OVER $40:- ""Open""-world roaming consists of awkward running and jumping. NPC's don't speak their dialogues, instead they make each their own awkward sound when interacting with them.-  In my opinion, previous DBZ on consoles have better fighting combos than this one. Very limited for me. Repetitive.- I worked very hard to get the SSJ and SSJ2 skills, only to find that I can only spam my techniques before the transformation wears off - no power increase. I guess this is fair, because of the other races. Although there is a item which boosts your stats when a transfomation skill is used - that would give the triumphant ""HAH, feel the wrath of a Super Saiyan!!"" - feel.Also another let down for me, is that super saiyan transformation keeps your current hairstyle, and it only changes colour to gold. I feel each hairstyle could have been given alternate SSJ styles. Some hairstyles work in SSJ, I suppose.Overall it isn't a bad game, and i do enjoy it. BUT NOT FOR THE PRICE I PAID.

The Soundtrack is very DBZ, it blends in well to the game.The Story is quite a fresh, interesting take on the story you know and love in the Dragon Ball Z universe (it involves time travel). I liked it a lot and loved how the characters had different interactions with you depending on your race (everyone is surprisingly racist to anyone of the Frieza race for instance).Sadly, many battles are left out (like any with Android 16 for example) & no levels for the original Dragon Ball at all (though those are handled by an Frieza Race NPC called Percel, learned about from his dialogue).The range of playable characters is kinda poor compared to past games (many forms & characters not playable), but unlike past ones, they all play uniquely and don't share the same animations (like Ultimate Tenkaichi). The character creation isn't halfassed like that game too. There are 5 races to choose from, and you can change all sorts of things such as their hair, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, skin color, eye color, Pupil type, and even voice! Sadly, Frieza's race is unnamed & only Saiyans have transformations outside of Kaioken. I loved how Male Voice 8 is none other than Takahata101 of Team Four Star fame, using his Ghost Nappa voice from DBZ Abridged!!!There are hundreds of items for your character to wear (but unfortunately a large amount of them can't be recolored). There are also tons of skills to use (with Strike, Ki, Power up & other catagories). You can even train under a master, who can be one of many characters in the Dragon Ball universe. They give you skills & Z Souls if you fight enough while having them as a master.If you want to play 2 Player, you need to go into the story mode to access it (It really should've been a separate mode). You can't call upon your other Time Patrollers to help in Parallel Quests or VS mode (only the Time Patroller you picked to play as).Also, sadly, the game relies on the RNG system to unlock many skills & costumes (the ones that can't be bought, or given to you by your master), as well as even Dragon Balls. So you may have to complete really hard missions multiple times for even a chance of getting one piece of equipment.As for the DLC, it's quite nice. It adds several more playable characters, more Parallel Quests (which can earn you more Skills & Costumes), more masters & more story. I like how they explain the GT missions being in the game as an alternate Timeline. It gives an excuse as to why Battle of Gods & Revival of F can exist in the same game (and a damn good one since this game heavily involves Time Travel).Many of the missions can be quite difficult, and Strike Based characters can be at a bit of a disadvantage in certain circumstances (like 3 Saiyans spamming endless Kamehamehas until you die for instance).Anyway, apart from some minor details, it's definitely a great game with a lot of potential. Hopefully, they expand on it in a sequel or something. I definitely reccomend it."

Petty good amount of content, but it's only somewhat a fighting game (similar to the Naruto games).But the lobby's take at least 30-60 seconds to find a match, and another 10-30 to join, and being ""Disconnected from the Xenoverse server"" happens often & will send you back to the title screen to spend another 1-2min getting back into the overworld (which is crap unless you're in the multi lobby).Protip: disconnect from the wifi/pull the ethernet cord while loading your character to avoid disconnections while grinding the ""parallel quests"".But even with the glaring faults of the servers & overworld, the fights can be fun. I do enjoy the WORKING 3v3 fight system, its fast and simple."

I loved the series.As I'm an anti console gamer, there's no Dragon Ball game for me to play until the release of Xenoverse. The full price is hefty but the game is good enough to warrant its pricing.The game forces you to grind but the grind is rewarding enough as not to tire you out. You feel your custom character developing in his power and you develop a bond with your toon. Want to be overpowered in Super Saiyan form? No free pass for you as you would need to complete a specific quest which is not easy until your toon finally has reached certain decent power level. But when you do finally beat the quest, you know your transofrmation into Super Saiyan form is deserving.Moreover, in the story mode, you feel that every character is properly representated in terms of their power levels. Krilin is much less powerful as Goku for example, as it should be. It brings out the fantasy behind the Dragon Balls series when you feel that all characters are as strong as they should be. In other quests your accompanying NPC toons however share your level for practical purposes as not to limit your option when it comes to selecting your NPC toons.The fighting is pretty well done except for the lack of proper sense of the destructive power of ultimate blast attacks which is lacking compared to how these are portrayed in the comics.The downside to the game is the lack of polish in the sound department. Besides basic voice overs and effects you hardly hear anything else in the game. There's no wind, no bird chirping that ultimately gives you the impression of a dead world. Destrubtible environment too is almost non existent (the graphical effects disappear too quickly to leave a memorable imprint of your real power.The server too is problematic. I have barely managed to login since getting the game. It worked for two hours then it went down for the remainder of the day.If you're a Dragon Balls fan this game might be too god to be passed up. If you're not familiar with Dragon Balls universe this still could be an interesting fighting game with RPG elements to it for you to try."

You get to choose what moves you use in a battle and can freely change them in town.- The fights feels just like what you've seen in anime.- 3 control schems to choose from. Not customizable but will do.- There are 2D animated cutscenes in the game.Cons- Town is pretty huge, but you can't fly nor can you run at full speed. Places you need to go (shops, quest givers) are scattered all around the place. It won't be so bad if there's interesting things to see... but there isn't much.- During missions NPCs will talk as you fight. Unless you use English voice-over or can understand Japanese, you will miss them all among the chaos.- Camera is bad for in in-door fights (walls often get in the way). But luckily there's not a lot of such stages.- Group fights can be extremely unfair, if you are ganged up on you won't have a lot of options.- Your character starts extremely weak; stat-wise a kid Gohan is stronger than you. For some harder missions you will have to grind XP before you have a chance to win.- No practice mode; local multiplay is restricted to one tiny stage and a 3-minute timer."

The story is good, it makes sense to have your own character that doesn't just splat him(her)self into the story for no particular reason. The combat is fantastic in my honest opinion. I love the fact that in the middle of a battle, if you exert yourself too much and run out of stamina and energy you're pretty much a sitting duck. It's intense when you see a massive blast heading at you and your thought process is ""Oh crap, I can't avoid it and I can't block it!"" It legit gives you the sense of a battle in the series.As good as the game is in my opinion, I do have a few minor ""complaints"" (for lack of a better word).-Connection issues.

,Recommended,323470,14791332,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Monckey100,"I have played both intensively and casually every DBZ game from the PS1 editions to the GBA sprite versions to the popular budokai 3. I will make things detailed for each section for everyone looking to buy this game and/or get the season pass.Gameplay8/10,as others have mentioned the game has a lot of skills and abilities for you to use from basically the whole series to its own unique versions, the grind in the game is actually a positive part of the game as it adds things for you to do HOWEVER there are some things I don't agree with. For example, Youcouldget Super Saiyan  early by beating a 3 star mission or you can spend those same hours grinding to just unlock it in the shop. It would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that it's really hard to get the skill and the time spent grinding for it could just be spent getting to the point in the story where you can simply buy it. None the less I still helped my friend grind for it as there is a sense of accomplishment but strategically it's better to wait it out. The game offers quite a few ways for you to play your character but there are certain moves that are just outright unfair and unblockable, it's not as big of an issue since it's a new game and balancing still needs to occur but it is significant enough in the story mode to lower the rating. Additionally another problem which made this a solid 8 rather than when I originally wanted to 10/10 gameplay is that auto attacks are very simplistic and lack depth which is apparent since there is only a single page for when you open up the combo list, teleporting behind/infront of characters costs way too much even though I find teleporting is a significant part of fighting in almost all games and it is showcased a lot in the anime series.Story10/10As a Dragon Ball Z fan, the story gets real old with every retelling and you basically know what to expect, they have done a great job making the story engaging and making your character feel like they are genuinely interacting with the story and making things better. This becomes even more apparent as when you beat missions the city populates with new faces which creates a sense of accomplishment. After I had finished the story, I wanted more as it was engaging and while I haven't finished the story 100% (at 90% currently), I am happy to see there is more to come in the DLC packs. What makes the story engaging is as the other users have mentioned, the creators did a great job of answering popular fan questions of ""what if goku failed"", it lacked depth at times beyond ""time and history will fall apart"" but it is a great idea and it was well executed, sometimes even featuring what happens because goku failed. While you can't expect a whole new rendition of the story line, the game does a great job of telling the original story as well as adding its own twists, coming out of the game I could explain most of the DBZ story to another user without actually seeing the anime. While at the same time, knowing the potentials if one of the key characters had failed/succeeded.Pricing10/10The bundle pack is easily justifiable for anyone who is a fan of the series, I've paid more for other games such as CoD which turned out to be a bundle of sticks. This game goes above and beyond for delivery and while so far you can get the same content by getting the cheaper version, I highly suggest getting the season pass for that glorious DLC and besides that, you are supporting the developers which will help push out content faster as well as attract some big players to bring DBZ to the PC and hopefully even start pumping out an xenoverse sequel or to add more content to the game and features.Customization6.5/10Initially the customization is great as you are given quite a few choices and thematically the characters all make sense, I can tell apart a Saiyan from a human and overall the team has done a great job to allow the users to be able to customize. Unfortunately as certain clothes prove to be better for your characters build, you find yourself wearing the same outfit as others who have the same build as you, the more you venture into the game, the more you find yourself noticing close clones. I was under the assumption you could change the color of ANY item which would greatly expand the small clothing selection but was quickly let down when realizing that is not the case. Additionally, the game almost taunts you with the amount of races that you cannot pick or for certain characters you cannot play as, for example Buldos race or being able to play as the dark version of Frieza. The game has quite a few choices for character creation especially as a at launch game which is great and from the DLC packs it is easy to tell that more options will soon be available. As for new races, unfortunately I do not think they will be implementing anything beyond the 5 choices.Graphics9/10Overall there isn't much to say about the graphics, it's sharp clean, and looks amazing in ALL available market resolutions, I have a 4K monitor and it was just beautiful to watch, the cutscenes were equally as beautiful. The games bright colors has an eye candy effect and even in dark rooms you can clearly see where is what, what made the graphics tank is the fact that the game is still glitchy with cloth effects such as hair moving/tail coats moving as well as the lip syncing is a bit silly. The game needs some polish but it turned out pretty damn well for an initial launch.Cons4/10Keyboard controls are atrocious, using a controller is basically mandatory and I find myself wishing some keys would be mapped together such as instead of having two separate keys for supers and ultimates, to have a toggle instead with ctrl would make the keys more accessible, remapping the keys before playing is highly recommended. On both controller and keyboard, throwing is really easy to forget for key combination and every single one of my friends who I told to get the game still had no idea how to throw even after being told how ingame. The game seems to lack some hindsight and QA testing which leads to overpowered abilities, bad mapping of controls, and other issues which really makes the overall score tank.The game basically screams for a chat system as I find myself seeing players spam ""hello"", additionally it needs more sectors/cities, the current city is over crowded and with so many clients requesting to see other players, it's no wonder why the servers are having issues, the game just wasn't made in mind for a huge player base such as what we have now and because of the lack of foresight, a lot of players including myself find ourselves playing offline and for online mode to just invite friends in a created lobby.Other issues include the chat system its self being very annoying and requires a mute button, I seriously wish I could play main story quests with friends which is a let down seeing as some quests are very very hard. The game also screams for a friends list, inviting friends to a lobby is tedious as you have to switch from controller to mouse just to invite them using the steam interface, an friends list in game would solve this issue and would keep friends in an easy glance to read. The game also screams for clans/guilds which it lacks as well as a trading system. The fact that you can have multiples of the same clothing but not be able to trade seems like a design flaw.Another issue I found was that the game lacked any sort of height depth, with all the graphics way at the top of the screen, as well as it being a dragon ball Z game, the first initial thing I tried while in town was to fly, which I was presented with just a jump instead, the jump its self is useless as all the things that you could be able to pass is blocked by an invisible wall.Overall7.9/10, great game. get it, a fresh take on both mmorpg and fighters."

This game, for me, is one of the best DBZ games I have played.I love the premis of the story. It's simple enough to get you right in to the action, but is a genuine enough DBZ story to get you in the right mind set to train up your own DBZ fighter.Yes, there are some times when the frenzy of action comes into conflict with the camera and the environments, but the times you get frusterated by losing a match because you rabited a bit too much when you got stuck in the corner of a cliff are only made all the more sweet when you train up in a few parallel matches, then come back and have that perfect throw down.I'm only 2 days in, and at about level 25/80 but I am having a blast. I haven't even touched the World Tournys yet... need to bring my A game for that, but I can see this game stealing about 50-80 hours of my life at least.If you like DBZ, if you like making your own character and playing a legacy style story mode, and you like custome builds that take some effort to put together than this is a game for you.The one major drawback for me, is off of purchase, you do not have a good selection of character for 1 vs 1 mode, and the HUB for all game modes is in the game world, so it's not the most user freindly for pick up and play until you get a little ways through the story and unlock a good amout of characters... but i was going to do that first anyway.

More than a decade later and I'm still a huge fan.  Fighting games generally leave me bored and button mashing my way through them.In short:  This was a game that could have failed  hard like most of the DBZ games out there and I'm predisposed to be disappointed and bored in this case.  So, when I say it's one of the best games I have ever played, there have been myriad bars set *reaaaal* high that it hopped right over.It starts out seeming a bit sparse.  Fighting gamers may not care for the very straightforward combos, but that's only because they've failed to explore the other customization aspects, the very unique defensive/evasive/RPG mechanics, and the excellent speed and visciousness DBX excels at.  To top it all off, there's a high skill ceiling and strategic considerations to master.  Race and gender even change how you play dramatically.The story is pure DBZ ridiculousness and had a definite nostalgia drawing me through it every step of the way.  Parallel Quests and their hidden requirements affect character skin unlocks, item / ability drops, score, experience, zenni, etc...  Hiring NPC versions of players to be your minions on your adventures is pretty fun.  Having other Time Patrollers/Players appear randomly in your Parallel Quests to give you the chance at a dragon ball, which you earned from an embearded mini-me Friezan named IzyerFriezaRun'n? or a myopic elder called MasterNoshit is downright hilarious at times, and lets you test their layout against your own :)I've never cared to perfect my mission scores in other fighting games.  However, this game gives you excellent benefits and rewards for doing so.  And, it's a joy to play through old matches.  You know what is required for a perfect score, you've had epic battles and close calls and, if you choose not to don OP gear on your alts - there are no restrictions of any kind except the odd race / gender item-, then you can have an honest to god challenge on your hands.  This game is very difficult if you are not built right, or if you do not know how to manage your Ki / Stamina, or a thousand other consierations.  The first real missions will likely frustrate 90% of players, but I doubt any will complain.  It's all part of becoming the strongest in the Universe.  See you all in the player World Martial Arts Tournament.  Which is a thing.Buy it already!  Get Goku's hair, now comes in SSJ, or Master Roshi's beard, or Yamcha's bandit sword, or a signature move from a master like Big Bang and Gallic Gun.  DBX almost perfectly weaves MMORPG aspects into the fighting archetype.  The poses and animations and canned chat make for some bombastically funny moments in town.  So many fans, and no manual chat system make for a far friendlier and entertaining environment than pretty much every other online game ever.  And, really, there's a World Martial Arts Tournament.  For us.  What fan could resist throwing their wallets at the chance to compete for real?"

The only thing I cannot stand is that there is no real in game chat system. To get some of the best items in the game you have to explain what to do in the mission. Super vegeta for example, you must let krillin die in the mission. How the hell are you supposed to tell people that without chat?! I must have done this mission about 10 times and everyone just keeps killing frieza before he can kill krillin.10/10 for people with a headset.6/10 for people without."

The reason behind that is you can't play the story line with friends or pretty much anything related to it. Only thing to me that they did co-op was what they called PQ mission which means parallel quests they did a good job of that but if there is only co-op in one and not the other i can't really say im playing co-op because the majority is only singleplaye. Don't get me wronge i love the game and it has alot of areas that could do to fix but don't sell a game that doesn't really have alot of what the devs call co-op. I may change my review positive but with the lack of co-op i may not at all i prey if there is another DB game they correct there mistakes but until then this is the last game i will buy from them.

Lots of colors to choose from, a fair selection of races that make sense, etc. Could it be better? Yes, but no other previous Dragonball title has been this detailed.-The most addicting Dragonball game yet!-Missions and Quests do a fair job mixing things up a bit. Sometimes making things feel either less or more grindy, easier or more challenging.-The game runs flawlessly on my system and to be honest, my processor and hard drive need an upgrade.-3 v 3 battles are crazy fun, but sometimes disorienting, haha.-If you are a fan of fighting games and a fan of Dragonballz series, you'll get time out of this to enjoy.------------------------------------------NEUTRAL:-Clothes will effect your character's stats. I like this and at the same time, I don't. Kind of wish we could wear what we want and get the stats we want when we unlock them of course.-Occasionally the ally AIs are useful to me. I had a small slice of life left, I hid from the mean old bad guys and they finished them off for me. : D-Great music, but its missing some classic tunes from the TV anime series-You can't fly in the town area-There should have been a couple more playable races in here. Why can't I be a Saibaman? :P------------------------------------------CONS:-RNG system! It feels like no matter how many times you play something, an item will never drop to you!-Your custom character does not talk. Even if they gave us only three different voice options, that would have been much better than this.-There is NO alighnment system! What if I want to help screw up the time line and be a villian!? > :)-Some semi-major characters don't exist in the game. As in you either don't see them or can't use them-There are a few select missions where you have to hold the AIs hand and keep them alive. What makes this worse is ALLY heal items will NOT heal them. This includes the Story Allies and PQ Allies!-Fighting the Great Apes is very under challenging. Even if you are weak, you can still beat them, it'll just take longer.-Cheaters! Lots of them! Through simple manipulation of their Save Data, they can make their characters as strong or weak as they want and unlock everything with a few minor clicks!! Completely ruins the progression in this game and makes PvP with randoms pointless."

,Not Recommended,323470,15245581,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,TreesDontTalk,"So I finally beat the main story of this today and I will say this, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is not worth $60. It is an unfinished mess of a game that clearly was not ready for release yet. While I enjoyed my time making my own character and joining in the classic DBZ battles, I cannot ignore the blatant problems that are so obvious and make it so hard to enjoy this game.Let's start with online play. My character is LVL 52 and I only got there doing everything solo. At no time have I ever been able to connect and do parallel quests with other players, can't connect in quick match, can't see them in any rooms and the player list barely registers any players on the server. What is the point of even including multiplayer? It is so broken it is laughable, and any contact I have had was sloppy, laggy PVP that was just impossible to play.Then there's the AI. Okay so, being that I couldn't play quests with players means I have to resort to AI partners. The partner AI is garbage at best,  you'll find your partners dying all the time and thinking, ""Wow, how the ♥♥♥♥ did Frieza just kill Beerus by himself? That's amazing. ♥♥♥♥ this game."" Which brings me to my next point which is that the enemy AI and programming is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. I swear the developers hate us because they programmed the cheapest, most ♥♥♥♥ed up AI combat scenarios ever. Some enemies have god armor, and cannot be staggered by hits. In addition they may have infinite Ki/stamina and spam the same attack over and over and over. I feel like if I can fight and kill Beerus in a 1v1, then how the ♥♥♥♥ can Android 17 and 18 beat my♥♥♥♥♥so bad? Or why the hell are all the super saiyans non staggered and infinite Ki? Jesus I can only take Super Kamehameha so many times throughout a match without throwing my controller.And then there's the story.So I just beat the game right, and may I say it was a seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story you go through. Sure I'm fine with ripping off Time Cop and helping the DBZ universe get fixed, but it seems like they put so much emphasis into the damn Saiyan and Frieza sagas and then just said, ""♥♥♥♥ it! This game is getting too damn long!"" Once I beat Frieza and *SPOILER ALERT*I was already fighting Cell and I was like, ""Wait a minute.....they skipped some♥♥♥♥♥♥"" And it didn't stop there. Immediately I found after the Cell Saga I beat the Buu saga in what was like the blink of an eye and then there was the end of the game. So yeah, I wanted the full DBZ experience and it was decent up until the Cell Saga, then it fell very flat very quickly.I could go on to ♥♥♥♥♥ about things like how the RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and how the framerate and tearing and graphics are crap, but you get the idea.Dragon Ball Xenoverse was a dissapointment and I was angry that I wasted 60 dollars on this game when I guess I should have waited for it to be patched and gone down in price. I will not be buying the DLC and I suggest you wait on this thing to get a huge price drop if you really want it. It's unfinished and it seriously needs some work done before I can recommend it. Shame on you Bandai/Namco and shame on you Dimps.4/10"

Rather than being a fighting game like the Budokai series, it is more similar to Monster Hunter or God Eater. You gain experience after each mission. The story is unlike other DragonBall games as it focuses on a new character, YOU! You get to pick your race, skills and clothes and later on you get even more choice. While you can boost your abilities across many areas, it usually helps to specialise in one or two. While there were server troubles initially most of these have been fixed. One downside is that the default DragonBall characters are generic and boring in comparison with your custom characters, but they are still fun to play as. Online play seems good and you can take part in 3-player co-op. A very enjoyable game."

The controls are clunky and unresponsive at points. You can be beating an enemy to a pulp and then have your whole trajectory switched to the space opposite of your enemy. CPU are horrendously overpowered. Ultimate attacks won't connect if the enemy is down, unlike the good fighters. To level up, you have to do more than the story and often times you will be be largely underpowered by the next series of story battles. But i can't help but smile when my character jumps into an iconic DBZ scene like he owns the place. The fighting options given to you at the beginning of playing can be tailored slightly for your playing style. And the online is a fun experience if not only to see all the other great player characters made (my favorites being ""Black Krillin"" and ""Dale Gribble""). By all means buy it. But the servers need work and youll be fighting the camera and overpowered CPU enemies for the first hour."

This ""armor"" makes it so when you use any attack your enemy will not flinch whatsoever. this armor can be broken eventually but after 2-3 long winded combos will fully regenerate, starting the process over again. Combine this with the fact that in one specific fight you have to fight two characters both with 2 full bars of health and a rather large amount of this armor and the entire thing becomes (in my opinion) un-handleable even for 50-60 levels.If there's something im doing wrong (IE an easy way to break this armor or mimic it) TELL ME.The rest of the aspects of the game are completly fine though, including multiple set-ups for one to use, clothes with different attributes, and a vast pool of moves."

A Dragon Ball Z game that is trying to be as close to the DB Universe as possible.2.)  Character Creation that allows you (or your OC) to take part in the game's story.3.)  *PC-problems for a former console nut* Controller Support.4.)  A pretty fun ride from the beginning.5.)  Be trained by people from the DB universeNegatives:1.)  It feels like Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja story has seeped into the game and it will show itself soon.2.)  The online aspect.  It's nice that you can play with your friends online but at least give me the ability to turn off the always-online feature.3.)  The DLC prices.  The Season Pass is already stretching it and the stand alones will make you say no after seeing what's inside.4.)  The intro (the very beginning of the game before you creature your character) is a ball dropper and defeats the purpose of the tutorial.5.)  You will cap, no matter what.  You better have built your character wisely.6.)  You better be happy with the 1st character you made because no new characters till you complete the main storyline.7.)  Masters that you choose are always present but switching to a master you want to learn from or learn to get an achievement turns into a hide-n-seek/grinding/waiting game.The Wild Cards:King.)  Random drops will be working against you day one.  If you want to be a super sayian, you better be the luckiest SOB of that month, of that day, of that year, of that second, after you do the all the quest requirements.Queen.)  The parallel quests will be the DBZ equivalent of From Software's fantasy games.  Especially if you don't have the right lvl or characters.  Pray to what every diety you believe in if the game decides to drop you in a quest againts 2-3 opponents off the bat without getting to support.Jack.)  The character creation is very limited and I haven't even gotten to the clothes.  For that see King.) and Negatives 2.).Joker.)  The leveling, soul, and clothing buff systems, will hurt you if you're not careful. (hope you were paying attention during the tutorial)  In honesty, the leveling system should have been like DBZ budokai 3.Personal score:  A super sayian 2 out of a super sayian godOnce you make it isn't that special anymore.  Something that isn't as fun or rewarding as its older siblings, but still better than it's three other attempts to draw in a wider audience.  Maybe if the beamstruggles and clash struggles were put back in and the leveling systems from Bodukai 3 then I would probably give it a super sayian 4 for because even though the real pet peeves weren't fixed, you are trying to make the game a fun DBZ game.And make sure that when I go super sayian my hair ascends, just make two models for normal and super sayian for each hair.I recommend but get it on a sale for at least 15% off."

The parallel quest and story lines are awesome the graphics are perfect.The parts that I cant stand are the enemy computer ai. The enemies tend to fly in circles rather than actually fight prompting a chase rather than a fight. The controls, at least for the pc version, are terrible. Clunky at best cause the player to fire attacks in the wrong direction or not respond at all to the controls. the levels seen to be rushed causing the caracter to slide in random directions while on ground or small bumps it the terrain that cause your character to be shoved backward. it feels like the creators put all effort into custumiztion and left the other aspects of the game prone to bugs and frustrating involentary movements by characters.I do like this game and recommend it for people who like dbz or fighting games in general.

The game features highly customizable characters and is designed for multiple playthroughs. The bad part is the button mashing nature of the fighting mechanism, questionable OP skills, and grind to level or get certain items/skills.After the first playthrough, there's ""tricks"" to help with the XP grind and other items (skills and equipment) are transferred to new characters. Overall I think it's a decent DBZ/GT game for some mindless fun after a long day's work."
,Recommended,323470,15165397,"Posted: 1 April, 2015",all,JackaL,"I have been playing this game nearly every day since it came out...over a month now.It's perhaps one of the best DBZ games I've ever played. The character models look great. It's as if the anime went all 3D. The controls are tight and the combat is much more freeform than in past games. Instead of being stuck with the QTE-heavy strike range/blast range dichotomy, you can fly around freely in combat without having to do quick-time events to change positions. It's a very good combat system.The character creation system is reminiscent of Ultimate Tenkaichi, but with a lot more options. A LOT more. Character creation is the meat-and-potatoes of this game. Everything hinges on the character you create. It sucks a bit that you have to wait until you beat the story to create more characters, but at least you don't have to restart from scratch with each character. You pool resources such as costumes, special attacks, and money between all your characters. This was a huge releif and a huge time-saver. Very good system. Also, the mastery system is similar to the one in Ultimate Tenkaichi, but with less masters and more focus. There's a select pool of characters with whom you can interact, train, and learn new moves. Overall, it creates this virtual activity hub where you can roam around and do what you want. Perhaps the most open-ended DBZ game I've ever played.The story is pretty good and engaging. It's a little fan-fictiony at times, but it's not too over-the-top. The side quests are absolutely addictive, especially because a lot of the unlockables are gathered through the side quests. This leads me to issue #1: the drop rates for certain items are crazy low. You can repeat a quest 10 times (they're 10-15 minute quests, mind you) and still not get a single unlockable. You can play another quest and get nearly everything the first time. It's a bit strange and frustrating at times. It does make powerleveling much less tedious, though.Now, on to issue #2: online play, The servers are horrendously bad. When the game first came out, it wasn't unusual to be randomly kicked off the server. There were times I had to open my Task Manager because I couldn't get on the server and the game was essentially frozen. This leads to issue #3: there's no way to opt out of server connection. Everything is integrated into one virtual lobby. Either you connect to the server or you don't play (though sometimes, SOMETIMES, the game will let you play in offline mode if the server is down or there is a prolonged connection issue). Even doing the offline quests requires some server connection, which is insanely annoying. It's actually one of the most unreliable servers I've been on.Now, issue #4, which I hope will not be an issue too long. The frame rate can slow down or freeze momentarily at seemingly random times. It doesn't happen often enough to be a dealbreaker, but it shouldn't happen at all, especially with a capable rig like mine.If it wasn't for the fact this game is ridiculously fun and engrossing and nearly everything I could want in a DBZ game, the above mentioned issues would be the 4 nails in the coffin. But they're manageable. The core gameplay is what is ultimately important and its the solid gameplay offered by this game that allows me to forgive the noticable shortcomings. I don't pre-order very often for obvious reasons. This was worth pre-ordering. If you like Dragon Ball-themed fighting games, this would definitely be a good investment."

Should've been including with the game from the start. But thats coming from someone who has never liked the idea of DLC in the first place.I would only recommend this game to people who are actually into the DBZ story.

(Slight Spoilers Ahead)First my settings: I play with Nvidia SLI 980 GTX @ 4K DSR resolution and maximum settings at 60 FPS.The great:  (Things that hit the mark perfectly)~The introduction is amazing~The Game OST is very nice and I like it.~The Creation of a character with the races well thought out is nice, giving the game replay value.~The presentation is amazing of how they fit your character into the story without it feeling too out of place.~The graphics style make you say ""Its a dragonball game, in the dragonball universe"" as it was very nicely done.~Just Guard and Guard Break along with throws prevents a player from just holding block all day long.~Ground and Air Combat Feel Different, which is a nice thing.~Seamless Transition from Keyboard Mode to Controller Mode. (This surprised me a lot)~Having an Online Component is great for any fighting based/Progression based game. It allows a player to feel the ""Coming of Age Story"" that DBZ really is through their characters as they improve, while giving every player when servers are fixed the ability to actually play the fighting game online in various formats online. Something every fighting game deserves as a standard in todays day.~Menu is done well and is easy to manage.~This game is actually fun and while grinding does exist, I can forgive it due to the fact Dragonball really is about growing and this game allows that feeling deeper than what i see come from other fighting games.The Good (Things that are half in-half out)~Gear Based/Level Based progression allows players to keep on playing and discovering new things.~Although there are plenty of skills, it all boils down to wether you are a physical fighter, or a special move fighter around KI Specials or Physical Specials~Transformation Implementation is done well, but later on Saiyans become dependent on raising Ki Levels, Transforming to Boost their powers, and then while their stamina is draining, Firing off their special and Ultimate Attacks.~Controllers work great, but not every controller has good bandwidth or enough buttons. (Tech Issue)~The NPCs are nice in the Offline Lobby, but they also get in the way. It makes the offline game feel like an MMORPG and kind of distorts things when you see such a difference in power. I've seen Level 80 walking around Offline. I feel sometimes they are litering the area too.~The Costumes in the Costume Shop are nice, but they need to have the increases and decreases not just expressed numerically but also in the stats of the character. Something like (Stat +/- (modified stat)) would be really nice. If I equipped something with three health arrows and my health was 10. It should say ""10 + 3"" to be able to mentaly and visually know what we are getting for each piece.~Items are nice, but form a dependency as well. They increase the feel of being in the Dragonball Universe. Of course its up to the players choice and helps with builds as Namekians have better Item use.~Being Good or Evil in Parallel Missions (Depending on Mission) like I am one of those players who loves kicking Kakkarot's♥♥♥♥♥:)~You get EXP based on the way you clear the mission. It ranks up to Z rank. This is good at monitoring the kind of gameplay that you have, but it also punishes you for the gameplay that you do not have. It becomes then a job of balancing a character based on maximizing experience points, rather than actually playing to your heart's content. The Solution then becomes to level up very high and then play missions through overpowering them.~The Voice Acting is decent to good. There is voice acting also based on characters who are together or facing others as enemies. The reason why its under ""Good"" is because we remember watching DBZ growing up and even with DBZ Abridged out there....we are now used to certain voice actors having roles from the past that we can tell when any character sounds out of place.The bad:~Soul Powers increase moves, but usually if you use master's moves. Example is filling out your bar with one masters moves and a soul to play like a character even though you look different. Gets in the way of customization at times.~The story skips over very wide gaps. The first two missions are the beginning and end of Saiyan Saga, then two or three missions later you are done with Ginyu and Freeza Saga. Then they skip all the way to the end of the Perfect Cell Saga to the final battle setup. Due to this, the difficulty spikes,~All the Clothes count as gear and equipment. You need these to help your style, but if you wish to wear clothes for the hell of just wearing clothes, you are out of luck. A player can look at your clothes and tell what kind of build you are going for.~Blocking is not an instant thing, and sometimes it feels delayed....(counter to the GREAT comment on JG)~There are times when a player enters a HUD while in Combat, Sometimes it disables everything else. Like sometimes I can't block an attack or move out of the way when I have the item screen opened up.~Characters were left out, and due to this part of the stories were altered. Where is Yajirobi in all of this? How about Korin? or Chiaotzu? in the Saiyan Saga....~The game has you pay for DLC initially upon release which is a Season Pass. I bought the season pass hoping they add a lot so in paying for it we do not know exactly how much we will get. Will we get more than what we paid for it? or less?~CURRENT ISSUE: Connecting to the Servers Online does not let enough people in due to overload. I have to start steam on Offline Mode in order to play the game.~Horrible AI in Defense/Protection Parallel Quests of NPCs you need to protect.~The offline single-combat on low levels is hard to almost impossible. The enemies have usually more of everything than you do. You gotta be cheap to win and its amazing how good their AI actually is when fighting them, but how bad their AI is when they are fighting alongside you on Parallel Missions.~No ""It's Over 9000"" Line! or ""Has anyone seen my arm, you can't miss it...Its green!"" Line :(Game Rating: B-This game has a lot of potential going for itself and done right can become an A-Class Title. Being able to select your skills, gear up and have measurable progression is nice for long-term play. This game really is a GEM to Dragonball fans everywhere.I found my performance to be smooth playing through the game, but this game needs more of everything. You will play through the same Parallel Quest many times in hoping that you get the trigger to bring in the tougher fights to chance at getting certain drops or clears.What makes this game enjoyable is that if you are a Dragonball fan it makes you feel like you are in the dragonball universe. Also, I think a lot of players love the female villain character and her costume as well.Remember, no game is perfect and bugless. I feel this game did suffer from ""lack of content"" in the sense that many games are rushed out the door and then to make extra money, one is expected to buy DLC packages on Day 1. This is one of the few games I've bought DLC since launch (Civ V was my other one) and enjoyed it. Basically, this game is in need of a little more of everything. Time, and a few fixes and this game would be incredibly golden.There really is tremendous potential here and all the memories of my teenagehood came back.Also, yea!!! Frieza is still an insult-humor/comical/sarcastic badass. You will love the voice acting during that part. ;)Note: The ""minus"" part in the B is the fact that at launch the servers started having problems and those who bought the game at launch like myself are stuck in a First Come, First Serve setup. Companies really need to plan more carefuly their launches."

,Recommended,323470,14708225,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Valapatto,"I've spent about 36 hours since the release that occurred two days ago playing this game. This should say something how addicting/hooking it is.Pros:- Smooth PC controls for a game that clearly is made with console controller in mind- Great amount of different Super and Ultimate skills to customize the characters- Nice cartoon like graphics that run well even at higher frame rates- Interesting main story- PvP and Co-op matches run smoothly with hardly any latency issues- Opponent offer different amounts of challenge- Decent amount of characters with most main chatacters of the series availableCons:- The server(s) are notably unstable and occasionally let you to play only few matches before disconnecting you- The difficulty level of the main story increases slightly too quickly, likely requiring you to grind some unneccessary parallel quests to be able to continue with the story. However slowly grinding more challenging opponents with no-brainer attacks in order to beat them is faster and more plausible than leveling the character to apparently required level- Vertical movement could be smoother- The normal attack combinations are way too simple and require hardly any focus as semi-randomly clicking both mouse buttons gives you decent results- The normal attacks cannot be customized in any way and are only affected by your race and gender selection- Gender affects stats, and whilst it might not be a con as it gives some more customization besides race selection, I'd rather see the effects gender neutral- Being outnumbered makes the game notably harder and occasionally ruins the match when all three opponents decide to use their Super/Ultimate skills chained together without hardly any chance of countering- The same healing & boosting potions that are available in PvE matches are also available in PvP matches. This includes the regen potions that last for minute or so and can heal you basically just as fast as your opponent deals damage, ruining the 3 minute long matches- The match making system doesn't let you examine the level of your opponent before starting the game (you can end up against totally overpowered opponents if you do not limit the accepted levels)- The amount of available matches is low with usually only couple available (may be better later on)- The game requires you to move around the Toki Toki city to access shops and matches. This may give the game some RPG feeling and allow socializing with other players, but is mostly unneccessary and occasionally even annoying especially when you need to run 100m to start another match- You cannot preview the piece of clothing you're about to purchase- Clothing affects both visual and stats (you can't have the best looking clothes without sacrifing your stats)- The alteration of your characters hair, face etc requires grinding 7 dragonballs (see more below)- You can make several preset equipment & skill sets BUT they all share the same stat points, making you unable to make sets that are based on totally different styles e.g. melee and Ki blasts- Wishes from collecting all 7 Dragonballs allow you to access some unique rewards including 3 characters, several skills, stat point reset, character remake and some clothing options. This wouldn't be too bad unless the DB's would be only available from grinding/farming- Some if not most of the skills and clothes need to be unlocked through grinding parallel quests and require some vague goals to be achieved- Unlocking single specific skill or item generally requires annoying amount of grindingDespite the notable amount of issues I've found within the game I still like playing it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's into fighting/rpg games and especially if you're into DBZ."

,Recommended,323470,14709501,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Hagzor the wizard,"I came into Xenoverse thinking the worst after the poor showing DBZ games have had on the consoles in the last few years so its surprisingly how well made this game is. The first thing of note is what this actually is. The creators have tried a different approach in extending the life of the game with this odd mmo but not a mmo type of progression. It kinda works in an odd way but i will get to that later.First off you create a own character. Theres a choice between all the races u expect , human, Saiyan, Namekian and then the Buu race and the Frost Demons who they just named the Frieza Race (because names are hard I guess?). From there you're taking to the hub world and this is the big thing about this game.From the hub world you can take missions which are separated into two different kinds,  find a master who will teach you new moves and abilities or shop for new moves and items to progress your character. Speaking of progression lets talk about your created character. The first big thing is the leveling system. You will find you will level up as you do missions  and you be able to put points into attributes such as hp, ki, basic attack etc. This means you play the character how you want. If it be a close up fighter or attacking from a far with stronger ranged attacks. So whats the gameplay like? if you even played the Tenkaichi games then you not what to expect. it also has 2 v2 or  3 v 3 which is nice.Ive also noticed a grind to the game. everything was alright up till i got to the Cell saga. then once i fought Cell the game took a drastic turn in difficulty. My Attacks did nothing to him, he was pretty much invulnerable and took little damage. As it turned out Cell was level 30 and at the time i was only 20. There are a bunch of quests that are different to the main story missions and this is where the grind happens. These repeatable quests have chance rewards stuck to them such as the ability for the Super Saiyan skill and Moves. I found myself repeating these missions multiple times trying to get these rewards which turns out to be intended design to level up. Right now i'm 32 or near and the next story mission enemy (its Cell again) is something like 42 so the game expects me to level up using the secondary quests to progress the story quests.  Its not that badl as you find yourself gaining the levels fairly quickly and the quests can be played with other people online so its ok.As of right now unfortunately playing with other people is difficult because the servers are pretty much broken. The game does have an offline mode but online is really want you want to be playing and right now its impossible to even get into a online part plus when you finally do it's plagued with constant disconnects. Its disappointing that in 2015 we still seem to have these problems with games that are intended to be online all the time. Maybe if there would of been a beta to stress test it might have not been an issue but hell it probably would have been.There are other issues i have with the game such as the disappointing transformations the player characters have in that the Super Saiyan ability doesn’t even change the hair and just turns and it yellow. The voice acting is pretty awful and the new villains of the game are fairly boring and not that interesting.  I tend to find the cutscenes disappointing as well. Namco Bandai have done good work in the past with Naruto and DBZ games in creating moments within their  engines but here i feel like they failed. For one the game just doesn’t look as good as the Naruto games or even going as far back as something like Burst Limit. The character just don’t animate. Mouths hardly move and sometimes it feels like i'm watching still images, it just feels lazy to me considering what they done before.With that said If you're fan of Dragon Ball z theres a huge amount of content to keep you going for a while and there something satisfying about progression your character. It truly feels like the team created something they wanted the fans to play for a long time and enjoy and I feel like they accomplished that goal. If you fan its an easy recommendation."

Until now.. from my experience with the DBZ series I can say for a fact almost all of them have always had story missions and sidequests related to the story which almost always became repetitive. However, Xenoverse offers something new and unique which I never really saw coming. Not only is the story twisted... one can say it's altered and changed and best of all it's up to you to fix it. Yes. You, not Goku or Vegeta, or any other DBZ characters. You will dive into the world of Dragon Ball and become your own unique character and go alongside other DBZ characters to help fix the timeline. The gameplay is different, the game itself feels entirely new, and best of all its a new series to enjoy hours of fun with. So if you're hesitating on whether or not this is just going to be a repetitive game or anything like that, then you're surely mistaken. So don't hesitate and become a part of the DBXenoverse."
,Recommended,323470,15183084,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,Squishy,"I originally made a negative review on the game, but I'm going to change that, because, despite the issues with the game, it does remain enjoyable in some way.First of all, let's start with the negative things. The camera is REALLY weird and just like the AI, seems to do what it feels like doing, when it wants to do it,  The AI, seems to target things for no apparent reasons. In one stage, you can only weaken an enemy by aiming at a specific spot, but what do your companions do? Go toe to toe, within the enemy's range, non stop... Why do they do that exactly? Aside from making you loose while you're doing quite ok, they seem to serve next to no purpose at all :(. And no, it is not just Krillin that dies ^_^.The controls are a bit odd on a keyboard, you can really sense this was meant for a controller, and Mice+keyboard, while kinda playable, becomes painful quickly. The gaphics are, odd, but kinda fit with the anime's style, while they appear nice, a bit more polishing would not have hurt, regardless, it does look decent enough, and since the maps are not actually that huge, it seems to run quite well.I originally thought the game was taking a REALLY strong learning curve, since I kept dying extremelly quickly, turns out, the game has levels, and you need to increase your abilities. Seems obvious right? Well, I must have missed that part of the training telling me how to do this originally :). So yeah, I was a L1, fighting 3 L7's, no wonder I was getting beat to a pulp :). Thing is, and this is what made it, odd, as long as your in a fight/questing area, you can NOT level up. So while I kept trying and trying and trying, I never actually saw the levelling window since I was simply chaining the quests and following the things they told me to do :).Here's the other side of the coin: you can grind the lower levels in a matter of minutes. Find a L44 quest, get your♥♥♥♥♥beat, congratulation, you just leveled up :). Yeah, I can't see any issues here, like at all ^_^.There seems to be some online thingies, although, I never was asked to create an account, an all online features are ""offline"", I'm probably missing something somewhere again ^_^.The only thing is the game's price. IT's way to expansive for what there is (pending being able to access the online features)."

The character creation essentially allows every DBZ fan to live his childhood dream of flying around being one of Earth’s greatest warriors. The visuals are nice and the voice acting – with some of the voice actors from the show – is superb.And that’s about all I have to say on the positive end.Negatively, this game has atrocious and unfair gameplay. Here is a non-exhaustive list of features the computer AI has that you don’t:1. If the computer blocks, even if you attack from behind, the attack is blocked and the opponent takes no damage. If you block and the computer hits you in the back, you take full damage.2. Saiyans that go Super Saiyan stay in that form infinitely, which essentially means infinite Ki to spam ultimate attacks (and, yes, the computer does that liberally). Players that go Super Saiyan revert when Ki runs out.3. Many bosses get Super Armor, making them immune to flinching. Players can only get limited Super Armor in limited ways.The game is an exercise in frustration where in later fights where you’re facing multiple opponents, they just gang up on you and chain-attack you until you die and you can’t do anything about it. There are missions where you fight multiple Super Saiyans and all they do is juggle you with ultimate beam attacks.It gets worse. There are ESCORT MISSIONS. You fail the mission if the inept ally AI dies, and oh yes the inept ally AI will die and you can do jack-all about it. There is a huge over-heaping of RNG in the game as well, where you need to grind for hours praying to RNG for drops – and get this: for a specific drop (the Dragon Balls), the chance goes DOWN the more Dragon Balls you have. And if all of this weren’t bad enough, as of this writing there has already been one round of nerfs. It’s like these developers are trying to put everything people hate about gaming into one package.I grinded up to max level only because I felt like I needed to “finish” a game I spent money on. Don’t make the same mistake I did."

I don't recommended it, however, I wouldn't go as far to say stay away from it.  It has beautiful parts and parts that are just fugly.Good Points:*There's no doubt about it the fights in this game capature the spirit of Dragon Ball Z.  From how every character moves ,to the types of attacks you can use, and the graphic quality of the game feels like you really are in the world of Dragon Ball.*As you progress through the game you'll unlock several characters and their forms based on when that fight happened.  In other words you could have Radditz Saga Goku or Sayian God Goku fighting beside you in the offline Parallel Quest against Broly or you could choose any of those characters.*Customizing a character is quick and easy, so is equiping them with various costume pieces, skills, and Z-souls. Unlike past Fighting games where a skill takes up ""X"" amount of slots, in this game you have 4 Super Slots and 3 Ultimate slots any of the type skills only take 1 slot.  Costumes come in all kinds of forms ranging from Kid Chi Chi's Outfit (DB) to Broly's outfit (DBZ Movie Broly the Legendary Super Sayian).  There's even a few customizable costumes that fit into the world, some of which can only be equiped by certian races (Majin, Namekian, and Freeze Race).  There's also sets that are gender based.*Masters consists of all well known characters of the series that will teach you their own special moves.*Storyline for the game follows my favorite DBZ Charater... Future Trunks.  With that said it is a Time Travel based story line which fits in perfectly with Future Trunks.  This story fits in well with the DB universe even if the reason for your costume character doesn't make any sense, (Spoiler) F. Trunks wishes for a warrior to save time... instead of doing it himself as this is his job.  The characters added in for the story fit into the DB universe perfectly, either by being quirky or just down right evil such as most of the villians in DB.Fails:*Main world is one small, tiny, itty bitty, town... with nothing to do but go to vendors, Parallel quests, and Battles (1v1, 2v2, 3v3).  You can also meet several characters from the series that you either Train Under (Masters) or who have more Parallel Quests.... why I don't know but they have some outside of the Parallel Quest stand.*Skills are the heart of the game allowing you to equip different attacks to beat down your foes... problem, about 80% of these are dropped in the Parallel Quests... RANDOMLY.  Good luck spending hours trying to get any one of them, case in point (x100 Big Bang Kamehameha) I must have run this PQ nearly 100 times over the course of two weeks before the skill finally dropped.  On the flip side of this, I got some skills such as F. Trunks's sword attacks on the first go, both of them.*This brings me to part of the problem with masters (which is pretty much the same problem as above).  Some masters will ask you to get a certain items at some point... those items can only be obtained through the drops in PQs.  Case in point on this is I had Vegeta as my master and needed to obtain the Z-soul ""I am the strongest on earth!"" to continue the training.  I'd farm this skill for a while, then continue on with the main story, farm, story, farm, story... I beat the game and hit max level long before I finally got this skill from the PQ drop.*Costume pieces... 85% of them are based on characters with just a few that are designed to fit into the DB universe that you can alter the colors of.  The biggest problem here is variety and stats.  If you are building a certain style (Melee/Strike or Ultimate) then really there is only one costume worth it, depending on the build.  You can equip any combination of outfits, but be prepared for weaker stats.*The first DLC is really short and miss leading.  You can complete the extra story missions in a few minutes IF you equip the right abilities, otherwise you'll end up stuck on the first fight for a while (which is what happened to me, you need some AOE skills, good luck farming them).  As for the miss leading part... the three extra story missions are all based on DBZ Movies (no spoiler other than the movie part).  Where GT comes into play is there are three extra PQs with Three more playable characters, if you've watched GT then the three characters you can guess at (GT Trunks, Kid Goku, and Pan).  Seeing as GT does not exist in the DB Universe (According to Akira Toriyama) I'm not sure why this is in the game, also considering Battle of the Gods was the first step into a new series.*Build Mechanics... I hate this.  What I mean is you have points per level that you put into your basic stats.  If you make a well-rounded character like what I believe a DB character should be you'll be underpowered for most fights and PvP.  If you  stack points in one area, well... you'll be good at one thing.  Case in point my balanced Earthling has decent Health, Ki, Stamina, and damage in Melee and Strike... but no damage at all with Ultimates.  This character can fight any in game... but can't get above an ""A"" ranking.  My Female Sayian is a Ultimate beast... but she has poor health, stamina, and damage in melee and strike.  Spamming Ultimate attacks with her in battles usually nets me an ""A"" to ""Z"" ranking.  In PvP both characters aren't worth jack.  However, this isn't the only problem... unstated stats are assigned to the character build.  For instance a Short Character will fast but have low health... a max height character will have higher health but will be slower.*FPS... yes FPS... here's why... One thing they did that I feel is just wrong for any game is FPS does come into play with whatever character you have.  Regeneration skills/abilities don't go off of your character but off your FPS... so if you can run the game at max FPS you'll have a very slight advantage over someone who cannot run it at full FPS.  Health, Ki, and Stamina will regain quicker, this applies to any skill/ability that restores any of them.  Frankly this is just an oddity they should never have made.*Server issues still happen, though connecting to the server isn't as much of a problem anymore.  Sometimes you'll find yourself unable to move while a battle is raging around you... OR you'll be the only one moving (sometimes this is lag but not always).  Had a game once where everyone could talk to me they just couldn't move and the NPCs weren't moving either... I could do damage to them so easy win.  Zoning to a new location bugs out on occasion, what will happen is you'll notice the portal acting unusually and trying to go through it just brings you right back in front of it.*Color options for customizations... I bring this up because it just seemed to me as odd that they have set colors instead of using a color wheel. My only guess at this is it was ""easier"" on the programmers.*Graphics... ok I said they are good for a DB game.  With today's gaming industry they are far from high quality.  There are some things in game tha can be destroyed due to battles, however, most of the world around you will have a texture that fades showing damage.*Lack of variety... It's a fighting game I get that.  However, there's only so many times you fight anything in this game before you just get bored.  Having to farm nearly everything in the game gets really old, really quickly.One thing I'll add about Costumes/Skills you can save them in your preset tab then move around in town in whatever.  So you can have a town setup then use a battle setup for fights.  This is neither a good thing or a bad thing, just something I felt like sharing in regards to my mixed feelings about costumes.Overall this game is worth it if you are a loyal DBZ Fan... not so much worth it if you’re looking for a new game and aren't too familiar with DBZ Lore/History."

The customizability of the moves is great, and the button combinations feel really organic to me. After playing for a bit, I know exactly how do to the combo I want just by watching my character. And blending all your abilities together really allows you to create techniques you can really call your own.I find the gamepad controls very intuitive, but not everyone is going to feel that way at first. You WILL get used to it, though.Graphics:I'm really glad Dimps brought back their cell shaded style; it's the only one that really works, I find.

,Recommended,323470,15136124,"Posted: 30 March, 2015",all,Drakor,"It's definitely not perfect, but the first in Budokai wasn't all that great which led to the fantastic Budokai 3, and the same happened with Tenkaichi. So if this game is this awesome already, surely if they made a sequel and expanded on pretty much everything, then it's definitely possible that we could have the next great DBZ games that fans argue is better than BT3 and B3.This game has plenty of things that make me smile, and even more that I find extremely fun. A few things felt cheap at first, like the super armor some enemies would get, but I found myself less frustrated by it the more I played because think about it, in the anime there were a few people with super armor too.I enjoy the levelling up aspect of it, trying new builds, and all the races are extremely unique. Even the genders have a couple things that make them unique. I would prefer if the armor didn't affect stats though, if I'm honest. In some cases the stats are negligible and you can use them regardless of if they're good for your build or not.I absolutely love the flight in this game, it's immersive to see your allies fly past you zigzagging or moving up and down like in the anime, and the new camera angles really bring out the action of DBZ, and once again, makes it feel more like the anime.The combat doesn't have much depth in terms of combos, but that's okay with me because personally I'm not all that great at fighting games to begin with. This game focuses more on timing, positioning, preparation, and keeping an eye on your ki and stamina, while trying to figure out how much of their recources your enemy has left, than memorizing a bunch of combos. It's more of a Smash Bros than a Tekken or Mortal Kombat.Everyone knows it's a big cliche, but everyone also knows that deep down they want to be part of the DBZ universe. This game does just that, and I enjoyed it. One of my favorite abilities is Destructo Disc, but out of everyone, Krillin has it. So it's used once or twice and that's it, no more usefulness. But in this game, if a weak character has an awesome move, you can give that move the justice it deserves!The character roster isn't as impressive as BT3, but all of the characters that you really need are here. You can recreate just about any fight in the DBZ universe, and you can definitely recreate all the major fights. But the roster really isn't too big a deal considering you'll be using your custom character about 95% of the time.People have had two main complaints with this game from what I've seen: 1) The servers. I've seen a lot of people rant and rage over them, saying they can barely play a match and sometimes can't even log on to the single player content. I got this game about a week ago and have had no issues, so either I'm lucky or the servers have been fixed. 2) RNG. Maybe it's because RPGs are my favorite genre, and I've been playing them since I could read, but this game's RNG doesn't really seem all that bad to me. People are saying they'll farm something for hours and hours and never see it, but so far that hasn't really happened to me. Don't get me wrong, I've had to farm for a while to get a certain Z-Soul for a quest, or when I farmed Chain Destructo Disc Barrage, but even then I got it fairly quick, after around 20-25 tries. Then others, like Super Saiyan, I got on about the fifth try. So either I'm lucky, or most people playing this game just aren't used to having to farm for things, which is understandable.So I say you should give this game a shot if you're on the fence. You'll enjoy it the most if you're a fan of the Tenkaichi games, are a fan of RPGs, and obviously a fan of DBZ. If you're looking for tons of depth in the combat itself, I'd look elsewhere.Oh, and the lip syncing is horrible, but that's a common theme in most Japanese games.tl;dr Buy this game, beat things up, get stronger, then beat up tougher things. Much fun. Also laser beams."

,Recommended,323470,14763465,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,stevenonce,"I'm really enjoying this game. The missions get a little repetitive, but that's the joy of finding friends to play with. I wish they'd put a recommended level on story missions, so I could know how much leveling should be done in between story missions, but the story is still fun and challenging without it. They also don't point the master system out up front, and that's probably something you need to keep an eye out for. I didn't get my first master until after Ginyu because I assumed that the game would give me a mission to go and get one. Don't wait that long, go look for Piccolo or Krillen as soon as possible so you can at least start on someone's missions. The skills from your master are so much better than ones you pick up in the early game, and they really help for beating some of the harder ""boss"" types.Also, if you've got a crappier computer, don't worry you can still play this game. I've got a quad core laptop with a bad video card, but I can still play this game without any lag. It gets a little hot, but that's what a $10 from Wal-Mart is for. I've played for 3 hours straight and not had a single problem. And if you don't have a controller, that's fine too. I started out KB+M and did just fine, I only switched to controller so I could hook up to a TV and sit back and enjoy the game. But it's seriously hard to switch between the two, so I'd suggest choosing one and sticking to it."

,Recommended,323470,14690771,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,KEGruber,"As of now, the PC version of this game is adequate. I haven't played a Dragon Ball game since Budokai 3, and of course that was on console, so it has been awhile for me; a lot of things have changed since then as well. The game blows through the tutorial quite quickly, and as of now, i cannot figure out how to go through it again; I do not see any sort of option for training either. As well, the options menu does not go over combination keys to figure out how to do moves such as vanish (which is another problem on its own right now), or grabbing moves.The vanish feature seems to be bugged; it seems while playing with a keyboard and mouse, you only vanish directly in front of the attacker, WHERE YOU JUST WERE, so the vanish doesn't help on that front. When i use my p[laystation controller though, i am able to vanish behind the target. The locking on system is kind of crap too, the game tells you when locked on that all attacks will be towards that lock, but there have been many times where my goku-blast-whatcha-spell-it goes in the complete opposite direction of the locked on target; then they of course attack me, i try and vanish, to only appear right in front of them again, and continue to be hit.Macros on your mouse are definitely a most have for a fighting game if you are not going to be using a controller.The games free roam what ever you want to call in between main story missions is pointless to me. I would have much preferred the original menu: click, choose, and play option instead. Now i have to make my character run around to go do those things instead; which takes way to long to move around.oh, anohter thing: when i have the resolution set to the highest option and all settings maxed out, any ki blasts do not appear, only in 1080 resolution. I am not a fan of how the English voices do not match up with the characters mouth movement. it is somewhat annoying to see. Visually, the game looks pretty good for trying to keep it like the anime, but for the PC. i think upping some textures and more AA options would have been nice.Overall, the game IS fun, but be prepared to deal with some bull crap when you're going to play it."

Far from it.Combat has its own problems, one of them is blocking. You can’t block in the middle of a enemies combo. Which is annoying consider the CPU enemy can block during yours. I’m a martial art expert in the game, you should be enable to block, ♥♥♥♥ logic on this part. This is one of my big things I really don’t like.Next the graphics. It looks great but for some parts you have a lot of screen tearing and texture glitches, but even with a GTX 980 or a GTX 780 Ti this shouldn’t be a problem, v-sync should fix this if not then it’s the game itself and not your graphics card, but this shouldn’t hinder you. Though I wish the video settings are a bit more advanced in the game itself. You can still change it in the NVidia panel.Sounds, Music etc. Now this is great. You can have the original Japanese voices with English subs, or have the voices in English with English subs. This I love, as anime fan and addicted watcher this is a big plus for me.Next we have the disconnecting problems, even as a 1ste day release they had problems, this brings back horrified memories. Specially as a Diablo 3 and Warcraft player. We have now 2015 I don’t think these connecting/disconnecting problems should even exist, yet it does. Bummer. I hope it will improve later on.Now I haven’t had the time to try the online parts consider I couldn’t play all the time due to the disconnecting problems, so sadly no opinion from me on that.Gameplay. Now this is a big surprise. This game plays great on a keyboard with mouse. This surprised me, I love these kind of games but only with a game controller, and now with this game with a keyboard. It’s tricky in the beginning if you don’t know the controls and key bindings, but you’ll get used to it. Even though it plays great with the keyboard and mouse I still prefer the game controller, but that is my personal opinion. If you like to play with a keyboard and mouse, then go for it.The side missions/quest are cool and fun to do, though not if you need to grind them for a specific skill or item, it sometimes can be a bit annoying. Even collecting materials can be a bit of a bore, but hey, we can't have everything.Overall from what I have played so far it’s a great game, I would rate this game an 8 out of 10."

The story and voice acting are decent for the most part, but the writing can be a little painful sometimes.BUT, there's one major thing holding the game back right now. The game's launch is a disaster. The servers suck right now (On PC at least, can't say much for consoles). The PC version didn't have a network test, and now it suffers for it. You'll lose connection to the servers constantly, and even if you're playing single player, you'll be kicked right back to the title screen.

Literally the only problem is the server issues, which are probably just because it's much more popular than they anticipated. Hopefully it will get fixed up soon.The story is close enough to DBZ to be familiar, and different enough to be interesting. The levelling is simple and subtle, but effective. Sometimes you will get smashed in story mode, so you go off and train a bit, and then you can beat the level. It works really really well. The class differences are small enough so that none are particularly overpowered (that I've seen) but still noticable. A fair amount of gear choices for fun appearances, and some stat variation. Then the ultimate customisation is the move list, where you can have whatever suits your play style, with fun ways of unlocking them.The music is pretty lame, and a few more volume levels would be good, it's often hard to hear voice chat without other sounds completely off. Graphically it's simple, but looks nice.Honestly I can't fault this game, apart from the network issues. Lots of fun, I've played 25 hours in like 3 days haha."

76561198044223358,Recommended,323470,15549500,"Posted: 25 April, 2015",all,jjkurtz03,"(WARNING: May contain potential small spoilers.)Overall I love this game. This is hands down the best DBZ game ever made, but take that with a grain of salt considering its former competition. I loved the RPG elements in addition to the minimalist-sandbox style of gameplay. I enjoy the custimazation and races to choose from, and the story does a great job of focusing on you instead of the same old hum-drum DBZ story line that we have all seen 10 billion times. That being said, towards the end of the Buu Saga and on, this game turns from challenging to almost impossible in certain situations. In my personal opinion it is garbage in the late game. Here are a few pet peeves I had which could have been EASILY executed better by the devs:-The custimization of the races felt very bland. They basically took the hair, featurs, builds and voices off of most of the key characters in the show and made them interchangable. While it did add some fun customization, it was extremely generic and it was clear from the start that little effort was put into it.-Certain skills such as Super Saiyan 1/2 and Energy Charge/Full Power Charge/Maximum Charge come WAY too late in the story progression. You can't buy Super Saiyan 1 until after clearing the Cell Saga and you can't buy Super Saiyan 2 until after the Buu Saga. It's infuriating to try and complete the Sagas without these skills as the enemies are rocking super saiyan 2 or 3 against you, and can literally rock your world in 10 seconds flat. That doesn't even consider skills like Super Vegeta 1/2 (which is the Super Saiyan equivalent to blast specialists) cannot be bought at any point and must be farmed on PQ missions at an absurdly low drop rate. I tried to get Super Vegeta 1 at least 50 times and never saw it drop once. Important skills such as Maximum Charge must either be farmed on one of the absolute worst PQ missions (prepare to rage quit A LOT) or it can only be bought when you clear the game the first time. The timing of skills being available in the shop, or even available at all was extremely discouraging for me at certain points.-In the later PQ missions the friendly AI stands there and floats watching you get smeared by multiple ultimate attacks for incredible amounts of time. I can't even tell you how many times I threw my controller down and just watched my guy get rocked while BOTH of the friendly AI literally did not throw a single punch at any enemy.-The computer AI is ridiculous. And I mean RIDICULOUS. I cannot even count how many times I've been perfectly comboed and rendered unable to even stand up until I'm obliterated by the computer AI (This didn't become a problem until after the Buu saga). Their attacks are flawless, they can break through your ultimate attacks like childs play. They are too overpowered overall in the later PQ missions/Story and the game crosses the line from challenging to infurating in more fights than I care to remember.-Single player missions (by yourself) felt like a bad joke as a blast specialist. You get absolutely no time to power up and your standard attack is equivalent to a fly attacking a T-rex. Blast specialists get infuriatingly manhandled in the later story missions and you have to overlevel your character immensly. In early to mid-game my character felt incredibly overpowered often times 1 or 2 shotting most enemies. Early game I felt like a monster (which I'll admit was pretty fun for awhile) and late game I felt completely useless without a meat shield to take the focus off of me. I didn't feel a happy medium anywhere as a blast specialist.-As a melee combat specialist your attacks do absolutely no damage until you get super saiyan and your super attacks are very difficult to chain together. The game is a bit easier (solo missions) but fights take twice as long and getting the Z rating in missions is near impossible until you hit high levels. That being said, when I hit late game and had Super Saiyan 2 it did feel pretty good.Overall I loved the game, but with the poor execution of the fighting mechanics and AI, I don't know that I would pay full price for it had I known. Wait for summer sale and pick this game up for $10-$20. It's worth it at that point."

Even when I'm getting completely DECIMATED, I still feel like I'm having a great time because the game itself is just so fun to play.

I wasn't sure if I'd like the new (well, new to me) fighting style but it is extremely smooth in this game. The story line finally wanders away from the ""playing along with the story... again"" and brings a unique spin to the story that I know and love. Plus, being able to create eight of your own characters is always a plus.This game has a nice MMO-ish feel to it without sacrificing it's fighting core. You can party up with people for ranked matches, casual matches, side quests, and the main story. If you don't have internet, it sets up AI that would act like other people, just with a little ""hire to join"" system. You can customize your character and if you want to get a certain Dragon Ball look, you can get it. The difficulty in this game is perfect. You can cruise through a couple missions but then spend ages trying to beat the next few, or grinding side quests to make it easier.This game isn't without its flaws though. There is a vast lack of tutorials for the online play. Constantly I see people asking for people to join their party, and others saying they want to join. But none of them know how to join. So the chat is constantly just spammed with people trying to join/start parties (for people that don't know how, pull up the pause menu and go to the 'Player List' selection and look at parties that you can join). The customization seems to be mostly for looks instead of actual stats, save for the Z-Souls. My one big complaint is the heavy reliance on RNG for the side quests. I don't mind if the bonus fights at the ends of missions happen only 50% of the time, and in fact, I enjoy the feeling of randomness and having to play through the missions multiple times. However, when things like an ""Ultimate Finish"" are random even after having done all the bonus objectives in a certain amount of time, which already requires luck with RNG. If I had to beat a rare bonus RNG'd fight in under five minutes and finish it with an Ultimate Attack, it should automatically give an Ultimate Finish, and not just roll again for the hell of it.All in all, I am really enjoying this game. I plan on working on 100% this game (we'll see how dedicated I can be) and seeing how♥♥♥♥♥♥I am in ranked matches. 8/10"

The game also sports an alarmingly well stocked roster, so don't worry about being unable to play your old favorites when the mood takes you.Though occasional camera glitches and some serious wonkiness with the translation and dubbing hold the game back from perfection, it still manages to come fairly close to being a DBZ fan's dream game and should make a fun diversion for everyone else.8/10"

This game is really more of an RPG than a straight up action game so loss of saved data is harsh.Anyways, that's the biggest bug so far. Other than that the animations are rigid, and not really quite as spectacular as you'd expect these days. It does look okay though, and there are little flairs that make you really feel like a DBZ character. For instance if you execute a fully charged energy/spirit attack on the ground it lives a giant groove in the ground. The sound effects are great, and the soundtrack is decent, but hilariously enough the VA is really bad... even with veteran VA from the series, and even one of the abridged guys on the team. The entire feel lands somewhere between MMO, and Action RPG/Fighting game. This is as much a fighting game as the Naruto ""fighting games"" It's more of an RPG and that's fine, and it does require a little skill in it's competitive format, but you're not going to be beating a high level character right off.It plays pretty similarly to the Tenkaichi games if you were wondering about the action portion, but you're equipped with power scanning abilities, and a scouter early on which makes for a fun immersive feature.  Using your scouter/power scan you can can explore areas and obtain items to mix together and make skills, healing items etc. So there's some minor exploration in the game too. You can pick your race which is neat, I wasn't sure what they were going to do with that, but it's an awesome feature. Essentially if you ever got to play the MMO it's basically that but more of an action game, and less MMO-ish. The hub world REALLY feels MMO-ish though... and because of that you'll feel little empty as you around a giant map filled with maybe a handful of NPC's to talk to. It's a lot of fun, but again it feels like assets from an MMO recycled into an action game... PC options are nearly non-existent, and it's really only playable on a pad.I like it, and feel like it has a lot of stuff to offer, and the action is a lot fun when you get the hang of it. Co-op is fun when it works, and the versus system is interesting but again not really worth your time. It's really a single player experience, with multiplayer feeling like it should belong but doesn't quite fit in the games gutted form. Oh forgot to mention, the game uses a lot of assets from the old MMO, soooooo yeah. There's a ton to do, and the story is a lot of fun but again it's awkward, good, but awkward. If you choose to buy though remember there is a save issue, and the servers are janky as hell... so you're not really guaranteed a flawless experience."

The targetting on the enemies is weird and it's just hard to switch over to another enemy because sometimes it won't let you. Lip syncing is just off, except in the animated cutscenes that look like Akira actually made them. Also, the servers are constantly crashing and it's just weird. Plus, Saiyans can only go up to ssj 2? Weird, but I can live with it. Graphics are nice and are better than Budakai Tenkaichi 3 for the Wii. Although, some levels are easy when they aren't supposed to be while there are ones that say they are extremely easy while they are actually not. The rating system, at least in my opinion, is broken and could use a little touch up. While we're at it, give us the option to heal our teammates because I can not tell you how many times I have lost one single mission just from one person dying. The enemy AI feels buggy since one second they want you dead then they next second after you hit them, they go towards your ally acting like one of those thin skinned hypocrites that can dish it out but can't take anything. I would recommend buying it, but be prepared for controller throwing/keyboard smashing at some of the harder levels, such as the one where you have to play as Ginyu and fight in Frieza's ship. So, unless you really can't stand fighters/brawlers, then you should get this game if you love anime, let alone Dragon Ball.

There are different ways to build characters to keep the game fun and you can also play with friends when your bored. My only complaint is the servers are not the best right now. Constantly geeting diconnected from Xenoverse and takes a while sometimes to log on. They have said that they are working on the servers so that is good. I recommend this game to anybody DBZ or not!

I am around 50-60% complete of the whole game, level 80 on my custom character and unlocked every single character.. and i am wanting more.. i will be buying the season pass..There are alot of people with 3-4 hours gameplay giving this crazy high ratings so here is my opinionPros- The town is a nice- Customization is ok- Fighting is decent, its alot closer to the budokai series its fast and repsonsive- The cutscenes are brilliant adding more DBZ content is always a good thingCons- The game is too hard, 3v1 - 5v1 etc silly frustrating fights that make no sense enemys that do crazy damage- No guides to the item system or explanation on how they work, have to equip before a fight otherwise you cant use them- I only figured out how to spend my skill points after the first 3-4 levels- Typical asain game style that has terrible menu systems and very poorly explained- Town physics are garbage, may aswell just be a town of blocks, you cant jump on anything, invisible walls are so 2000I'd avoid the game if you didnt want dissapointment..

At the time of writing it has multiple server issues, which cause crashes and booting from the game even during single player.  The fighting system is fairly boring without a huge amout of depth or strategy.  The charecters are limited to very samey combos with little unique flare in terms of mele ( for example on the game pad there is a single combo that lasts longer and thus dfoes mroe damage making it the best one in every situation).  The ki batsts have been altered so you can't charge them anymore so they become an easily dodged medium range attack that is again the same for every character.  Teleportation is now based on a stamina bar which is also used for dashing so you have to choose between moving around the map at a reasonable speed and ebiong able to dodge your opponents attacks, ( this can run out mid mele too which is very frustraiting).  Each character has their own set of special moves and finishers which are very pretty and feel good to use the first few times but quickly become broring as you'll end up using only one or two per character.The game's much touted character creater is paddling pool deep. you can chosse from five different races and then male or female which all have differnt attributes, which, at first glance looks varied.  However on further investigation of these classes one is very diffuclt to play on account of having speed penalites, and of the other four, only the saiyans have access to transformation techniques which make them the obvious choice as thay have more power and thus more damage.To add to this the single player is agnosising, there are several fights where opponents whon't react to yor attacks, but you react to theirs meaning they can stunlock you and defeat you in seconds.  There are multiple stage fights where if you lose you must do all of the preciding fighs again  ( in trh saiyan saga you must battle  5 saibamen with allies , five mroe saibamen without allies, Nappa with piccolo, Nappa without piccolo, then Nappan and vegeta all in a single health bar and lsoing rests the whole thing).   One last gripe about the single player there are several fights against multiple opponents, you can only attack and dodge the enemy you are locked onto meaningyou can be attack from behind or the flanks by enemies off screen and cannot teleport put of their attacks, you just have to wait from them to finish fall to the floor get up change locked on taget then you can carry on.TLDR the games is shallow, poorly designed, and only gets by on it IP. don'y buy it"

The game has a great story that integrates beautifully into the Dragon Ball theme. You will see familiar things from a different perspective. All the characters look really great and are very detailed. On that subject the sheer amount of detail in this game is just staggering and you will definitely get the feeling that this was a labour of love for the developers. For example of all the characters you will notice that same combos you do will look completely different on a character basis. For example if you pick Vegitto he will in melee combos cross his arms and work only with his foots like it was shown in the anime. And this goes for all characters everybody has a different ready stance, different basic moves and different ways to execute combos. Only the custom characters borrow movesets but that is fine they have to be based on something after all. Mortal Kombat could learn alot from this where you can't tell different styles apart because everybodies uppercut looks the same as does every jump heavy kick etc.Building your very own DB character is nothing short of great and as I already said it was so awesomely integrated into the whole franchise.The number of moves to unlock is huge and I have played only with a very small percentage of them. There is tons of stuff still to discover.Now onto why this game is hugely flawed in my opinion.The flaw is with what you will be doing all the time namely the combat system. In later stages of the game as soon as Super Saiyans show up this game degrates into an ultimate attack spamfest. The combat system actually rewards this kind of play more over skillful melee combos and you will see that the game has been designed completely with the utterly broken implementation of Super Saiyan in mind. It will actually force you to mindlessly spam ultimate attacks or you simply won't be able to succeed. How the non Saiyan races are suppossed to win this game from a certain point on is beyond me. And you too will rage when you are stun locked in Super Kamehamehas of three different Super Saiyans. If a little more thought would have gone into this combat system this game could have been legendary master piece.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes, for a Dragon Ball fan there is a ton of stuff to enjoy here. Characters conversing mid battle about known topics etc. Maybe all super moves that were ever shown in Dragon Ball to try for yourself. This game is great fun indeed. If the combat system flaw turns you off or you do not like to grind for stuff this game isn't for you and you should pass on it.8/10"

The plot starts off pretty good, with the interesting idea of seeing how the Dragon Ball timeline could have gotten screwed up if various things had happened differently, but it ultimately isn't used very well. Most it just falls back on ""what if the villain were even stronger?"", rather than more interesting questions like ""what if Frieza had brought the Ginyu Force with him to Namek in the first place?"" or ""what if Majin Vegeta actually had been fully under Babidi's control?"". It's also surprising how characters like King Cold and Android 16 don't appear even though you can create custom characters that look just like them. These definitely seem like missed opportunities.The combat is generally pretty interesting, but a lot of the special moves seem rather useless, so I quickly found a core group of abilities that I used and ignored most of the rest. The character customization is quite extensive, though there seem to be a lot more bad builds than good ones (recommendation: put most of your points into Basic Attack and either Strike Supers or Blast Supers - there's relatively little reason to use both). There's also something of an emphasis on grinding if you want to unlock everything, which can get annoying but does fit the Dragon Ball theme because it feels a lot like the training seen in the show.I haven't played any of the DLC, but all of it appears to be rather lastluster - there simply isn't enough content being offered there to justify the price.Despite all of this, DBZ fans will probably find plenty to like about Dragon Ball Xenoverse - I've certainly enjoyed playing it.

This game isn't the greatest by any means, far from it, as a lot of things are missing that would make it just stellar.We could do with more playable Dragonball Z characters. There were some that were just completely discarded from roster that are apart of the main story and that is just sad. No they aren't unlockable, they're just not there. Even if you bought the season pass this game will still be missing characters.Missions and general story content are quite lacking. The fully voiced over story along with the occasional animation and awesome in game graphics are great and all, but there needs to be more, and the season pass isn't going to save this game from it's short term lifespan if they take their time releasing 3 missions at a time. As of right now I have only 2 open slots for characters to be made with the rest being filled with level 80's. This has taken almost no time at all and the only reason I have as much play time on this game as I do, is 1) drop rates, 2) drop rates, and 3) dragonballs. Everyone knows the drop rates are abysmal, but that's part of how this game is trying to keep itself alive.Character creation is good, simple and fast. You never spend a whole lot of time dilly-dallying with this feature, but it has it's drawbacks. The biggest of which is that Humans and Saiyans all have exactly the same skins (hair, eyes, body types, clothes, etc.) and that other races are quite frankly, bland and lacking their own variety. With all of the countless races we've seen in both Dragonball and Dragonball Z over the years, you'd think that we could have some more variety when it came to races and even each individual races customization.Power variety is there, but this being an RPG of sorts, you primarily tend to go for the powers and abilities that do the most damage and offer the most survivability. It's impossible not to min/max in this game. The lack of customization of these powers aside from picking and choosing is another let down. I love using final flash, or spirit bomb, or whatever, but why can't I assign a color scheme to them at the very least? It wouldn't be that big of a feature to add and would allow so much more personalization for players.Transformations. Why only Super Saiyan? Seriously. Hurray for Kaioken, but ♥♥♥♥ that power. I made a Friezan soley for the purpose of being able to change forms into something awesome. No unlock potential for Humans or Nameks. No crazy alter ego's for Buus. Just Super Saiyan...and it wouldn't be so bad if Super Saiyan wasn't the bee's knees. Unlimited special attacks? Sign me right the ♥♥♥♥ on up.Game Dev: ""Here's 3 other race--""Me: ""No thanks! I'm good right here.""Game Dev: ""But each race has it's own bonuses. Like the Nameks who have stretchy arms and suck at everything. Or the Majin who have less stretchy arms and suck only slightly less than Nameks because they have powers only they can use. Or the Friezan who...well...they punch good? Have a single ki blast that stuns and takes forever to shoot? Ummm, look cool?""Me: ""Ya I'll take genertic appearance and all that for unlimited special attacks. Sure I may not have passive health recovery, or a slightly larger health pool or stamina pool or passively regenerate ki like the Humans, but I do have the the ability to turn Super Saiyan and just spam Ultimate attacks until the cows come home.""This game is still good, don't get me wrong, but it could have been so much better, and for the price tag it could have been a lot better. Hold out until this game comes out on sale and then pick it up."

From Dragonball to Dragonball Z and GT, this game is full of nods to these great series. Xenoverse caters towards this fanbase, so I can understand why it would hard to get into. If you take away the title and characters, what you are left with is a pretty generic fighting game. The combat, though fun and flashy, can get repetitive. Though that does not make this game have any less replay value. The amount of customization during character creation is really where this game shines. You can spend tons of time designing your perfect fighter. The mentor system also adds a nice element to the gameplay. What makes this game frustrating is the often buggy fighting which can be overlooked considering no game is bug-free. RNG also does this game a huge disservice because you can spend hours on hours looking for one piece of clothing (perhpas this is done to make the satisfaction when acquired even greater). All in all, Dragonball Xenoverse is a flashy, fun, grindy, repetitive yet replayable homage to Dragonball. So if you are at all a fan of the anime or just enjoy brawling with legendary fighters, gather the dragonballs, summon the eternal dragon and wish for luck with RNG (you'll need it). Let's just hope for an even better sequel."

As my brother put it, very similar to Phantasy Star online, but with all the flair and grit of a Dragon Ball fighting experience. It's not a standard fighter, more like a up and down brawler that has bigger maps than any Dragon Ball game today. Can get a bit repetitive but it's up to you to use all the content in a way that keeps that from happening. Definitely suggest it highly to any DBZ fans."

Though currently this week (Launch Week) it is plagued with disconnection issues. Putting that aside because I'm am sure in due time like any other game on launch server issues will be less of an issue. So on to the actual review.The story is based around Future Trunks and Time Lines. You get to create a custom character that you build upon during gameplay. You can create up to eight characters (***SPOILER*** You will only be able to unlock them once you've beaten the game the first time). You can create Male/Female Majin's, Male/Female Saiyens, Male/female Humans, Namekians and Frieza Clan. There really isn't much to play with for customization (I mean it's not like this is Skyrim or anything) but there are plenty of choices to go around.Without going nuts into detail you are summoned by Shenron after Future Trunks wishes for you. You are then appointed to work with him to correct corrupted timeline plots.Combat is really solid and responsive with a controller. The graphics are fantastic, though some may beg to differ. The AI can be a tad noobish late game by stun locking you if you let them, but for the most part you can take control of any situation. That is from my own personal experience, it may differ for others.And as a heads up to anyone who has or is planning on purchasing this game during the first week or so. Yes the servers are going to crash a lot, what game hasn't. If you put your Steam into Offline mode it will not connect to the servers making the game 100% playable without disconnection issues. Sure it may be counter intuitive but it works.In closing. If you're a fan of the Dragon Ball universe I'm sure you'll enjoy this game. And if you're a hardcore DB fan it's a must have."

Every race and gender has their own unique combat attacks to differentiate from each other which is a good thing.The Story mode cinematics in this game is very awesome especially if players are dbz fans, but if they're knew you might be amazed yet confused due to being new.The character creation is also decent as well with choices that are given. There should be more options, but for now this is Xenoverse first game so I hope for more in the future.The best thing about this game is players can invite friends to support them on quests to gather items to enhance their character or fight against each other in pvp.ConsHowever pvp isn't the best place in this game due to laggy players and sometimes spammers with latency support. The other part bad about this game is the chat. Players cannot freely chat with each other which I don't know why.The other bad part is that it's hard to find friends once entering multi lobby. Sometimes you might not be on the same server and to be honest players can't even tell what server they're actually on. The search enginer to find friends isn't the best either plus latency as well that can mess up the gameplay when pvping or doign quests.OverallNevertheless this is a good game to play especially with friends  or knock around on during free time and I do hope for  a sequel.I see this game as an prototype to gather intel from various of users to improve on their sequel.

,Recommended,323470,16729559,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Eminence,"As a standalone game Xenoverse would be mediocre at best. If you're not already in love with Dragonball this game should be a solid pass. That said, if you love Dragonball then you'll most likely enjoy this game. As much as I want to love this game being the DB fan I am it only gets a 6/10 from me.Story: 5/10The entire story revolves around you being summoned by shenron after a strong warrior is wished for to help defend time. You then go into all different parts of time helping the usual Z warriors beat the bad guys. It's a decent plotline but leaves much to be desired as you face stronger and stronger opponents without the difficulty scaling much. It gets to a point were you face Beerus and he's just as easily defeated as Raditz is in the first fight. Non of the bosses and anything special about them other than a larger health bar.Subquests:6/10Subquests, or PQ's as they're called in Xenoverse are basically add on missions were you go back and revisit missions or areas to fight different enemies who have or will be possessed by evil during the fight. These tend to be very similar to each other and don't really bring much to the table. The AI is the same and they use the exact same techniques without any variation.Graphics: 7/10Dragonball has always had cartoon style graphics because, well, it's a cartoon or anime as most would prefer. Though even on the maxed out settings you get some really weird looking stuff happening in the hub-world. Up close everything looks quite nice but as you look farther out you see the textures extremely blurred as they only load fully load as you get near them. This is a huge eyesore and it has no reason to it especially considering the low-res look of the game. Other than the hub world this seldom happens and looks quite nice, but the sheer fact you spend an large part of the game in the hub it really takes a toll on you.Combat:6/10The combat system is mediocre at best and extremely annoying the rest of the time. It's basically repeated left and right mouse button spam with the occasional super / ultra as they load. The biggest flaw is that the enemy AI gets a massive amount of KI (your chargeable ability you only get via combat) to begin with. Meaning you can literally come out of a portal or just at the start of the mission and you're already getting smashed with an ultra. It's one of the most frustrating things in the game made even worse when you're fighting multiple AI. While we're speaking of AI lets address how poor friendly AI is. The only use or AI in this game it to keep you from getting double, triple, or even quadruple teamed. It's so useless that almost every time I fail a ""main story"" quest is because a friendly died. It's pathetic. Then while they are alive all they seem to do is jump right in the way as you use your spec and they absorb all the damage.Audio:7/10Xeonverse has a decent audio track with some nice combat music and generally nice combat sound effects. Though they can get a bit repetitive at times.- Voice acting: 3/10The voices for this game are atrocious. The worst and most noticeable example of this is the supreme kai of time. Every line she speaks sounds extremely forced and it sounds like the voice actor was near gargling the mic as she spoke. It got to a point where I muted the character chatter and just read the text bubbles or subtitles.Overall:6/10If you're not in love with Dragonball you should pass on this. Even if you are a fan I'd strongly suggest only getting this on sale. It's quite short for a $50 game taking me only 22 hours to complete the main story and sidequests."

It runs so well it might as well be native. It immediately recognized my absolutely anonymous Gameware controller that even freakin' Nidhogg had trouble with. And more importantly than anything, it is Dragonball for PC, at last, and it is as glorious as you could imagine it. It's spectacular, cinematographic, and gives off an amazing sense of speed. The game blends 3/4 of fighting game with 1/4 RPG - you get to customize a character, level him/her up, buy equipment, items, skills. The fighting is relatively less technical than a purist of beat-em-up games might want - this is the only complaint you could have really. But it's quite minore, the fighting model is still plenty of fun and allows for one HECK of a show.And the rest is simply gorgeous. The look and feel are perfect; the music fits; the vibe is extremely faithful to the original (more than DBGT ever was in fact), the original character designs are believable, there's some delightful snippets of animation and I mean, the opening title is freakin' Cha-la-head-cha-la. It's as Dragonball as it gets. The new plot (involving time travel and fixing changes in history) is basically an excuse to get you the chance to meddle with the great moments of DBZ while still retaining a personal identity as your own character, and works perfectly. You also get to perform side quests which emulate different scenarios - for example, you get to accompany Raditz on Earth to try and convince Goku to come with him (the convincing is done with fists of course).Overall, I am truly satisfied. It's definitely a polished game, one made with great care that looks plenty good; but surprisingly, it also looks like a game made with real attention to the desires of the fans. It is distilled DBZ fanservice; and as such, I am perfectly happy with it. If at least once in your life you mimicked a KameHameHa or a Fusion Dance, you want to play this game."

XENOVERSE SERVERS ARE OFFLINE, CAN'T CONNECT TO XENOVERSE SERVERS RETURNING TO MAIN MENU. When you try to go back in it just says connected wtih out starting the game thank god you can ALT F4. Also even if you are wanting to do single player it still requires you to connect so you are boned if the servers are down. Also you dont have all of the character slots unlocked. i am a good bit into the game and i can still only have 1 character when there are about 8 other slots i can use. Even if you delete that character your new character will start off right where you left off but at level 1 so you get DEMELOISHED. Also it so far is very lacking in the character department. They say thery are going to be adding lots of characters with DLC so i reccomend the season pass. Now to the good. The Combat is Amazing, The Story is Amazing, The online fighting (when you can connect)is yep you guessed it AMAZING. Though the characters may be few at the moment they can have multiple diffrences in how they play. Now you are not super sayian the whole time, it only last a certain amount of time and depletes your stamina so it makes it balanced in online.

If you like Dragon ball Z, you should look into this.That being said, there are a few minor issues I have with the game:-Some events/characters were changed or left out of the main story. Obviously, they can't have everybody in the game, but characters like Android 16 would have been a great addition to the android saga missions. There is also a lack of Bulma and Chi Chi, I want my domestic abuse simulator, dang it (Please don't hate me, I was only kidding ;~;)! Although, as side characters, I understand their omission from the main story.-Some moves cannot be used outside of 1v1 matches. That feels incredibly restrictive. The only move I've come across (and it may be the only, correct me if I'm wrong) that does this is Body Switch, which would be awesome to use in missions. I realize that it's cheap, but that's what Captain Ginyu taught me to be! Maybe only being able to use it in already cleared missions would be a middle ground?-Character creation feels limited. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing, but your character either becomes mostly physical or mostly Ki based. There is little room for the middle and still being able to clear missions easily enough. Also transformations are limited outside of the Saiyan class.-I don't know why this one bothers me, but if my character just finished, let's say, the Buu saga, and did a 1v1 against Hercule, why should he stand a chance? I realize that balance is needed in a game like this, but if I want to destroy someone utterly, I should be able to. Again, not sure why that bothers me.-Time to get drops. It can take HOURS to get a drop you are looking for. Typical of this genre, but might want to be shortened a bit.There is quite a bit of good, however:-A decently long story. Anywhere from 9 – 14 hours on the main story alone, based on your skill level as a player.-So many side quests. Parallel missions are pretty cool, and there are a lot of them. These alone can add another 4 or so hours to your playtime.-The “Master” system. Being able to choose a master to train and learn signature moves from them is a great idea. That's how I learned Body Switch. :D-The story itself feels well done. It's actually surprising how they were able to tell a story with your character and still manage to feel cohesive, at least by Dragon ball Z standards. It's really well put together, and only has a few lapses based on gender and whatnot.I'm sure I'm forgetting something (Or plain wrong!) as this is the first time I've made a lengthy review on Steam, but if you made it this far, I thank you for your time and I hope I've convinced you to look into Dragon ball Xenoverse. c:"

I was already tired of the DBZ games repeating the stories all fans know almost by heart but what this game does makes it fresh again... Official fan fiction. Just making your own character to interact with the established DBZ stories is surprisingly fun and intriguing enough to keep fans playing.Gameplay is not as deep as you want from a fighting game but being able to give custom moves based on established characters gives a nice sense of customization for your character. The best situations in this game is one on one and while team on team does work.... it can get pretty annoying when you get blindsided while trying to focus on one enemy. When you outnumber your enemy, fights can become very easy and almost a joke but when you have to face multiple opponents by yourself...the game can get frustrating as when you try to melee, you are stunned from ki blasts and attacks out of camera view.So be warned for the above frustrations.Voice acting is fine enough but there's some odd voice acting (as in, some voice actors seem to be different people from the English dub but then again, it might be because I've been mostly watching DBZ abridged.)Don't ask me about the Jap voice acting in DBZ as I could never get used to Goku/Goten's Jap voiceSoundtrack is...servicable. I really wish they got the cheesy music back in the anime from the 90's.Summary/Conclusion: Unless you are a DBZ fan and/or a fan of the Ultimate Tenkaichi series, you have no reason to buy this game.PS: Yo, Bandai Namco, hire Team Four Star of the DBZ Abridged series and get them to voice act all the characters!

Or how you really can't make hybrid builds at all, it's either gotta be full-on focused on striking skills or ki blasts and NOT both.

This game combined some of the best features from both games and added more! Customizing your character, super attacks and strengths in abilities. At first I kept wondering why I was only getting 20-25 fps especially on a gaming laptop and I couldn't enjoy the game as much but as soon as i figured out the problem and fixed it. OMG , i love it even more, put all the graphic settings all high and ill still get over 70fps and the combat is so smooth. It's a beautiful game and challenging.

The game focuses around the story and parallel quests more then anything, and gets increasingly difficult as you play which will force you to train more and earn more attribute points.versus mode is terrible with no custimization and the game often puts you in unfair situations to make it harder (like fighting super saiyan trunks and vegeta at the same time by yourself). After completing the main story i have no interest in finishing off all the saga's that come afterward as the game does become reptitive.The dragon balls aren't worth the hassle collecting and many characters and stories are simply missing, including transformations such as imperfect Cell, Frieza's second and third form etc.The game is annoyingly impractical, often times you'll be replaying a mission to death trying to get a skill and the game's server is a mess. Personally i have trouble connecting to the servers and a lot of times get disconnected at random moments, which gets really annoying because the game will throw you straight back to the start menu.I know this seems like a biased review, but honestly i loved the game when it came out, buy it if you want something to kill time but don't think it is something you will keep coming back to. The play time is just too short and versus mode won't have you coming back for more. Once you beat the game ad the quests you will probably stop playing altogether."

,Not Recommended,323470,14857978,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,BlackDragon,"This game had a lot going for it, but ultimately cannot be recommended.First, the good: The three-dimentional combat works remarkably well. The battles are generally fast-paced, and the ultra-moves are spectacular. The time-traveling setup provides an effective and interesting framing-device, and the resulting list of missions allow for a wide variety of scenarios. Fight alongside your favorite characters from DBZ... or change history by standing alongside the villains and securing THEIR victory. Lots of spectacular optional battles where heroes or villains from across the continuum join forces, too. Care to fight Super Vegeta 2, 100% Final Form Frieza and Powered Perfect Form Cell all at once? The game will provide you the opportunity to do that and more. Huge selection of fighters, including characters from outside the normal canon (Bardock, Broly, and several from DBGT, just for starters) and with it comes an equally huge selection of super-moves and ultimate moves, for all your ki-beam-throwing needs. The ability to create your own fighter and set him/her/it up just the way you like is as satisfying as promised - there's a huge variety of clothes and accessories to go with your carefully-configured character-appearance. Be a hulking titan, or a pint-sized powerhouse! Anything goes.......BUT! And this is, as Zero Punctuation's Yahtzee would put it, a big, STINKY but. For all its advantages, it's got greater disadvantages. The combat works well... but you have to choose between 'interesting' and 'possible'. Meele combat is fast-paced and fun, but the useful skills are few and far between, and high-level enemies will devastate you without trouble, since they basically don't flinch - making them impossible to combo. Ranged combat (using 'Ki blasts') is extremely potent, but quickly gets really, really dull. Stand back while your allies distract the enemy, fire your favorite flavor of multicolored death at them (knocking off large chunks of the enemy's health-bar), then charge up your Ki again. Rinse and repeat until all enemies have fallen. That's it. That's ALL you're going to be doing for the last half of the game - well, that or constantly dying. Meanwhile, the huge roster of fighters has some glaring, obvious holes in it. Several familiar faces are missing, including Androids 16, 19 and 20. Intermediary forms of Frieza are missing, as is Cell's non-Perfected form.And of course, there's the servers - the game has aspirations of MMO-ness, and while it CAN work just fine offline, it will stubbornly TRY to connect to the servers, often failing miserably and wasting your time in the process. If you DO connect, expect to get kicked off time and time again, returning to the main menu every time. Lose your internet-connection in mid-battle? The game will likely crash, taking your progress with it. This issue will probably be aleviated over time, as the dwindling number of players eases the pressure on the servers... also reducing the POINT of the multiplayer.Several other niggling details tear away at the enjoyment. Randomness rules the day - enemies and allies alike may randomly drop pieces of gear or skills while you fight, and if you're trying to get your hands on a particular skill (either because it's awesome or because it suits your character perfectly), it can take a LOT of grinding to actually get it. Worse, the 'Ultimate Success' of side-missions is random too. To expand: Fulfilling certain requirements during missions (such as winning under a time-limit, keeping escort-targets from taking too much damage, or defeating enemies in a particular order) will activate 'Ultimate Success', providing an extension for the mission where new enemies appear, old ones ressurect and power up, or other interesting events occur... if you're lucky. If you're not, you can play the same mission over and over a dozen times, fulfilling the requirements each and every time, and still never see the special ending. Several of the missions are also frustratingly difficult to the point of impossibility, and while being ganged up on by constantly beam-spamming Super Saiyans can be handled with the right set of skills and a maxed-level character, there's no counter for escort-targets who can be one-shotted by the final enemy and constantly bounce right up in said enemy's face.So no, I would not recommend buying it. In the final tally, it's got more frustrations than awesomeness. That being said, if you DO buy it, make sure to play it through to the end. The final, post-game chapter is ALMOST epic enough to make up for all the annoyance that went before. Almost."

,Recommended,323470,14869467,"Posted: 13 March, 2015",all,GirlInTheMirror,"If you're a fan of DragonBall, this is a definite should-buy. I've heard that it's similar to the original Budokai games, but having never played those myself, I'd have to say that it's more similar to the Raging Blast games mixed with a little bit of Burst Limit.Pros:-The character creation is amazing, and while not perfect, it's miles better than what they gave us in Ultimate Tenkaichi, and certainly exceeded my expectations.-The story is a fresh take on the original, and for once isn't just a simple rehashing of the same old plot over and over again. Your character actually plays a big part in the central story, rather than just having their own little off-shoot.-I'm using a keyboard, so I can't really talk about how a controller feels, but with a little bit of rearranging, the keyboard controls feel pretty solid. Personally, I'd advise setting Boost to F and Super Attacks to Shift, but really it's all up to how you feel the most comfortable.-The sound effects and music are some of the best I've heard in a DragonBall game in a while, and while the main theme, Flow's rendition of Cha-La Head Cha-La, is getting a bit old (for my taste at least), the rest of the soundtrack is pretty dang beautiful.-The visuals are nice and fit the style of the original series to a T. They can get a bit weird at times, but it's usually just a minor distraction.Cons:-The voice acting is, for the most part, mediocre at best, and complete rubbish at worst, with a few exceptions. Colleen's Gohan seems to have less heart than it did in previous games and Kai, and some of the writing isn't that great when compared to the previous games. That being said, the game does have a few gems of dialogue, Sean Schemmel and Chris Sabat do an amazing job as per usual, and Josh Greele performs a pretty good Demigra.-The controls, while functioning, do feel a little stiff at times, and sometimes attacks won't hit or lock properly onto your opponent. As far as I can tell, this may just be a bug when running at 60 FPS, but I'm not sure.-As I mentioned before, the visuals are nice, but they can mess up every once in a while, usually in cutscenes when someone uses an energy attack, like Ginyu's Body Swap. The character models also look a bit stiff at times, and if you're running on an older computer you may experience some lag.-The servers are awful, plain and simple. It wouldn't be so bad if you could just play solo without having to connect to a server, but the game forces you into it as soon as you start the game. A way around this is to go offline from Steam, but this also prevents you from being able to stream and record for friends and spectators.-The A.I. is extremely unbalanced. Usually in story mode missions where you need to protect your allies, they're the first ones to go down, and if even one ally is KO'd, the mission ends immediately. This is an especially big problem in the Ginyu Sneaking mission and the secret Bardock mission. The A.I. in free battle is also a bit odd, as sometimes the cpu will just fly around in circles, making it annoying to hit them.All in all, Xenoverse is a definite step in the right direction, and it looks like patches are going to be released for a long time to come, so hopefully the more game-breaking things are resolved quickly. I wouldn't say this game is for everyone, and you're probably better off not getting it unless you're a die-hard fan of the series.As a game on it's own, I'd probably rate this 6.5/10, 7/10 if I felt generous."

I pre ordered it for ps4 for nostalgia reasons, but then again on pc for the possibility of future mods.    For some reason the console version was out about 3 days before the steam version was and that is the one I have spent most of my time with but after playing even just a little on pc I have to say this is an excellent port.    DIMPS really knows what they are doing.  While the game is missing some features we all wanted to see I think this is going to be something along the lines of Tenkiechi as in the first game is good in its own right but later renditions will perfect the equation.Now I understand my pc may be quite a bit more powerful than most but this runs excellently the only complaint I would have is that I need to have V-sink on just because I am using an old monitor that only has a refresh rate of 75.  I understand that I can’t see any more fames than my monitor is kicking out but having a frame rate counter I love seeing the frame rate at a constant 140 that this game produces with V-sink disabled.  The slight tarring is a nuisance though so I recommend keeping that on.Other than that this game is better than any of the recent dbz games by far bit it is in no way a budoki 4 or a budoki tenkiechi 4, something I think a lot of fans are wanting(me included).  The fighting beats battle of z so much that I will finish this game probably multihull times(something I have never been able to do with battle of z or rock paper scissor).  The story is interesting but has some dumb difficulty spikes out of nowhere.  You have to level up your character with side quests otherwise you will not get passed some levels.  Learning skills from a master is a nice add on, even having the choice of having Cell be your master.The voice acting feels like it is for kids, but the people curse often.  Its feels like they could not decide their target diagraph kids of DBZ fans.If you are a dbz fan and want to play a fighting game that lets you make a super sayen this is the only game to do it…..(rock paper scissors was not a game….it was not)Also this is my first review I am only righting it because I want this game to do good so we can maybe have really great dbz games againI would say this is a mid-to-upper-level dbz game, it does not have some of the key parts of budokai of bodokai thenkiechi but it is good on its own right.

Who didn't dream off making his own Character with the Skills you want?Its a good Brawl Game and if you like Dragonball it's a save Buy.The only thing i dislike are the following:The Story starts way to late when Son Goku is already Mature and has his first Son Gohan.There where quit some fights between the departing Goku from the Mountains and his first Born so i'm basically complaining that the Story Arc is to short. Then they left out GT and make it a DLC (now for only 29,99!!!) And they ignored all the Z Adventures that happened between the Big Arc Battles. There was way more Material to work with and the left it outSecond is that the Melee Skills are greatly weaker than the Energy Skills. A Meteor Kick won't do the Same Damage than a let's say Masenko (Skill from Gohan Jr.). So if i fight other players im forced to choose Energy Skills. Even with full Skilled Melee your Weaker than a Energy User. Thats something that could use a Patch.Third is is the Companion KI. To say it blunt they incredible Dumb. Lets say you Choose Goku as Supporter. He won't do anything more than Simple hitting and Kickin and sometimes shoot some Blasts.

There are a few issues that need to be adressed, as in CONNECTING TO XENOVERSE SERVER, You will see this nearly as much as CONNECTION TO XENOVERSE SERVER HAS BEEN LOST. This is easily the biggest fault in the game and I dont see them ignoring it for long, so hopefully it will be fixed reasonably soon. The other main problem it has is Tokitoki city, it does all it needs to as a quest hub for you but you lose all feelings of freedom that the game strives to give you in fights and leaves you running back and forth from the trade dist to the mission board over and over again. The last problem I had was with RNG drops, this is more of a love hate type thing I love how you are pushed harder and harder to get a high rating in the mission and when you do you feel like you earned the loot but when your master, depending on who you chose, demands you get one item that only drops in one mission and you are forced to run that same mission 10-15x times and you get a perfect score each time it gets old real fast when the item never decides to drop.That is literally the only problems I noticed and most of them are small what this game does well easily outshines those, From heart pounding boss battles to 6 v. you brawls you allways feel like you are on your heels and that one bad move will often lead to you being combo'd into oblivion. The main story quests are quite good and each saga has some very unique moments and you ALLWAYS feel like a badass. Than there are parrallel quests which throw you into some... interesting scnerios, Oh you want to help the saiyians fight the Z warriors in the sayian saga, sure. you want to fight 30 mini buus at once, sure. and when you see an ability that you know from the anime it pushes you to Z rank it to getsome amazing ability, x20 kaioken, Super sayian ext. even if some of them can get grindy at the late levels. One of the coolest features is the master system, you can talk to any number of Z warriors to have them teach you their moves and help you progress further, For me hearing Vegeta say he finally sees me as a warrior after him yelling at me after every mission that I need to get my act together and that I dont deserve to be his apprentice was one of the coolest moments I've had in a game in a while.

As an American, the first DBZ game I was able to play was Budokai for the PS2 (if you don't count NES emulators running Japanese ROMs simply as a way to feed my teenage DBZ addiction).I've seen the series front-to-back more times than I can count. Nothing is going to surprise me in the storyline. Dragonball Xenoverse seems to address this, by refreshing the story in a way that makes everything seem new again.The fighting gameplay is quite addicting, as you can make very choreographed interactions with the fighters that really get your adrenaline going.I think, though, this is a game made for DBZ fans, as the MMO style in between the fighting really seems to be shoe-horned in. I barely notice, simply because this is the type of DBZ game I've waited 17 years for.I've had some crashing issues, which have either been midly irritating, to infuriating, depending on if the crash occurs after a rather crucial fight. For new players, as of right now, the best method of playing is by disabling the Steam Overlay. I'm quite surprised these crashing bugs exist because of a conflict between the game and Steam, since the PC release was advertised here. It seems like poor planning to me.The servers have constant issues with disconnecting, or crashing the game itself. The developers have not been very transparent in their solutions to these problems. I've seen other games bounce back quite quickly from similar problems.Overall, I am very pleased with the game.

Melee heavy, powerful finishers, or a high health build-You can have different characters be your mentor (cell, frieza, goku, ect) and learn their ablilities-Different races have weakness and advanatges-A different story line than the other games. Its a breather from the other dbz games that follow the story line, if you read or watched the series, you know what to expect.-Its a challenge. The effort you put into your character, the easier the game gets. (Still tough)-online capiblities. Havent explored this much since Im still doing the story line and not maxed level-repeatable quests and rewards, helps gear and level your character as well gets your sempai to take notice-You can create teams with friends and play along and help each otherCons:-Some fights seem impossible. Certian ""bosses"" have anti flinching or a sheild you must break before you can do damage, all in all they're pounding on you and taking massive amounts of damage.-The bosses ""learn"" your fight style. If you like to charge in and brawl it out, itll continue to run around, block,ect.-Again, some fights can be unfair, after a hard boss fight, you have a chance to come upon a new enemy at random (or part of the story) and you may have to fight several opponents alone-Leveling can be bit of a pain. If youre following the story line with out doing side quest, you wont make it. You can be as far as 10-15 levels behind and chances of winning are slim. So you have to grind out quests here and there.-Servers arnt relaible, continuous disconnections-Some abilities are buggy.

Though some may say that they have finished the game in a day or 2, im very slow with games that make you level up. I like to grind for long periods of time so i can really over power the enemy without feeling like hes way to powerful for me to take on. Ive only played one other Dragonball game and it was alright but not very great, the fighting was a little sloppy and the story dident feel like it was going anywhere. Recently i played Naruto Shippuden: Ultimat Ninja Storm 3 and i absolutly loved it. The campaign was based purely off the anime and the fighting felt balanced and well thought out. No real camara glitches, moves and game mechanics can be learned fast through gameplay not through reading some sort of BS guide, and the graphics where amazing with bloom that made you ♥♥♥♥ and shading much like wind waker HD. I then saw this game. I was not a big fan of how stiff and slow everything felt in the toki toki city overworld. Talking to people is a bore and its your first objective other than fighting trunks, and the shops are very limited. I very much disliked the fact that when you go to the clothing shop, it does not show you what the clothing looks like, it only says the name and gives the skill stats. I also hated the fact that some cloths can be worn by certain races. I think that everything should fit everything, just my opinoin. But, the combat is a whole different story. Its a little sloppy and inpersise but its fun and feels satsifying. You get special moves and can change those moves by bying them, finding them in levels, and earning them from masters.

I haven't tried PvP but I don't care for that much. At least it is not required to play PvP for your gaming experience. The combat is a little repetitive and you will most likely end up repeating your most effective combo over and over. The character customization is hyped up quite a bit but to be honest it is slightly disappointing. You basically end up looking of a weird 'fusion' accident of all DBZ characters mixed together. What I do like about the character creation is that race, gender, height and weight influence your stats. If you taller that makes you physically stronger but slower. If your character is heavier you will receive more HP and if your character is slimmer then you get more Ki (energy for your blast attacks)If you really want to build a character towards a certain play style, I suggest looking these specific stats up first!Things I really miss in DB:Xenoverse are:* Transformatiosn for all reaces, not just super saiyans. I dont know how this would work but I find it lacking that other races don't have cool visual tricks.* Thin male Majin characters. The thinnest male Majin is still too fat! I want to make a evil or kid buu!* fighting stances don't change your fighting style. They are still the same boring moves.*you can pick the color for your starting outfit but later in the game, if you buy, for example, Sajin combat armor, you can't change the color. This seriously limits the character customization level of the game!Price-wise I find that the content, or rather the lack off content, makes the game a little overpriced. If instead of just one city there was a whole open world to explore and battlefields wouldn't be so small (I constantly find myself fighting against the edge of most maps) it would be worth the money.4.5/5 for DB fans3/5 for regular players"

I liked that.-the game looked and felt nice, lush colors and destructible environment made the game that much more enjoyable.CONS:-Cant imagine playing with a Mouse and Keyboard. Controller (for me anyways) is a must.-Sound not complete. Im guessing this is only the translated game but there are moments when you get complete silence and im certain theres an audio clip missing, example when you beat the last boss the theres a 10 second spot without anything, no background music, no speaking just the group standing there.  and then things pick up again.-*My biggest issue here* at points the story doesnt seem to make sense considering you been helping everyone through out time and no one remembers you, your just ""That guy."" your the Yamcha of the group who just so happens to be able to beat everyone to a pulp. You'd think someone would remember a Human who could beat saiyins, or another saiyin considering theyre all gone, or a Majin since theyre so common on earth. or any of the other races they pulled out."

Character customization, while not super expanded, is a huge bonus and this game feels more like a love letter to fans who always dream of fighting along side or against popular series characters.If anything hurts this game its the hit-and-usually-miss connection which has a habit of dropping on you randomly, the really unclear ultimate mission conditions (that I can only assume before they were posted on the net were trial and error) and what appears to be malicious item/skill drop rate (RNG are not my friends).With the exception of the online battles the longevity of this game revolves around unlocking equipment/skills and leveling secondary characters as well as trying to get the best scores. I seriously hope they come up with some DLC (new races would be nice but skills, equipment, and quests are a must.(Mini-Rant, I find it disappointing only saiyans have a transformation. No Frieza style change? Why are the majin locked in the fat form (male)?

Keep in mind if your opponent is on 60 FPS but you are on 30 FPS than you're at a disadvantage due to you processing slower than they are. (just for online, offline 60 FPS is fine) And that is one of the two main reasons I can not recommend this game to the average consumer. The other reason is sad to say, but this game has possibly the worse customer support, if any at all! They made a game that THRIVES off of the online functionality yet they don't add ANY cheat detection and most likely don't ban the ones who hack anyways. Trying to join into a friends lobby on more than one occassion i just get kicked from it and it says he is banned, so if the cheat detection its there it's terrible at best.Balancing wise the game is decent, you'll always run into the same cookie cutter build in like 60% of your games, 30% of the games is hackers, and the other 10% you got yourself a good match so it's not at all bad.Although there is deep customization, you'll end up looking like everyone else if you want to be the very best due to gear having stat limitations, and the new DLC gear doesn't help much cause it's not max gear. Character progression wise i love it but in the end you're not unique unless you gimp yourself due to gear.I'd say PvP is the main selling point for majority everyone but its a joke at most due to hackers, and if you win they can always just alt f4 and it'll act as if nothing happened so there goes ranked in a nut shell. If you want this game to grind from the bottom reach the top, then continue to assert yourself as the best through PvP.. this is not your game sadly.Now if you just want a new DBZ game for the story it does a good job at giving you the original story in a tweaked matter (if you are not a fan of DBZ you can get lost as the game doesn't explain the story). The gameplay is refreshing, they hit the nail imo on the melee system, ability to stun for a second if you block at the very second which feels amazing.. I just can't bring myself to recommend the game unless you are buying it for the story, or just to play casually with friends cause that's the only way you'll enjoy the PC ported version."

The combat is fun and pretty fast paced depending on the build of your character. There are unfortunately a few downsides to this game however. The use RNG (Random Number Generator) systems in this game are so heavy that its almost impossible to find the mentors you want without doing parallel quests or exiting to the title screen to reload the city over and over to find the one NPC you wanted to talk to. RNG also has a large part in the item drop rates and acquisition of dragon balls which is understandable but i think farming for a cumulative 10 Hrs to find just one dragon ball and recieving nothing seems a little excessive in my opinion, as well as RNG playing a large role in your ranking on missions by affecting wether or not you get the special mission objective. The only other complaint I would bring up is the AI's over use of ki blasts which leave you stunned for extended periods of time with no way to recover which is quite irritating when facing more than one enemy at once.All in all the game is worth the price and i would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys DBZ or even if you dont.PROS:>Fun gameplay>Decent character customization>Interesting and original story>Use of old iconic characters any DBZ fan would ever know>Decently paced combat>Fun multiplayer experienceCONS:>TOO MUCH RNG>Poor enemy AI>Server issues"

NOW that the game is doing rather better with it's servers, I can give this a review I wanted to give it from the start!First off, if you are looking for an engaging fighting game like street fighter, king of fighters, or something of the like, then... this may not be your kind of game. HOWEVER, if you are into a massive brawl with some elements of beat em ups and even some RPG elements with a fresh new twist to the DBZ story, then by all means give this game a look!I haven't had this much fun with a Dragonball game in a long long time! The battle system is rather fun for what it is, and it's nice to be able to make your own character (not like that OTHER DBZ GAME i will not mention) and have a rather interesting story to go around them! While I do wish that there were more options for customizing your character, I did like the variety the game gave (was trying to make a Dragon Quest like character before more attuned to DQ8).The single player part of the game, being story, does transition quite well... and dare I say is much more accurate to the Dragon Ball Z story than MANY other DBZ games in the past (ironic considering this game is supposed to be changing the past due to the plot).The multiplayer quests are a good way to get your friends involved with some Co-op play, and it gets to be really fun trying to get some of those rare items and moves you have been longing for. And if you get tired of some questing there's also Online Battles that you can do against your friends or other random online players! I haven't tried Ranked Mode as of yet, but plan to do so soon just to see how it goes.For the negatives of the game at the moment I would have to say that the Story Mode isn't all that groundbreaking... yes it is a fresh new way to play through the plot of Dragon Ball, but... somehow I was expecting a bit more. The fighting system isn't perfect and the AI can be downright idiotic at times.... God damn you Krillin.... And, as I stated in my previous review of this game, the online system is still a bit broken. It can randomly kick you off at times or not let you log on. The GOOD thing, however, is that they fixed this considerably compared to before, and in case you can't get online for any reason they do have an option where you can simply play offline and use some of the in-game allies for your co-op team.The game is not perfect, but by god is it fun! And is one of the better Dragon Ball games I've played in a LONG long time! If you are a fan of the series, by all means pick this game up! And if you're not a fan, perhaps take a look at some lets plays other people have done by now and see if it catches your eye. This is a good game!"

In that regard, I will talk about everything that's wrong with it before I praise it.Dragonball Xenoverse has some of the most idiotic A.I. I've seen in a game in recent years (Although the worst goes to that one Aliens game, I'd say. You know the one.). In a PQ, you can choose two of any of the characters you've unlocked to assist you, which is good, because some of the quests are tough, even at the beginning. The problem arises in that they are basically just meat shields to take hits for you and deal some light damage. They rarely use their super moves, and they never, ever use their ultimates or transformations (where applicable... or not applicable, as the case may be.)In addition, the enemy characters may just float harmlessly in front of you, begging to be hit. On the flipside of that coin, some of them will be absolutely ruthless. They will spam their super and ultimate moves, and chase you down afterward to kick the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Granted, most of that happens in later difficulties, but more than you'd expect. In one of the later quests, where you have to fight every single Z-Fighter (From Yamcha to SS3 Goku, in several different areas, each with their own team of enemies), going throught the portal into th final zone greets you with Super Saiyan Goku, Gohan, and Goten. More often then not, both Goku and Gohan will fire Kamehamehas at you the second they see you, while little Goten hits you with a barrage of blasts that, while inaccurate, can lock you in place fairly well... right before the Kamehamehas hit. You'll likely die immediately, because of course.There are a few glitches, too. The most notable ones seem to be in two PQs that have you collecting Dragonballs. Both have the same problem, which is that one of said balls spawn, without fail, outside the area you're aloud to traverse. And that blue, circuit-like barrier that holds you back will mock you silently.Also, there are spelling and grammatical errors absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY, everywhere. Sometimes, when a character shows up in a fight, what they say may not even be what's displayed on screen (In particular, Frieza and Vegeta rarely know what they're saying.). That's not to mention the bits you find in the shopping menus and non-cutscene dialog. It gives a sense that the translation of this game was incredibly rushed. Like, 'get it done by lunch' rushed.Lastly, and this is more of a personal grievance, though I know others share the sentiment, there are not beam struggles. That's a staple of Dragonball Z itself, as well as the better fighting games it has produced. There are still physical clashes, but I've yet to win one of those, as there's nothing that tells you how to do it. Button mash? I'd love for you to tell me which buttons. I've tried them all.Now,,. the praise.This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everything that they did right, they did amazingly. The character creation is some of the best I've ever seen (Though I would have liked to be able to make an Android character, but that's neither here nor there.). Saiyan, Eartling, Namekian, Majin (every single one directly related to the big pink fatass, I might add.) and whatever the hell you call Frieza, there are almost endless combinations of parts and styles to choose from, every bit of which lets you pick what color you want for that specific part. Ever seen a blue and orange Namekian with a spikey skin mohawk and red eyes? You will.The story mode is amazing. You'll see just about every important moment in DBZ history in addition to some completely new ones, AND get to fight alongside the regular cast. Who among you never got the urge to jump into Gohan's fight with Cell and deck the power-stealing sum♥♥♥♥♥ yourself? None of you.There's tons of replayability, too. Every PQ has hidden objectives, and drop some amazing things, like famous characters clothing and moves.You can learn from a master as you progress, all of them key heroes and villains, From Krillin to Beerus the Destroyer, and a lot of major names in between. Each of them will test your strength, and teach you their exclusive moves, which you can't get from any missions.You can play online or off. When on, you can directly interact with other people roaming Tokitoki city. When off, a few handfuls of those same people will appear as non-interactive NPCs, so you can admire the cool ones or laugh at the silly ones without drawing their attention. I once saw a player character named Kim-Jong Uub. Enough said.All in all, if you're a fan of fighting games, Dragonball Z, or both, you'll love this game. You'll buy this game. You'll cheat on your significant other with this game."

The combat, it's high paced, but not so chaotic that you lose track of everything that is happening, and the variety of skills and combos you can make with them is near endless.3. The graphics, the game is beautiful to look at and the animation sequences are true to the more recent Dragonball anime installments (including Kai, Yo Son Goku!, Battle of Gods and Revival of F), though synching for the voices could have been done better.4. The story, for a game that focuses on time travel, it could have been so easy for them to ♥♥♥♥ it up, but the situations work together (almost) flawlessly, with some very popular ""what ifs"" thrown into the mix.5. The character customization, need I say more? The ability to make your own character is a huge plus, and the amount of options that you have for your character just makes it even better.Cons:1. The servers, the amount of times the servers have randomly closed down on me, be it just exploring Toki Toki city or even on missions, is quite frustrating.2. The mulitplayer, this isnt so much a developer issue, but the PvP is insanely uneven, the game has only been out for a couple of weeks, but already hackers have dominated the online scene, with hacked stats, abilities and even Online Rank points.3. The difficulty curve, this game has one of the strangest difficulty curves ive ever seen, and the reported difficulty is often more for the sake of the continuity flow than it is the actually stage difficulty, and this is just on the side quests, in the main story it gets even wierder, with some overwhelmingly difficult stages followed by incredably easy ones.All in all, this game has its flaws, but that's to be expected for a fighter game mixed with RPG and MMO elements, but for the long run it's every DBZ fan's dream, as we have the chance to live and interact in the world we've all known and loved for the last 10-20 years, though if you haven't followed the series there will be times where you will get lost"

But I will itemize my pros and cons with the game and you can make the judgement call.Let's get the cons out of the way first:-The voice acting by the main cast is absolutely phoned in. They all sound like they were forced into the recording booth. Mira, Towa, and Demigra sound at least average.-The audio engineering is really messed up in some instances. The worst example being in the Ginyu Saga, Goku wanting his body back before actually having switched bodies.-I don't know how many people have this issue, but I frequently have Ki effects just disappear.-Grinding. Oh man the grinding. I understand it is a RPG but damn this gets tedious.-The ally ai is some of the worst I have experienced in an extremely long time. They have no problems floating above your head and laughing at you instead of reviving you in the parallel missions.- Attacks that have absolutely no reason to do so hit behind the character. Please tell me how a Kamehameha hit me while I was behind Goku.-The camera is garbage. If you get caught up against a wall, say goodbye to half your health bar as you get pummeled into oblivion which leads into...-The enemy ai is horrendously unfair. ***SPOILERS**** (I guess?) How is Hercule a harder than perfect Cell? ***END***Not to mention the enemies with 2 health bars that you will have to fight 2 or even 3 of at a time by yourself or with ally ai with half of your health bar which is pathetic.Now the pros (there aren't many):-The character customization is very deep and it is gratifying to put what 9 year old me thought would be such a badass DBZ character in the universe. A preview of what the clothes you are buying look like would be quite handy since if you don't like what you bought, you can only resell it at half what you paid.-It can be extremely fun and satisfying. Pulling off a 30 hit combo and ending Frieza's crappy life with a powered up Kamehameha that your own character pulled off is something no other game can fulfill.-The parallel quests are a fun and interesting idea. It is fun to play on the opposite side of a conflict, say on Frieza's side against the protagonists.Overall, it is a hard sell. But if you can get passed some obnoxious technical flaws, it can be a reasonably enjoyable experience. Maybe get it on sale for $30."

At times I have my falling outs with the game with some quests (Bardock I’m a Melee player) ;P but that’s normal right?

,Recommended,323470,15008525,"Posted: 22 March, 2015",all,Mr. Knytt,"Dragon Ball XENOVERSE is a pretty damn good game. The controls are solid, the fighting is fun, it looks beautiful, and on the PC you get a smooth 60fps. This game does have it's problems though.When you first start up the game, there is no main menu. You only see start game and options. Instead of a main menu, they decided it would be a good idea to replace it with a GIANT hub world, where you have to walk around VERY SLOOOOOOOWLY to get from one place to another. Want to do multiplayer? Walk there. Want to do sidequests? Walk there. Want to do world tournament? Walk there. Want to see leaderboards? Walk there. Want to do the main story? Walk there. When you have to make me spend 2-5 or 5-10 minutes walking around a huge hub world very slowly just to buy a health capsule in a game where my character is able to move around at the speed of sound, that's poor ♥♥♥♥ing design!Another gripe I have with this game is that when you first get into the game, you can't do ANYTHING other than the main story. Not normal matches, not multiplayer, not the shops, not even the online hub world! And when you do have access to all that stuff, guess what! The only playable characters are you and the first Goku, unlike EVERY OTHER DRAGON BALL GAME EVER!!! Playing through the main story for about an hour will get you some more characters, like Vegeta and Freiza, but the first thing I wanted to do, and I'm sure many of us wanted to do, was hop on multiplayer or single player and be Super Saiyan Goku to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Vegeta or Freiza. A lot of us also wanted to get a feel for this game before we actually started to play the story mode. They kind of do through tutorials, but the only real mode of practice so early in the game is getting beaten by Raditz over and over again. That could turn a lot of peaple off, especially in a fighting game!A few people could say that, ""Oh no, it's supposed to be a story driven game!"" I get that, but when the fun of a game takes a major back-seat to the story, it ruins the whole ♥♥♥♥ing experience! Ask yourself this: In Street Fighter do you have to do some story ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to unlock Ryu or Chun-Li? NO! In Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 did you need to do the story mode to unlock Gohan, or SSJ Goku, or Vegeta, or original Kid Goku? NO! You could jump in and play! Sure, there are still unlockable story characters, like GT Goku, but GT Goku is not the same as ♥♥♥♥ing Gohan or SSJ Goku!My first impressions of this game were pretty bad, especially since I was expecting to jump in and have fun right off the bat. However they won't sacrifice their precious storyline for a bit of fun, and that really bites!My last gripes with this game is the bugs. This is a pretty unfinished game. People phase into rocks and you have to restart the match, graphics freak out for a few seconds, and online mode DID NOT WORK PERIOD! (For a while) This isn't to the point of Sonic Boom, or Assassin's Creed Unity, but it's still pretty bad. However online mode in this game (Which is pretty much most of the game) got the same treatment EA gave to Sim City. It worked, but just barely. You could get into the game once in a while, however there were a few times when I just gave up and went to play Left 4 Dead 2. How the game handles it's connection is it connects you to load the character menu, and then it connects you to load the hub world. That wouldn't be the biggest problem, assuming that when it disconnects, it tries to recconect so it can go back to the character menu. If that fails then you're SOL for online mode. Sometimes it stays there and won't stop loading, sometimes it flat out crashes! They fixed the online now, but before it was utter dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and it ruined the game for me.With all these major gripes though, I am glad to say that the gameplay makes up for them. This is one of the best Dragon Ball games in YEARS! Super tight controls, great visuals, fantastic fighting, and just being a game that can actually live up to its hype, unlike last year's games. With 6 people being able to fight at once, this makes for very interesting and fun combat! The ability to make a custom character with such diversity is a huge bonus to the already great characters and fighting. Its so diverse, this is pretty much Deviantart/Fanfiction the game! (No porno tho) With all the content packed into the game, I can gladly say that this is one of my favorite Dragon Ball games, despite those other gripes, and it's definetly worth your money. Although it's not the most accessible Dragon Ball game, it's still damn good. I would still reccomend DBZ BT3 over this one just because it's more accessible, but if you are a fan of Dragon Ball and you can get past the bugs and hub world, I highly reccomend that you stop reading right now and BUY THIS GAME!"

The animation is smooth, the difficulty is very balanced, and there was a surprising amount of depth put into the settings for the PC version. Full disclosure: I came into this game expecting to be disappointed by another attempt by a company at capitalizing on a rapidly fading franchise before it died.What I got was a very fun game, and that is saying a lot as I don't like fighting games in general. I'm also not very good at them. The only two complaints I have are the combat system, which has depth, but the depth is overshadowed by the unbalanced attack types. There are WAY more energy attacks than physical attacks in this game, and that makes a creating a character that gets up close and personal a bit difficult, but not impossible. The second problem I have is the story mode, which goes from being on par with a normal DBZ episode to being an incredibly bad self-insert Mary-Sue fanfiction in the blink of an eye. There is one point where the player character actually helps Goku push an enemy back because he doesn't have enough energy left to maintain a Spirit Bomb. That's right, you get behind the Spirit Bomb and push it forward to overpower the enemy that is trying to push it back. There are several parts of the main story that are like this and I found myself groaning audibly while watching them.This being said, this game is a fighting game, and the fighting mechanics are good. If you are playing this game for the story, you are looking in the wrong direction. If you want to have fun being an OP energy shooting alien, then this is the game for you. Goku Simulator 2015 is the top fighting game for those that want to bring their Deviant Art OCs (please don't steal) to live."

Lots of characters which is great, fighting is generally fun.My biggest issue is the balancing and repetition. Storyline and parallel quests range from ridiculously easy to painfully hard. Often you'll have to fight the same enemy 3 times, the enemy recovering full health between each set. Or fight 3 enemies at once, with seemingly unlimited ki and stamina. At times it can get kind of BS, not in a difficult way but in a rubber-band effect kind of way. By the end, with difficult multi-enemy scenarios that resist flinching (can't close combat because you can't combo your hits on them without them retaliating) I ended up cheesing the entire fight - flying around in circles  to dodge the CPU moves and whittling them down with ki blasts.The other thing is that you cannot create multiple characters until you complete the game. So first time play through, if you picked buu class but decided part way through that sayian might be more fun; you're going to have to delete your progress and start from the beginning. By the time I grinded through the main quest, I just didn't have it in me to start from the beginning with a new lvl 1 character."

Mechanics could definitely use tweaking. It seems like to win any battle you have to just knock back and spam super moves until the other guy dies. Literally what I had to do to finish the last bunch of campaign missions because combat was so unintuitive.Customisation is a neat concept, though severely lacking when creating character. You end up seeing dozens of the exact same characters all the time. Nothing really unique, very few options overall beyond clothing.My biggest peeve right now is the multiplayer, or lack there of. Personally I don't care about the cheating, I don't do competitive so it doesn't affect me. However a big selling point of this game was the co-op. At first, yes you could meet up with friends (which was difficult to begin with) and play some alternate quests together. However since the server updates, now there are ""instances"" of the main hub. As a result, and the lack of true steam friends integration, unless you and friends get lucky and into the same instance (not choosable btw), there is no way to play together. In order to add friends in game, you need to physically be in front of the character, and you can only add individual characters to your friends list. This list is not cross-character, and does not carry over between them. If you happen to be in different instances, there is no way to invite a friend to you. Nor can your friend join you on your instance. Using steam invite and join is a no go. There is no support for it that I have found. As it stands, I have been able to play with friends 4 times since the game came out, and most of that consisted of doing a single mission, then getting kicked back to title screen, and never being able to get back together again.Unless you're a die hard fan who only plays single player, don't waste the money."

I found this game to be awesome for the  following reasons:Its on PC!Custom Chars are cool.Just about every ultimate/special move from the series you can equip.The bad:Connectivity issues. Getting booted out of the game every 15-20 min is extremely annoying. At least its always after a match and I dont loose progression or items I collected.Cant run the game past 60 FPS without ki blasts and special effects disappearing.UPDATE:People are hacking their stats in PVP and the devs are doing nothing about it. I do not recomend this game any longer and encourge people to save their money and hope the next installment is better.

,Recommended,323470,14911589,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,KillZacular,"As a long time fan of DBZ and having bought a large number of DBZ games in the past, I felt that this game has the best combat in an DBZ game to date. The in-game story related audio and scenes are awkward at best but has an interesting concept and the animated scenes are done very well. The game has great combat that is very similar to the Tenkaiichi series.One thing I would like to see in the future would be more slots for special attacks. For example, (using an Xbox controller for example but the game is playable with keyboard and mouse) you hold R to see your list of ""Super"" attacks or specials, you hold L+R to see your ""Ultimate"" abilities such as finishers and super saiyan. I would like to see an additional page of Specials or ""Super"" abilities in the future from holding another modifier. Having only 4 specials out of hundreds of attacks leaves you with little customization.Speaking of customization, the character creator has far too few options, it is not terrible, but is far from what I had hoped in hair style options.Finally I will touch on the online aspect of the game. The online has a central hub like option that we see similar to games like Destiny, or Phantasy Star online games. You have a central city with players running around using Emotes to chat with each other. There is no in-game typing in the PC version (what?). The way you can play with friends is to make a traditional game lobby and invite them to a screen that resembles all fighting games with names and ping listed with nothing else to do while you wait. The other option is to make a ""Team"" and invite your friends or other players which only slightly speeds this process up. Similar to single player, you must walk all the way back to the NPC to start a new mission each time and the walk gets slightly annoying, I would like to see an option menu pop up after finishing a quest that asks if you would like to go back to the city or retry the mission again. It would make the grind for that certain ability or Z-rank on said mission feel much cleaner. You can also fight friends or other players online in ranked matches and it is done fairly well. They are still working on balancing said mode by adjusting the moves or equipment that leaves this mode not fully balanced.To summarize, this game is an amazing step up for Dragon Ball Z fans and it is the best game they have released to date with the Dragon Ball name. That said, if you are new to the Dragon Ball series itself and just looking for something new, make sure you research it well first. I had a friend pick this game up without any prior knowledge of DBZ and he very much liked the game, but the game is still slightly behind the modern fighting game experience. This game was made for DBZ fans and should be judged as a step in the right direction. I really am looking forward to seeing another similar game to this one that improves on the online play and fixes the problems that this game has. I love this game and really hope they keep improving on it and future titles with this amazing step towards a great fighting game."

If you're interested in just having an extra game sitting in your inventory for a higher game count then by all means, go for it.  On the other hand, if you're looking for something worth the money, then look elsewhere.  This game is so horrible.  I prepaid and bought the season pass only to find out on launch day that everyone was already level 80.  There is no free roam as the previews suggest.  It's only a very small area you can walk around in.  I am still kicking myself for wasting $75 on this piece of crap.  By the way, if you start the game, it will continue to run in the background even after closing.  I have to stop the process through task manager to close it, otherwise it's just advertising to everyone suggesting you are crazy about it.  The game seems very rushed.

These need fixed ASAP.- Clothing. While it's cool to have so many different options, by having stats on clothing, you limit your viability if you aren't wearing clothing that supports the areas you want supported. Stats either need to be variable on a piece of clothing (which gives replay incentive similar to MMO's), or need to be removed altogether. Also, all specific player pieces need to be color customizable (I.E. Piccolo's cape)- Item collection. Item collection in game is distracting from the fight. There needs to be a better way to collect items in PQs, not to mention it is boring doing so and feels more like an obligation than anything else.- The hub city is an incredibly lifeless and boring place.- The RPG aspect of this game feels incredibly superficial.That's about it so far.
