,Recommended,323610,12268557,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Delphaeus,"This is a great game, albeit with a few significant problems.The Gameplay is the best part of it, where you have to simultaneously deploy and manage multiple response units including firemen/firetrucks, Ambulances/Paramedics, Police, Negotiators, Salvage vehicles etc.You start in a suburban area where you respond to numerous events. The game quickly manages to scale up and has you managing multiple units at the same time, in different areas of the city, all earning you money to purchase new equipment. When you have the required equipment it unlocks a ""mission"" that takes you into a separate ""mission map"" and you get a more complex mission. When you complete the mission it takes you back to the suburban area again, to manage more random events until you have purchased the required hardware for the next mission.This gameplay is quite fun, and even though it is the same incidents, the map is quite large and always has you thinking on ""where is the nearest hydrant?"", ""what resources do i need for that?"" or ""where is that criminal running?"" so each incident is still quite unique.Now, the ""significant problems"" I mentioned earlier (from least significant to most significant)Firstly: Audio is ok. It repeats a lot of things a lot of times and has some interesting things (like every vehicle you click on sounds the ""ambulance sirens"", even if you click on a car on the side of the road)Secondly: Graphics are ok. It doesn't have any options above 1024x1280 and on a full HD display it is somewhat grainy, but I don't think this significantly detracts from the gameThirdly: When doing the more complex ""Mission scenario"" I still haven't found a way to restart it without quitting to windows. So when you make a big stuff-up and all your firemen are dying with a wall of fire between them and the paramedics, you actually have to deal with the situation... or you quit to desktop and start the game againNext: Each individual will not really do anything unless you have told them to. ie: A fireman will watch a fire burn, unless you have told him to equip an extinguishing device (hose or extinguisher) and is within range. If a fire moves out of range, he won't follow it. Same goes for Paramedics and Police. I'd love to see a little bit of automation, such as: tell the fire-truck to ""CONTAIN"" the fire and they setup automatically to stop the fire spreading, or tell the paramedics to ""TREAT"" the casualty, and when he is ready for transport they should automatically load him into the ambulance and take him away.Oh, and firement shouldn't stand in one fire when trying to fight another fire... yeah this can happen.Lastly: Traffic routing. If you order ten ambulances (yes, i made a few mistakes fighting a fire once) and tell them where to go, after the first two arrive, then the others keep driving around in circles because they can't get to the spot where the first two ambulances parked. Sometimes they'll drive around a building on fire and blow up because they are trying to get to that exact spot.And sometimes they get ""jammed"" because they drove too close to a pedestrian and then you have to manually ""unjam"" them so they can drive again. (not too common)But, all in all, a good, enjoyable game, just be warned that some things are frustrating"
,Recommended,323610,12958738,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,CubeJackal,"At first glance, this game might look like those abysmal simulator games that you find decorating the local GameStop's bargain bin and the Steam Greenlight page in equal measure. However, 911: First Responders couldn't be more different. What appears to be a mild-mannered and simple simulation is a surprisingly realistic and hair-pullingly tough game of skill and judgement that plays out more like an RTS than a traditional sim. Well-researched subject material, a lengthy and challenging campaign, and exquisite sound and music design go hand-in-hand to create this gem of a game that deserves far more recognition than first appearances might suggest.In 911: First Responders, the player assumes the role of an emergency dispatcher in an unidentified, accident-prone urban sprawl somewhere in Europe - presumably the Netherlands, considering where developers Sixteen Tons Entertainment hail from. It's your sole duty to command and micro-manage emergency responders of all professions and roles, ranging from police marksmen to fire department marine divers to tow truck technicians. The mammoth campaign is comprised of twenty assignments that are broken up by short sessions of responding to low-level emergency calls inside the city, with each success granting the player some of the funds needed to buy vehicles and upgrades that are imperative for the next big assignment. Though they start out easy enough, these large-scale missions quickly become damningly hard and will push even experienced RTS players to their multi-tasking, micro-managing limits. A very wide range of emergency situations and responses are represented in loving detail, giving the game just enough complexity to be engaging without being overwhelming to people who aren't educated in emergency service operations - despite the plethora of vehicles and personnel on hand, most of the tools the player is given have an obvious and easily comprehensible application. The open-ended nature of each assignment is also something to be noted and applauded - though some missions may have clear solutions, others require creative use of the tools at your disposal in order to save  as many lives as possible.Of course, fun as it is, the game isn't flawless. The eight-year-old graphics can't help but show their age upon close examination (though they aren't 'bad' by any means), and the pathfinding of the game's larger vehicles can become problematic in enclosed areas - which feature heavily in some assignments, occasionally resulting in Tetris-like scenes in which the player must manually guide their confused emergency vehicles out of a tight spot in order to release an urgently-needed automotive at the bottom of the metaphorical heap. The game also has a nasty habit of giving the player new tools or personnel without giving much notification, which wouldn't be so bad if those new tools and personnel didn't tend to play very critical roles in the mission in which you're given them. One notable example is the fifth assignment, in which the player must clean up after a road bridge collapse - a task in which the fire brigade's marine divers are essential for locating sunken cars in the river below. The game, of course, doesn't tell you that it's given you these divers, so they're easy to miss when you're loading up a fire engine to send onto the map.These flaws, however, pale greatly against the immense fun that I've been having with this game so far. The surprisingly steep challenges that it offers seriously surprised me as I progressed further into the campaign, and part of what motivates me to overcome every nail-bitingly tense challenge and assignment is my curiosity over what the next assignment will hold.  At the asking price of £3.99, this game is an absolute steal for its quality and a must for strategy fans and anyone who's enthusiastic about the work of the emergency services. Definitely get this game."
,Recommended,323610,12235937,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,Karlos,"Time Disclaimer -- I have played 911: First Responders / Emergency 4 for hundreds of hours prior to the Steam release.Emergency 4 is a Real Time Strategy in which the user is tasked with controlling a number of German Emergency Services; Police, Ambulance, Fire, and Mechanics. Using these, it's up to the user to deal with a number of disasters in the main campaign ranging from simple fires to earthquakes, hostage situations, airline disasters and more! Alternatively, the user can play an endless mode in which they must deal with random emergencies which will grant them the finances to purchase more vehicles and deal with bigger disasters. One great aspect is you're not penalized for doing a bad job so if you get bored, you can use your police units to cause havoc.The game is easy to get into but difficult to master as controlling a number of different emergency units can quickly become overwhelming. The assets have also aged well since release.Emergency 4 is definitely a unique game and is an often looked over gem, it's a game that is both engaging and enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Real Time Strategies.Additionally, the game is VERY moddable. The 'LA Mod' is definitely recommended as it adds dozens of additional units and missions.To put it simply, this game is a must play and for the price it's being offered at, it's definitely worth grabbing. There are rumors of emegency 5 being released next month (October 2014) and hopefully it's a better game than the poorly done Emergency 2012/2013/2014 games and hopefully, the release of Emergency 4 on Steam is a good sign of Emergency 5 being released on Steam sometime soon."

There is no other game that has the amount of detail and freedom as this game. You control the fire, medical, police, and technical services of a city. Firefighters must set up hoses and put equipment on. Police must secure crime scenes and control onlookers. Medics must triage and transport. Technical services must repair equipment. The game does a great job of making sure to put enough emphsis on each of the services.I can not recomend this game enough.As added fun, I recomend looking into the LA Mod made by Hoopah. It changes the game from European to American services."

,Recommended,323610,29285366,Posted: 15 January,all,Bollogg ☀,"Greetings!I first need to state that this game was one of my early childhood games so it could be that my review is not entirely unbiased but I will try to keep it as objectively as possible.Emergency 4 or 911: First Responders is - as you will now hopefully know - a real time strategy game in which you take complete control over the fire brigade, the police, the ambulance and technical services. That means that you cannot simply pause, give commands and then let it all work out. Though there is a pause button, you can only move around and do nothing else when it is activated. Before getting into more details, I have to say that buying this game on Steam has the following disadvantage that the Deluxe Edition is not included. Therefore, you will not have a second map to choose from in freeplay and three deluxe missions will not be playable. Furthermore, this is the american version of the game so the cars themselves won't have the original German names on them but rather big, not as fitting English general ones. (That is just a minor detail and I don't think anyone will be bothered that)The CampaignThe Campaign in Emergency 4 consists of 20 missions that follow this vague pattern: There will be a little animation followed by an information text about what has happened and what you will need to do. Then you will try to master the tasks at hand while mostly at some point one or more surprising events occur that make the mission even more difficult. After completing one you will be taken to a freeplay-like map in which you have to take care of random day to day missions in that city until you can buy some special vehicle, equipment or training so you can go on to the next mission.Whilst every mission is fairly manageable, completing all of them with 90-100% (i.e. noone died, personnel and property damage have been mostly avoided, budget and time are okay) is going to be extremely difficult. You will have to do way more stuff on all fronts at once than you can handle but thus the reward was for me even more satisfying when I scored a relatively high percentage.The freeplayWhen you've decided to play freeplay you are presented with two options: Endless Game and Challenge Mode. On both you will be thrown into a city where random events will occur that you will have to deal with by controlling again all 4 services at hand. The difference between these modes being that on the first, events will be completely random whilst on the second, things will start off relatively easy and will get harder the longer you play.This mode has been for me quite a nice option to waste time on when I am bored or when I want to do something trivial when watching something else but after 40-60 minutes things will mostly get repetitive.Therefore, I highly recommend the usage of mods (which there are plenty of) and as a newcomer I'd start with the easiest to use and the most famous one: The Los Angeles Mod.The GameplayThe Gameplay definitely isn't for everyone. You will need to control every single unit individually, they will not put out fires, treat patients or follow criminals themselves no matter how close they are (except the doctor who will run towards the next injured person when he is out of the vehicle). To give an example of this: There have been reports of a fire nearby and you naturally sent a fire truck. Once you've sent it there, you will need to tell the firemen to get out of the vehicle, then make them equip i.e. a hose, connect it to the truck (or a hydrant) and then tell each of them which fire to put out. To be fair, they are going to put out fires around them once they have connected their hozes but only to a certaint degree.So you can imagine that dealing with everyone individually will be extremely hard and chaotic when you have events everywhere which all need your attention but that is the core of the game. You will be stressed alot, trying to maintain control at all fronts.Overall, if you are searching for a game like this choose Emergency 4. I haven't tested all of the other ones but based on their review rate compared to this one it is fair to say that the 4th part of this series is definitely the best one with a huge modding community so it shall never get bored.Thank you, one person who has read this far!"

An absolutely fantastic game, if you look past the very poor coding and AI spawning ETC.  Has an amazing mod community and some of the best content such as the LA mod completely transforms the game.  One of the only Emergency services management game and highly recommended.As for the flaws, yes there are many.  The civilians have no regard for their own safety and routinely stand close to cars about to explode, etc.  When you block a civilians path say closing off the scene of an accident, it will continually spawn civilians until the FPS absolutely tanks.  The AI pathfinding is poor, and even still there are a fair amount of glitches with hoses and other core game mechanics.Regardless, especially playing the LA mod the idea of controlling the different services is absolutely intoxicating.  Even taking the game online to control only one service with your friends makes for some of the best team play.  Graphics are very good considering the games' age."

76561197987664334,Recommended,323610,12962241,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,Eddie Krueger,"After two hours, three missions I dare to say it's worth the 5€.Basically it's a real-time strategy where you're not playing a cigar-smoking general who commands armies of tanks, instead your units are medics, firefighters, policemen and other people who have anything to do with emergencies; maybe only Batman is missing.The game has a sandbox-like campaign, where you are assigned as the man directing the city's first line of defense during calamities, and you will get - I presume - randomly generated emergencies including extinguishing fires of various sizes - from a few smoking bushes to blazing multistory buildings, catching pickpockets and restarting failing hearts. Time to time, however, a pregenerated larger scale operation will pop up which will certainly require a combined operation. For example in the first and second one you will need both medics and firefighters - with gasmasks in the second, while you need medics, criminal profilers and marksmen in the third. All in all, I have no problems with the variety of missions so far.But the game has problems. The most important - for me - is that it lacks active pause; when you stop the time, you cannot issue orders. Many would say ""it's called real-time for a reason"", but I would answer: ""If it was real-time strategy then an ambulance would reach its destination in 30 minutes or so, and not within seconds. So let's call these accelerated time strategy, and as such, they need active pause. Especially when you have to act for all your men and women, because they will apathetically suffocate in a smoke-filled building should you not order them outside."" And with that last sentence we reached the topic of AI.Well, it's simple, and not without problems. For example the firemen will target the nearest fire within a few a meters when they have a hose in their hands, but will gladly try to take the longer route to reach their assigned target, even if that way the hose will be too short. So don't try to send them on longer journeys unattended, which means a lot of micromanagement when your hands would be full even with a more proactive crew.Another problem is that they just don't seem to comprehend the gravity of these emergencies. For example, in the third mission I had six marksmen ordered to riddle two mobsters with bullets. The culprits were of course running towards the edge of the map, and my unit of cold professionals, the tip of the spear, the edge of the knife, the crack of my ... eh... were walking after them. And I don't mean they did not take a vehicle or something, I mean that they simply did not feel like running. I had to order a donut-eating patrolman into the criminals path, and - luckily - they immediately opened fire on him, giving enough time to my SWAT team to finish sightseeing and catch up with them. My condolences to the widow, her husband died a heroic, although otherwise completely avoidable death. Bleh.I think that's all I could say about the game. The sounds are okay and the graphics are, well, there. I mean you won't drop your chin, unless the most recent game you played is Defender of the Crown, but it's not bad at all. Long story short, as I mentioned before the game has its own share of sometimes hair-thinning problems, and I would hesitate to call it a good buy should I have paid 20€ or so for it, but for 5€ it's a bargain."

When equipped with a hose, you must manually order them to attatch to a hydrant or Water Bower before they can fight fires.Overall, 911 is still very good despite its age, and is, at least until mods start appearing for Emergency 5 and many bugs are fixed, much better.

Though the same map can be a bit bland after many hours of gameplay, taking a small break, then popping back into another match playing a different role greatly changes things up. Definitely a must buy if you have friends to play with.Multiplayer is a bit sketchy at best.

It's easily one of the best emergency games I've played to date.There are however, a few things about this game which I do not like. Note that I almost exclusively play the LA mod currently.- In the base game, paramedics are just stretcher bearers (being a paramedic student myself, I find this very annoying), however in the LA Mod, the Paramedics can actually do stuff, whereas the EMTs are mainly stretcher bearers.- The AI drivers can be really stupid, many a traffic jam has been caused when three people tried to go through an intersection at the same time in different directions, and end up having to wait for each other... cue 3 police cruisers to clear the backlog.- A lot of items can be a bit finiky to deploy or use, especially when your trying to do them quickly, an example from the LA mod would be police spikestrips: click car, click to disembark cop, click cop, click get equipment, click spikestrip, wait for cop to get it from car, click location next to road, click deply strip, click in direction to deply.- Trying to manage 10 different crews (eg. 4 fire trucks with 4 firemen each, 3 ambulances with crew, 1 crane and 2 police cars with 2 cops) can be very painful at times, especially when you are racing the clock (either fire spreading or people dieing)"

,Recommended,323610,34272479,Posted: 16 August,all,Isaiah53six,"FIRST OBSERVATIONSAt first glance 911:First Responders/Emergency 4) doesn't seem all that appealing and had a slight learning curve for me.By default this game features European emergency vehicles and sirens only but the game excepts MODS.  The Los Angeles MOD introduces American vehicles and sirens into the game making it highly worth playing.GRAPHICSThe graphics are decent for an older game and the game even runs on my older system.IN-GAME AUDIO COMMANDSAfter a short time I thought the in-game police, fire and paramedic commands became repetitive and borderline annoying. The good news is these sounds can be changed and even deleted entirely if you so choose!CAMERA VIEW LIMITATIONI found the default camera views also limiting but they can be altered (slightly) in the games config file.MODS AND SETTINGSThis game allows MODS and file editing which is the only reason I purchased the game. There are some great mods out there for this game.The games config files can be altered to suit your tastes. (example: the number of callouts/events, select events, weather, starting funds, etc. )NEWBIE LEARNING CURVEAs a newbie unfamilier with this style of game,  I think the multiple and overlapping callouts/events are a bit overwhelming (especially when trying to learn how the game works).  The good news is that it's entirely possible (and recommended) to edit the frequency of events among other game settings.THE BOTTOM LINEDespite a somewhat limiting camera view (takes getting used to; It's NOT SimCity) and some minor in-game MOD related glitches, the ability to add MODS and edit game settings make 911:First Responders still relevant and highly recommended.  At $5 it's a great deal."

So for 5 bucks you might as well pick this one up.On a side note to make the game 1920x1080 you need to edit the config files. Also when you get an arson call send cops immediately, when there is an illegal demonstration send more cops than you think you need or you will most likely get cops killed and end up killing lots of civillians as demonstations can get out of hand really quick."

Beware playing it on more active displays or it will minimize to desktop very often (like almost every your order to click).The game itself has a lot of things to do. The first mission, for example. On a rainy day a soil is waterlogged so a crane tilt and fell on a building where were some workers repairing. There are two injuries, one injured person lies under barrier. You need to call the ambulance to heal those injured person, but you also need to call a firefighter to lift the barrier. Then a crane drops even more making a fire and another injury so you will pick a firefighter, extinguish the fire etc. For extinguishing the fire you may equip your firefighter with hose connected to water pipe or to pick fire extinguisher.

All missions are challenging, which is nice, and some require to use all 4 departments (Fire, Medic, Police and Engineering) to complete a mission. I believe in one mission (I think its from the LA mod) you had to use the engineers to get into an airport because the gates were locked.Great game, I grabbed it for 50% and I must say it was a steal!Edit 2 (adding more info and what not): Recently installed NYC, London and US Army mods. Great mods! NYC and London are fantastic, however the US Army mod is too much for me man... too complex. ;)Nonetheless, I love the London mod. Probably my favourite mod, since I live in the UK. Modding this game is easier than modding GTA 4 if anyone played that... as simple as opening up an installer and selecting a file. Boom!This game offers a wide range of callouts, and the campaign has some really fun missions (currently just finished mission 4). There is a total of 20 missions, and some mods, like the LA mod offers additional missions if you wish to do those. Between each mission is a period of free play, where you respond to a variety of fire, medic and police calls throughout the city to get funds to buy vehicles to help in the next mission(s). Outside of the campaign you have free mode and challenge mode. Free mode is basically the same thing as the inbetween missions bit, but there are no missions but just call outs, which I like (it is what I play all the time so) and challenge mode... haven't tried that yet, but I will give it a go. Might be fun, who knows?Update 1: 14/02/15Played a little bit, still with London Mod. Ohh man this mod is amazing! Since I'm new to the Emergency series I don't know how to tackle half the calls so I ended up calling in 3 armed response vehicles to an illegal demonstration. topg.Nonetheless I am still to try Challenge mode. Will try that when I have time, if I don't forget. Also I should play more of the campaign missions, I'm only on like... 4, maybe 5?Will update review as I progress through this fun game ;^)"

But with some positive points.Allow me to clarify:I see a lot of positive reviews for this game, and I know it was a product of its era, but I really struggle to wrap my brain around this one. Aside from a few issues where save games were mysteriously deleted, I found that before I could get my hands on a campaign mission I had to wade through inane emergency after inane emergency.Quick! Someone's had a fall and has a minor injury! (A minor injury? Like a sprained ankle? Fine, they can wait while I tend to the three fires going on and the pickpocket on the loose) - I return a minute or two later and find that the person had DIED from their minor injuryI eventually did get into the campaign and tried the first two 'levels' - but really it seems that there is a formula for dealing with them, and deviating *at all* makes things difficult.Pathfinding is ridiculous - roads are a mere suggestion - and I know there's the ages-old argument about depth vs simplicity, but requesting a fire truck, then waiting for it, then selecting it when it arrives, then clicking near to the fire emergency, then asking your firefighters to get out, then asking your firefighters to equip themselves with fire hoses, then asking your firefighters to attach their equipped fire hoses to separate fire hydrants dotted around the area, THEN finally asking them to put out the fire (Though the hitbox often means you end up cooling a building and not attacking the fire), it does get rather tiresome. When the fire is out , reasonably you'd expect them to tackle any other fires in their immediate vicinity, but no, they will stand about and wait for the order - often while you're doing other things - so the fire spreads yet further. THEN once the fire is out, you tell your firefighters to disconnect the hoses, put the gear away, then get back in the vehicle before either shuttling them to the next fire or sending them back to HQ.It is very difficult to manage time in this game, and completing campaigns often means failing them often enough until you know the formula. It's a very stressful game at the best of times!I really can see the appeal, and Hardcore RTS fans may very well be all over this, but this game is not for me, and certainly not one I'd recommend for the casual or average gamer...!THAT ALL SAID - apparently there are plenty of mods which make this game a lot more playable. To those who have time for such endeavours - I wish you luck!As usual, I have documented my progress in the form of a video playlist:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC1vQ3C6bM0"

After this I bought the CD of Emergency 4 (a.k.a. 911: First Responders) and I play it obsessively, even after the end of the campaing. I tried to accomplish all the missions with the maximum score. Yeah, good old times, and today I'm replaying this version on Steam. Sadly it's only in english (the CD version has a lot of languages), but still works on Windows 10 and bring back this reverted concept of the Real Time Strategy.I even enjoyed it playing bad: making train accidents, letting people die and buildings burn, only to create a more catastrophic tragedy and a more challenging problem to solve.The only two problems that I detected are 1) Scenes that requires polices, shooting and action, are not interesting and the manual management of the cops turns it hard and confusing, and 2) The stupid civilians, this AI is so dumb, but I supose it tries to be realistic and people in real world does the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things, put their selves on risk and die beneathly."

Default multiplayer is bugged and you need to be on same wifi/internet to play multiplayer, BUT there is a software called Hamachi that allows you to play from different wifi/internets. Just have everyone who is playing join a free server you can set up, and whoever is hosting will give their Hamachi IP (not in game IP) to the others to type into Direct IP connect to connect to the multiplayer game.

The occasional stroke, small fire, or pickpocket to deal with. Then situations get more and more severe and more and more frequent Not gradually, it just spikes and spikes up.Before you know it your fingers are moving across your keyboard at lightning speed as your rapidly clicking the minimap to bring you all over the city to deal with 10 situations at once. Those situations can also create more situations.Example:- I receive word that there is an unauthorized demonstration going on in the north part of town. I look over there and it's just some guy with a sign shouting ""Resist!"". So I send a police car over and pay the man no mind.- Then there is a traffic accident on the other side of town and one of the vehicles involved is now in the river along with the driver. So I'm sending ambulances, some firefighters, a divert, some tow trucks and a crane.- While this is happening a rabid dog is on the loose. I send some armed police to go deal with it.- I have now forgotten about the Unauthorized demonstration.- Now I'm micromanaging the traffic accident. Having the firefighters pry open one of the cars to rescue the injured driver and shoving them in an ambulance. The diver is slow as a turtle but ends up attaching a buoy to the submerged vehicle so the crane can pull it out of the water.- I check back on the rabid dog and instruct the officers to put it down. A civilian was injured so I deploy an ambulance and bring the officers back to HQ.- The other car in the accident is out of the water and the firefighters pry it open, Sadly the driver is already deceased. I have the towtrucks recover the vehicles and send it all back to HQ.- The ambulance aiding the injured civilian (that may have rabies now) is on the scene and I micromanage the process and then bring it back to HQ.- I have now noticed that there is a fire on the minimap. Though since I wasn't notified it wasn't part of the Endless modes generated emergencies.- Turns out that Unauthorized demonstration has grown from one man to a full blown mob on a rampage that has started a large fire and killed the officer that I sent.- I kick into high gear. I deploy all of my officers and ambulances to the scene along with a hydro-pup equipped armored vehicle. I decide not to risk any fire fighters and just pay a bunch of in-game money to have an airplane drop a load of water onto the building.- I ignore the medical and criminal emergencies that pop up while I organize my forces to put down the riot. Though I do divert attention to any fires.-So my police forces arrive and attempt to put down the riot non-lethally. While the officers are over-whelmed the hydro tank is able to repel the rioters just fine. Sadly the water plane hasn't arrived yet so the fire is still going. Since I am monitoring 5 places at once I am too late to notice that the hydro tank caught fire and exploded. Killing multiple officers.- Many rioters are injured, but whenever any civilians walk by and see the riot they join in, so their numbers keep growing while I keep losing my officers.- Eventually matters grow grave. So I lure the rioters into a parking lot and let them attack the remaining police cruisers. The area is now on fire. I make sure to contain the fire and the rioters inside with my remaining forces.- I should note that during this another traffic accident, a bank robbery, more fires, and a bomb threat have occurred.- Eventually all the rioters are dead or dying. I save as many as I can and deliver the rest to the morgue and breath a sigh of relief.- Then mere seconds later there is an earthquake which causes fires and injuries across the city.- I quit the game so I do not have a heart attack.***********************************************************************************************************************This game with Free-mode alone is quite fun until you get overwhelmed. Then you will be the one needing medical attention.For 5 USD on Steam I say this game is worth it to kill time.."

I remember playing it years before this, but somehow back then it was better, or maybe it was another game? This Steam game is just a no-no, it's buggy, forces you to replay missions because something bugged out, AI is sometimes just stupid, the firefighters/medics wont get out of the car themself so you need to click on them every single time. That's just annoying, i had to replay a mission not once, not twice, but three times because one patient magically dissapered. After a while it gets boring and frustrating. I got it on a Winter Sale for almost 1 euro and i got 11 hours into it. I regret it. It would be a good game if it wasn't that bugged."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!(No but seriously this game is lit)"

In Emergency 4, you take on the role of the Chief of Police, Director of EMS, Fire Chief, and Technical Coordinator. You dispatch units to a call whether it involves crime, medical emergencies, fires, or simply a traffic light failure. You even all four of them for traffic accident, and many other emergencies! I'd recommend downloading the LA Mod for this game, as although the European version is satisfying, the LA Mod is 500x more satisfying and contains almost 200% more units than the vanilla version of Emergency 4.

Sometimes a civilian will stop in the middle of the road until you move them. Also, firefighters are not aware of things blocking their hose, so you gotta make sure nothing blocks them. I hope that the developers would be so kind to release a small patch to fix these issues, now that the game is on Steam, but the game is from 2006. Very old.

I played it in hard mode and it gave me a good challenge. The design of the campaign is quite balanced with enough variation. The only aspect I found odd about the game design was that sometimes I received very detailed instructions on what to do and sometimes I was barely offered any clue.The graphics are absolutely OK, especially when you take into account that it is about 10 years old. I think the animations, textures and effects are still rather nice. I only had very little graphic bugs. Unfortunately, I had some performance issues: Occasionally, the framerate dropped considerably. Given the fact that my computer easily meets the requirements of this title, that should not happen at all.The sound is also good: You have music which is not unnerving over time and the responses from your units are appropriate.The biggest shortcoming are some bugs because of which I could not finish three mission. Luckily, there is a cheat to win the mission which I then used.All in all, this is a decent game for those who like simulations and who would like to save lives rather than kill people for a change. At least, this was a nice deviation from the usual ""seek-and-destroy"" RTS genre (which I do like)."

Though the graphics settings are not very high (I use 1024 x 768) the screen displays clearly and the game can be played either windowed or fullscreen. There is a continuous play option where random emergencies are thrown at you requiring you to dispatch the correct equipment in order to deal with them and a tutorial is available at the start of Campaigns. However you are only able to play missions in Campaign mode by unlocking each one as you progress through to the next as you advance through the game. SPOILER ALERT! By typing 911 First Responders into Youtube I have seen gameplay footage on there of the missions which are available to play in the game which dates from when it first appeared in 2011. I'd rate this game 4/5 so far.

This game was basically the english version of emergency 4 (German).To cut it short, this is a rare breed of game. You play as emergency services commander. Managing multiple departments such as Fire Brigade, Police Squads, Medical and Engineering Services, responding to multiple calls that can threaten life of the helpless.Vanilla game has challenging missions that will test your micromanagement skills. Stretching your brain ability to memorize, prioritize, and multitasking to its limit.There are Mods that will transform this game to the real gem, putting real life emergency services to countries worldwide. Enhancing the gameplay furthermore. Find your friends to do some co-op, unique experience guaranteed."

This game has mods, besides emergency 5, 6 and 7 dont have any mods you can download. Haven't tried it? Buy it, you will like it. Don't like the first mod? Go and install a mod on emergencyplant. Hope you enjoy this game!"

This game is perfect for 5 Dollars. 7/10"
