Brad and Buddy from Lisa, Joy Factory and Canyon Tracks2. Humans and Ghosts from Crawl. Powerups based on a couple of stand out weapons from the game would work.3. The Beaver and some skinned Player Characters from Chroma Squad. A powerup that summons a mech on the horizon to fire short barrage of homing attacks on a nearby racer might work if it's not TOO over-the-top4. Tim from Braid. A powerup that makes everyone but the user ""rewind"" to a second or two before while the user still speeds forward would be appropriate if not too complicated to code.5. Dust from Dust for the deviantart kids6. The Janitor from Spaceport Janitor, complete with existential whining and Spaceport Track7. Axiom Verge powerups.8. Thomas and friends from Thomas was Alone9. Player from Retro City Rampage.10. Something Meta for Stanley Parable.11. Yo. Undertale? They have enough iconic mess going on they could have their own set of spinoff racing games.12. Since you've already made friends with Adult Swim, some Classic AS characters that still fit the theme, like Ignignokt and Err?Oh, the game is good if you know what you're getting into: A Super Mario Kart-a-like. SPECIFICALLY SUPER Mario Kart for the SNES."

It goes so fast that I can't even stop myself from comparing it to F-Zero more than Mario Kart. And that is BY FAR one of this game's strongest points.-A LOT of less known Indie Games could really get out there from this.-It's really quirky, especially those items!-Though i'm REALLY waiting for Carol to get into the roster, I'm enjoying playing as Lea from Cross Code and Tim Burr from Fists Of Awesome (Two games I don't know a thing about).CONS:-Something that you should have from the get-go of EVERY kart racer, even if it's in Early Access, TIME TRIALS, isn't playable at the moment.-Titus from Indie Assault is in the roster-The tracks are kinda short.I'm really looking forward to this game. It looks AMAZING, and the flaws aren't really that bad (except the Time Trials one).FINAL VERDICT:""Keep up the good work Mac.""~Doc Louis,Punch Out!"

,Not Recommended,323670,26408941,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Reed,"Before I say anything, I'd like to make it clear Ididenjoy this game, I just wouldn't reccomend you to buy it.I loved zipping around the track, and I have a soft spot for any game that let's me play as Carol Tea ofFreedom Planet, even if that does make me someone usually avoided at parties. Infact, the whole character set is actually pretty great, and aside from a few visuals, such as the melon-with-a-face (used in-game as a menu cursor among other things), which are awkwardly smooth for a retro-style video game, the graphics are absolutely great. It's deffinitely a fun game to look at.That's where the ""but"" comes in, and this is a big ""but."" It's a lot of fun to look at, but a lot less so to play. That's because this game cannot decide if it wants to be Mario Kart on the SNES or Mario Kart 8; the courses themselves are more like the SNES game, being flat and often very blocky, with only about half of the tracks having any real smooth turns. The turning controls themselves are also very comparible to SNES Mario Kart, being somewhat slidey and slow (though arguably a littletoo slow), but allowing for brisk and speedy turns using a slide. However, while these two design choices work well with each other, they're both made near-unenjoyable by the fact that rather than making the karts move only at a reasonable speed as in the SNES Mario Kart, allowing players to better judge turns and react to the other racers and track hazards without being hindered by the slower turning speeds, the game decides it needs to try to keep the player's attention by making every car go extremely fast. This leads to the problem that due to the slow turning and the quick speeds, by the time you notice an obsticle it's already too late to really avoid it. This, combined with the fact that the blocky track designs often require tight 45 degree turns, means you'll be hitting things a lot.This game has potential, but either they need to slow down the gameplay, or completely redesign the tracks."

Here are my first impressions:+ It captures the feel and look of Super Mario Kart pretty well!+ Nice character and track variety+ you have multiple objectives in a race. Get first, collect the mushroom and collect a specific amount of money during the race. This is optional and raises the rank you earn at the end of the cup+ All the game modes you expect from Mario Kart are there, GP, Time Trial, Battle, Versus, ...+ the music is awesome!- the tracks are super colorful and full of hidden ways, items and other things. You feel really lost and need to learn every track before being able to get first everywhere- the developers really overdid it in terms of shortcuts. On some tracks, you can just use one shortcut after another until the end of the lap. Feels like every curve has 2 ways to drive it. Because of that you never know if you're driving the correct way. It's a bit too much- some soundeffects are really loud- drifting feels very unusual and needs some time to get it right. Doesn't feel as natural as Mario Kart at the beginningOverall I'm enjoying this game a lot. Most of my cons can be solved by the player by simply learning the tracks and the controls. Which is OK for a singleplayer game, but I feel like a Mario Kart-clone needs a better accessablity for new players.It doesn't really feel like an early access title to me, but it's strange that (at this moment) half of the tracks have no game references and are just colorful tracks.I also learned about many other promising indie titles with this game.I can definitely recommend this game!"

Canabalt, Duck Game, Guacamelee, Freedom Planet, Adventures of Pip, Shutshimi, Teslagrad, and Runbow are the only games featured that I've even heard of. I mean, I'm sure that the developer for this game approached some of the more recognizable developers and got turned down, but even so, the roster is a little underwhelming.-In fact, it kinda seems like some of the characters are just there to fill roster space. I don't know what Toto Temple Deluxe is, but for some reason it gets four separate characters that each have their own character slot.-That's another thing: there's a really noticeable unbalance in how much representation each game gets, especially in terms of characters. The Toto Temple Deluxe thing I mentioned earlier is the most flagrant example, but there are other games that, in my opinion, probably should only have one character representing them. But I guess it's kinda too late to change that."

But I have seen better.First of all, while my wired xbox-controller worked fine, the on-screen keycommands were still displayed for the keyboard.  And while it's not rocket science to figure three buttons out, it still holds back the ""pick-up-and-play""-aspect I expect from a kart racer.The gameplay is very similar to the original Mario Kart. You drive, you throw things, you try to win. The controls, in my opinion, feel a bit floaty and lack the grip of similar kart racers, but maybe that's just me.What this game offers is challenge. The tracks are harder than you might expect, with a lot of sharp turns, many jumps, and an abundance of obstacles. And it doesn't help that, when you get hit, your driver AND the camera spins around, leaving you guessing whether you are still looking in the right direction.As for the tons of tracks and crossovers (SO MANY CHARACTERS!), it doesn't add much to the game. Every track and character feels pretty much the same. The idea behind the VR-TRAX, which are maybe 70 % of the tracks in the game, is that they look like tron-style meshes in different colours. I was underwhelmed.There are other aspects I don't like, for example the toned down music, the AI that seems as helpless as I am and so on, but I just wanted something quick, easy and fun to play with friends or alone.But apart from screaming ""LOOK AT ALL THESE INDIE GAME CROSSOVERS"" right in my ear, this doesn't offer much to me."

The TV filter is nifty and makes me wonder what other filters might be added later for other nostalgia attempts. It does what it comes to do, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun. Looking forward to the new content coming and even the runbo track I hate made me laugh.Looking for another kart game that brings back the SNES style, enjoyed the other kart games like sonic's racing tittles? Well your next kart game has drifted into early access. Looking forward to playing this one online. Least I sure hope that online comes through. Everything else seems well under way, even the pitfalls of the game can be something to laugh at.Another thing to mention is that it doesn't seem to suffer from trying to push the same racers unrealistically to winning, meaning you can indeed play the game's point system realistically for the cup win without getting first place every time. At least so far. Something I believe well worth mentioning with rubberbanding mechanics past.When you hit your speedy stride here, you feel that rush, even just starting with the 50cc, you're already having fun.If I were to nit pick here, only a few of the characters I'm fond of so far, but there are still some there, and the sound ballancing feels like it needs a little work. That and though the control design as is, is more than functional, I want the ability to re map my controller. In this day and age, there's just no reason not to have the likes in the final product.Despite that, well worth the ten bucks, a steal if on sale, and a modern twist on a classic look with new track ideas that brings it's own flavor.

,Recommended,323670,23798807,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,The Chaos Maker,"The game is just like the original mario kart, but different, good and bad. The tracks look great and have great music, but I think that either make the tracks bigger or extend the lap count because it feels a little to short for my taste. The character selection is great and has lots of options. I would like if you added a character from Gang Beasts, it would make my day. The controls are nice except the drifting. It feels too floaty and it is difficult to start a drift. One more thing I would like you to add is local multiplayer in racing and in the battle mode up to four players. I would also like to choose which courses I like to play. All in all, it is a great game, just add and tweek a few things"

It sure has a lot of content for an early access game, and of course it has a few bugs but overall I say the game is worth the 10 dollar entry fee. Also Carol is the best racer."

Is very snes mario kart like but looks nicer, the controls are good and is super fun. Really wish they had an online leader board for time trail or some sort of multiplayer aspect but is still in the early access so hopefully that will come. Great game and a bargain for 10 euros. If you miss mario kart becaue you play game on steam then this is perfect. I dont write reviews usually and especially not for games I have just bought but this deserves a thumbs up :)"

Sure beats waiting a couple years for the Switch to fail and Nintendo to fully embrance developing for other platforms like they are with  Super Mario Run and Pokemon Go...."
