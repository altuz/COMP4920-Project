,Not Recommended,323720,27641516,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,work4dvd,"Although billed as a ""3D psychological horror adventure and homage to the Resident Evil and Silent Hill games,"" the game is more akin to Myst and their various clones. The game is played from a first-person perspective, but the movement is constricted to clicking directional arrows; i.e., you ""move"" through static screens and click on various objects to pick them up or interact with them. Essentially, it is a first-person point and click adventure.That being said, it is a disappointing point and click adventure. The story is paper thin and offers few shocks and surprises. Although there is an ominous feel throughout and the music is appropriately creepy, the ""horror"" element simply falls flat; it simply isn't scary. Due to the very nature of Myst-like games, you'll often be confused directionally, especially since there's little variety in the environments. The puzzles are rather simplistic, requiring very little thought to complete once you have the requisite items. The lack of voice acting throughout is sorely missed; despite the fact that there are three other characters besides yourself, inexplicably, the only voiceover is for a short story and several newspaper clippings.I want to call attention to the English text dialogue and descriptions, which suffer from poor translation, likely due to the developers being Swedish. Since the story is important in a game such as this, the awkward sentences and word choices drag the game down significantly. (I don't know why so many developers don't enlist native English speakers to fine tune their game; it would make a huge difference.)For achievement hunters, I achieved 100% in 4.6 hours. The majority of extra time was backtracking to find coins and, for one achievement, hidden text revealed by the flash of a Polaroid camera. If you're not interested in 100% completion, the game could be blazed through in 2-3 hours.TL;DR: In a word: disappointing. It's certainly not worth the $9.99 asking price, but if you see it on sale for a dollar or in a bundle and you can overlook its flaws, it can be a mildly entertaining time waster."

Even though it is a point and click, you will still feel this underlying feeling of terror as the game slowly reveals what's happening piece by piece.

If you only have a $10 net worth, you could probably find better uses for that money.They got the puzzle aspect right in this one. While most games haphazardly throw together 'puzzles' in the form of ""move the blocks in order"", this game actually involves more thinking than most. They aren't that difficult, but will provide some satisfaction when you figure them out. A great thing I found with the puzzles is that they aren't frustrating in anyway, so you won't mind taking the time to solve them.The worst thing I can say about this is that the navigation is rough, your character turns,flips,and cartwheels all over the place and it can leave you disoriented. After I figure out where I need to go, I have to rely heavily on the ""hint"" button to point me to the correct doors; otherwise I'd end up going in a several circles.I haven't beaten it yet when I'm writing this, but I'm definitely excited (and hesitant :p) to get back into it to reveal more of the story. I picked this up looking for something to do youtube videos on, and it has delivered.(**Plus the publishers were more than willing to let me record and monetize let's plays after I EMAILED THEM FIRST.)"

The atmosphere had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The graphic style made it even more creepy. It had a few jumpscares, but didn't seem overly reliant on them. Just the atmosphere and ambience made it totally creepy. I like a good horror game, and I do sometimes like point and click games, and this game was a great horror, and was a great point and click game.Wasn't really what I would say was really hard, and many puzzles were memory based, but other puzzles took a little thought. Overall, although I never found it a huge challenge, parts had me thinking for a little bit. Minus it not being very hard, I still like the game. I like the creepy feeling you have the whole time. it is a little short, but doesn't over stay its welcome. I honestly feel it was just right, though I wouldn't mind if it was a bit longer. Is it worth the full price? Well it depends. I would buy it either way, but for how short it is, waiting for a sale might be better. It has the value though. I got it for next to nothing on sale though, and kinda almost feel it was a little too cheap. Like I bought the game for a little over $1 CAD, but would of paid more.

Oh and make sure you keep an eye out for blurry circles, they're probably optional coin collectibles that unlock...oh I don't know. I didn't care enough to try to find them all. I'm sure it was basically nothing, achievement maybe. And there was a storyline...I guess. And I got the bad ending (achievement!) because Ikept a promise(lol spoilers). Didn't care enough to go back and get the good ending. I'm sure it was the difference between a couple of lines of text.Honestly, the only reason I kept playing is because I could tell from the beginning it was going to be really (mercifully) short. 2.5 hours for all three chapters. Never going back. Save your money. Basically if they showed a few more photos on the store page you would have seen the whole game. I got this in a bundle and decided to play it because it was there.

For a 2015 game, the artwork could have been better and more detailed. It looks like a game from 1995, we don't need that today.The puzzles are ok but most of the time you will have to roam around until a scripted event triggers, and you can't know such thing is going to randomly (actually scripted) happen, like doors unlocking themselves after a cutscene for no reason or new items popping up only because you go to a room already visited in the past and the thing comes out of nowhere. There is no logic in that and is not a good way to make the progressing in the game harder.The atmosphere is cool but once you get a grasp of the story, you notice how empty and obvious it is.Can't believe it's a 10 euros game. I think I bought it for 1 euro or so, and I still almost regret it.There are much better or more entertaining point and click puzzle games and adventure games out there, I see no reason to recommend this one, even because it is highly overpriced (low budget game, cheap soundtrack, no voice acting almost at all).

Player embodies the persona of Sam - patient of rehab institution ""Reaching Dreams"" where he wishes to face his drug addiction. Sadly, as soon as very first night within the facility the place twists into the title ""mare"". Sam will have to face this world of nightmare in order to solve the dark mistery of ""Reaching Dreams"".Click'n'click adventure gameIn terms of gameplay Decay: The Mare doesn't exactly shine. Game is a somewhat crude composition of heavily photoshopped still images. Animated elements are kept to a minimum and most of the game player ""leaps"" between pictures making transitions from one place to another not exactly smooth to say the least. Pictures in general are well made and game provides hints whenever player gets stuck. Regretably due to static nature of the game they are quite painful to watch whenever backtracking is necessary and at some points you have to run from one end of the level to another. Besides this ""Decay"" is a rather standard point'n'click game requiring player to look around for items to combine and utilize in order to solve numerous puzzles. Each of three chapters leaves a little freedom of order in which player solves the objectives but all of them have to be finished to continue the story.Horror experience for easily spookedWhen reception of gameplay might be a matter of opinion it's the horror elements that were the biggest letdown for me. It is commendable that Shining Gate Software tried creating more subtle and psychological experience. Especially nowadays when ""collect ""X"" while running through a dim space for a jumpscare"" appears to be a trend among indie horrors. Pictures witnessed in Decay: The Mare were succesful in creating an amtosphere of persisent uneasiness but nothing beyond this. I've spent most of the first episode almost waiting for some jumpscare to spice things up a little and when it finally came I realised that I started getting bored by the time it showed up. Decay fails to time its spook elements properly and atmosphere thins by the time they appear, stripping them of the impact they could make.I could probably recommend the game to the ones who are easily frightened if they want to get used to the horror genre in small steps. Also point'n'click enthusiasts should find the experience enjoyable. Story, perhaps not the most thrilling, is the definitely the strongest side of the game. Regretably game is plain unrefined with elements like rotating items in equipment menu (used once in whole game) or mandatory scripts triggered by having a peek at a ladder. Decay: The Mare could be a quite good game but perhaps lack of creators' experience was the reason it failed to reach its full potential."

Really loved the atmosphere.I also enjoyed the way key pieces of the story are revealed throughout each episode, but it felt strange that completing an episode kicks you out into a menu rather than continuing seamlessly on to the next episode. It was a little immersion breaking. The three chapters are distinct in that your inventory is cleared each time, and you are unable to return to areas in the previous chapter, but it would have been much more organic to throw up a title card and just let the game continue. I completed the first episode and honestly didn't even know there were two more until I looked at the achievements that described them.That's not to condemn the game, though. It is genuinely spooky; a few of the jumpscares got me pretty dang good. And I enjoyed the puzzles overall but really wish they had been more difficult. There are a few somewhat challenging moments, especially in the excellent second episode, but often the hardest part was just trying to remember which room the clues were in.Harder puzzles with complex components (i.e. more steps than just use item A in location X) and a more nuanced relationship with their environment would be a huge improvement. Simple puzzles work in the original Resident Evil games because they have combat and inventory management, but in a game like this puzzles are the player's primary interaction with the game. Great puzzles grow organically out of a game's unique logic, and horror puzzles in particular should contribute to an inscrutable sense of dread. Hopefully Shining Gate will hone in on that kind of development with their next title."

Your character is a psychiatric patient who thinks he's woken up during the night  but then finds he is in a medicine induced nightmare that he can't seem to escape. The gameplay consists of single clicks to move around, open doors, pick up objects and solve puzzles.The people who will like this game are those who really like sudden scares. The game is full of doors slamming shut in your face, shadowy figures running on the periphery of your vision, objects being thrown at you by invisible forces... that sort of thing. If you're happy to turn the lights down, walk around an old creepy building and have things go BOO! at you, then buy the game.If is is important to you that your games have interesting plots, interesting characters, good scripting or challenging puzzles this isn't for you.More detail:There is a consistent plot arc running through the three chapters which is completed without leaving many things unexplained but it lacks any detail.The puzzles are really lacking. Most involve taking undisguised codes from one part of the environment to open a door in another. I found nothing challenging and therefor not satisfying.Any creepy atmosphere the game might have generated was ruined by the horrible navigation mechanism. The same icon is at different times used to move you back a step, make you turn around 180 degrees or  move you back a step followed by turning around 180 degrees. It's disorientating and tedious.  It was annoying enough to stop any spooky atmosphere coming through."

Sure, the narrative had potential, but I understood immediatly the limitations of the game. It's a point-and-click. Don't expect a fight scene, having to run away, hiding, etcetera.It is all very straightforward. At first I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the ""thing"" following me throughout the centre, but I noticed how it never really ""came"" for me. Thus the limitations of a point-and-click. No ""real"" action.Still, I looked past this and continued with my exploration. The soundtrack was nice and unsettling, some of the characters (one in particular, if you played you know who im talking about) was fun to talk with and the puzzles needed exploration and some thinking, without being overly challenging. The coin-collecting is fun and unlocks some neat extras, I recommend collecting them, the game being pretty short.To sum it up, I liked this game, even though point-and-click really aren't my thing.I would give it a 6 out of 10.

It took me about 4 hours to complete and it might appeal to you if you like the darker side of point n' click like Scratches, Lost Crown: A Ghost Hunting Adventure, Sherlock Holmes: The Awakening, etc.  It's probably better than the first two on my list, but not up to the third.Anyway, you're Sam...a drug addict, a man on the edge, trying to get your life straight in this crazy asylum/rehab facility/group home etc.  From the very beginning it's clear things are not as they seem and the game takes you on Sam's journey through 3 chapters as you scavenge for items, solve puzzles to progress and try to figure out just what the heck is going on.Decay is not a great looking game.  Serviceable.  Way better than Scratches which was hard to find anything because of the ugly, filthy rendering and graphics, but it's comparable.  Still, it's not too difficult to find what you need and the puzzles for the most part are pretty easy if you pay attention to your surroundings and all of the clues you pick up.  You'll  always have a couple of items in your inventory and it's pretty easy to figure out what goes where, what needs combined and what unlocks what.  About 2 puzzles stumped me for a bit but trial n' error is your best friend and even the casual point n' click gamer should be able to figure them out.The game succeeds most in atmosphere.  Your environment undergoes several weird changes through the episodes, and  unusual things will happen in places you've already visited.  There's alot of achievements to get and I got most of them quite easily.  If you back-track and keep your eyes open, you'll find most of 'em.  Though the ""asylum"" setting is getting overdone at this point, it's well used here and there is a general sense that you're being followed and watched from the get go.  Like I said in my Dreadout review...Decay is a game that's not straight up scary, but rather weird, atmospheric and in your head.  I'll remember a couple of the weird characters I encountered forever.  Being unable to die ramps your courage level up for this one, so just keep pressing on.Sound design was solid and the piano soundtrack was cool.  There's not alot of spoken dialogue but what is there is well-done enough and conveys the story, and as an old school game I don't mind reading text, so that was never a problem.  The puzzles were just challenging enough to give you some sense of accomplishment by figuring them out but don't expect a tough, daunting endeavor and you'll be okay.Not everything is perfect here.  The interface can clunk around a bit.  It works alright but it's definitely not the most intuitive around and neither is moving around.  Sometimes when entering through a door, you'll be faced different ways than you'd expect to be facing which can lead to some stumbling around and doofusing your way into the wrong room or direction more than once.  A little more character development would have been nice.  You don't get to know Sam reallllllly well enough...enough to vest yourself in his adventure but I didn't find myself particularly worried or concerned about the character.  The same holds true with the protagonists.  Perhaps, a little more voice acting could have fleshed these parts out better and given a little more personality to the people and creatures that inhabit the asylum.  Although the weirder creatures (who I don't want to give away) were wonderfully well done and total WTF creations.  Play the game and you'll see what I mean.Overall, point n' clickers with a taste for the macabre will definitely enjoy this.  I almost lean towards not recommending it because it's far from perfect, yet it's decent enough for a one time play through.  If you have a pretty free day off work you can beat it in one setting.  Decay is not quite a must have but I enjoyed and those with a taste for the macabre that enjoy classic point n' click should give it a try.  At $10...it's a ""Hmmm, purchase,"" I'd say 5 or 6 on a sale would be the right price.  I'll break it down as I always do!Pros:-Good usage of an overdone setting-Great sound design and soundtrack-Creepy atmosphere throughout-The story does just enough right to keep you going-Fun puzzle solving that is just satisfying enough (very logic based)-Some wild, weird characters that you will remember.Cons:-Graphics are mundane at best.-Could have used more voice acting.-Moving/interfaces are serviceable but a little goofy/clunky-Despite the fun of the puzzles and their appreciable logic design, many are far too easy-Could be more challenging in general (but you do want to push on)-Protagonist is ho-hum-Story could use more emotional investment all around.Overall:  6.9/10"

Grahpics Wh0r3s need not applyA relatively short game running me a little over four hours. I never left the game running while taking a break so my completion time is respective of average completion time for a player of average intelligence.Having said that none of the puzzles were too difficult nor too easy and I used the hint system only about three times; twice wastefully as I only needed to retrace memory a few steps to find a solution.Despite most of The Mare's adventure being utterly nonsensical the third installment wraps everything up with logical explanation. The story, ten years ago, would've been deemed quite profound but nowadays is a common one; no less a couple of important philsophical concerns are suggested.The main reason that The Mare gets a thumbs up from me is the game's ambience. I felt the atmosphere and scenes were illustrated by artists with some understanding of psychology and advanced awareness of emotional empathy and it's romance with locations and lighting; all miraculousy delivered well despite the older graphics engine.I paid $1.50 for the The Mare in it's entierty with all three chapters. I feel it's well worth $6The default $15 retail appears to be lieu of casuals with a large pool of gaming funds; simpler gamers who can not wrap their heads around the miriads of other genre's so only spend on Match 3's and Walking Sims."

Instead of moving around you click to move and turn around. With only few [random] puzzles and items to pick up though, don´t get fooled only because its publisher is Daedalic Entertainment. The first person feature in this game is quite unique, what´s missing are the puzzles.And it is a bit annyoing that, when moving through a door, you sometimes do a 180° [Turn around, basicalyl].And it´s even more annoying that many of the solutions include you getting into a room and then out for a random event to happen. That gives you the feeling that you´ve missed something, but in reality you only had to leave the room.Atleast you can get hints if you are stuck. It´s only really unsatisfying if you have to use them too often.In addition, voice acting would have been neat. It´s akward that the main dialogues don´t have recorded voices, because 2 articles have.But what I can say is: Atleast the story is going to make sense at the end. That´s nice.But, did I have fun?

,Recommended,323720,25392949,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Cryohydra911,"It's very unfortunate that this game is only good for one or two playthroughs - because I absolutely loved playing through it.Decay: The Mare is a spiritual successor to the Decay series that was released for XBox Live Arcade by the same development team at Shining Gate Software, and published by Daedelic Entertainment. It's a point 'n click tribute to psychological horror games, as per the description, and while it's not a survival horror game in the traditional sense, it's a solid story and has a thick atmosphere to share with all who play it.The game itself is split into three episodes, all included in this one package. Unfortunately, the game is still short, which may be a blessing in disguise - the entirety of the game is chock-full of interesting, though perhaps easy, puzzles, and is visually enticing in a gritty way, much like classic survival horror games such as Silent Hill or Resident Evil. The gameplay is simple, as a  point 'n click, but there are some interesting elements that this game has, and just enough jump scares to periodically break the tension.In the first two episodes, the story will be very confusing and probably not make too much sense overall - but in the third and final episode, everything is brought together into a big ""aha"" - arguably too well, although one of the two endings this game has presents just enough ""what if"" questions to leave the player with. It's a wonderful game with a very thorough and well-made conclusion.If you're wanting a scary point-and-click adventure experience, I would highly recommend this game. If you can't really stomach the scare factor, there's enough playthroughs that can present the experience to you without you needing to do anything yourself. I'm not sure the game alone is worth purchasing full price, considering the length of the game, but the quality is top notch and I would love to see more from Shining Gate Software.There is, of course, one question that is never answered. Why the horse?"

I'm torn because this isn't an awful game, but it does have a number of things wrong with it that really should have been corrected, such as multiple angles to each room instead of just one in many cases which causes you to get turned around a lot.  Puzzles are just ehh and are often easily solved, but in some cases they're more annoying than anything.

But I believe that for this game,it really works !! I personally love P&C games,they are the first type of games I played when I left the world of HOGs and started looking for a more involved genre of games to play !! Just like P&C mystery games,this game has a nice flow,so far. . . .It seems to me to have all the ambience of a decently made horror game,you feel creeped out being in this seemingly abandoned rehab hospital. . . I like the subject of the game too,going through treatment for drug abuse,it's a bold subject and could have been taken the wrong way by the audience and could have offended A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE !!I,for one,think it's an outstanding subject and I believe that there is SO MUCH that can be done with this subject matter and I'm hoping to see way more ideas about it in the future !!O.K.,about the game itself,it's a fairly standard point and click mystery/horror game. I think the surroundings are pretty creepy,the music lends itself to the feeling of dread,it's very unobtrusive but at the same time,it's always there,in the background,quietly sending out creepy vibes !!There is plenty to do here and plenty of places to go and doors to enter. . .I've only come across 2 mini games so far and they were pretty straightforward P&C puzzles,if you take your time and observe your surroundings you'll find the answers to the puzzles,but you do have to be diligent and pay attention-you never know what is a clue and what's put there to throw you off the scent !! I think thats one of the things I look for in this genre,I want the answers to be in the gameplay,I don't want them to be so obscure I have to resort to a walkthrough,thats not a fun game,thats a crappy made game and those are the games I delete right away !! One thing I often do with games is I take notes !! Yes,take actual handwritten notes,that I can refer back to and use in case I get stuck and am not sure what to do !You have an inventory,accessable by the I key on the keyboard,while in the inventory you have the ability to look at everything you've collected,you can turn things around and look at the backs of things,I suggest you should do that,if they give you that option,they do it for a reason and I believe you should take full advantage it. You also have a ""combine"" ability while in your inventory,as with the examine ability,I believe they give us this for a reason and it's never hurt anybody to try every insane combo you can !! You never know what will work together and what will not,unless you experiment around with your items !!I'm gonna slide back in game now,I'll repost in this review as I progress deeper in game. . ."

The plot itself, while somewhat promising to begin with didn't deliver at the end. The art and painting allusions filled me with a brief but futile hope, I mean a collection of Baroque paintings about the Biblical story of Judith was a great touch but there wasn't much done with it, especially with all the implications that specific story could have had on the plot.The puzzles were all very different from each other, which was nice and a few of them left me with a genuine feeling of accomplishment once I solved them, but a few did feel a bit cheap or the ways the clues were presented didn't make much sense.

It created the perfect atmosphere of fear by providing just the right amount of jumpscares spread out just enough to keep you terrified. The puzzles provided a little more substance to the game than I had originally believed however their level of complexity was fairly erratic. Most of them were childishly easy but some of them made me feel as if I were scooby doo and the whole gang was there except Velma who had taken a holiday. So we were fumbling about trying to place random objects in things to see what would happen. On a final note, the Hint button is ridiculously over powered. Instead of listing your objective (i.e. find a place to watch tape, or find out more about Reaching Dreams) it would instead lead you to the exact location of your interaction. Overall great game for the sale-price paid (would not be as satisfied if I had paid the full price) if what your looking for is a good scare."

The story might as well not be there, navigation is confusing, puzzles are mostly poorly done.

The story was interesting, and the game will often have you staring at the screen unsure of what exactly you just saw. It is the classic point and click adventure style.One negative aspect however, in my opinion, was the inventory system. It was slow to cycle through multiple items, and I found it annoying and confusing that some items could be spun around in the inventory, and others couldn't. When I got to a puzzle that required that I spun an item around to look at something, I spent about 10-15 minutes wandering around trying to figure out what I was missing. Until finally I realized that I could spin some items. I then tested it with other items and it turns out that only specific items can be spun around.I'd say it was 7/10 for this style of game."
,Recommended,323720,19916209,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,ʕგҚვֆ,"Decay really isn't as bad as it first comes off as, it immediately seems like some low-budget point & click, which has been super popular in the past handful of years. But Decay is set aside from the mumbo jumbo that floods the gaming market nowadays, as it's slightly unique in it's own way, though when it really boils down to the fundamentals, it's nothing special.Decay is a point & click puzzle horror game, and the puzzles are the correct difficulty (some may be too easy), which is a huge step forward compared to most games of the same genre, which have incredibly specific puzzles which you will probably NEED a walkthrough for (""Scratches"" comes to mind). The atmosphere is well established and you can get tied into the game pretty decently, though a lack of depth to the story/characters makes it hard to fully put yourself in Sam's shoes (the main character).I completed all three episodes and it took me about 2 to 3 hours, and I took my time (took a couple breaks, etc.). It's a short game but I got it for like $0.49 on sale so I'm not complaining about that, also it adequately tells it's story (which is a pretty creative idea) in the correct amount of time so the length isn't a problem. There are a few dramatic cutscenes which explain more of the story which are pretty well-done and some are downright intense, which is cool because most games of this genre have super below-par animation and graphics, but like I said, Decay stands out because it's a bit better than the average point & click puzzle horror.Though when looking at the theoretical side of Decay, even the good execution doesn't save it from being nothing more than an ""above average"" point & click puzzle horror. The story is incomplete, and the storytelling features are below par; the entire story is explained on newspaper snippets, which is the only time voice acting is present (and I don't know if it's just me but he reads WAY too slow). Voice acting isn't even present in the cutscenes, which is where I feel they should have allocated the talent, because I can read a piece of paper alone, but when I'm watching two people argue for example, I'd prefer to hear their voices rather than read it.This is an ongoing problem for Decay: the developer just flat out made dumb decisions. The navigation is also difficult, given the fact that some rooms will start at the same orientation once you enter it no matter the angle you entered it from (the game is entirely ""slide-show"" style movement and looking). So for example, if you enter one of these types of rooms from the end of the hall, it will put you on the wrong side facing the door you just came through, making the buildings feel more like a labyrinth than a residential home. And some rooms don't do this, and will orient you correctly, making it just as confusing since you probably expected to be looking at the door you just walked through. It's all very confusing, but you quickly memorize the layout of the buildings in each episode since the maps are relatively constricted, so it's a short-lived con. The small maps aren't really that much of a problem though, as there's a good density of things to do in the amount of space they give you.All-in-all, Decay isn't bad. It has a decently creative idea behind it, it's execution is above par, and the length is accurate-albeit short, if that matters to you. But the overall experience is what matters, and while at some points I was super invested in what was happening, and the game DID hold my attention for a good 2.5 hours (which is increasingly rare nowadays), it didn't have a lasting or any sort of serious impact on me. And being a dramatic horror game about murder and finding yourself and the answer to deep life questions, Decay should've made me feel way more.6.6/10"

In my opinion it's a good game to get started in the horror genre.Storywise it is interesting but I feel like the development of it was rather shallow. There was a lot of potential and although there is closure at the end of Episode 3 I feel the game would have benefited from more depth. 7/10 would recommend."

It is, however, quite short - I completed all three chapters in one sitting yesterday - so if you're going to buy, I'd say get it on sale if you can.On the positive side, the story was interesting, and some of the effects were pretty creepy. There's a good sense of atmosphere in this game. I also enjoyed the camera chapter in particular, as using the item to reveal secrets was an interesting element.In terms of criticism...well, as I said, it's quite short. Also, the level design can be a little confusing. There were a few areas in the game where it wasn't always immediately clear which door to take, where you would find yourself facing a way you didn't expect and it was quite easy to accidentally double back on yourself.Overall, I'd say this game is just okay. Worth a look if you have a few pounds to burn, but not wishlist material. Nothing awful about it, but then nothing great either. It's a good effort, but there are some much better examples of point and click horror out there.Recommended with caution."
