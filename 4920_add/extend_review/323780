,Recommended,323780,13105647,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Brad,"Overall great game if you WANT to create your own firework simulation in sync with music.Minor issues that could be fixed/improved:There should be mouse wheel scrolling in sequence editor,The firework when selected in placement should indicate which one you have selected,When playing the simulation you should be allowed to skip to a section you want to see,When creating a firework, it should allow you to clear the firework placed instead of clearing the whole rack,If the above were fixed it would be even better than it already is. The above are just minor problems that I noticed while playing. Click here to see my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zZaHJ-AqYNote: if thinking about using the ingame recorder, dont. Use Fraps instead since it doesnt cause the game to lag as much."

The base game has 2 maps, and about 35 different effects nothings been updated. Was fun for my play time but got stale afterwards."

,Not Recommended,323780,14104883,"Posted: 21 January, 2015",all,Picks 'n' Kicks (Terrum),"For some reason I rushed into buying this game simply because I've always wanted a fireworks simulator, and this looked really good from the screenshots and videos. But unfortunately it's just not as good as it makes it out to be. On the simple side, there are overused sounds, quite a limited set of fireworks and it's just simply overall quite a poor design for a simulator - it's more of a worktop or, do I call it a sandbox? On the technical side, it's even worse sadly, it takes up far much more GPU power than it needs to and the way it has been coded makes it hard to edit or even try open back something you've made without it causing errors, even for someone as tech-savy as me who understands the Windows Registry can't seem to even get it fixed. I had really high hopes for this game when I saw it released on Steam, but disappointed with the outcome even for a $10 game - overall I've spent less and received much better developed games."

Fireworks Simulator is brand new into the market released only two days ago and come to think about it I'm sure your'e all thinking ""well here's ANOTHER simulator game...""But let me stop you there, Fireworks Simulator is unlike anything I have ever played on Steam before and in a good way.Welcome to this crazy, psychedelic world of bright lights and explosions.I booted this up to try it and found myself 2 hours later in awe of a pretty awesome firework show I had built from scratch to music from my computer I had previously imported.If you buy this game be prepared to have your imagination captured, skills put to the test and most importantly have a lot of fun regardless of your age.I can assure you this is way more than placing pretty lights and watching them go bang.Unlike other ""flop"" simulator games I think this might just become a hit and the developers deserve every credit for it.The question is, can you top the London New Year Fireworks? You can certainly try!!"
,Not Recommended,323780,14697910,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Pyroman,"Great potential.  Effects are beautifull.  But there is a lot of settings that is missing that would have improved the game a lot.  It is hard and unfriendly to use.The possibility of starting the ""play"" anywhere would let creator testing some effects instead of restarting the video everytime we need to see how it goes.  At les in the sequencer, instead of the pic of the place you are shooting, put a simulation of your show.Having the possibility to call effects directly in the sequencer and place it after would have been a great thing to have too.The is absolutely not enough effects to play with.  These effect should have more descriptions like time of the effect (I like the prefire time showed in sequencer by the way)And shooting places is limited to 2, it is fastly becoming boring to make shows in these conditions.I cant believe WECO put their name on that.  Experienced people should have seen the lack of possibilities of that game."

But this game is so boring.  i wanted to create a display without music and sometimes with music but nope... you can only create a display with music. its cool being able to create your own firework although it has a horrible UI.
76561198173095807,Recommended,323780,14662408,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,CrazyDave,This is a great simulator. It has lots of shells to work with. The display graphics are great if you have a 2Gb video card or better. The only limitations are as follow: You can't use artists mp3 as background music then post it to certain social media due to copyright laws and You only have two locations for launching fireworks. You launch from either bardges or a golf course. If you forget and create a display with an artists music some social media will remove it and warn you about breaking copyright laws.

,Recommended,323780,13736617,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,2shoes,This can end up a black hole where all your time and those missing socks from the dryer ends up.  Once you figure out the sequencer and fiddle with making custom fireworks it can be a lot of fun making displays for your own music. I do wish the Devs would add some tools to help with symmetry. Also a way to fill a firework with one type of effect rather than pulling the same one down 95 times.

76561197990258309,Not Recommended,323780,13780177,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,-=SD=-Marcel,i love fireworks and i really enjoyed this game. If i save a custom effect it glitches once in a while but i don't have problems with that because the next time i press save it does work. What i really dislike is that it won't show the effect of the high mortarshells anymore. I tried reïnstalling 3 times but that still doesn't work. You can see the shell going off because of the glow on the landscape. I tried different resolutions and qualitysettings. (ps my PC runs ARMA3 on ultra settings so it's strong enought for a fireworksim...). Gameplay is awesome and i love tha fact that you can upload your own music. I only recommend games that are properly fixed so a no for me (when the game is stable i will recommend it).

Right as soon as I pulled up one of the demo shows, the frame-rate dropped from 60fps to 10fps. Not a good sign when you turn down all of the game graphics and still get a poor frame-rate. I didn't let that get me down until the game caused my computer to blue screen. I haven't even started making a show and with the horrible frame-rate and potential crashing of your system, I would not recommend this game. Waste of money. Also, the preview video shows a solid 60 fps, where's that in the game?"
