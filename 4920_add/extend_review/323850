This game is really only top-tier when you have people to play with. Keep in mind that whoever you play this with will hate you afterwards, but it'll be great while you're in game. The minigames are fun, the system for unlocking skins and new gamemodes is satisfying, and the pace of the game produces a perfect amount of chaos while still keeping you interested.Worth full price. Buy it for yourself and a friend."

Also, if you are about to win an online match, everyone will leave the game (without any real worry of being penalized) and you will receive no points for your wins towards new content even if you won every match against players before they left. The experience bar will just say ""you have to play against others online to gain points"". Yeah, that's great. I did, but because they quit I might as well have just played against the computer the entire time. Then, when they updated the game the most recent time (July 6, 2016), it seems to have become entirely unplayable for mac users (it won't even run)."

We all get to laugh and relax, and it's just a lot of fun.It's 4-player warioware.  It never really feels like the same game twice.  Everyone has fun, and even when you're eliminated, you're never out of the game long.If it looks like something you might enjoy, and you're on the fence about it -- if you have people to play with locally, it's extremely enjoyable.  If you're looking for an online-only experience, you might be disappointed.  I've experienced connection issues in well over half of the games I played online over gigabit fiber.However, as a local experience, there have been few games as fun as this one.  I enjoy it just as much as my 9 year old and my moderately-interested-in-games wife.  I can't give it much higher praise than that."

,Recommended,323850,23728648,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,URBANXCROW,"I didn't really play this game much until one of my friends got it too and we started to play online with other people. It's incredibly fun, my only two complaints:The server system is tiresome. There has to be one person who makes a server and is in charge of everything. They get to kick anyone out, they get to end the game, and if they leave, the whole game is over and no one gets any points. I'm in a server with two other people. I joined during the game and I was just about to win but the host wouldn't have it and left just before, which meant the whole game was over and I didn't level up or anything. Not like leveling up does anything anyway which brings me to point 2:Serious overlook in the reward system when leveling up. I am level 100-something and my friend is level 80-something. Every time we level up we get the same thing over and over again. I unlocked Ghost Scare 17 times now and Shifty Ground 20 times, along with other games modes and other characters I already had. Serious flaw they don't even bother addressing, because I emailed the developers and they didn't even respond or fix anything and this was weeks ago. (Update: They responded and stated that they are developing a fix ""very soon"") After 100-something level ups I *still* don't have Chainsaw Backstab and I haven't seen anyone who does since you can't unlock it.Of course aside from these and some minor glitches here and there, the game is actually quite fun. I would definitely recommend it despite those two incredibly annoying things, which I hope will get fixed soon, developers."
,Recommended,323850,33012535,Posted: 29 June,all,juanitogan,"Overall, I like this game... but not nearly as much as I had hoped to like it.Right off the bat, there is too much text on screen -- in too many font sizes ranging from big to tiny -- with poor use of whitespace.  That is a UI fail.  There could be half the text without making the interface any less informative or any more confusing... which it also suffers from.The game itself, however, is quite a bit better than the UI betrays, but still lacking tweaking for a wider audience.  In my opinion the game runs too fast to be very likable.  I'm primarily a social gamer and a big fan of Worms and games that run at about that speed.  Bomberman and Super Smash Bros are at my upper limit, but beyond the upper limit of some people I play with.  This game feels like it runs about 25% faster than Bomberman.  So, while I expect the majority of the latest generation of fast-twitch gamers like this speed, I suspect it is also excluding many from liking it more -- certainly me and some of my friends.Too high of speed and a lack of entry-level ramping is a common mistake I see among indie developers.  If the primary play testers are also the developers, it is easy to lose sight of what is the proper amount of ramping for new players.  I suspect the overall clock speed was never fully (or properly) play tested here in search of the sweet spot that appeals the broadest audience while not losing your core audience.  Even if you can't afford a huge test effort there are still ways to work with a small test group (one-on-one and in tiny nibbles is how I do it) to find what you are looking for.  This isn't the forum to get into that, so I'll move on.A 10% drop in overall clock would probably go a long way in feel of taming the extreme hyperaction of the game.  The devs could, for example, drop the clock a bit, call that ""normal"", then maybe also create beginner and advanced speeds.  The problem there, however, is it changes the online play settings probably too much, and might also create whiners in couch parties who don't like to play it slow.  Also, a game with too many options generally tells me that the devs don't know how to get it right on their own.  Regardless, I would at least consider such options.Furthermore, the hyperaction and other speed problems with the game aren't just related to the game loop clock.  I'm the type of gamer that enjoys taking a bit of time after each game (or major game event) to look back and analyze or relive how I got there.  Games that allow me to do that are clearly the one's I enjoy most when I analyze my favorites.  This game is so quick to pull the trigger on the end of one round and move you onto the next that I get no chance to look at why anyone (including me) won or lost.  And, that alone, pretty much makes me wanna throw the game in the bin and go do something more fulfilling... which is too bad considering the potential I see here."

You then play  your match according to the game randomly picking from your collective choices of gamemodes and you playing them in that order.Expierence PointsYou earn xp for every match you play with people online, you are however, able to play using AI bots to fill in for other players, but if you play the entire game without another person you earn no xp at all.Steam Items!Steam items are awarded with every level up of your exp bar and items you earn have different rarities. You earn characters and gamemodes by leveling up, characters are purely cosmetic and provide no in-game benefit, while gamemodes give the player the ability to choose that in thier list of gamemodes to play for any given match! Players can still play gamemodes they dont have, but they have to rely on another player having it and putting it up for individual matches.GamemodesThere is many different gamemodes (I believe a little over 15 or so)  that challenge the player with moving, each gamemode has a different objective and it is up to you to master them and beat everyone who stands in your way. The devs have said they will continue to release new gamemodes and characters as future updates continue, but really as this game is not in early access, there really should be alot more features by now.GamestateRight now the state of the game is okay, connection can get really bad, and it gives the host a slight advantage every match, which is a big deal, but the devs are working on the feature, and hopefully they will put all effort towards it and stop giving us wierd updates like this ""mutator update"" that gives more of an RNG taste to the game and veers from the skill aspect of the game a bit.Pros:- Sountrack- Graphics- Announcer Voice- Leveling System- Replayability- Steam Achievements, Trading cards, and Items- Idea Of The GameCons:- Multiplayer Connection Issues- Lack Of Gamemodes- No single-player way to earn xpGood, not the best, shows potentialAs of right now I would give this game a 6/10 ratingThe game is in need of features, a stable multiplayer feature, and some kind of way to earn exp without bieng online. Other than that, the soundtrack is great, the graphics are great, and hopefully the devs here continue to put in alot of work and work out these issues with the game. I recommend this game to people that seek a fun quick party game and look forward to more features. Other than that, you may want to save your money and wait awhile to see if the problems the game has are fixed.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games followLot's O Giveaway'sgroup curationshere!"

Its also fun for the whole family, since there really isn't anything that inapropreate in Move or Die.   I love most of the mutators, especially the Jet Packs and the Double Jump.  I could really go without the Hardcore and decoy mutators through.I only have a couple of small criticisms.  The first is that its almost impossible to level up and unlock more content unless you are online.  There is the Daily Challenge, and you can level up that way, but its really hard, since you fail as soon as you die.  I'm rarely able to get past the first randomely selected game mode without dying, especially since the mutator that they choose.  It would have taken me forever to get to where I am now if I had to relay on the daily challenge only to level up.  A story mode would be great, but it doesn't really need one.  Although you could play it by yourself, if you use bots, its really meant as a game to play with other people.On the bright side, if you really want more content and don't want to have to work for it, there are plenty of mods for this game.  However, I don't think that you can use the user created characters in online matches, only in offline couch matches, from what I understand.  I have never installed any mods for this game, and I'm not sure exactly how they work.  I also generally don't feel comfortable using mods, but if you are not like me in that regard, they're another thing that you could use to keep the game fresh."

Around here we play any local couch games we can get our hands on and I can confidently say thatMove or Dieis hands-down pure fun.With both online play and local madness, it's always easy to get a game going. Overall,Move or Dieis highly polished. There are tons of avatars you can earn as you level up, and lots of built in player interaction.

There needs to be a MASSIVE improvement with match-making.One flaw is getting a message appearing on the main screen that ""x player"" is seeking players for a match, I try to join their server, the game attempts to connect and after some time boots me back to the menu. This happens constantly.I get kicked by hosts that should have their server set to private if they only want friends.The server list itself bounces around too much making it difficult to select a specific server (and then often get kicked after managing to select it!).  Should be able to filter private matches or matches in play.The biggest gripe though is connecting to servers with MASSIVE pings! Which makes the game unplayable, resulting in having to abandon the match followed by a warning message that I will get penalised experience points! I don't want to abandon, I want to play!!The game itself is great fun, the experience in trying to get an online game is not.  This game also records win %'s.  So if you're matched to a 900 ping server, there goes your win %!!If you plan to only play this local OR if you have friends that live geographically nearby then I can highly recommend the purchase.  The party games are varied and fun and the code works well.If you are planning to buy this to play random people online then I'd steer well clear unless the developer improves match-making, displays pings or hires local servers to connect to."

I was enticed in by the Rick and Morty cameos and once I'd watched a couple of videos I decided to give it a go. Best. Decision. Ever!The game is made up of multiple game modes to play online, via local network or just a load of controllers and a sofa crammed with four people. I personally tend to use a Steam controller or an Xbox 360 controller to play the game and find the controls pretty easy to use. Lag is occasionally a problem but this is always the case with online games, and shouldn't put people off missing out on this gem.The rounds are basically mini games that you play against three other players (or AI bots) and you earn points based on how well you play. The points from each round are then added to your score, and the first to a predetermined amount (usually 50) wins. I really enjoy that when playing online, each player (not just the host) gets to choose game modes and mutators (minor changes to the game, such as jetpacks and double jump) that are played in each round. This is particularly good when your opponents have unlocked game modes that you haven't, and vice versa.I did find that there was a bit of a learning curve with some of the levels. My first few rounds were abysmal! But once I got the hang of what I needed to do, I started to win rounds and eventually win matches overall! I find the daily challenges can sometimes be frustratingly difficult, but the game is so fun it almost doesn't matter.The community itself is pretty much always friendly and fun, I've only ever once had a player throw their toys out of the pram, and this was just a case of a sore loser. It was a full on ""ur cheating ermagherd?!?11!?!!!eleventyone11!11!!"" and rage quit, but the game is wonderfully equipped to deal with people leaving mid game by applying a penalty to repeat offenders and retaining all XP earned whilst the opponent was in play. Thanks, devs!It has now become an almost nightly ritual in our house to play the daily challenge and a few online matches. There's a fierce rivalry going on and gods forbid if one of us chooses a mutator that the other hates! It has yet to ruin friendships but I can completely see why it might!DON'T GET BITTER, JUST GET BETTER!I would absolutely recommend this game, and encourage those on the fence to just go ahead and buy it!

Also, if the host is losing and cares at all about his win ratio, he can just leave unscathed, no penalty and everyone else gets booted from the game with no XP. its quiet un-enjoyable to deal with, and it hasn't been worked on NEARLY as much as it should have been.

,Recommended,323850,29472842,Posted: 24 January,all,Pixelated,"This game has blown me away by how much popularity it has gotten over the span of just a year. Trust me on this: You can go into the game at any time (even at midnight) and there will be at least ten or eleven servers waiting for you to join. Honestly, this just boggles my mind, and this is one of the few games I've seen that can sell more than a million copies in under a year.Let's adress a problem you might be thinking about: Updates. When you first see the game's thumbnail, it has whatever update is the newest next to the ""Move Or Die"" logo. You might be thinking, ""That update must've happened four months ago or something."" Actually, this game has the most responding developers I have ever seen. They update their game whenever the Winter Holiday season starts, as well as Christmas. They have always asked their players what they want to see sometime before the update, as well. Plus, if you were to ask the developer if he could fix a bug, chances are that it will be fixed sometime within the next one or two months, maybe even a shorter amount of time.The game does have a major problem, though: Internet connection. If you have poor Interenet connection, the game will almost always lag. This problem is fixed if the person you're playing with is in the same country as you, or if you're in the same room playing a couch game. This problem might even fix itself soon in the PS4 version. Yes, you heard me: It's coming to Playstation 4. (GET HYPED!!)I would most likely give this game an 8.5/10. It's pretty fun to play with your friends, but it can be pretty laggy."

,Recommended,323850,20754184,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Dastuke,"Edit: Many of my complaints were fixed, but the small player base is still a problemOh man writing a review for this game is honestly way too hard.... After watching a video of this game on youtube I was immediately interested and very quickly purchased and jumped into this game. The party aspect behind it is clever, the scoring is fair, the games fun, and the moving element unique enough to make it so you're always slightly distracted from the main goal of the current minigame as you need to keep moving and avoid jump spamming to keep yourself from exploding in a colorful splatter of paint on the board. As far as steam party games go, this is definitely a unique experience and definitely a fun game... but I still have a hard time recommending it, at least for its current price tag, as it is right now.While the game itself is a total blast, it feels unpolished in many aspects that have turned me off a bit... for starters connectivity is a huge issue in this game. I myself can join CSGO and tf2 servers with next to no lag, but this game always seems to struggle to connect with the other players in online. Many times I'll be running through a stage only to have my opponents freeze momentarily or go into its ""ice skating"" glitch. When the game starts ""ice skating"" the minigame will begin and the characters themselves won't be shown to move. Behind the scenes however all the other players are doing their own thing in a sort of limbo where you can't see them but they're more than capable of interacting with you, making certain games like trickshot, chainsaw backstab, blowback, bomb tag, and hat chase virtually impossible to win, as you're disadvantaged by the fact that you have literally no idea where the rest of the players are, resulting in you blindly wandering the stages hoping for the best and praying you're not screwed over. (video of said ice skating glitch herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoTxFBvoGQ)Next, is the current state of the online game. Frequently I've looked online for a game only to have their be no servers up currently and no one to play with. Out of desperation I would then check the server list and see 8 open games, 3 of which were private lobbies and the other were random games with 2 other players. Often times you'll end up joining an open server only to be kicked by the host immediately as they're farming wins with a friend or the users were just unsure of how to set a password. Regardless you eventually join a game and the host doesn't kick you but then you wait a few more minutes as the host sits aimlessly unreadied either waiting for a 4th user, who may never come, or just being away from their screen. As you play through the game every 5 or so rounds maybe a user disconnects either due to a poor score, or poor connection, but then when you're finally within striking distance and 1 win away, the host can end the game, sending you back to the lobby, where you can both sit, without gaining any experience (as I've had this exact scenario happen around 4 times now)... With the game being new its understandable for their to be few players... however this is a huge problem when you consider all the current flaws of the game as it is now and the fact that the ""bots"" you can play with any time not only don't give experience, but struggle to even play through certain game modes as their intended (seriously I've never seen a bot survive more than 3 seconds in vertigo).Next lets discuss a few of the minigames...Jump shot- A great concept but flawed in its execution, due to the fact that it has only one stage with health pads everywhere, users often times just spam jump as the whole ""move or die"" aspect is totally irrelevant. Users often camp the top platform and time outColor Craze- I like the concept and it definitely fits the game, but its easily my least favorite minigame. Strategies include running 3 blocks behind an opponent and wiping away all their progress or just getting the walls and ceilings and then trying to get the floor in the last minute.Rocket Run- Very fun game type, teleporters allow for you to screw over your opponents. One of the funner game types ImoChainsaw Backstab- Once again not much to say here, it fits and its executed well.Vertigo- Another really fun game type, the random spawning of platforms can often screw you and leave you in an inescapable place, and its impossible to play if you're ice skating, but I really enjoy this game type, very skill oriented.Blow Back- Fun ""fighting like"" game where you try to knockback your opponents into the death tiles. Once again few complaints aside from many of the ""safe spots"" users will try to camp where a single blowback will never put them in harms way.Ghost scare- The concept is fun and interesting but not executed as well as I'd hope, the teleporters allow for you to screw over opponents almost right at the start of the game, and the cooldown on the scream can ♥♥♥♥ you over as sometimes you get a kill and an opponent will slide in as you're scream leaves you in endlag for another easy kill. Furthermore, users often just camp at the top for an easy win in time out.Fizzle Floor- Love this game type, no complaints, moving on.Cleanup Crew- Another good one, very fair, no real advantage, just clean up as much as you can.Bomb Tag- God do I want to love this minigame, but I really have a hard time doing so. While its fun and fitting with 4 players, as soon as you get to the 1 on 1, I've found that whoever the bomb spawns on ends up getting screwed. It's just much harder to chase someone than to be chased and I find myself just missing an opponent nearly every time it spawns on me in 1 on 1.Sugar Rush- Yeah this one sucks. Sorry. You spawn in a random spot of a labrynth of confusing paths with teleporters that I still haven't figured out and candy spawners scattered throughout. The Game effectively picks a random spawner and then spawns pieces of candy, one less than there are players. The winner is often chosen by whomever is lucky enough to be closest to the spawner that's chosen... But since that apparently wasn't terrible enough, the candy moves all over the stage through walls, so many times after racing to the spawner you'll get there just in time to watch the piece you just missed phase through a wall and land exactly where you were 5 seconds ago, right into the hands of an opponent. It's like a sadistic version of musical chairs.Speed Run- This is a great game type and it rewards skill.... but I feel like it's trying to be much more complex than it actually is. There are different paths that activate traps that can slow your opponents or make them backtrack but these traps are easily avoidable, and while the game seems to have ""safer"" shortcuts, i've found these to be completely pointless as you barely have enough time to complete the course if you try any route aside from the most obvious one and it often turns into a cluster of 4 users all in the same 30 pixel area trying to finish the stage a fraction of a second faster than one another.Hat Chase- Great concept, poor execution. The hats initial spawn point is random, so in many cases whoever it spawns closest to wins just because of how hard it can be to navigate the map and how big an advantage having the hat uncontested for the first 3 seconds of the game can be. It should spawn in the very middle of all 4 characters, making it as fair as possible from the start.Falling blocks- Great game time, no complaints, gradually gets tougher and rewards those who are willing to try to snake their way down to the lowest platform.Stomp- I don't know if I've ever even played this one truthfully. I don't think it works online?And one universal complaint for all minigames... wayy to few maps... like 1 maybe 2 for each so everything gets to be very repetitive very quickly..."
,Not Recommended,323850,34053211,Posted: 5 August,all,Arzola,"If something as a neutral review was avilable, that would more likely be the option I would pick. But in the lack of it, I'm afraid at least from my experience with the game, the bad aspects outnumber the good ones.On the good side, there is indeed an interesting variety in minigames, mutators and scenarios. Often implying a different strategy in order to attempt to win the game, or at least to prevent others from gaining more points. And of course, what else good points do you need for a fun party game experience? Nothing really.Most of the bad points however come in what some may look as pet peeves, but at least my friends and I did find a little bit of a nuisance.For starters, the ""vanilla"" version of the game (mutatorless) does appear to have a big flaw, which is jumping. It may have to do with the spacing of the platforms more than anything, but we really did struggle to get used to the platforming. You fall way too fast, and don't jump that high and while visually the jumps are more than doable, attempting to do it with a controller of any kind is more tricky than it should really be. And yes, double jump mutators and whatnot might solve this problem, but that is why it was mentioned it was a problem with the ""vanilla"" version. But without mutators, game such as the Death Race, are simply too hard to beat (at least, more hard than it should be).Next is the lack of visual aid when it comes to identifying different platform ""block types"". When you play with the maximum four people at a time, most likely the screen will always display the largest view in order to keep in camera every single player. But when that is the case, it starts to get a little hard to distinguish between normal platforms, teleporters or other greyish elements.Speaking of teleporters, it does seem a little broken that nothing tells you which teleporter is connected to which. Come on, even just colored lights would have been enough. For minigames such as ""Escape From The Homing Missile"" not knowing where a teleporter might take you could mean either going to a safe spot or right into the rocket. As sometimes it isn't as simple as ""up and down"" or ""left and right"". Sure, we can learn all the patterns after trail and error, but why did we have to go with the hazzle of learning that in the first place?Also, before starting any new game session, you are told to select the type of levels that you want to play, and then you play a shuffle selection from that grab bag. But, was it really necessary to add the countdown on local play? I understand the need of it when the game is played online, but when playing locally, it just made us rush and many times not even select the maximum allowed amount, an interesting mix, a selection of those we havent played, or at least something that wasn't that monotonous before the time ran out. And that is another complaint for local play, why is there a maximum allowed of minigames to play? The fun comes out of the randomness and variety. Why limit the amount of variety you can have at a time? You don't go play Mario Party expecting to only play the different versions of Face Lift (A little extreme of an example, but you get my point).As an additional minor (and I mean MINOR) complaint, the tutorials literally are reduced to: Use the stick to move, a button to jump, and ""Move Or (you) Die"". Sure, nothing else might be needed but... why was there no mention of teleporters? I know how they work, but as they were as gray as regular platforms we didn't notice most of the games had them somewhere, they blended in as some sort of ""differently decorated platform"". Or why said tutorial never made some mention that some games require a press of a button to do something else than jumping? (And yes, the last one sounds like my friends and I are lacking in the brain department in some way. But when you are talking and laughing, miss out to read the instructions, and the first minigame that you EVER play consists of laying mines with a button... what you end up with is a bunch of dorks trying to stomp, squish into walls, push to ""cliffs"" without ever trying to press a button) TL:DR, it might not hurt to add to the small tutorial: ""Oh and listen, there are teleporters, they look like this. And some games require you to do an extra action, just use this button then.""Now, from a technical standpoint it appears that even on a 950M (Not too good, not too bad of a graphics card) with the appropiate clocking settings, RAM, paging, etc. The game seemed to lag a lot. I would normally blame it on the specific model of my laptop, but it does appear several other users have had issues with several different rigs. But that is more a case by case basis so I can't blame it on the game.We also had some trouble trying to play with controllers and having them being detected, but that also happens on more games than just this, so again, maybe not a problem with the game itself. (I hope).It is not a bad game by all means, but honestly, it was more of a ""one-off"" experience than something I would actively be playing with my friends. But if you believe none of the complaints I wrote are something you are likely to experience or consider a problem, then go for it."

Now although the quantity seems disappointing, the variety is not. Be it the mini-games or the modifiers that you’ll see as well, there’s always a twist to the games you play.The mini-games ranges from avoiding a homing rocket or a laser controlled by your opponent, finish first in a race, duel your opponents with rifles or chainsaws, splatter yourself all over the room or clean up most of the mess, steal more treasure than your opponents,… I think you get the idea, there’s lots to choose from.Or >>> The Bad:You can acquire more content through leveling up and the content ranges from more mini-games, different characters to choose from or other miscellaneous stuff. There’s a problem with this though, because of the amount of content that can be unlocked, unlocking everything can take “Hours”.To save time, you can purchase said content through the marketplace on Steam, but not everyone will want to make those purchases, especially when you can unlock everything in-game in the first place.Another problem that should be mentioned is that when you get new content from leveling up, sometimes what you get is not new at all, rather something you got already. This can be frustrating for those that seek to unlock everything in the game.Die >>> The Ugly:As mentioned in the previous section, you need to level up in order to unlock new content. The best way to do that is by playing multiplayer games and winning them will be even better. When playing a multiplayer game, should the host quit the game early, the match ends immediately.This can be frustrating to the others involved, because they don’t get any experience or any sort of compensation for the host quitting the game prematurely, nor is the designated host of the match switched to another player.While I do not recommend this game for completion purposes, I can recommend it for the overall fun factor. I had fun playing this game with my friends and whether you want to play this with your friends or complete strangers, this is a game that shouldn’t disappoint you."

The fast-paced, ever-changing gamemodes makes every match a dynamic, refreshing experience, and combined with the interesting twist of this game (having to move or else your health depletes itself), it leads rounds to often result in goofy and hilarious outcomes.

The game has easy and simple controls and gameplay is nice. Modes are awesome but it sucks that you either have to buy them or if you want to, grind xp to get characters, modes, and even mods. The customization is unique. You get to choose what game modes you want and so does the other players giving everyone an equal chance at game modes they want. You also can customize your character (already said how you get them). Mods can be either a nightmare or really fun. First, mods only happen if they're enabled. Second, only one mod can be selected at a time and after a certain amount of rounds the mod changes. The mod is selected by the players but one player gets to pick each time. Don't worry it gives each player a turn or more at the mods (not always the same options giving a variety and has 3 options). Lastly, mods can help you or provide problems. For example, Stabilzer makes first place slower than normal and last place is faster than normal being either good or bad depending on the situation. Another example would be Double Jump, which is literally what the title is. These mods usually effect all of you not just one in peticular (other than mods like Stabilizer). In conclusion, I highly recommend this game."

The objective is to survive till the end of each round, though rules differ every game. Its one of the best party games out there for sure. The characters are really cute and most game modes are fun to play. And winning any round gives its own kind of satisfaction.There are only two downsides to this game but they are easily fixable I feel:1.There aren't enough players online. You can rarely find a game to play with random players over the internet and usually cannot find a party of 4. This can be solved if you got many friends who buy this game as well, so that you get a full party to play with. Also the peer-to-peer connection might be a problem for various reasons.2.They haven't introduced too much content since the initial release. The games are pretty fun. But they tend to get repetitive. The workshop has been kind of creative but those contents aren't allowed in online game. They should be able to fix this as making character models and game modes for this game isn't as difficult as the high end games.But looking past the cons I would definitely recommend you to buy this game if you have a few friends willing to buy a copy for themselves as well. I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends and I don't regret it.Good Day."

The game can be very competitive and it can ruin friendships but at the end of the day who cares about them?As well as this, the game offers skins, which can be sold on the market for profit, and skins are being added every couple updates or so as well as the many already available, and due to the level up system dropping you a free item, it is good for people who don't want to spend money on the game as they get skins for free but also for people who may want to sell their skins or buy others on the market.I can go on for days but I would definitely recommend this game.

Move or Die simply revolves around a score based system which consist of over 15 mini games which lasts over 20 seconds. These mini games either gives you 0, 1, 2 or 5 points if you are placed 4th, 3rd, 2nd or 1st respectively.To achieve the entitlement of slapping every other player in the face and of course being able to brag about your awesomeness as announced by the default narrator, you must be placed first. To achieve first position in Move or Die, you must be the best in the mini games chosen via player one. The scoring system within Move or Die is 0, 1, 2 or 5 points if you are placed 4th, 3rd, 2nd or 1st respectively. To reach your target points, which is decided by your game time, you must reach a minimum of 5 points away from the target as to claim victory and of course the ability of slapping your opposition you must win a mini game to claim the victory.The mini-games are composed of fast paced games modes ~20 seconds each, with their own unique rules and levels, so be ready for some fast paced madness. Some of the games include Fizzle Floor, which places you on top of a platform and slowly disappears until one player is left on top of the platform. Another fun action packed level is called Colour Craze which I do believe makes friendships disappear. In Colour Craze you are placed on a map the size of your screen, and you have the ability of colouring the floor and the player with highest amount of blocks coloured will win. Note to self: following other players works well. Another fun mini game in Move or Die is called Rocket Run which consists of a rocket which gets faster as time pasts follows a player well until either the player dies and then rages or until the rocket is trigged by either another player who has move in the way of the rocket or the rocket has just randomly exploded.Move or Die features a Steam workshop community. Within the great workshop store available on Steam are creations by the players of Move or Die, All Items presented on the steam workshop is 100% free and full of bugs. The workshop has many modifications that could be made to your copy of Move or Die which include; New and unique characters like Ms. Popsicle or Mr. TopHat, Different levels and modes created by you and others and finally mods to the music available within the game. This section of the game is great for making your copy of Move or Die 100% UniqueAn another great feature within this game is option to have mutations which affects the games in multiple ways. An mutation which is guarantee to destroy friendships is Ghosts. Ghosts is a mutation in which makes all players turn invisible and can only be seen via their small trails and the time when standing still. This is great for when your friend is about to claim the victory. Another friendship destroying mutation is called Death Touch, Death Touch enables the dead players to interact with the live players which could cause the death of a player. Death touch lowers the life of the player in contact with the dead player. This results in a lot of censorship with all players about to win.Finally, a great detail about Move or Die is the fact of the levelling up system which is based on wins against either other online players or the daily challenge, which is simply plain hard. When upon on achieving your next level you will either be given a brand new character or a new game mode which can be played online if you are the host. However, this does have the down side of a very small community which proves buying the characters for a low price of $0.04 USD is simply easier.My final verdict of Move or Die is “Move or Die is a great little gem which has a small but mighty following leaving you with unique modifications and these underdogs developers do have the power to take on AAA games like Grand Theft Auto V and Those Humorous Lego Games by TT if this was launched on consoles. Move or Die is great way to lose your long-time friends. 8/10”"

I have been following this game for a while lately, but have finally decided to buy the full game, as I couldn't wait for it to come out of early access. The game is made by Those Awesome Guys (or TAG).It is a 2D arcade-style game, built on the principal that if you don't move, you die. The game is very fast paced, and very fun to play. There are game modes, the newest being Sugar Rush; a race to get the candy first, ranging to Stomp, having to stamp on others.ModdingYou are encourage to modify the game, after all, it's initials are MoD! I made some changes to the speed of characters to make the AI bots really bad, as they are not programmed that way and otherwise are really hard to beat. I also changed some of the textures of the characters, making them look  different.Move or Die uses Bit Bucket to host it's game (although the repository is private) so bug reporting is an easy process. I have reported a couple of bugs already, as it is in early access. Me and my friends have had a great time battling to be the best at Move or Die, and I hope you will too! I highly recommend this game to all ages.Review from the Geek Circle Blog:http://thegeekcircle.blogspot.co.uk/"

Why?The Good:Move or Die has given me moments I have yet to feel in other games! The competitiveness is exciting and extremely fun. Seeing what types of characters people use and unlocking new characters made me want to keep playing! Online games were very smooth and it looked very nice to the eyes. This was done all done perfectly. There have a couple moments where I would get errors online, and I'd have to restart the game, but other than that it was great. The first 2 or so hours of the game were perfect.The Bad:After about 2 hours, the game went downhill fast. The game is now basically unplayable, with very slow menus, but it was working perfectly fine in the beginning. The starting screeen now takes a long time to load and there's nothing to fix the lag in the menus, I even decreased all of settings to check for improvement. Nothing. I replayed the tutorial and it is now imossible for me to play, everything moves too slow. Online games are even worse, freezing and screen glitches made it very unplayable. There was no way of refunding because I played over the limit. I have decided to keep the game and continue supporting the developers with the nice trading cards.Disclosure:I'm not too upset because I actually purchased this game during the free99 update/sale, so I got it half off. With the spoopy update, the game didn't improve in terms of playablility. I'm curious if others have had this issue, because I've seen screenshots of people getting a similar error over in the community hub.UPDATE - Apparently, other players are experiecing similar issues, with 1 fps in the menus and even on start-up. Maybe less than half of the players are affected, but this still needs to be shown to the developers as soon as possible."

I played other couch-coop games with the examt same controllers and it worked so its definitly a game bug.On a Windows Laptop (slow) the controller worked but it was unplayable becaue it already buged in the menue.On my PC it worked but as soon as there were more stuff on the screen it became incredibly slow. My PC is old, but all the other arcade-couch-coop games work just fine on it.I see that there was a lot of work put in it, but this games code seriously needs to be fixed.

Both fast-paced and appealing to the eyes, how much better could it possibly get?  This game requires minimal storage and hardware to run at top-notch quality which makes it even more awesome.  The game modes that are both unlockable and buyable on the Community Market (for very cheap prices) are all entertaining and keep players on edge.  A wide variety of character skins makes the games interesting and silly.  What is great about this is that if someone is impatient to unlock a skin, it is easily purchasble for a few cents on the Community Market as well.  This game can be played for hours on end without a hint of dullness in the area.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately, with good things there are also bad things.  This game has too few players, sometimes I feel like my only competition is with the bots.  Another thing is that there seems to be a problem connecting to other player's lobbies both in Server Selection and in Quick Join mode.  It is not frequent, but it can be agitating when you want to just play the game!  Overall, this game is definitely a buy for everyone that would enjoy a great experience!"

It's got a lot of good aspects to it and I was really excited to bring this out on one of our couch game nights but ultimately we didn't spend longer than 30 minutes on it. There's a few reasons for this but it boils down to Move or Die not leaving a great first impression.The match picker is... not great. Please don't randomly choose from the list, or rather have an option to work through mini games sequentially, if you end up like we did with Rocket Run, Color Craze, Hat Chase and Cleanup Crew all in the same playlist you're playing back-to-back games of minimal skill, maximal luck mini games. This really drains enthuasism in a group of 4 players when ""Move around a lot and hope for the best, maybe employ some tiny amount of strategy"" is all you can really think about. It's really not fun, and once the bad impression is there it's hard to get out of it.Some games have good concepts but fall alittle flat on execution, Speed Run (where the first instinct is for all players to run right together, ending up in a cluster, one dies which causes their corpse or something to interact strangely collision wise and the other 3 players slow down, now their character isn't running as fast as it should and you die due to a change you had no control over.) Vertigo is incredibly unforgiving. Jump Shot you almost have no control over where your bullets go as your character rotates incredibly fast.I think Move or Die has a lot of potential, the love is clearly there and some of the concepts are spot on (Falling Blocks, Stomp, Fizzle Floor, Ghost Scare [nice.]) but when you have a party game you need to come out of the gates swinging, otherwise when one player out of a group of 4 starts to feel encumbered, the rest shortly will follow and the game is put away not long after.To recap some of my thoughts:* Match picker needs options - ""Randomise"", ""Sequential"", ""Losing player (total point score) choses next game"", ""Player 1 chooses."" etc.* One-button gameplay is enticing but might also be limiting some great interactions, Ghost Scare could have a 2-second ""hide my footsteps"" button that could really bring out the mind games, Rocket Run might let you additional produce a shield to bounce the rocket off you.* Speed Run might need a look over, Vertigo might move alittle slower to begin with and ramp up, Jump Shot could have you rotate slower but add a 'dodge' button to compensate, etc.That's just my opinion though, as an avid Mario Party and couch-party game fan Move or Die is just a little short of the mark for me. I'll definitely revisit it later on but for now it is what it is."

,Not Recommended,323850,20806395,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,Jables,"I have to say I was quite excited for this game to come out, being a fan of local couch competition as well as online play with friends.  This game has it all on paper, complete with grinding incentives and lots of potential for long replay value, customization and friend competition.  The trailer had me, hook, line and sinker, and it seems like everyone is giving this game rave reviews.  Honestly the game is great on paper, the graphics are great, the controls are simple and this game is easy to pick up.Here's the problem, This type of game hinges on 2 concepts:-Multiplayer competition with friends whether local or online-Tight engaging fast gameplay with varietyUnfortunately the multiplayer is completely broken at the moment, you basically have to create or find a room and just sit there and wait.  The game isn't well populated so you'll end up in a room with a high lvl individual who will probably start the match with just you and some bots as he's probably been waiting for 20 minutes.Once you finally get to play you get treated to extreme lag (unless you're host apparently) I'm on a solid wired connection and play games such as Brawlhalla with zero lag whatsoever.  It really pains me to say this but even if you can get past these gamebreaking issues, the gameplay itself is actually quite bland and unimaginative and very repetitive at the moment.  The devs are saying free DLC and sure there's the workshop I suppose, but a full game at release needs a variety of engaging minigames.  It's like buying Mario Party at full price and finding out that you only have 5 minigames for now but you're free to wait for the community to make some new ones...  The game claims variety but the minigames are all so similar in look and feel that you may as well be playing the same 20 second mini-game over and over again.The graphics are nice IMO but the game suffered from performance issues and constant frame drops for me and my system is well past the purported system requirements. I have much more than 1 gig of ram and 512 mb of video memory.... These aren't even specific requirements and seem to be quite watered down for a game that clearly needs optimization and polish.  Either way I can't get this game to run at 60fps consistently and this game is all about split second controls.  I'd understand if the system requirements were honest but they're simply not or else I'd be getting a smooth experience with the video settings at near minimum.In all honesty I bought the game, I messed with the gfx settings, played the tutorial, popped right into multiplayer (well after trying to find a server and all that), the experience was as listed above, I gave it a few tries, realized I was bored stiff and playing an alpha basically and requested a refund.I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone as it's not complete.  I was testing the game for me and 4 friends because I was leery about this title.  The plan was to get a four pack basically and play together but the game simply isn't engaging enough to be local, and the online is broken.  Also I read in another review that apparently you do not progress or unlock anything in local, you must be online, but online is, once again, broken (didn't bother trying the local because we'd mostly be playing online anyways)Solid reccomendations:For Online And Local: Brawlhalla (This one is free, online and local, with no lag, and they're still in beta)Local only but omg buy a case of beer and invite 3 buddies over: Samurai Gunn (THIS IS THE LOCAL COUCH FRIENDSHIP RUINING GAME TRUST)TL/DR:  This game is great on paper, promises to deliver so much but is broken in it's present state.  It's in alpha.. early beta at best.  I really hate to bash on an indie title but at 15$, and claiming to be a fully released game? Nope.  If it's testing that's required early access was the route with an honest memo.  Especially if the multiplayer is the focus and local is an afterthought (ie you can't unlock anything unless you play online) then your multiplayer is expected to be smooth as butter and you're expected to have servers.  This game may be fun one day, but not today.Parting words: I could MAYBE recommend this game for young children for local play.  At 15$ you'll have a cute colorful game that might get a few laughs.  If you have a family and game with your kids this might be worth considering, try it with steam refund policy with your kids and see if they like it.  If you're an adult looking for a party game to pwn your friends at Smash Bros style you'll most likely be let down and much better served with the two titles I suggested (one of which is free to play but not pay to win).  Note that this game was marketed as a party competition game for adults so I reviewed it as such and that this is just my opinion.  Honestly with steam's refund policy you can always just try it :)"

It's a game with a variety of simple premises, and it's very easy to just pick up and play any of the gamemodes regardless of experience level. It's a great party game if only becuase it's so accessable.For content the game has a lot to offer. There are a total of 14 gamemodes and a slew of characters to unlock. The game comes with a variety of maps for each of the gamemodes. This content doesn't even begin to touch mods which are currently getting a lot of workshop support. All of these unlockables come from the level system which just rewards you for participating in daily challenges, different goals and just regular online play.This game is great, and apart from some latency issues it runs smoothly.

Game consistently refuses to properly shut down despite re-installing the game twice. Needing to win a round before being able to win, despite receiving points fo second and third place at any other moment is inane- probably a reason why basically no other game practices that.  Movement and jumping feels innacurate, leading to a lot of colliding with the very end of a corner. Handles latency worst than literally every other game in my collection.I understand why people would enjoy this- but I absolutely did not.

It is probably the most rage inducing game  I have played at this point.Almost no one still plays the game, so don't be fooled by the adds. Basically it is really hard to find a server.  It is even harder to win on said server, and it is really hard not to get kicked the one time (or every time) you do win.Don't really know what was wrong with this game.  I had to install the game several times before it would work.The game did leave me very mad at times, so just a rage warning for those high strung people.7/10  Don't pay full price"

It's amazingThe game is really fast and look away from the screen for one second.. You are dead.So let's begin about the main idea of the game: Move Or Die.If you don't move, your health goes down, jumping doesn't count. Stand too long or jump too much, you die. Really simple, but what makes it hilarious is, when you don't have space to move! That's when it gets fun.Let's move to gamemodes, the thing that makes moving or dying harder.There are some amazing gamemods to this game and I gotta say, they are hilarious (And crazy!). One of my many favourites is Hat Chase, where players run after a flying hat. Who keeps the hat longest on their head, wins. More gamemodes are unlocked the more you play, so keep chasing those hats!Mutators!Game chanching things that really annoy people! Once in a while the game let's one player choose a mutator! The mutator can for an example, constantly change players skins, make the lights go out, make the game ""Move And Die"" and many others. Mutators are also one great reason to hate your friends!Overall, the game is great and crazy, you will never sleep again after this"

It has a lot of content to offer, and takes a little bit of skill to play.Move or Die is a game where you play with people online, or with friends, and you all compete in a bunch of different little mini-games, and whoever has the most points at the end, wins the match. It is a very simple concept, and very fun. There was the Mutator update a little while ago, that adds, well, Mutators. Mutators are little bonus that can help you or make you do worse, such as the mutator Move AND Die, which can be difficult, and the mutator Jetpacks, which can help. All of these things make the game very unique, and why I will always play it.Overall, it is a great game. It is Local-Multiplayer, and kid friendly, so the whole family can play. I highly recommend that you get this game. It won't be a waste of money."

You play minigames with the main restriction of having to constantly move. Standing still will cause your lifebar to drain quickly, which will kill you in a few seconds. You start with a few game modes to play, and most of them are pretty fun.However, this is where the game takes a massive dive. You have to unlock the other game modes throughrandom chance. Not only this, but different game modes have been arbitrarily assigned different rarities. This means you could play this game for dozens of hours and never have access to a given gamemode unless you buy it on the market or gamble with strangers hoping they've found it. Seriously, this is part of the game. You can go onto the market as of this review and buya gamemode for the base game for $6.20.That's about 40% of the game's price. That's disgusting."

So, why a game so fun, about playing with your friends that have great characters, have this limitation?2) The online connection is..well not so good. So again, cant progress playing with friends, cant progress playing with online people and the only way is with online solo challenges. So what’s the point?3) Moar minigames and characters!

It’s designed in a way where it’s easy to learn and anybody can pick it up and play it. It has a great number of different minigames and optional mutators that keep the game enjoyable to play. It also has different announcers that you can choose from. And the comedy of the game is nice too. If you like to play multiplayer games that are enjoyable, fun, tense, and funny, then I highly recommend Move Or Die!"

We usually rotate between games based on the group and the current feel things, but sometimes a game is needed to change the attitude of the players.  This is that game.  Usually when my group of coworkers pick up controllers to start this, theres a bit of hesitancy.  Then, the first two or three rounds are an adjustment period, mostly consisting of 'what just happened?' moments strung along over a three or four minute period.  It isnt long after that, however, that things really start picking up.  Usually, by the end of the first full game, theres a lot of laughing and playful shoving as people really start picking up on how to score points in the different round types, and then the real fun begins.  Suddenly lunch is over, and a bunch of quiet coworkers are jumping up and down in the breakroom yelling at each other and the screen, and everyone else on the floor is looking at us rather oddly.All in all, a great use of a few spare minutes and a few friends.

I'd really enjoy playing the game more if it wasnt for some flaws that made me refund the game (for now).First of all it is the Rage Quitters. I understand why some people do that, but out of 7 Online games I played with people 4 times it ended because someone quitted. (All those 4 times shortly before I would've won)So those game neither gave EXP nor any reward.Secondly it is the matchmaking. I didn't play a lot, and when being Lvl 2-3 I got matched against Lvl 30+ that had a lot of experience in the game and (checked their Steam profiles) some had over 40 hours. How am I meant to defeat others in those random modes if they all played the modes hundred times oftener than me? I won randomly, but would've wished for me being matched against equally bad/undexperienced players.And I know I could've played against AI, yet I don't get any EXP/Rewards for AI games, so there are no sense in playing that.I'd rather suck Online and improve there than winning against AI bots and getting NOTHING from that.The game itself is great, and if you have friends to play with it is even better. For me it wasnt what I imagined.ALSO HOW DO I NOT A SINGLE TIME GET TO CHOOSE A MODIFIER IN 25 TIMES A MODIFIER WAS CHOSEN"

After 1 day of going crazy for the spent 15 euros, I decided to sit on my♥♥♥♥♥and to search all day long for fixing the lag...and it was sucessful. Before the lags, I was willing to say that this is the worst game in the world because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, but after I fixed the lags, this became one of my fav. videogames. It's very funny game to play and can be very addictive. And if you hate some of the minigames ( there are around 25-30 or so), another very funny thing is to watch how your friends are ragging so much (btw. I've lost 2 friends of mine just of this game :D). In conclusion, this game is funny, DEFINITELY worth it ( even if it lags there is always way to fix it ), but keep in mind that in every single moment you play this game there's chance that you lose your friends you play with. ALSO, IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIEND TO PLAY WITH, THE GAME WILL BE LITTLE BORING ( in most cases)!"

Connection still isn't the greatest, but it increased the quality of gameplay enough for me to change my review from negative to positive.Out of the 15 or so online matches I've gotten placed in, there has been a poor connection in 13 of them. I really like the gameplay, but if there is a poor connection the minigames are completely ruined.I haven't played private matches with friends so I can't speak for the connection quality there. However, the overall matchmaking connection is very poor and will hopefully be improved in the future.I'll change my review if future updates improve network connection quality in online matchmaking."

The game pits players against each other in a variety of 2-platforming challenges ranging from blowing up each other Bomberman-style to racing through booby-trapped maps to reach the goal in a short time. The game is a blast to play at parties locally and online play is a nice alternative to those who may not have easy acess to players nearby. Speaking of online, overall it runs quite well and easy to find others to play with. Included is a very user-friendly method to make custom content and full Steam Workshop support which give even more ways to keep the game fresh. Overall, this is a great pick-up-and-play game to experience with friends for a very reasonable cost."

And even then there are some game modes and mutators that mess up the lobby real bad. The network issues are basically common place and definitely needs to be addressed. Online play with random people across the world is such a bad experience as the host usually just cleans house.The TURBO mutator often de-syncs most of the lobby having one guy stuck at the mutator select screen, others stuck at waiting for players screen, and finally another guy randomly playing a ghost map in which when he gets synced to the host he dies.Heavy bullets is another example as the host can regularly be seen having an advantage on other player's screens. The host can seemingly ""catch"" bullets (on the host's screen he just dodges them"" and dodge stuff that seems like it should have killed them.Sometimes characters will just phase through the floor (Fizzle Floor) and die.Minor complaints:You cannot select which color the bot is (I realize that it depends on where you place them) but I think it would be simplier to just have an option to switch the team colours.Another complaint is to address one of the maps in Colour craze as whoever wins basically depends on the last few seconds due to the large area in the top and bottom portions.This game would be awesome if these networking issues are addressed."

,Recommended,323850,30657076,Posted: 21 March,all,boiling water,"Move or Die is a game where 2-4 players play a series of minigames. Every round (about every 10-20 seconds), the minigame changes. Every several rounds, if enabled, a random player can choose a mutator, which is to change the gameplay (such as: turbo mode, jetpacks, underwater, etc.). The interesting part is a game mechanic that forces you to move, or you will die, as the name implies.Pros:Nice graphicsFun gameplayFriendship-ruining gameplayYou can actually just unbox rare items and sell them to get steam wallet funds ;]Cons:Servers are a bit wonky, it will often tell me I have poor connection even though it's just fine.Rarely anyone playing (with a good server), so you need to convince your friends to play with you.This game is pretty fun if you can get a couple of friends to play."
