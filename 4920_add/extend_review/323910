,Recommended,323910,29958283,Posted: 16 February,all,Source of the Mist,"I'm really grateful for this piece of software -- my computer is pushing the 3 year mark in terms of age, and this very VR test helped steer me towards my next possible upgrade!Quick story, so my computer was about 3 years old, rocking an old Zotac GTX 670 4GB video card. When I initially did the test about 5-6 months ago, it said nope! Not ready.The software didn't just stop there, it actually recommended something huge: basically the software not only confirmed my VR incapabilities, but it also helped me upgrade my computer!Instead of waiting to build a brand new rig, it recommended I pick up a new graphics card that could support VR. Wow am I happy with the test software!Edit:So basically I went from a no-go, deal breaker on VR to an ""You're ready for VR!""\m/ Valve, you rock! \m/"

So decided to test my HTC Vive since i will be doing VR content as well. Here are the results.OS: Windows 10GPU: GeForce GTX 1070CPU: I7-7700KAverage Quality 11 (Very High)Frames tested 12646
,Recommended,323910,30132653,Posted: 23 February,all,mkuhnlein,"I downloaded the software and it said my computer was not VR ready. I have a gaming laptop with an intel I7, 16 gigs of RAM, and a GTX 960m (the laptop version of a GTX 960). I got an HTC Vive and tried it on my laptop, and while some of the more graphically demanding games don't work, most of them do. I have done google earth vr, universe sandbox, zombie training simulator, irrational exuberance, and others. Although the framerate is sometimes not the best, I haven't really had much of a problem with motion sickness, and it has not subtracted from the experience significantly. So while it is not the best for VR, it still works. I hope this helps anyone thinking about getting a vive.If I could vote in the middle of ""yes"" and ""no"" on this, I would, because it said that it was using my intel graphics card and not my NVIDIA to do the test. But according to other posts, it actually IS using my NVIDIA but just not telling me it is?? That is one problem I would say the developers must work out."

Plus, my mom said no more toys until I clean my room. I reminded her that I'm 44 and don't live at home anymore. She grounded me. When I finally get my VR system, I'm going to be the coolest guy in town. Girls will be beating down my front door. That'll show my mom that I was right all along.Now I'm going to clean my room to be able to take advantage of room-scale VR, NOT because my mom said so. I mean it. I'm my own man now, and I don't care what my mom says.*Mama, if you read this, I was hacked by the Russians. They're everywhere, Mama. Will you make me some grits and eggs? Thanks. I love you!"

,Recommended,323910,29646171,Posted: 2 February,all,The Holy Golden Spork,"Now, When you talk about 'Innovation', this game comes to mind instantly. The gaming market nowadays is getting tougher and tougher, with Triple A titles such as 'Life of Black Tiger' coming into play, it's surprising to see this game surpass it. Voice acting was solid, as was the graphics and gameplay. Truely a game to speak of for years to come. Only problem is that the game isn't very optimized as I was experiencing frame drops running a GTX 1050. Other than that absolutely flawless game. Story is a bit short, though, but I eagerly await the story expansion pack they'll be releasing soon.10/10"
