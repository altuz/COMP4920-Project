,Recommended,324070,13438891,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,BlaXpirit,"Imagine a game where the character is just a ball the whole time. A ball that isn't even bouncy and can't jump. Consider how difficult it is to implement any platforming that isn't simply clunky and awkward with such a limitation.Now let's think about 99% of platformers. How very annoying and limited would they be if they didn't allow changing directions in midair? It is completely unrealistic, yet omnipresent.I thought about these concepts a lot, and didn't believe it was possible to make a decent game with the mentioned limitations. And yet, here we haveiO, and calling it decent would be a huge understatement.So yes, the character is a ball that can roll clockwise and CCW. You don't simply ""move right""; the movement happens because of friction. The ball can also shrink and grow (changing its mass) anytime. Arbitrarily changing mass and angular momentum are the only unrealistic things here; the rest is just physics.And oh how fun pure physics can be...As mentioned, rotating allows you to move using friction. The friction also applies to walls and ceilings, allowing you to do not-so-obvious things. Changing mass in mid-air while keeping the momentum lets you change the trajectory (launch yourself). The process of growing in size improves your grip, letting you speed up easier, or... climb some walls! Now, don't forget that you can only grow/shrink so much...And of course, we also get the more typical features of a physics-based game: There are moving platforms. You can push and interact with things in other ways using friction. Portals: speedy things comes in, speedy thing comes out... but what if the thing can change mass?The game is almost flawless (if you overlook occasional clipping through objects in rare cases, which doesn't affect the gameplay).Graphics are very aesthetically pleasing. Won't talk about music, because Irolledwith my own.★★★★★★★★★☆"

Gameplay is fun and is broken into levels which gradually get tougher. The background music is very well done. Really easy game to learn but hard to master. Works well on keyboard+mouse or controller. Overall a very fun little abstract game to add to your collection.

In the game, you play with a ball that just roll and roll...it's only ""skill"" is turning it own size. The first few levels are easy, but harder and harder...trust me, this game is really hard to play...it challenges your IQ...There's one thing good about this game, if you are stuck on a level, you can chooce to skip it and try other levels first instead. So you won't get bored and annoyed:)Personal Score: 8/10"

It is an absolutely AMAZING (and addictive) Physics based game that will test your reflexes and ability to solve puzzles! What you see is what you get, and it is as fun as it is challenging. It has many different gameplay mechanics, intential gameplay bugs to exploit, and you can even finish seemingly linear puzzles in many different ways. It will keep you trying to get those gold medals: .02 seconds of? Try again! The gameplay is intuitive to learn, and most of the mechanics are very intuitive (Though some will require some practice to get used to), and you will also spend time trying to beat puzzles through trial and error. Eventually you can form a knack for virtually any puzzle and use your experiences to beat other puzzles. Many of the longer puzzles will incorporate several different mechanics all at the same time to give you an exceptionally difficult time, though once you complete them (With a gold medal especially) it is very rewarding.This is a must buy for any puzzle, physics or skill lover."

76561198079691633,Recommended,324070,20577679,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,riSmArk,"A very nice and well-made puzzle game which is both challenging and fun. You control a wheel and uses its ability to shrink and grow to climb walls, drive through loops and do many other cool tricks to guide your way through the level. You have 225 levels to go through and the difficulty increases for each stage. It's one of those games where you just replay the same level 100 times to get the best time as possible. And with the leaderboards to compare your times with other players, it makes you want to improve your time even more. For the price its at now, you'll get a fun and addicitive game that you will enjoy a lot."
76561198026891192,Recommended,324070,17009852,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,HalberdRejoyceth,This is one of those games where completing a level feels very satisfying and motivating to keep going. It requires you to develope a good amount of skill with the basic concepts provided as you succeed in more and more of the challenges. Figuring out the puzzle of the basic layout of the level isn't the hard part here. It is more about understanding the consequences of shrinking and growing (and thus changing mass) at an instant applied to a rolling object while the rest of everyday physics is kept the same. By doing so you get a feeling of how momentum is connected to mass and how it acts on the velocity of an object. The level design incorporates these new mechanices in some surprising ways. And you can test if you truly master the mechanics by aiming for the optional medal rewards that are given for beating a stage within a time limit.Ultimately I can recommend this game to all who seek a good challenge and don't get frustrated all too easily. Even for the latter kind there is an option to skip levels and return to them at later time. The only negative thing about this game is perhaps that it sometimes doesn't keep up the level of challenge and throws in a couple of trivial puzzles every now and then at the later stages.

It follows the law of conservation of momentum (linear and angular) but it ignores conservation of mass... This is such a brilliant way to make a college level Physics 1 student get confused to failure, but at least it was super fun in the way...By the way, I purchased this game on my iPad 2 and iphone 4 and it works terribly! so play on a real computer or lastest models of iPhone/iPad only."
,Recommended,324070,15142943,"Posted: 31 March, 2015",all,elsjaako,"Nice puzzle game, good entertainment for the price. The puzzles where well thought out.It's based around a simple premise: you are a ball that can spin around it's own axis, and you can change your size (and with it your weight). For example, this allows you to go from heavy to light (so you can launch yourself) or from small to big (to hold on to the walls).They take this one mechanism and really explore what you can do with it. It reminded me of Portal, where you basically have one mechanism, and the game is playing with that mechanism in many ways. This game does that with a size-changing ball.I feel the difficulty was good. Most levels I got before they got frustrating, but it was never easy to get a gold medal.The graphics look good, and the game ran fast.The only problems I had were with the controls. For one thing I never managed to get my XBOX (original) controller to play nice on linux (I haven't tried on windows).The other problem I had only happened in 3 levels with complex manouvering while using a USB keyboard. It seemed like the controlls stopped working part way through. I got a PS2 keyboard and this stopped. I think it might be due to n-key rollover. This means those three levels could be frustrating if you are playing with a USB keyboard.Besides those three levels, I had no problem using the USB keyboard.iO took a fun idea and used it well, I look forward to the developers next game."

From an unseen, orthogonal mechanical linkage providing 2 degrees of freedom, an axial mount point delivers tubes for pneumatic injection of liquid gallium into one of two systems; the segmented, reinflatable, toroid vesicle which provides internal pressure to adjust the radius of the structure with the side effect of adding mass, or to the torque converter for tangential acceleration of the entire mechanism in unison.  Coupling these controlled mechanical forces with an exceptionally high friction coefficient around the circumference of the mechanism permits an operator to explore seldom studied facets of Lagrangian physics with a focus on momentum and Coriolis effect."

I never thought a puzzle/platformer/racer with no jump button would be at all enjoyable, but I was wrong. The physics are clever and slightly exploitable, the level design is clean and simple, the controls are functional, and the soundtrack is soothing, to say the least. Anyone interested in any kind of platform or puzzle game should definitely pick this up.Now, if there was Steam Workshop support with custom levels, that woud just make it even better. Let's hope that's in the pipeline somewhere!"

,Not Recommended,324070,29614493,Posted: 31 January,all,6ap6apblckaAa,"Unfortunately the game is not good. The main reason is it's mechanic, but not in the sence of itself, rather than in the impact it has on the controls. The ball is spinning. And therefore it has angular momentum which is extremely hard to control and especially frustrating to predict it's influence after making a move, For example, you spin up, jump and when you land the momentum screws your controls heavily.Otherwise the game is nice and interesting."

Sadly, they're not. The game isn't too bad, but with all the great games out there, it's not good enough to keep me playing. Also,heads up to anyone with a 144hz monitor:You will have to set your screen to 120hz or lower, in order for the game not to stutter like crazy! The devs knew about this while the game was in development, but didn't fix it, partly because they meant it affected a small amount of players."
