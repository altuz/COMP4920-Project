,Recommended,324110,12930790,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,Schiz0id,"Hey fellow steam users!I bought this on 11/13/2014 and I have tested both Moto Racer 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all playable. Here's my review for each one:1. Moto racer, the bonafide classic. not many tracks, but the game is wonderful, old-school, and arcadey. A definate must-have! 4:3 only, use the ""black bars"" mode.2. Just like its predecessor, this game is wonderful and fast and arcadey. Much more tracks this time around, but the game is a tad more realistic and not quite as arcadey as MR1. If you add custom widescreen resolutions lower than 1024x768, usually they appear in-game.3. Moto Racer 3 is a departure from the second one as there is a heavier focus on ""arcade realism"". The COD of the Moto Racer series, but this game is very enjoyable still and as always, has a wonderful sense of speed. 4:3 only.4. The classic from ios, this game was created with auto-acceleration in mind. Play this with a controller and don't be as heavy on the throttle! The shoulder buttons are best for acceleration as button A is hard-coded to be Boost. 4x3 only, just like the older versions. This game is fairly faithful to its predecessors and is a good time waster, but not quite as good as the originals.Overall, i'd say if you are a fan of the series, by all means get this title. It's cheaper than buying each one on GOG, and it's great fun for all ages!The game had extreme bugs on release, but on my windows 8.1, amd fx 8350, and nvidia gtx 660, these games run fine and have few problems."

There might be a way around it, like setting my display to 16-bit manually, but I can't be arsed right now. I might put effort into finding a workaround later though, because I recall this one being my favourite.Moto Racer 2does launch, but there'sno sound during races, no music or SFX. Plays well, but feels weird because of that.Moto Racer 3works(huzzah!). Don't think I played this one back in the day (or not much); it seems less arcadey and fun than the previous two instalments, but that's just my impression after a single race.Moto Racer 15th anniversaryis the most recent entry (you can tell it's modern because you accelerate with the right trigger, not the A button!) and it'sutter garbage. Not only does it manage to be uglier than the other, way older entries, but more shamefully it plays poorly. Not the game I cared about anyway, but dang, morbid curiosity is the only reason to bother trying it at all -- and even then I couldn't finish a single lap in a cross race. The way it handles just feels entirely wrong, like someone's first Unity game on XBLIG.So all in all, if I find a way to make sound work in 2 and for 1 to launch at all, maybe I'll spend some time with this, reminiscing. But I cannot recommend it in good faith.(Oh, and I spent more than 5 minutes with this -- but Steam only counts time spent in the launcher apparently)"

I do agree with other reviews saying that they could have tried to make it more compatible. There are unplayable areas (mostly when you're playing a dirt race with many competitors on screen) and MASSIVE slowdowns... Could be better.Now the biggest reason for the Negative review: they f*** up Moto Racer 2! Why was the great, perfect soundtrack changed? WHY? I do believe I left Moto Racer's 2 CD more time in my Stereo then in the PC, just for how great the soundtrack is. Then I load the game with high expectations for a battery solo to start the video and I get a totally souless music in a new intro video, and then the menu screen hits and where is the beautiful Punk Rock music? This should be advertised as it is on GOG. I would not have spent not even the less then a dollar I did. Total lack of respect with the game fans."

So getting to play the first one again was a blast (Even if I had to lower the quality of the polygons because I was getting lag) until I made it to the fourth championship where the game told me that I was running an ""illegal copy of the game"" and I couldn't accelerate. So the steam verion I purchased is running an illegal copy of the game. Not to mention that there are so many issues and bugs with the first and second MotoRacer."

Notes on the fix will also be at the end). I only bought this game for nostalgia, and boy did it deliver! The graphics are not too hot, but that is because these games are old (Moto Racer 1 came out in 1997). I don't recommend this game to people looking for simulators, but if you like easy-to-load, fast-paced arcade bike racing games, then these are for you!THIS IS JUST FOR MOTO RACER ONEhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/324110/discussions/0/613938575207390002/?insideModal=1There's the link to the fix. It's a super easy fix to do, but it was found in a version not on Steam version (Duh!), so the only problem that I found was in the middle of a championship race when it said ""Illegal Version"" and I couldn't accelerate. The single races and time trials have all worked. I don't think I will be able to unlock maps since I can't advance in the championship, but there is an ""unlock all tracks"" cheat online, so I did that."

I played Moto Racer and Moto Racer 2 everyday on my PSone  in my childhood !I don't recommend it, because the soundtrack is not working and the video sequences, too !BTW, It works well on Windows 7 !If they gonna fix this issue I'll change my review, but so ..... and the 15th Anniversary Edition is just some cheap trash, skip it !"

I must admit it took a bit of work to get all the games to work on my computer.I had to run compatibility mode for moto racer 1 and 2. Moto Racer 1 only works from the shortcut i made from the directory that it is in.

,Not Recommended,324110,14714597,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Adolf Hitler,"Moto Racer (1) crashes as soon as it starts on my x86 laptop.Moto Racer 2 apparently lets you play up to 4 players at a time, either via the same PC, or through LAN. When playing with the AI, you need to be very mindful about what difficulty you're playing on, and if you're playing on Arcade or Simulation mode. It's fun to race around at the different tracks in the game, and it even lets you make your own tracks, though if you make the corners too tight, it won't let you race in it.Moto Racer 3 and Moto Racer 15th Anniversary Edition is boring and bland.Don't buy this compilation, not even on a sale, like I did"

I re-raced the track like 10 times, eventually well enough to compete with what should be Hard mode, and I still couldn't place higher than 5th in the race. The others were gone from the start, never to be seen again, as if their bikes are faster than the player's and they make no mistakes whatsoever.MR 3 - XBox 360 controller doesn't work. At all. The launcher detects the buttons when I re-map them, but in the game the controller does nothing.It shows that they threw this thing together quickly."

Plug in a old computer or if you can manage to get a special copy of Roadrash great for you. The only bad thing is you have to win the race to win the money to buy your bikes. If you win your race some hot chicks greet you or the guy giving out the money will try to cheat you with play money in a cutscene its funny to watch.  (All game modes automatically unlocked) Roadrash is not your regular racing game you get weapons while you can kick players off their bikes.  Moto Racer no you cant but they still have special game modes but you have to unlock them. (No cutscenes included)
