I hate to say it but in its current state, it's not worth the price tag.That being said, what I did experience, I really enjoyed. I just think it's really lackluster given the premise and the atmosphere. Everything was very linear, the inability to backtrack at times was extremely frustrating. I expected a lot more than I received.I know it's Alpha and I really hope it grows and evolves because it has SO much potential. Every other reviewer seems to think its the best thing since sliced bread and I just don't believe that yet.I'll be watching it closely to see just how it does shape up and I fully expect to rewrite this review in the future.

In spite of that, I was genuinely surprised by twists and turns in the narrative within 15 minutes.I was not expecting to see an ending in under two hours. Those seeking a game to play moreso than a space to explore or a narrative to unravel will probably get there sooner, and probably be disappointed-  there are other Steam reviews that claim to have finished in 20 minutes. But Verde Station seems clearly designed for multiple playthroughs. Exposition via recursion. Nothing here is as it seems, including the fade to black. The narrative IS the game.At this juncture, all I can definitively say is those two hours have left me itching to go back, and as a fan of these experiential setting-sims, that's worth my recommendation.If you are the type to embrace ""walking simulators"" because the term ""game"" is more of a pigeonhole, keep this one on your radar."

I was about to recommend this game, but I was waiting for something more to be in a game before I do this. Well, it didn't work out.What's goodFirst, it's very impressive to see such game to be developed by one man. I had a lot of fun providing feedback and bug reports on the forum while the game was in Early Access.Second, the idea of the game is good. Attempt to present it looks a bit dramatic. There are some good moments in the game which can create an illusion of something interesting happening.What's badThe idea of the game is undeveloped and presented very shallow. It looks like a very short and linear story told us via game. If you compare a game devlopment to a movie development this game reminds me of a short clips directors make to present their vision to producers before they are hired to film a full movie.There is absolutely no challenge in this game. You just move further because you have nothing else to do.The game interactions that affect your story progression boil out to just  moving around and using terminals. All other interactive objects are secondary and give very little benefit.The overall design of the game is very unobvious. The game lacks explanations and player assistance. You can discover some pieces of information scattered around only if you'll be ignoring story progression and specifically looking for them. These pieces of information are very disconnected from each other and won't give you a full picture or even a hint about it. Maybe if you collect them all you'll be able to see something. It seems I haven't found them all.The game still contains bugs.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAS7nwjsjcwSummaryI was expecting this game to be in development for at least a year more. I was excited about what this game could be.I never expected it to end like this.I can only recommed it only if you're interested in studying game design. There are very good examples of bad design decisions, and a few good ideas. I would like to read post-mortem for this game."

Verde Station gives the player an incomplete set of building blocks from maybe more than one story and asks them to put it all together however they see fit. If you treat the game how it's looking to be treated, you should come out with some things to think about. If you want the game to entertain you passively, this might not be the game for you.Some people are saying they did everything in the game in under half an hour. I didn't come close to doing everything and completely ignored certain segments of the game and I took almost two hours to finish it with 2 out of 12 achievements."

Why do you make a game that's so good to experience but so hard to talk about without completely spoiling?! I feel like I'm in some kind of weird verbal bondage where I can't really say what I want and have forgotten the safe word. Oh well, I'm still going to try treading on eggshells here and talking about this and we'll just see what happens. Here goes...I originally saw this on sale and had the words ""walking simulator"" and ""adventure"" and ""sci-fi"" jump out at me, all things which I'm a fan of, so I figured at 99c I probably couldn't complain either way no matter how it turned out. I didn't read any further on it beyond the general positive score, and, boy, am I glad that's as much digging as I did. This really is a game that benefits from some blissful ignorance before going into it, save for maybe the fact that it's pretty much completely devoid of conflict of any kind and is instead based mostly on ""purpose"". At least in as much as you have a role to play and a function to fulfil and that will pretty much be the extent of the gameplay.You awake on the titular station and are immediately given a test on your mental state and told to perform it again every 30 days. You are then given the task of maintaining the station's plant and tree life for future endeavours and to also check them every 30 days. What follows is the strange juxtaposition of tasks of tedium among a spectacular setting... basically a janitor in space. There's more to it than that, as you'll explore the handful of rooms that make up the station and read various log entries, but all that is best left to your own discovery.I know it sounds like a total non-event, but I promise you there's more to it than that.It kind of reminded me of the classic '60s TV show The Prisoner. It was weird and never really explained itself and by the end you probably had more questions about everything than answers, but still thoroughly enjoyed your time with it the whole way. That was definitely my experience with it.The only complaint I'd probably have is I was left wanting more. Sniffing around every inch of the station to try finding new things to see or possibly interact with took up the lion's share of my hour or two with this title, and I do wish it could have been eked out to something longer and the concept expanded upon. But otherwise, the brief time I spent is something that still managed to have great impact and will stay with me for a while, and I strongly recommend you take the time with it, too.Oh, I just remembered... the safe word is Verde Station."

You really need to maintain the integrity of the plants because if they are alive, you are alive. Don't get too worried about the little things but definitely make sure to log any issues you encounter on the station. Also a good tip is to really really stay focused on your mainframe. I mean the terminal. It's a terminal. I mean the system, it's a server with terminals. I named a mistake when I logged the books but keep reading because you'll need all the books in the microwave.

Verde Station follows in the footsteps of Gone Home and The Stanley Parable; it's a game about exploring an environment, and in so doing, coming to understand that environment. Or, to try anyway.Like Gone Home or The Stanley Parable, it's easy to ""win"" Verde Station. You can go from the opening to the ending in half an hour if you put your mind to it. But that's not the point; don't do that. Take your time and, more to the point, think about what's going on. Expect to be confused. Expect to be misled. Expect to be surprised.If you say the phrase ""walking simulator"" with contempt, you probably won't enjoy Verde Station. That's fine. But if you're willing to leap into the unknown (and Verde Station is one of the very few pieces of media that actually is improved by approaching it without knowing what's going to happen), I cannot recommend this game more highly."

Maybe I missed something but the game did not last much more than 30 mins for me. First I thought I was stuck but than I realised: that's it. There is no way out with the third walk around the station. This 'experience' directs you to a partly forseeable conclusion.It's not even a good walking simulator. Interacting with stuff was more than messy. In my opinion the game's not worth the 5 bucks I spent on it. To make for a game or experience, a lot more story is needed."

That's, just to say, not a bad thing, because it provided a nice surprise regarding the experience and it felt kind of nice.On the other hand, the experience itself was not so terrific in the end. That's probably because you know exactly what'sgoing on when you take a close look at your surroundings. (I'm not going to mention any details.)Take a second/minute to take in the details and you might be able to figure out what's going on yourself.Another thing I didn't really like, but that's probably because it's still in development, is the short gameplay of each playthrough. Depending on your play speed it can be done in less than, let's say, 40 minutes.What's good? Fear, by answering a set of questions you're supposed, or you believe, you get a custom tailored portionof fear presented to you. If that's completely correct, I don't know, because I don't know how the game has been designed. But, it's done in a good way and makes you act careful for as long as it lasts.I recomend the game as far as it concerns the concept, but I don't recommend it based on actual content. It's too little at this moment. The experience doesn't last long enough at this time to be regarded as a full gaming experience. It feels more like a test setup for psychologic gameplay elemenst to see what works and what doesn't. (Depending on your goal as a developer)Conclusion:Verde Station has potential, but needs more work. It needs longer playthrough time. At the time of writing the presented content is not enough to keep you satisfied for long. For the current price you expect more material, story and interaction with your surroundings.But, I do recommend Verde Station, because at its core it's a great concept that does work in a fast way. And if the developers do something with the feeback, they'll be able to create an awesome game in the end."

I recommend it especially for those of us who love exploration and atmosphere above all else. It reminds me of older adventure games in its ability to truly draw you into the environment and make you feel like you're there.I spent 2.5 hours playing, soaking in the atmosphere, poking in every nook and cranny, and enjoying every minute of it. This isn't a game to be rushed through. Take it slow and get in a thoughtful frame of mind. Play it alone, with headphones, and ""bask in the silence"".The atmosphere is absolutely my favorite part of Verde Station. There were times when I genuinely felt isolated- and a bit frightened- wandering around the station. Though the game is a ""walking simulator"" it does a great job of ramping up the tension at certain points.As for story, there's a lot not directly said in this game, but if you take your time and pay attention, it becomes clear. I disagree with the reviewers who say that the game has no story (or that the story doesn't make sense). It's there, and by the time you reach the ending, the truth of the situation can be inferred.The only thing that could have improved this game for me would've been multiple endings.

It can't quite be classified as horror, but the game has a wonderful way of building up the atmosphere as you inhabit this lonely vessel in space, making you feel that impending sense of nameless dread. This is definitely not an action game, either. It reminded me of the Stanley Parable in some ways, minus the narrative but with plenty of the existential crisis-inducing moments. You explore and feel out the story for yourself. You could easily make it through to the ""end"" without having discovered any of the details of the backstory, and still enjoy the overall experience. But the real fun is in taking your time, truly getting into the role you are playing as you examine your surroundings for clues as to what exactly happened here, and what is happening to you now. My only real complaint is that there isn't more...I would love to see this game with multiple endings, for instance. The game holds so much potential, it would be great to see it expanded upon even more.

The game drops hints to lead you to believe where it's headed and then tricks you by ending the opposite.  I'm for twist surprises but it felt cheap.

The purpose of this game is to tell a story, but if it was not in game form, it would not have worked as well. This is the first time I have seen a game truly pull off being a story that is better as a game because of how they involve the gameplay. Basically, think of it as a walking simulator that simulatres you bein the main character in the story. It is definitely short, so be expecting this. But since when do we require a story to be exceptionally long to be good? We pay about $10 to go see a 2 hour movie. I recommend playing it without learning anything else about it, and don't look at the following spoiler.The only thing I don't like about this game isit makes you think there is a secret, happier ending even though, as far as I can tell, there is not. This was really frustrating because I kept replaying it trying to unlock the happier ending and the game was even giving me clues that I was getting closer to achieving this. Even more major spoilers now as I will explain this. After I deciphered the final code from the wall and completed the game, I remembered there was another place to enter a code in the Greenhouse. So I restarted the game, and entered the code. It opens up the wall in that room, leaving only some kind of transparent barrier preventing you from getting sucked out into space. This seems to make the Greenhouse into some kind of docking station. The ship you see at the ending even has a part sticking out that looks like it could maybe dock into that. Before you get too far into the game, the terminal in the greenhouse let's you report a catastrophic event. If you do that, you are told you can exit onto a ship if one is docked, but you can see nothing is docked there once you get it open. The game provides all kinds of ways to report problems making you think if you report problems just right, maybe you can get them to come rescue you sooner than the ending. If you first answer the mental health questions as if you were healthy, and then the second time around as if you are mentally unstable, you will unlock a different message from Jeff. He says your health is mental health is not looking too good and they will be there within hours to rescue you. I still wonder if maybe there is a way to get rescued, or perhaps the developers wanted to include that and then changed their minds. The game is literally taunting you to try to get rescued faster and giving you signals that this is possible and that you are on the right track, getting closer to achieving this goal.Update:So I emailed the developer about the other endings. There aren't any, but my thinking was right on track. They did consider having other endings that involved getting saved in this way, but ended up deciding against it. I don't think it was a bad decision. The existence of other endings would probably only have added extra content that did not really push the theme or intended experience to be better in any way, it would just have diluted that. My only complaint is the game makes you think there are other endings even though there are not."

Over the year your mental state declines and by the end of it you're unsure if you can take it any more.SPOILERS AHEAD ---------But here's where it failed horribly for me:1. All these disk logs about stuff that happened on the station. None of it made sense, or seemed to have any purpose.2. Why are you maintaining this tiny station with only 1 bedroom? Who are you maintaining it for?!3. Why was the station itself engulfed in a video simulation cube?At the end of the game, if you restart you now have access to a code that opens up the huge docking bay doors, meaning you can see OUTSIDE of said cube. You can see the planet you're orbiting, you can see the beauty of space, you can even just about see - if you squint - the space ship that will eventually come and get you in the far distance.This makes the reply 100% stupid, because you no longer have that suspense of 'why is the outside of the ship glitching, is this real, am I mad' etc etc.With a lot of polishing this could genuinely be a great game.

You are in charge of maintaining the greenhouse (for some reason).  And that's about it.I couldn't shake the feeling during this game that it was 3 a.m. and I had had another sleepless night and was watching ""Silent Running"" on the SCI-FI network.  Except Bruce Dern rocked and those robots he had were kind of cool.I almost didn't give this game a second chance but I decided before I could give it a rating I needed to try it again.I did.  It still doesn't make any sense.  It's a mix of ""Silent Running"", ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"", and just about every other space-station scenario you can think of.  The concept is interesting but played out and this game, unfortunately, doesn't add much to the genre.Okay, so you're in a space station and what happens?  Let me guess, the protagonist starts losing his sanity?  The computer, which the protagonist depends on, begins malfunctioning?  Slowly the space station gives in to the second law of thermodynamics and everything starts to fall apart slowly?  Didn't need to play it, already knew.  It's every cliche you could think of besides the white hats and the black hats.Except there are the disks that give you a neat little story about the white hats and the black hats.A neat added wrinkle is that concept that the entire space station is part of a huge bureautric corportaion that, in its idiocy, has mindless, pointless bits of red tape that you get mired in.  Never seen that before!Oh, wait...except in ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".The developer touts this as a game ultimately about paying attention.  It's a kind of open sandbox, walk around, figure-stuff-out-yourself adventure.  I liked the sound of that.  At first.  You walk around a space station, only five or so rooms, and you can interact with stuff.But pretty soon you're just walking around a space station with only five or so rooms with stuff you can interact with.   It's pretty cool because you can pick stuff up and.......put it down.And pick a book up and....put it down.And pick a plastic container up and.....put it down.Oh and then you can....flush the toilet.Wow, who thought being along in a space station could be so incredibly boring?I'm sure there is a story here somewhere.  I just didn't really care much about it.  I get that the game tries, at times, to disorient the player purposefully because it adds to the psychological drama.  And I get the concept of having a game that you have to discover and figure out.At some point, though, this type of game needs SOME kind of structure.  You have to have some reliable way of at least keeping time -- it's a space station for Christ's sake, they can't build in a f*cking calendar and clock?  Otherwise the game just becomes a mish-mosh of stream-of-consciousness experience that doesn't make any sense.  What you want is a game that doesn't make any sense but still makes a little sense while you are playing it.I don't think there would be that much to tweak in the game.  It would be nice to have some puzzles or something.  Something to do besides open and close valves.  Something besides listening to really bad music used only because its copyright has expired and the developers didn't want to put out a ton of cash.  Give me something to do, please.Sometimes doors open, sometimes they don't.  Can't figure out why.  Can't figure out what is actually happening and what is misperceived.  Can't tell if the what appears to be a bug is actually purposefully programmed into the game.And, in the end, don't particularly care.  Might have a high replay value, I guess.  Next time I want to feel that life is pointless that it's nothing but a bunch of unrelated episodes with no underlying purpose....well, next time I feel this like I'll read ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"".The ending of the, I think, was the best -- who would have predicted that it was all a fake journey?  Oh, wait...just like in ""Capricorn One"".Only thing I can figure that was left out of this game -- Klingons."

It felt like it's going to require doing a lot of chores to maintain the space station, but I was glad to discover that this isn't what the game is about. It has an actual story, and it picks up from there. I was also surprised by the ending which is always a plus.Compared to other ""walking simulators"", I enjoyed Verde Station more than Gone Home. It simply offers a lot more interactivity and a better story. It wasn't as amusing as The Stanley Parable, and wasn't as atmospheric as Dear Esther, but all in all I would rank it between these two in terms of overall enjoyment.Some people complain that Verde Station is short, but for $1 (on sale) there's more than enough content. Definitely better bang for the buck than any of the aforementioned games. Recommended!"

The silence is so eerie and when things start happening and the music kicks in, that only adds to it.I had no clue what I was doing in the game but I did end up ""beating"" it, if only by accident. Verde Station is more interesting than entertaining. There's a weird creepy vibe to the game (reminding me of The Journeyman Project) and you'll keep wondering what's going to happen and when.I feel like this game could've really benefit from more of a storyline and a better way to end the game. Mild recommendation for the curious and those that don't mind playing a video game where literally all you do is walk around."
,Not Recommended,324120,13730702,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,GekoPrime,"I like walking simulators, but this game was just boring.The core concept was workable. There were some effective scenes, both dramatic and subtle, and a bit of foreshadowing that made the ending enjoyable.I think what it lacks are atmosphere, timing, and focus.Focus:the interactive aspects of this game are pointless, distracting, frustrating, confusing... the station is a ring, and you're intended to walk it clockwise. The game lets you walk in the wrong direction for a couple rooms until it stops you with a locked beeping door. Have fun plodding back to the story.There are floppy discs scattered about. You can plug them into a console to read. The process is annoying, mood killing, and they add nothing to the story. Ignore the discs. Same with the console commands. Ignore the terminals altogether. Ignore the cupboards. Ignore the crates. Avoid your left mouse button altogether. Exploration will be punished.I played through in a little under an hour and felt glad to be donethat bit where you walk up all those stairs to find yet another beeping door? don't dispair, the end is near![\spoiler]"

There is no gameplay and there is nothing you can do to change the course of events. The consoles are nice to play with, but there isn't much there either. The full game is around 45 minutes to get through.This game has no replay value. I thought each play through would have different outcomes, but it was the same every time.There were a couple of puzzles, I suppose. The answers were given to you if you looked around, though.Even with the sale price, I wouldn't recommend this game."

Yes I enjoyed the game, I fully recommend it and I will definitely play it again, buuuut; it is not worth 10 euros or dollars (or other currency). It should really be half that price, for which I am glad that I bought it on sale which is what I recommend everyone else does.Now my personal notes: I really liked what the developers have done here and it was really fresh how they made my isolation so scary and freightening.  I do wish there where some more explaination, but if there were then maybe we wouldn't theorize ourselves so much? It has several small details that if you miss you would lose on the experience but since the enviroment is small and sometimes poor those details stand out. I do hope that the team behind Verde Station continue in the same spirit on another game but with more content and clearer storyline. Oh, and I also really liked how they made the moniters and menu interface work the same, it created more nice atmosphere. Now, go and play it!"

It's the video game equivalent of a great short story, like one of those masterful sci-fi shorts that just blows your mind and makes you want to know more, but somehow leaves you satisfied.

Still needs some work. My biggest issue was you didn't really have to do much to end the game. The clues seem to pop up without the player having to do much more than walking around the station. I would mostly recommend it bc the game style is pretty neat, and the story line keeps you interested. Don't play it expecting too much though.[Edit] only buy this if it's on sale for like $1 or $2 ..... the game is so linear and it's just not worth it for full price."

There are two or three go-find-it puzzles, a razor thin story line with no payoff, and a heap of useless mechanics. Seriously don't think anything you can interact with has a purpose or is some kind of clue. And the ending was so sudden and disappointing that I went back and played it all again, thinking I had messed up the first level and was missing whatever it was that gave me ""the good ending,"" but there is none.The artwork and level design are solid, and the atmosphere is perfectly lonely and spooky, and I feel like the devs could make this into a very tense atmospheric horror game. The isolation feels real, but wasted. Get Lifeless Planet instead."
