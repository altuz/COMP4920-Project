It creates moves like ""quadruple jump"" and also situations where you have to stack your characters in particular color order to navigate passed obstacles!This is a great example of how a co-op game should be!"

So I'd been chomping at the bit since I heard about the game last December.  And Kalimba did not disappoint!  Some notes:* stacking is harder than it looks... you need a ledge or a hole or something to do it* more platform-y than puzzle-y* difficult, but not extremely so (as some reviews implied)* did not cause any existential marriage crises (as some reviews warned)* got very exciting at some points* similar feel to ibb&obb, but we liked Kalimba much better* visual style is very nice* lots of jokes that are ... somewhat funnyThe scoring system is up to 70 points for getting all the goodies, minus 1 for each death.  The goodies are kept even when you die.  So you can get a pretty good score without being amazing, but it's quite hard to get all 70 points (and a golden totem).The game is VERY short.  We completed all 20 co-op levels (so including dark void DLC) in 3 hours.  We didn't get 70 points in all the levels, and I'd say there's about a 50-50 chance that we care enough to go back.  Many of the levels introduced interesting gamplay mechanics, but by the end thing started to feel same-y.So if you want to play a co-op puzzle platformer and you and your partner are both decent at platformers, then get this game!"

,Recommended,324140,26008522,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,arq,"Hidden gem amongst puzzle platformers.Excellent game playing single or local co-op. Mostly pleasing mechanics and the gameplay feels precise. I loved the art style and whimsical music. The game is also forgiving when playing casually, but it can be frustratingly hard if you are aiming for the gold totem (0 deaths, all collectibles gathered) on every level.My only gripe with this game is that the co-op is on the short side. 10 short levels and 10 more with DLC, the co-op is over in 2-3 hours. It also focuses on the stacking mechanic, whereas the single player has more different puzzle types. Definitely experience Kalimba co-op, but for longer similar co-op  only experience, check out Ibb & Obb."

Needless to say, Friend and I were absolutely stunned at the beauty of this game from the start. It's like a mixture of Jenga, Operation, and pure joy. There's no reason to not buy this game, unless you hate fun. 10/10, would buy again, this game needs more recognition."

,Recommended,324140,33005840,Posted: 29 June,all,ThePeeje,"Awesome game for local coop, mainly between 2 people because theres a long and challenging 2 player campaign. But theres also a turn based mode for up to i think 5 or 6 people where you beat each others scores like a penalty shootout.Seriously though for what it is, this is a 10/10 game! It looks fantastic, good sound, good overall design, great and original game play and a lot of unique game mechanics. Its also got a lot of style and comedy in terms of the writing.1 player is ok and will really push your brain to new levels. But the best experience is 2 player coop. So much fun!"

I enjoy the game, the little bit that I've played I think the mechanics are fun, and the gameplay is challenging.That said, I think that it's simply inconceivable in the year 2015 to not have online co-op as an option.  I've heard people say, ""it's just not possible to play this over the internet, the amount of communication the players need to have simply makes it impossible to play online.""  I think that's just a crock of bologna, team speak, Skype, Mumble, Vent and any number of other VOIP services mean that you can have just as much communication over the web as you can with somebody sitting in the same room.I think this game definitely has that nostalgic feel to it, but for a modern age, like an evolved Mario or Kirby but I just can't believe it doesn't have online co-op."

Was very disappointed to find out it was only local co op and it seems the devs have no intention on adding an online coop option.It is a great fun game to play on your own, no doubt about it, but I feel its competitive elements would be far more enjoyable if there were more online options available, especially for people who don't generally have any local gamer friends to stop by their place :P"
