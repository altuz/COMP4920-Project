,Not Recommended,324170,12270738,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,マジレズ✰Shadow,"Pyrite Heart's an interesting VN because it seems like a lot of other otome games, but when you get into it, it lacks the personality or flair of those games. Whether it's because the set-up steers into the inciting argument within three lines or whether it's because the protagonist actively picks a fight with everyone and everything constantly, Pyrite Heart feels like it's missing something – and it may be heart.To me it feels like Pyrite Heart took the easy way out on every turn. Instead of setting up the princess' personality at home, it immediately throws her into school. Instead of creating an opportunity for a natural relationship to happen, the princess forces it, attacking the first guy she sees, making him stand out as the main guy instantly but obviously. Of course, the protagonist is a very aggressive character, and that would be fine if she didn't feel like a shallow take on tsundere with more stubborn traits and an inferiority complex added in quickly. The love interests feel similarly shallow, with the option of either perfect-but-sensitive class president or sporty-and-mostly-loyal secret servant from home.While the dare's time limit of a week is realistic for some silly dare, it takes way too much away from what could happen in the actual story. Drama is quick and incredibly easy to see coming, and the whole premise of royalty is kind of confusing since it's presented as the Japanese Imperial House but seems a lot like a take on western royalty.Simple choices and good art be damned. This game is too quick to jump on reasons and challenges to give purpose and drive to its events, and in doing that leaves out some of the most important things you could find in an otome game: a moment of sincerity, a feeling of getting closer to someone, a semblance of fun."
,Not Recommended,324170,20826001,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Pyrite Heartis a cute, short yet vain visual novel without much depth or gameplay option. It certainly lacks character variety or story diversity. It might be considered eligible on means of display - with pretty enough art style, yet I find myself failing to recommend it due to it being completely stereotypical and uninteresting.Here we have tsundere princess Ahri Remono: the snobbish, know-it-all heiress of the royal family. After getting into an argument with his elder brother, the crown prince, Ahri takes his brother's challenge to survive outside of the royal palace like an ordinary high school student for one week. For the duration of that one week, she has to attend an ordinary high school without the aid or observance of any of her servants. No one is to know that Ahri is a princess. As she has always been ready to do so, Ahri accepts the challenge and ventures out to learn some lessons, and possibly find love ""unexpectedly"".Unexpected? Nah, not really. There are only 2 romance options to begin with and there are no significant characters beside those boys, Ahri and the crown prince anyway. A VN with 4 characters altogether. That felt a bit pathetic contrary to visuals and display of the game being in remarkable quality, accompanied with enjoyable soundtracks. Art style is beautiful and lively. It's like wrapping a lame, common gift in wondrously glamourous wrapping paper. It creates expectations only to fail living up to them.I must say that the story is incredibly short, with only 2 quite obvious branching paths. Each romance has a good, bad and a grand ending reachable through 3-4 dialogue choices. As it goes with any tsundere, there is a brief period of self-importance and aggression coming from Ahri towards the romance option, and a realization period with tears of desperation and frustration. It depends whether there is a happy ending or not, but the formula is foolproof. It is cute, but it's nothing interesting. There is nothing to shock or surprise you, no secret to discover, nothing unforeseeable. Thus, you get bored of watching Ahri and 2 glamorously pretty boys either flirt or argue eventually.It is nothing extraordinary, or remarkable. It sure is a sweet little game for your 3 dollars if you are strictly into VN gameplay and wouldn't like to miss anyone of them. As a final verdict, it is sadly passable.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

(Go to the bottom for reason of standing on a neutral ground)The storyYou will play through as a spoiled princess Ahri who's been shelterd all her life. And after a bet she made witth her brother about being able to survive in the outside world for a week, she transferred to a ""common school"". There she meets a fustrating rival and an unexpected nuisance.Audio and Visual elementsVisual elementsFor a short visual novel there is alot of CGs which is surprising. Art style is good impactful and smooth art style being used.Audio elementsMusic are relatively avergae nothing really crazy or good.But on 1 of the route i really loved the piano music being used there the piano really adds so much emotion to the situation i was rather surprised of them using a piano music in this short VNReasons for a neutral stand1. The ending felt too rushed it is like they just wanted to publish this as fast as possible, I felt that if they put in more effort in adding more content to the story this would surely be a straight up positive review.2. They could have done better in terms of branching out after the happy endings i really wanted to see more because there is still alot of room for more content but it is just ""The End"" and you get met by the credits.To sum upThe story is really cute and enjoyable in fact I found myself smiling throughout the whole playthrough but it is not worth at full price so i highly suggest to pick it up when it is on sale."
,Not Recommended,324170,19266589,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,サマエル,"The good:Visual appearance: A fairly high amount of CGs for such a short game, and quality ones at that. The art department is solid, nothing to complain about it; bishies, check; mandatory cute kitten, check; good backgrounds, check.The script: somehow clichéd, though less so than others thanks to the protagonist's personality. It has its moments.The eyecandy is there, and it's not overemphasized.Scales well all the way up to 1080p in fullscreenmode, perhaps higher, haven't tested that.Steam cards, I guess.The bad:Very short, expect to finish a playthrough and still have cards to drop (well, perhaps not now with the 2 hours rule, but back when I played this it took me two playthroughs and then some idling to get the cards, that's how short this is).The script: somehow clichéd, though less so than others thanks to the protagonist's personality. A tsundere protagonist is not something everyone will stomach, and many of the lines used to convey that feel forced or just ridiculous.You only get to pick one out of two routes, each has two endings and all end rather abruptly. Thus, there's very little replayability value.ERRATA: There are actually six endings, as pointed out by Alexia in the comments (who also made ahandy guideabout it). Even so, I feel that the replayability value remains quite low.As others pointed out, this used to be free and voice-acted. This is no longer the case on the Steam version.This is a very subjective opinion, but I found the protagonist unsufferable. Not because I dislike the tsundere archetype, but because I really found her unsufferable.TL;DR:A short otome VN which does its job relatively well but feels rushed and leaves you with a ""they could've put more into this"" kind of feeling. To recommend, or not to recommend this game? That is the question: and at the standard price tag I'll have to go with Nay. Wait for it to go on a hefty sale (or bundle), or skip it - unless you're the ""gotta catch 'em all"" kind of person."

However, it is very very short, and not really worth full price.  There are a few choices you can make which extend the game, but all content can be played through in a few hours.The artwork is beautiful making the game a pleasure to play through.

One route took me half an hour, while a good otome game should call for 2 or 3 hours per route at minimum. Simply, it went too quickly. In an otome game, you have to treat your story like any other. Have them slowly get to know each other or be able to go out and do things. Our choices for a love interest are slim and we don't get any events or story outside the rushed romance. I'm sorry, but all in all this wasn't a good game."

,Recommended,324170,13380001,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,Ceaseless Duality,"This is another game where I wish there were a more neutral option between whether your recommend it or not, or whether it was a positive or negative review. I didn't hate this game, but I wouldn't say I particularly liked it either. My biggest complain would definitely be that it's far too short. It takes less than a hour to get through the whole story once. Furthermore, it only took a couple of hours to view all the story paths.Yes, this is a romance visual novel. This is not to be confused with a sim game, because there aren't any stats or daily choices. There are two guys to choose from. During the story, there will be prompts for choices during high points of events. What you choose determines if you end up with a guy at the end. The choices are pretty obvious. The gist is: Don't be a jerk to the person you want to end up with. There's basically a good and bad ending for each guy.Another complaint would be the misuse of the word ""love.""  I really hate that in stories, when people have known each other for, like, two seconds, and they say they're ""in love."" This story's duration is only 1 week, and yet there's characters proclaiming they're in love at the end. It would be ""like"" at best and infatuation at worst. I'm not saying that they couldn't make this game for that short of a duration, but it is ridiculous to use the word ""love"" in these circumstances. I would've enjoyed the game a bit more if they'd just had the characters proclaiming ""like"" instead.Despite all its bad points, there are some things I did like about it. The main character's personality is very flawed. I like this, because many stories have main characters that are almost too perfect, and therefore, not realistic. By the end of the game, she's learned some things and become a slightly better person. While the romance choices (the two guys) aren't exactly unique, they're definitely not of the most common archetypes either. The best thing about game was the humor, I think. The game made me giggle. If a game can make me giggle, it can't be *that* bad, right?Would I recommend it? Eh ... if you  like very lighthearted visual novels and don't mind the flaws mentioned, then sure, but I would get it during a sale, at least."
,Not Recommended,324170,12387310,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Shinsuke Nakamura,"This is hilariously terrible. Poor writing, so fast paced it's unbelievable (can be finished in 20 minutes) & there is not a single likeable character. I haven't laughed so hard at getting a bad ending in a long time. It's completely out of nowhere and has no build up at all. Even the good endings don't have much going for them. I have no words. I almost want to recommend this because it's such a mess. On the bright side, some of the art is actually pretty nice! That's about all the praise I can give it. Maybe one of the routes will be worthwhile.Edit: Just got all the endings, took one hour. You can complete the game 100% before all the cards drop. I guess the Kenta good ending was sort of cute I guess? If this was just paced a bit better (make it triple the length) then this could have been halfway decent. As it stands, avoid it unless 20 minute long VN's that have worse writing than some 16 year old's LiveJournal in 2002 are your thing."

The included digital dakimakura enticed me to purchase this version+ For the play length, there were a decent amount of CGs with many variations+/- Plot is very simple, but doesn't go anywhere/is not explored in depth+/- Refreshing personality for an otome MC (tsundere princess) who does exhibit growth. Most people would probably find her annoying, however she outshined any other character.- Pretty short with only 2 routes. The card drops took longer than completing the entire game- Romance felt flat. The male love interests have no depth.- The first version of this game was free and voiced. I played that version before they removed itI might recommended this if it were on sale and you need another basic otome game in your catalog. I decided not to recommend this because I do not like Winged Cloud's actions as a company.

Now, I'm not saying this game is perfect, but it's pretty solid.    As you progress, it goes more into depth (not major depth, but a fair amount).  The background of your character is a little thrown together, but once you play more, it gets better because you feel more connection with the two boys and your character.  The art is AMAZING, props to whoever drew it all, it must have taken forever.  My review is that I think this is worth getting (especially if it's on sale) because it's a solid dating sim/VN.  It's not the best, but by far not the worst.

There's a minor continuity error involving the first two choices, and a possible similar error on Ryuu's neutral ending, which is a little sad considering the very limited number of branches in the game. However, the good endings are sweet and Ryuu's good ending in particular is nice.The characters are mostly good, but there's some inconsistency- mostly that Ahri seems to be a lot more demure on Kenta's route for no particular reason. Ahri's character drawns on a fairly annoying trope but she's surprisingly appealing, easily the most tolerable version of the ""naive sheltered princess"" because 1) she's not painfully naive about everything to the level of ""what is this human door you speak of"" 2) her ego is actually backed up by hard work and skill and 3) she's actually capable of introspection and noticing when reality doesn't square with her illusions. Kenta is nothing groundbreaking but if you like the type of character he is you'll probably like him.Ryuu and Ahri's interaction on his route is the highlight for me. Probably the best writing in the game is Ryuu and Ahri's verbal sparring, and it's nice to have a romance with a relationship based on finally finding someone they consider an equal. Also Ryuu looks really good as a butler.For £4 I feel like I easily got my money's worth and I enjoyed playing it."

It just didn't seem to blend well with the mood behind some of the scenes, but it also wasn't horrible. It could've been better, but it also could've been much worse. The story is really short, it probably took me about half an hour, to play through the story and the rest of the time I spent AFK just to get the remaining card drops.

Also, she finds out her brother sent in her most trusted servant to keep an eye on her. In this week, she either falls for her first ever rival or the servant she never realizes she's needed.

I did this for almost 2 hours and did 3 of the routes (there is probably a good, great, and bad ending to each guy), but that's stretching it since I decided to make it fun with voice acting. Story is nothing new, but it could surfice for some people. The main character at the beginning annoyed me to no end, but she has great character development by the midway point. There was also something off putting with one of the routes, since she met one guy earlier that week and is in love already in one ending. The other guy makes sense with their backstory, but not the other guy and her. It's not all bad. With that character development, some humor, and the beautiful artwork, it still makes a decent game.

It has great art work and the music is okay (the piano ballad sequences are very nice, the others are good background noise but nothing to get excited over).  The story starts out a little abruptly letting you know that you are playing the stereotypical spoiled princess but doesn't really give you much aside from that so personally I had to put a little extra effort into trying to enjoy being the MC.Now, I am the kinda person who if a film, good or bad, has a stuffed animal sitting in the rain with piano ballads softly whipering in the background, I end up in waterworks without fail.

It is simple, quick and a good introduction to visual novels and thier repeat playthroughts without getting bogged down in text heavy sections and subtle choices.This game is far too short, and the story is far too contrived. The choices are also far too simple. While the story does have a cute side to it, the emotional development of the characters just spouts out of nowhere far too quickly which really subtracts from the belivablilty of the story. The endings leave far too much unresolved long term makign them feeling quite empty."

Some of the CG shots had really odd facial perspective issues, and there wasn't any CG gallery so unless you save you can't go back and see them. Also there was no way to hide the text box, so no full CGI.Gameplay: 5/10. With this Visual novel, at 5 dollars it's almost charging too much due to content. I've played free VN's with longer paths then this. The text choices were interesting at points, but Ahri didn't have nearly enough options in order to make this worth the full price of the game. It's quite literally four to five choices, I managed to complete all possible paths in about 30 minutes. Which is definitely not very engaging considering that the makers of the game expect to make money.Story: 3/10 It was predictable, and a lot of it felt like it was a repurposed bunch of text from other dating sims and popular slang. Also the concept doesn't make a lot of sense.If they live in a world with Royalty, why wouldn't the commoners realise she was a Princess. Even if she's sheltered or home-schooled they would probably recognize similarities in features to her brother.Also - A servant in the secondary path's position would never reveal their owner's identity if this was supposed to be a life as a princess type game, nor go out of the way to make things complicated or themselves noticed. Doing so could get them fired, or worse yet killed if the laws are strict on loyalty in that world.The fact of the matter is, this is poorly planned, Ahri's one ""perfect end"" was really really poorly executed. If someone after a week is that hung up on not bearing the weight of the crown, then they weren't educated in the first place. There's a lot that Ahri should have been okay with by being a royal, so how would being bratty with some boy be a comfortable idea. And moreso the prince probably would give two ****'s if love was involved due to lack of status and when you're wealthy, you don't exactly look upon the less fortunate as lovers unless we're talking about Mistresses back in the day.*facedesk* There are much better Otome games on here, this may be cheap if you're new to VN's but it's really not very good at all. There's only a few cute scenes but the majority of the content is recycled text with slightly different outcomes, and one contrived boring plot. This could have been okay had they spent more than a few days on the text part of things. A longer, more interesting plot would have lead to a much better Visual novel. I don't recommend this and wouldn't bother paying for it."

It makes me sad that there wasn't more too it, but it was definitely worth the play throughs to get both endings.It sort've plays itself because it's a small game. You have minimal choices to choose and it doesn't heavily sway the story one way or the other. It's pretty cut throat about who you'll be ending up with, even if you complete a scene for one ending and you end up with the other. For instance when I got Ryuu's ending the first time, I didn't play out his first scene but instead played out Kenta's first scene and still ended up with Ryuu.All in all, it's sweet and short and to the punch.

The story was no masterpiece but it was simple, pretty light hearted, and even humorous at times.I'm not sure why others gave this low reviews.  It doesn't claim to be anything spectacular or anything of the sort.  It has very few possible paths, but nowhere was there anything that states it's going to be some elaborate masterwork of a dating sim.  It sounds very much to me that people were expecting too much for what they paid.It's simple, straight forward, and tells a cute story, however short that might be.

While it does leave one wanting more, ""wanting more"" is not necessarily a bad flaw to have since what is present is well executed.I'm a fan of the otome/visual novel genre in general, and Ahri is certainly a protagonist worth watching. She's spoiled, headstrong, loud, demanding, and competative, which is a nice change of pace in a genre awash in waifish, insecure female leads. She's definately the star of the show, with the boys present mostly as catalysts for how she grows and changes during her week in the real world. Unfortunately, the two boys don't get quite the same treatment - they're nice enough fellows, but they don't show the same depth of character or change as Ahri does.As short as it is, the game has limited replay value, and you'll exhaust all the options in two to three hours, depending on your reading speed. I would've liked to see it expand out a little bit, but for the price tag it's certainly not bad. The music is good, and so is the art. If you're interested in a unique protagonist for the otome genre, this is a good place to start."

Because I couldn't relate to, or sympathize with Ahri, it was way too difficult to tolerate her insufferable brattiness and conceit. I'm sure I could trudge through and get to that point but honestly, what I've been shown so far hasn't given me much hope on it being anything of substance.Final Verdict: This was a VN that could have been amazing had the developers worked a little more on background setup and making Ahri a relatable character despite her difficult personality. If you can put up with Ahri's attitude you'll probably be able to get through the playthroughs and maybe even enjoy it.
