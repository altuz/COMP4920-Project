76561198005923854,Not Recommended,324190,20984649,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Yulgalminakf,"This is the kind of game where I wish I could vote neutrally on it. It has amazing potential but is an extremely risky purchase. I've been a programmer for a few years now (C, C++, C#, Java, Python) and I'd love to see this game developed further.I love these sandbox type games with a passion. There's no point to them other than the points you give it. The spell creating and testing CAN be incredibly fun, but at the moment, it's limited. Currently, everything you do costs certain amounts of mana. Since everything costs so much mana, there's no way to create 90% of the awesome looking spells I saw in the trailers and previews. I feel kinda gyped.It's a risky purchase because this game can go either way: Blow up with popularity or fall into obscurity. If it blows up with popularity, the producers will probably put more effort into it and create it faster. If it falls into obscurity, the producers are likely to abandon it. I can easily see this game going either way.There's so little to do in the game, even for a sandbox game, that it's not really worth it yet. All you can do is move rocks around and make the ground go up or down. I love the spell creating system and this in and of it self could make the game, but it doesn't. I can see a lot of potential for it in future builds, but there's not much to it at the moment.I'd say the worst part of this game so far is the extremely limited implementation of the current spell design. You can only do certain things with either code or block-code. I often find myself having to do long, complicated work-arounds for some of the simplest things I want to do, increasing the cost of the spell and diminishing the full capacity of it. And some of the things I want to do are completely impossible.So far, in the current build, I would not recommend it. This review was done on 2/5/2016 on version  0.510c. If you're reading this far into the future with a much later build, then it might be better, but so far, I'm not impressed."

Simple things like moving the earth and water come to me easy enough. But I am trying to further develop my skills, and create more and more complicated spells with which to manipulate the environment around me.Day 2:Today I decided to hone my fire magic. This of all the elements requires a high degree of control. After much trial and error, I was able to create a new spell where fire orbs spin around me, and then I can release them all at once at a specific target. As these orbs leave me, I am able to twist them around a bit until they impact.Day 3:As my journey has only just begun, I decide to use my teleport ability to explore this land some more. Although I initially thought myself alone, I stumbled across a few creatures who at once began to charge at me. Quickly, I teleported a safer distance away, but the creatures continued to come at me. Not wanting to do harm to these animals, I chose to magically dig a trench between myself and them.My journey has only just begun, and I wonder what is in store for my future…[So far really enjoying this game. It has a lot of potential, and can’t wait to see more abilities and air magic to be released. On low graphics settings, the spell making menu has the controls graphic all pixelated. When checking the code for a specific spell, the menu at the bottom is pixelated as well. This is only a minor issue, and likely has an easy fix for our low-end computer users. Looking forward to creatures, more plants, and possibly multiplayer/npc’s. They might end up going in a minecraft direction due to having seed generated worlds, but more focused on crafting magic.]"

,Not Recommended,324190,19413777,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,ds6,"NOTE: This review was made for an earlier version of the game and I haven't kept up on the progress of it, so this review may be outdated in terms of current game content.I don't really understand why the game is getting the reviews it is. I understand it's early access, but there are a lot of things that should have been done from the get-go from a design perspective.  Here is a list of problems I have with it.- One of the first things I noticed is that there's no infinite loop checking, and you can easily lock up you game by making one. Well, at least with JS, and on that note it could just be a JS issue that Blockly detects but I honestly can't be arsed to check. That not being implemented (for the JS, at least) really shows what kind of game these guys are making, one focused on final results rather than code implementation. For me, this is a big red flag, even though it might seem trivial or nothing at all to someone else. If it is in this state because it was released too early, thendon't release it until it's ready for players to test. I am entirely certain that some prodigious beginner programmer has at one point crafted a beautiful spell just to have it be destroyed with a game-freezing accidental open loop that they can't fix.- Even if one does get far enough into the game as to be able to freeze it like that, the UI feels... unresponsive. I found it difficult to find specific functions In the Blockly editor, and what little time I spent with the interface felt unintuitive and haphazard. Orb creation isn't even called that, rather it's listed as casting another spell... While this makes sense logically based on how the game works (one orb per spell), my first instict was to look for ""Create orb"" or similar. Even Multimedia Fusion does it better.- The JS editor is okay, and has a number of simplistic IDE-like features, such as syntax highlighting, simplistic realtime syntax and error checking, and the occasional autocomplete, but the clunkyness and unresponsiveness of the UI still really hampered the experience. Also I wasn't able to find any select all option, to copy it into something that didn't suck to edit, and the mouse selection works when it wants to. To boot, there was no proper error console for all I could find; errors would just pop up at the bottom of the screen, with a surprising lack of information related to the error. Having an actual console likenearly every other programmable gamewould be nice, guys.- There is a code converter that converts Blockly code blocks into JS... This leads me to believe the code blocks actually just generate JS on the fly, which makes me wonder why you can't do the reverse (i.e. JS to Blockly). You also can't edit the generated JS without making a new spell and copy-pasting it. There isn't even a button to do this on the code generation pane, so you'd have to repeat that process for every spell you want to add a little JS flair to.- There is a distinct lack of proper low-level documentation. Sure, there are some help prompts [in the Blockly interface] and plenty of explanatory beginner spells [also mostly in the Blockly interface], but all of that is just as haphazard as the rest of it. There is no documentation for a number of JS functions that, according to numerous spells posted on their forums, a number of people use regularly. There is no one central place to read about how these functions work, and one of the functions relies on understanding of the underlying Unity framework (it evaluates UnityScript) and how the CodeSpells world is set up programmatically (you can access the game scene from the US scape, which isn't that super unsafe???). At least if you don't want to use those functionalities, there's not a ton of different things to learn and the beginner spells keep it relatively simple, so a new player won't feel overwhelmed...? I guess??- Mana (right? that's what it's called? I forgot already) drain doesn't really make much sense, and there's absolutely zero feedback on what takes what mana and by how much. You can't mix together mana usage very well, either; too little of whatever primary source your spell is assigned to, and it just flat out won't work. You can't change the type of a spell without -- again -- copy-pasting it into a new spell. Nothing but clunk. Maybe this was meant to introduce some challenge and mystique into the game, some guesswork on what will work and what won't. However, code doesn't work like that and will either yell at you or crash silently if you do something wrong. I doubt the game will hold your hand when you try to make this awesome spell to find that it takes way more mana than you even have available to you, and it hurts more knowing that it could have helped you out earlier, saying ""hey this costs 100 so don't use it more than twice"", but that doesn't happen.I really rarely used the Blockly interface, so excuse me if this is actually implemented and I just didn't see it because I only used the Blockly interface to get an idea of what kind of functions there were. That's not an excuse for it not being implemented in the JS portion, however.Aside from the programming, I also have gripes with the presentation of the game:- The game world is incredibly tiny. The edges of the world fall into what appears to be an endless void, and there's no indication other than falling to your untimely death that anything is wrong. I thought it was just a cliff for a moment, and was prepared to create some water with a spell to cushion the landing. That landing never came, as I was just teleported back up to a random position on the map.- While the fluid simulation isverynice, it's incredibly jagged, and really needs some visual polish.- Heating things up doesn't really make as much sense as I'd have expected. Instead of being able to light individual objects on fire, you instead increase the heat of the surrounding area until it gets hot enough for things to burn. Maybe I missed something, but that seems really silly (though having both abilities available would make for smashingly good design). Heating water to create clouds and humidity to create rain (if I was reading that right and it wasn't just random luck) was really awesome, though.TL;DR it has promise, but generally falls flat due to clunky, disjointed interfaces and lack of proper documentation. It tries to be simple and easy to understand, but complicates this by not having a very solid foundation to build on. I certainly wouldn't want anyone to try to learn programming using this tool, especially not my children or anyone I care about.I won't be requesting a refund or anything like that, mostly because I never have and don't want to go through the effort, but I doubt I will be playing this again until these issues are addressed. Yes yes early access blah blah, but not making sure your core gameplay mechanics are fully functional (or at least better alert your buyer that they are still undergoing development) is a downvote from me. The currently implemented features and functionality are done so poorly and there's no excuse for that. Regardless of my personal feelings on the matter, it's certainly not worth its hefty pricetag. Not yet, at least.somewhat related, why teach programming through visual methods like this, and then when they want to get into more serious, low-level stuff, they basically have to relearn everything? why not start with the text but with visual aids? that's just my hatred of visual programming though"

Some people need action, story, stuff to do, however this game just lets me relax with my imagination.  I thought the sandbox would just be a giant field but they spawned me on top of a mountain!  I fell into a gushing stream of water, ran from some strange creatures with teleport and accidentally casted onto this ball that pulled me in like gravity.  When I had the chance to look up there was a vast scenery to work with.  Boulders on tiny cliffs with what looks like giant roots that arc and bow in the distance.  Before I knew it it was night and I began to work with some fire spells that would light the scenery.  When I couldn't think of anything else to do I switched to water and flooded everything letting it carry me far as I split the water and sent shockwaves down the stream.  Finally I went to the arena to see the premade spells, I pulled rocks as I stood on top and slung them around.  If you can convince another friend to play with you this will almost surely be an amazing experirence.  I haven't figured everything about the spell making system, I know that you can use blocks or javascript.  I didn't see if you could import things that were already created.  Anyway I completely recommend this.  Even though it's early all I would really need to be more hooked on this game than any other is just add stuff to it which just takes time.  Finding some way that Dungeons and Dragons can be a part of this and create amazing scenarios in their sandbox would be a huge plus.Love the game keep up the good work!"

The only issue I have with it is there isn't enough to justify spending money on it.  It is a pretty neat trick to be able to write your own spells but there is no incentive to do so.  There is no mission,story,plot,survival, etc. so no reason to keep playing.  If the functionality of writing your own spells could be integrated into an RPG type of game it would, in my opinion, make this a better game.  Granted there are the 4 ""mission"" type mini games other than sandbox but that is still limited in scope.I'll continue to watch this game and if it becomes more than a tech demo, I'll be more willing to spend money on it."

Look up the term in wikipedia and see if the concept appeals to you. If you like to tinker with code and are studying or considering a future in programming you might want to give it a try.The game is at a VERY early stage, I feel at US$20 it is a little pricey for what you get, so you are more supporting the developers than buying a game. Steam sometimes offers discounts on games, so if you don't mind the wait you can add it to your wishlist and wait for a sale - which is what I did!Currently it's just a sandbox where you get to try out the exisiting spells and have a go at writing your own. The graphics are beautiful and the random map generation makes for some amazing landscapes. Performance on older machines may require you to turn the graphics settings down a bit, but it's OK.It uses Googles 'Blockly' code builder which I find an interesting way to write. (I am a experienced programmer with a background in C and Visual Basic). You can then look at the generated Javascript, or you can write in Javascript directly. (You cannot yet mix between them)Looking at the provided spells, making a copy and changing things to experiment is the best approach if you have never programmed before. The worst thing you can do is freeze the program (infinite loops and/or recursion are possible), requiring a task manager 'end program', but code is autosaved so nothing is lost.In the fantasy world (ie Harry Potter), becoming a Wizard/Witch usually requires years of study and practice (Hogwarts) and the most powerful Wizards/Witches are usually depicted as being very old (Dumbledore, McGonagall).In the real world, being a true 'Code Wizard/Witch' also will take lots of study and real-world experience, so don't be disappointed if you don't get instant results.

I'm not typically someone who takes chances on alpha games and usually don't bother to write reviews.That being said this game's concept is amazing, and if pulled off well, I would like it to become a staple of all magic games. As someone who loves magic in games, some part of me is always dissapointed when I find myself climbing a skill tree, looking around and seeing every other player doing the same. This game allows the gamer the opportunity to literaly create his/her own unique spells, forging one's own prefferences and style.  Even at alpha stages they have provided impressive diversity. It is obviously not perfect, but it's imperfections amount to little at this stage in it's development. Since everything is based off of code I even feel like I'm learning a little, but not to the point where it is like a lesson (though if I did study code I could probably kick butt in this game!).The number 1 thing new players will find defficient is the lack of any guidbook. Though it is said to be coming soon, you are thrown into the game with complex spell making based on coding and no manuel. At first this really anoyed me, I wanted instant understanding and the ability to craft mind-blowing spells! However it appeared I had to dissect the starting spells the game gave me to determine how they worked. As I said, I wasn't happy at first, but after trial and error for around a whole 20 minutes, I was rewarded with my first semi-original spell! Talk about feeling the rush and emersion in the game! The feeling of having worked and earned it, something being yours. Being able to use the spell and think of how you had put it together, how the idea had come to you! That is all worth it in my book.Conclusion: Good game. Not great yet, it's too early, but definately a project I would recomend supporting."

Be aware that at the moment this will only be fun to you if you like to engineer your own spells, since there isn´t much gameplay yet. There are four challenges and a sandbox mode.Where the game truly shines is, as expected, it´s ability to let you create spells. After 2.5 hours of getting to know the game I was able to create things like a spell where I aim at a point of land and a meteor shower (5 fireballs that explode) will come raining down after a short delay, a firelance that lets up a line of orbs that explode after a short delay, a bomb that bounces on impact and strikes a random nearby location, which it repeats until its mana is exhausted, a flooding spell, a spell to bring items it hits to me, etc.Can´t wait to see what people come up with once this game spreads a bit.TLDR:Get it if you want something unique that let´s you live out your creativity and engeniering skills and you aren´t afraid to learn a bit about logic connections, maybe read a few guides.Don´t get it if you are looking for a campaign or any kind of gameplay above a few simple challanges and a sandbox mode (yet) or if you aren´t willing or able to learn a few complicated mechanics."

This game has so much potential and the added style of code your own spells leads for some brilliant creations. This game could only be described as an original idea leading into the gaping awesomeness (Real word) of the steam creative community. A must buy for it will have untold outcomes and an amazing future.Also things I would like to see:-Workshop support to share spell packs-Spell packs to group your own spells-A more user friendly delete system (Refering to how scratch does it)-An option to use the proper code aswell as the BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) coding-Survival mode ( Possibly)-Head to head mode-A Construction system for building your wizardy lair-More ingame options and settings-An easier error system to help figure out where the error is in your code blocks-Just a creation mode where you don't have to load up the sandbox to make spellsI would go on but I'm sure the community would make this game amazing with it's ideas.10/10

I say this because the game is in a VERY early access alpha and there isn't much to do other than play and experiment with the few basic spells and effects that are implemented.I believe this game will be an incredibly powerful sandbox (and hopefully an awesome action/adventure game!) when it gets more fleshed out.  The idea of crafting spells through a visual language is both fun and rewarding.  You have to work to make your spells work, and that makes any spell you craft feel much more awesome than if you just made it with a predetermined effect.There is no tutorial and little documentation as of yet, so I reiterate strongly only buy this game if you are intrigued buy the idea.For more information, feel free to check out my first impression video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGoG5z-4-eQ"

This will be very long winded so read another review if you do not have the patience for long reviews! This game is in very early access, so i am impressed with how far it has got already. I have already created a few simple spells and though there is not much to it yet, there is enough to explore and enough content to have a few hours of entertainment with no trouble. The forums are very helpful, and if you are new to code, you can get spells from them to help you learn how to create your own. From what i have seen, the developers are very active, update the game often, and the development is very user-feedback centered, meaning all of your favourite features that you request have a good chance of being implemented. Anybody buying this game should definitely make an account on the forums where they are very helpful and there is no trash talking or any innapropriate comments whatsoever. But back to the game. It is fairly impressive graphics wise, and the physics do not take a supercomputer to run, which is good, as my computer is not great. In case anybody is interested i will put these at the bottom so that you can get an idea of how yours will run. The possibilities of what you can do with these spells is not literally endless, like the description says, but there is more than i care to discover. It would take thousands of hours of tinkering with JS or the blocks to discover them all and new code is being added all the time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has ever dreamed of being a wizard or liked skyrims spells but didnt like the lack of invention with the spells. You do not need any history of coding to learn this, especially with the forums.
