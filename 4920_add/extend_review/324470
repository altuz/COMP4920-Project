We talked for a bit about the game and what could be done to help, it, it's future and such. Let me state, the developer is a very kind guy, and this game is a very good game, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't intrigued me on first sight. The fact that he reached out to me personally should show he really does care about this game. The only reason I didn't like the game was because the controls felt a small bit slippery to me personally, but I've gotten word that that has been fixed, and I will definetely be rebuying it asap. If you enjoy games that are well made and made passionately (Or just good 3D platformers, like me) Then you should buy this, especially with the astronomically cheap price tag. Support this developer, he's one of the good ones.EDIT:My old review got some heavy downvotes, I'm guessing it's because the community really loves the game, so take that into account."

This game gives you such a rush jumping around at these amazing speeds. I cant really explain it, its the kind of thing you just need to experience. With multiple diffrent ways to finish each course it gives the game a competitive feel. You'll be trying to shave off those extra seconds to try and reach the top of the leaderboards on your favorite course.Visualy this game is stunning while the graphics are very minimalistic it is one of few examples of minimalism done very well in a game. The meticulous design of the levels leads to a mechanical and visual masterpiece. Not only will your eyes love this game but your ears will as well, the music is absolutely magnificent, even while failing a course over and over the music will keep you calm and mellow.I'm not usually a fan of Early Access but the game is so cheap and the devs seem to be very nice so far so I'm glad to support it in such a early state. If you have a few dollars sitting in your steam account I fully recommend getting this game."

,Recommended,324470,18738150,"Posted: 28 October, 2015",all,Blindlight,"A really stylish, pared-down bunnyhopping/parkour game. SinaRun reduces the complex mechanics of bhopping/surf mods to the bare essentials without sacrificing the sense of speed and difficulty. This one is more focused on intense, high speed runs with multiple lines than technical parkour obstacle courses. Although your speed is easily maxed out with the benefit of a sprint key, the game uses a unique timed-jump mechanic (length of press controls jump height/distance... kinda like a 3D flappy bird game on speed :P ). This leaves enough fine control to experiment with different lines and keep the skill-cap high enough so you can improve on your records. For this type of game, this is a brilliant compromise because it doesn't sacrifice the speed/flow for the sake of simplicity, and manages to scratch close to the same itch as notorious mods like Quake Defrag and CS surfing without the huge learning curve barrier. Still needs some tuning, bug fixes and more maps but for <3$ it's well worth checking out."

Let's start with presentation. There are typos everywhere, the music is all insufferably saddening with a certain track having literal tapping every few seconds just to anger you, the colors in some levels are awful with an example being a level with bright orange on top of even brighter orange so you can't see anything, and the levels all very much look the same. It is possible to do a minimalist style without looking super similar every stage.The gameplay is pretty bad too. Lets see, it's a first person platformer where you can't see your feet, so you can't judge how to land, you slide really far when you land, the controls are extremely touchy, speed is inconsistent, and there are often tiny gaps that you will fall between that you can't see because of the art style. Fantastic.I have no idea why this game has glowing reviews. It's incredibly poorly designed on all fronts. The thing is, it can be fixed with a few simple patches. Unfortunately, there's no way to see that without playing it. Refund requested."

This game as a LOT of pentential. It could be one of my favorite games...But sadly, the level design is way to hard. I played Mirror's edge to death getting every achievement for it (on Xbox), I SpeedRun DeadCore all the time, I even got in the top 10 fastest runs on the game, but this game...When you try to do a level fast, there's only one path you can take and there's only one way to take it. Everything from the speed at wich you get there, the number of milliseconds you pressed spacebar, to the orientation of your cursor has to be perfect to do the jump. The levels aren't open enough and the platforms are way to tiny. I don't mind dying a thousand time over a level, but I want to feel that I genuinly made a mistake and not that the game is punishing me for no reasons.There's an achievement about beating dev times on the levels... These dev times are not Mario Kart dev times or DeadCore dev times in the style of ""Our best time was 12.345 seconds... Let's make a 15 seconds dev time, so that way people have a chance to beat it."" Nope! I mean they could put their real time in I wouldn't mind, if the levels were open ended. Exemple: if a dev made the best run possible on road A and uploaded his time, that's good and pretty much unbeatable, but if you jump between road A, B and C to create road D, you can do it in 9.843 seconds! That's good design.My point is: So far, the game has an incredible core, but lacks polish. Keep the mechanics the same, but build better levels. Keep the insanity levels you have there, but build some more accecible levels too. That way, people won't finish tutorial saying: The control scheme looks kinda hard to get, but with the first level the game should let me experim- oh my god what the hell is this.Maybe after a couple of updates this review will change for a thumbs up.

For me it was extremely discouraging to keep landing on platforms, however just slide off and fall. I don't understand how other people find the game relaxing, as for me it was just frustrating and humiliating, trying over and over again and seeming to do nothing right. It's like you have no weight, and are just sliding around on.. butter, I guess. The jumping didn't seem very consistent, and neither did the sprinting. Another issue I seemed to have is that i would land on the edge of a platform, only to be pushed off despite me making it. I couldn't even get halfway through the first level. So, here are the pros and cons for me.Pros:-Nice music.-Simple and sleek graphics.Cons:-Wiggity jumping.-Platforms made of ice, butter, pure oil, I don't know.-No weight to you, it's like you're made of air.-Frustrating to no end.-Very dissapointed, becuase i thought I was going to enjoy this game.Sorry my review is so long, I just wanted to put in everything."

It's really fun trying to beat your highscore and seeing all the different creative ways to complete a level.It took me a good 30 minutes to an hour to get used to the fast speeds and sliding, but now I can complete levels very close to the time of those on the leaderboard. :DEDIT: and to those who wrote bad reviews about how the game is very slippery and you slide alot, that's just how the game is, and the sliding in my opinion, helps you complete the levels faster. You just need to know when to slow down in mid air and about to land that you don't slide off a platform."

I will say that much, but I also feel that there is a lot more room for content as there is a lack of levels and content become scarce after a few hours. You will try hard to complete each level, but trust me when I say it is difficult and you will slowly become bored after all the hundreds of attempts try to 			complete just one level. Now, I might be a noob and I wouldn’t be considered the best player at parkour games, but I’m certainly not the worst and I struggle to complete these levels. I think that in the future workshop support should be added, and that should fill the emptiness that I can see in terms of level variety. All of the 		menus look nice enough, but I think the main aspect letting this factor down for the game is most definitely lack of modes and maps. Multiplayer for this game is available, but the community is very quiet so finding someone to play with is very difficult. Adding a workshop feature to the game would improve this situation, and mean 	that potentially more people would be playing the game; and community made maps.GraphicsNice*Graphics in this game are good, and models are clear and as nice as you would expect for these kind of games. However, I think that more models could be added, to improve the background and surrounding of the maps. At the moment they are a little bland and could use some variety in colour and shape. Currently, all the 	maps contain the same shapes in different sizes and positions, and with an addition of different colours and models, the overall gameplay could improve and I would be giving this factor a higher score.SoundDecent*Music in the game sounds like restaurant music, and I think that the genre doesn’t really suit the game and a faster pace track would be better suited. However, the music is good and is quite calming and relaxing. But the end line is that, the music really doesn’t fit the genre of the game, but I can undertsnad as to why this 	type of music has been used, and that is to relax the mood of the game - rather than keeping you on edge.ControlsOkay*Gamepads are supported but they don’t work well. This is stated on the menu as it says ‘Keyboard & Mouse Highly Recommended’ and I feel that although they are not recommended, they should still work properly. I tried playing the game with a DUALSHOCK®3 controller and I was disappointed. I knew that I wouldn’t be 		able to properly enjoy the game, but I couldn’t move the player’s view quick enough, and so I couldn’t play the game at all. Even with sensitivity set to the highest, I still couldn’t play. Mouse & keyboard controls work absolutely fine, and I think that all of the different abilities are positioned in the correct place, to allow easy access on the keyboard. If you want to, then the game does give you the option to rebind controls giving the freedom to customize.OVERALL SCORENice**All scores can be found in the key at the top of the review"
,Not Recommended,324470,23054882,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,Holocene - Moving House,"SinaRun is a very fast paced jumping platformer where you try to beat levels as fast as possible. Having speedrun Portal 2 for almost 1,000hrs as well as lightly speedrunning Skyrim and Mirror's Edge I thought I’d love this game, but I was very disappointed.You barely have any control over your character and the turning is almost non-existent. I thought you would be able to strafe using a and d but sadly once you get going you are pretty much committed to going forwards. Trying to control the speed of your character is pretty tough and you get no feel of when you’re landing on platforms which makes timing the next jump difficult, not to mention how quickly to slide off of platforms once you hit them. I tried to fix this issue by attempting to rebind jump to mouse wheel but the game won't let you.Overall the game is more annoying then fun to be honest, I only managed to complete the tutorial and one main level which I died on around 50 times before finishing. Very disappointing as you need to be able to control your character precisely in order to complete levels effectively and you just don't get that level of character control."

Some of the ones you have are fantastic.- Fullscreen.- Jumping has a 1/4 second delay, which makes jumping very annoying and unresponsive.- You can't really stop your character once you get going. (Some people may like this, I personally don't.)- The time between falling off and respawning can be very long on some levels.I really hope some of these suggestions come to light, because I love some parts of the game and want more.

It soothes your soul as you approach the 200 deaths mark and allows you to keep on going trying to beat that time!Another great thing about this game is that you can see the dev's time for each of the levels, which shows you that the dev cares about this game and is pretty damn good at their own game! I can assure you as a new player it will be taking you quite a while before you can beat the dev's time let alone the #1 spot time!A couple of suggestions I would like to address to the dev:The game likes to switch from fullscreen back to windowed (an easy way to replicate this is to have it and then press ""Escape"" to bring up the options menu which will put it into a windowed state).Some keybinding options are not possible for instance binding ""Jump"" to ""Mouse 2"". I would love this due to all of the time I've put into KZ in CS where I either long jump with right click or regular jump with scroll down (I appreciate that jump cannot really be bound to scroll down as jumping in this game has a ""height on hold"" mechanic - although it would be an interesting addition if you did allow jump to be bound to Space/Mouse 2 and also have the possibility for scroll up/down to also be bound for minimum height jumps! Just an idea!)I've noticed that ""crosshair"" is a toggleable option in this game. I think it would be fantastic if it is possible to customise this crosshair. Resize/re-shape etc similar to the sort of crosshair customisation you can find in CS:GO.Another thing I would like to see added is the option for jumping sounds (probably footstep/landing sounds also) and I'm sure any Quake or CS player would also love this to be added. I understand if you wouldn't want to add this to the minimalistic theme of the game, however jumping sounds is just so iconic to these games it would be difficult to not suggest.Now for something you absolutely should NOT add - a replay/ghost replay mechanic of the top times on the leaderboard. It would absolutely destroy the magic of this game, figuring out for yourself the most efficient way to set the fastest times with what you have at your disposal.I would also like to thank Princesseuh for making a serious product and not making this one of those cheap ""rage games"" that you find a lot of famous YouTubers playing just to overreact and scream at in order to attract views. Thanks for keeping this classy.Now with all that said and done it's time to try and beat my 13.214 record on Wandered Hideout (watchout Princesseuh I'm coming for you!)Update: 12.201 record now :) Princesseuh you got some catching up to do :)P.S.

,Not Recommended,324470,18707357,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,Starz,Don't buy this game. The platforms you jump on to continue to jump aren't even spaced correctly so you can't get momentum and continue to jump. Needs a lot of updating and patching for it to be better. I put a request in for a refund.

The diffrence between this and gravilon is that this game fixes all the faults gravilon had and added a few more featured that couldn't have worked there. The controls remind me of when I used to surf in source engine games as the controls are lofty and the platforms are Icy. This Isn't a game you play to complete its a game you enjoy, the music fitted every level and its creative. Sure I only have .5 hours in this game while Im writing this review but Ill be glad to play more and get better and this minimalist platformer."

I like the fact that most levels are relatively easy to complete but to get fast times on them takes time and practice. The soundtrack is amazing and is perfect for calming you down after falling off at the last platform. Also the developer joined my friend and I's lobby and talked to us about the game and our opinions. The developer is nice and seems to want to keep updating the game and making it better. So overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys slightly rage inducing, platforming games and is definitely worth the price."

,Recommended,324470,20902571,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,▐ Felah▐,"This game has the most simplest mechanics and minimalistic graphics, yet this is one of the most challenging platformer game I've played. I like how this game made it easy to learn how to jump and get through levels, since the training mode lets you go through any selected level and let's you set restore points in case you're not very good at/not used to the game. I also like how if you're the competitive type, you can always try to get in the top of the leaderbaords, and if you succeed in doing so, maybe actually feel good for something you've done in your life for once.In short, here are the things I liked most:Amazing soundtrackEfficient training modePass levels at your own paceMaximum overdrive while holding shiftOverall, I give this game 9/10. The only reason that I rated it as I did is that I can't seem to ever find a multiplayer server, or it may be that I just can't get it to work.I recommend this if you like going fast or if you simply like jumping a lot. It's a nice game"

I bought it and started playing. The first thing that came to my mind was ""Nice music!"". When I started actually playing I noticed that the controlls are slippery. But I thought (and still think) it is something unique from this game and I wanted to get better. I only wanted to play a couple minutes but then I had so much fun that I played for 2 hours straight. I tested every map and although I didn't finish every map I found ways to ""finish"" the first half of some maps very fast. I am normally a very angry player and I scream really loud and annoying but this game didn't make me scream or punch something in my room. It made me calm down with its music and minimalistic / simple style after I got really angry at LoL. I died like 300 times on the first map and it didn't make me angry, not even a little bit. As I played, my ""skills"" improved and I could control the character better, even though it was still slippery. After these 2 hours I completely forgot the game and I got angry more often. After it got a patch today I noticed it and played again. It had the same effects on me like the first time.The game has been patched several times and it is less slippery, has controller support, bugs were fixed, I think one map was removed or got moved (one from the experimental ones), etc. Although I understand negative reviews that have clear pros and cons, I don't understand people who just play it for 5 minutes and then return it. If these people that were complaining about the slippery controlls, no controller support or other things would have just waited a bit, they may be happy with the game it is today and/or will be. There are reviews about the game one day (ONE DAY) after the release of the Early Access version, that are complaining about these things and refunded the game. But it's their decision and I don't think that they will change their mind because of a review :)tl;dr I think this game is much fun and you should just take your time to get better or at least play it some time before refunding it or write a review on it. The dev is also a pretty nice guy :). The only things I think are missing, are the soundtracks available for purchase and the Steam Workshop but I think this is either in progress or will be in the final version :D ."
