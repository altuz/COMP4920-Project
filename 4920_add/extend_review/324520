A rare, challenging TD!+ No major bugs.(Encountered only 1 tiny bug where mines disappear after loading.  But we're supposed to build up skills and let them get more powerful over time anyway.  Zooming out can be a pain.)+ Many towers and skills to deploy later on.+ Many enemy types.+ Graphic + music fit well.+ Other say the maps can be too long.  I disagree, as we need numerous enemies to build bigger arsenals.  Mix & match.+ Forgot to add... There's a reload button for each level.  Very thankful for this feature.- Very, very hard.  This turns many players off.  There's an 'easy' mode.  And upgrading best towers can take 20secs or more; requires strategy.- No descriptions for towers/skills.  Have to experiment!!! >_<? Others say it doesn't take full screen.  It happens only to me for 1 map, that's because it's a long, vertical map.  Not because it's designed for mobiles / tablets.  However, I feel buttons could be smaller, with helpful descriptions.7.5/10an immersive and challenging TD game overall.  Just not a smooth experience for the first few hours.  I'm addicted once I learnt how towers/skills work."

76561198138016967,Recommended,324520,30348877,Posted: 5 March,all,Lieu7enan7Dan,"Played the prior two versions of this game as well. Gameplay is very similar (not a lot of innovation in terms of how you deal with enemies) but still worth a buy and a fun game. The new graphics are outstanding, as well as some new enemy and weapon types. Most of the maps are pretty good. The hexagonal one is not a good design IMO because of how much you have to jump around to activate weapons as you get into later rounds. Too much mouse movement to make quick changes.The only big issue I have with this game is a long-standing one: the manner in which enemy vehicles can ""pile up"" within one another. Would much rather see the vehicles obey simple real-world laws like not being able to merge with other vehicles, pushing vehicles off the road if they run into them, while being tougher to kill individually if necessary. It seems like the developer chose this path because given current settings it would be too easy to kill vehicles if they didn't pile up. Better to just make it more realistic and the vehicles tougher to kill (perhaps by slowing the rate at which you can level up the weapons.Request: in addition to more maps (more snow / ice maps please), maybe add some cool extras for the home team like drones you can send out, or demolition teams that sabotage the road, something like that. New element to the game dynamic. If the enemy can have troops why not the home team? Would be cool. Even if just selecting a target and action."

There are 4 difficulty levels, but the 2nd (called ""Normal"") is so hard, that I don't know how""Hard"" or even ""Nightmare"" should be beatable. Wished, it had a more reasonable difficulty, ""Normal"" means to me, that it should be beatable without too many tricks."

I'm playing on easy settings as I always want to finish the game on easy with gold stars for all levels. That was until I played Defense Zone 3 Ultra HD.Level 3 on easy and I can't beat the super tanks at the end. Kind of feel duped considering that level takes over and hour to complete. Sheesh give me a break already. I shudder to think what these levels will be like with normal settings let alone nightmare?The game itself is truly awesome, it always has been from its first inception. Addictive, and heaps of fun. Challenging and frustrating at times too.If you want a game that is easy to play, yet near impossible to master, this is your worst nightmare come to life lol.I can't reccomend this game highly enough if you are into Tower Defense style games. 10/10 and some!"

If the difficulty level EASY is actually EASY then I would like to know if the difficulty level NIGHTMARE can actually be played.   The EASY level is a JOKE.  Too many games seem to have the difficulty levels all screwed up.  Let the more difficult levels be totally insane if you want to do that but at least give the casual player a fighting chance with the EASY level.  I can't even play past the 6th level."

76561197996136667,Recommended,324520,34230983,Posted: 14 August,all,SWCarter,"Defense Zone 3 is a standard tower defense game.  Enemies try to cross the map (usually with numerous paths available to them), and you try to stop them by building and upgrading defensive towers, and by using a handful of special attacks (like mines and aerial strikes).  You can only place towers in special build areas, and these build areas don't include the paths enemies take, so you can't adjust their routes in any way.  Towers include things like machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and howitzers.  Enemies include ground forces (soldiers, tanks, and mechs), air forces (a variety of planes), and even ships (but only on a few of the maps).The main strategy for the enemy is to throw a horde of enemies at you in 30 or more waves.  The sheer number of enemies involved mean that the missions tend to take well over an hour to complete, even if you use one of the fast forward options to speed up the action.  Luckily, the game saves your progress at the start of every wave, so if a wave goes poorly, you can repeat it without losing anything.I found the game to be reasonably tough even on the ""normal"" setting.  But there are also ""hard"" and ""nightmare"" settings if you want something more difficult.  Sort of annoyingly, you don't get credit for completing the easier settings when winning one of the tougher settings, so you have to play each of the 15 available missions four times to earn all of the achievements.This was my first Defense Zone game, and I was sort of iffy about it.  There isn't anything really creative about the game.  It's just a horde of enemies in each mission, and once you figure out how to deal with them, the same strategies work all the time.  If Steam had a ""sideways thumb"" option, I'd give it that, but since that's not available, and since the game is fully functional and priced favorably, I'm giving it a recommendation."

,Not Recommended,324520,29456558,Posted: 23 January,all,lolbyebois,"For a tower defense game it isn't that bad.  Theres a number of turrets that you need to know when to upgrade or set them down.  The difficulty curve on this game is pretty high, alot of experimentation is needed.  No descriptions on any of the turrets makes this more complicated then it needs to be.  Knowing statistics on enemies, turrets and number of spawns would really benefit this game.Should you get it?  Yeah if you really like TD games, but keep in mind that this one feels barebones.  Almost as though its missing alot of content to flesh this game out better.  Price is questionable keeping in mind every other TD game I've played.  Can't really recommend it to be honest, theres alot more TD Flash games from long ago that are better then this game."

The first impression I had was that the graphics seem to have downgraded a little compared to the second game, the soundtracks are awesome on the other hand, fit really well. The difficulty has been noticeably increased, but It would be nice if there were new towers because there haven't been any since the first game but instead we now get special weapons and new types of enemies, which is nice because the game is now more dynamic.

Everyone else should start with Defence Zone 2 first, then move onto this when you have mastered it.I am playing on hard mode at 4X speed, so the length of levels isn't a problem and the challenge is just right.Love that each sub-level within a map can be replayed, so if you make a wrong decision, you can rewind and re-think your strategy without having to start from scratch. The auto-hellfire when ready option is nice too.Really appreciate the new features, but would appreciate a guide to the settings and options within the game, I shouldn't have to work them out myself through trial and error.I loved all of the previous games in this series and this one picks up nicely after completing Defense Zone 2."
