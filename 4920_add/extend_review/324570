,Recommended,324570,15407459,"Posted: 16 April, 2015",all,Bizargh,"Firstly, a tip for the Music LoversIf you like the game's music, you can find the .OGG music files (Which can be opened & played by various free programs such as VLC Media Player & foobar, as well as free editors such as Audacity or Goldwave along with your standard commercial/professional editors like Sony Vegas) at the following directory:Your Storage Device (Usually C:) > Programs or Programs x86 > Steam > steamapps > common > HaloSpartanStrike >Data.Just simply copy-paste them where ever you wish, open them up in the chosen programs like VLC Media Player or foobar (Or even re-render them to a format of your choice should you be using editors like the previously mentioned examples), and enjoy the music by Tom Salta, which I do also recommend considering the official soundtrack release, as there's plenty of music not featured in the game such as ""Epic Evolution Reborn"" or ""Spartan Strike"" that will be sure to provide a good listen!My ReviewThere's not really a lot to say about this game at all.Basically, it's justHalo: Spartan AssaultNo. 2. Very little has changed. Same controls, same key-bindings (With the Pause, Fire & Alt-Fire still locked just as they were inHalo: Spartan Assault) same mission structure, same narrative style, but thankfully an improved UI. The differences & additions are very few. But in truth, there was little expectation of it to be so, nor any effort to make us believe as such. And being a game that's just above half the price of it's official soundtrack album, it's cheap & cheerful fun that will occupy you for 2-4hrs.If you had fun withHalo: Spartan Assaultshooting lots of bad guys to achieve a highest score, this will not fail to satisfy. If you've played neither, you can pick them up together in a bundle, which I recommend you do to save yourself even more money.It's a twin-stick shooter that surprisingly inherits the combat of the coreHaloshooters very well, and while it isn't anything noteworthy or something I'd consider highly recommendable, it's performance is solid & undemanding, it doesn't demand your time nor leaves a large hole in your wallet."
,Recommended,324570,15408689,"Posted: 16 April, 2015",all,Shingi025,"I think the decision to buy this game pretty much boils down to three questions, if you're on the fence.1.) Do you like the Halo franchise?2.) Did you enjoy Spartan Assault?3.) Do you mind playing more of the same, with some new content and a fresh coat of paint?Of course, it's not always that simple. Spartan Strike might appeal to people who haven't played much of the Halo franchise, sure. The gameplay is basic, but satisfying. Thanks to the 'Skull' system in this and its predecessor, you can custom-tailor your difficulty to a degree, as well as limitedly changing up a some of the gameplay mechanics.If you're looking at the game from a value standpoint, my opinion is that it's worth the money... if the gameplay is your cup of tea. I haven't finished the game yet, but I can tell it's most likely going to be short. I don't have a problem with that, considering the reasonable price tag. Honestly, $6 feels like a sale price already, especially considering that the aforementioned Skulls can add some challenge and a bit of replayability.Now, for fans of Halo, this game succeeds in capturing a bit more of the large scale feel of the previous Halo games a lot better than Spartan Assault, at least in the beginning. That doesn't mean it's got huge levels with divergent paths and a whole lot of room for creativity in your runs, it just means that the actual scale of things is better. There are background events you can pay attention to going on above or below your field of play; the second level even had the huge bridge from Halo 2 down below, with what I assume to be Master Chief in a Scorpion tank blowing up Ghosts. It was a nice touch.I can't speak for the state of the port. Honestly, I haven't had any issues playing the game. The game looks reasonably pretty, though I might not be the best metric for that. I thought Dark Souls I looked good on PC. Performance is solid, even on my relatively low-end PC, but that's to be expected from what's basically a side-by-side PC and mobile game. Luckily, there aren't any of the microtransactions the mobile version undoubtedly has, which is always refreshing.All in all, I'm enjoying my time with Spartan Strike. If you like Halo and don't mind a bit of rehashing, give this game a try. Then again, if you like Halo, you have to have a pretty good tolerance for rehashing. If you like twin-stick shooters, this is a pretty decent one."

,Recommended,324570,23010975,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,ownosourus,"Right from the landmark battle aboard the UNSC Pillar of Autumn, the Halo franchise has almost always been a team effort, even though Master Chief has done most of the heavy lifting in the mainline series. That's where all the spin-offs and novels come in. As the follow-up to Vanguard Games' Halo: Spartan Assault, Halo: Spartan Strike is not only a spin-off, but also a top-down shooter that reinforces the notion that Halo need not be limited to the first-person perspective. From a continuity standpoint, Spartan Strike takes bigger risks than Spartan Assault, setting reprisals from Halo 2 while giving more screen time to the Prometheans, who weren't introduced to the series until Halo 4.Spartan Strike's bite-sized five-minute missions fit in well with a straightforward story involving the Artifact of Doom plot device. In this case, the artifact is called the Conduit, a device that functions as a Promethean portal key. It is also a tried and tested sci-fi term that has been used in Mass Effect, Dead Space, and as the title of a Sega-published first-person shooter. Through much of Spartan Strike, the Conduit is subjected to a football-like change of hands between the UNSC Marine Corps and the Covenant.Equally engaging is the opportunity to revisit familiar areas from the main series. In Halo 2, New Mombasa was a war-torn battleground where Master Chief was just one of countless soldiers tasked to repel the Covenant. The raised visual perspective of Spartan Strike shows off New Mombasa as a highly vertical metropolis. While you're guiding a Spartan-IV along a commercial district in the foreground, UNSC troops are holding their own on a bridge in the background, hundreds of yards away. Although your player-character functions like a one-man army, nothing detracts from the implied accomplishments of the soldiers in the surrounding areas. Conversely, the location shift to Gamma Halo (also known as Installation 03) is a less engrossing environment, as, for the most part, it's a generic jungle accented with Forerunner architecture.In terms of the general control scheme of Halo: Spartan Strike they are pretty much identical to Spartan Assault. The only changes worth mentioning have to do with the responsiveness of the controls. In Assault, I found vehicle controls to be a bit of a chore, as it was a little tough to simultaneously pilot and aim the weapons. However Spartan Strike seems to have made some minor adjustments that have lead to an improved experience in terms of vehicle controls. I’m glad they succeeded in this area, because Spartan Strike throws a lot more vehicle based combat at you at a faster and earlier pace than Assault did.Speaking of general changes, Spartan Strike also makes some significant changes to the credit/weapon upgrade system. Both games have an arcade-ish system of weapon prep prior to the start of any mission. Players can expend credits to upgrade the default weapons and power-ups for any mission. Credits can also be spent on damage and score power-ups, which is important because players earn said credits by achieving high scores (complete with a three ‘star’ system) and hitting level-based objectives (such as killing  a certain number of enemies with a particular type of weapon). The big catch is that any weapon or upgrade purchased applies only for that next mission playthrough, meaning that players should probably think about how much they want to spend on what mission.Players can also apply difficulty ‘Skulls’ (a throwback to gameplay modifiers that can be found in other Halo games) to increase the percentage of credits earned at the expense of making the game more difficult. The Skull system is particularly important in these games because it’s really the only way one can tailor difficulty, as there are no general difficulty levels to choose from. I also think it works well in the Halo: Spartan games in general because the missions aren’t particularly lengthy, so it’s cool to customize difficulty and if it's too onerous, it’s not a big deal to restart and try a different combination.Getting back to the Spartan Strike improvements, the amount of credits earned in each mission, as well as the cost for weapons, has seen a significant reduction when compared to its predecessor. In addition, the first six missions are relatively easy to earn lots of credits on without upgrading your hero which means by the time the difficulty gets tough, you should have a decent batch of currency available to customize your weapons and power-ups. There are also some pretty cool weapons you can upgrade to, such as the Spartan Laser and Rocket Launcher.The biggest improvement I think Spartan Strike brings to the table is its greater emphasis on narrative-based gameplay throughout the missions. Spartan Assault had a habit of giving the player a general objective for a single mission and then letting them go at it. Spartan Strike feels like it has a more ‘dynamic’ flow in terms of the multitude of objective that can be found in any one mission. You might start out searching for a convoy, which then translates to an escort quest for said convoy while occasionally being interrupted to go on a fetch or switch quest, all of it accompanied by narrative that at least gives you a purpose for what you’re doing. It sounds like a small upgrade, but I feel it’s important for overall immersion and it certainly made me more invested in each mission.Another huge improvement is in terms of visuals. Spartan Assault looked pretty good for a two year old game but Spartan Strike blows it out of the water. Explosions look great, you can see enemies and allies fighting each other on different tiers in the backdrop, and everything just looks clear and crisp. Credit also goes to the great soundtrack, which captures the auditory feel of a Halo games very well.If I had to choose between Halo: Spartan Assault or Halo: Spartan Strike I’d pick the latter. It has a host of iterative improvements to the gameplay formula and looks and sounds excellent. However, both have a enough story immersion that I’d recommend picking up both for completion’s sake. Regardless, these are both two great dual stick shooters that are well worth a purchase."

,Recommended,324570,31031412,Posted: 8 April,all,Ezah,"Spartan Strike takes everything Spartan Assault did and does it better (as good sequels should). They added AoE indicators for where grenades would explode, targeting indicators for where you're currently aiming, plus one for movement for when in a vehicle. The Assault Ops got cleaned up so they are actually doable in a reasonable time, as well as shown right before a mission so that you know to try out during any given mission. A lot of weapons were added, armor mods were rebalanced so that they aren't stupidly overpowered, and a handful of new enemies were added as the Prometheans take center stage as the big threat of this chapter. They even added a narrator and did a very good job on making a story!The only issues I had were pretty nit picky. The narrator has a super dull monotone, and none of the Spartans have names, so it feels like you're just playing a clone that nobody cares about. Spartans Davis and Palmer from Assault, while not the Master Chief, were at least names to focus on that allowed you to understand what each individual person was going through in the game.Would I recommend this game? Absolutely! Game is fantastic, and I might even recommend it outside of the package with Spartan Assault, but the combo is too good to just buy one, and Assault is by no means a bad game. Pick it up now or stick it on the wishlist to wait for the summer sale, regardless this is a very good game to get."

Progress through another simulation program of finding and securing a forerunner artifact before the Covenant can use it. This sequel brings in everything you loved about Spartan Assault  with the addition of the Prometheans, their abilities, and their weapons. 5 campaigns of 6 missions each with a slightly more feasible gold star system than its predecessor and the vidmasters are actually somewhat challenging in this game as opposed to the walk through the level ones from the last game.

I feel like I’m playing an SNES game without a Game Genie.Difficulty is tough, and the game has no option to change this and no console commands to cheat this either.

,Recommended,324570,33036265,Posted: 30 June,all,Daniel Potter,"First of all, here is my review for the original game.http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/277430/I liked the game. It was a standard top down shooter, with a halo theme. The sounds felt adequate. Shooting enemies felt enjoyable. There is a heriarchy of various enemy types. Some were easy to kill, others were not, some were a few high threat. The gameplay felt seamless. Non-stop action and plenty of weapons to choose from. Overall it was fun, but there were a few drawbacks (which you can read about in the review above).This game is more of the same, with most of the drawbacks fixed. The major difference between this original and this game is that here you also fight the ""forerunners"". I haven't played halo games outside of halo 1 and 2, but i do know a thing or two about what has been happening to the franchise. Basically, in the original trilogy, you basically 2 other enemy factions to fight - the covenant and the flood. The reboot (Halo 4), introduced a new faction - the forerunner.In the original you only fight the covenant. In this game you fight both, but primarily the forerunners.Now, the game is pretty much the same thing. Except the levels became longer. There is at least a gurantee that they will last for 5 minutes. There are a total of 5 missions, each having 6 levels. It takes 3-4 hours.The scorpion (tank) controls were fixed too. Before, these controls were like this - imagine a dot in the center of your screen. Draw lines to the north, south, west, east, up to 8 directions. When you press W, you go north for example, relative to your screen. I hope you get the idea. It was very hard to control that thing. It's sort of strange because the same system is used for movement of your character, but it just doesn't work when using it on a tank.Now, pressing W goes forward relative to the direction your tank's front is facing. A and D rotate the tank. S makes it go backward.There is one problem with the game though. The 5 mission that the game has. There are only 4 really. The fifth one requires you to earn gold stars in the 4 missions before it to play it first. Personally i hate the concept of stars, and i think that the level should be accessible to all, regardless of the stars. I wouldn't mind if 1 mission would make up 5% of the game, but here it's 20%. They are locking away a pretty sizeable piece of content."

They did a good job of bringing a game type that's not seen so frequently nowadays and making it seem modern with great graphics and smooth mechanics. It's a very three-dimensional world for a top-down shooter, with a tactical edge even though the maneuvering is limited. The vehicles are cool, with the classic control someone controlling something driving system, just so it's different and not too easy. You can tell they wanted a small project they could bring to both PC and mobile, and yet they did a great job.However, it doesn't quite compare to Spartan Assault. You are either in cities or the jungle, reducing the alien/sci-fi atmosphere. The Covenant are not your main opponents after the first operation, which gives it nice variety. There are too many of the weak-but-lethal Promethians, though. Almost all the guns 1-hit kill the majority of the people you face. I love some of the new weapons (YEAH BATTLE RIFLE), but they're too overpowered. The game was much easier than Spartan Assault, only one level really frustrating me. Even the classic sit-in-turret-and-kill-suicide-grunts level was really easy. There were no challenging destroy-20-vehicles-with-a-magnum levels either. Besides, the whole story was a simulation. That kind of pales in light of the epic story of self-sacrifice in the first one.If you're looking for something new and fun, play Spartan Assault. If you don't bore of that (which you shouldn't!), definitely get this game."

I decided to immediately pick this up as soon as I saw it for sale, as I enjoyed the last game, Halo: Spartan Assault.Spartan Strike's story has you playing as an unnamed orange SPARTAN-IV, tasked with the goal of hunting down the Conduit, an ancient Forerunner object from the Covenant. The first part of the game takes place in a simulation of Battle of New Mombasa during the events of Halo 2, with the rest taking place after Halo 4. The story isn't anything special, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The gameplay remains the same from Spartan Assault, but with the additions of a new UNSC vehicle called the Kestrel, and the Prometheans as an alternative enemy to the Covenant. As with the Steam release of Spartan Assault, there are no microtransactions ingame, as additional weapons and abilities can be bought with ingame currency gained from completing missions. There is no multiplayer sadly, which is disappointing.  The music(composed by Tom Salta) is one of the best parts in this game, as it sounds closer to original trilogy's soundtrack compared to Halo 4's.If you enjoy the Halo franchise and/or like top down shooters, I recommend this game, especially at it's current price."

It may be but a meagre slice of the franchise that Microsoft is willing to give to the PC crowd, but even so, Spartan Strike and it's predecessor manage to feel like true Halo games thanks to their enemy, vehicle, and audio designs echoing the main entries in the Halo saga. The level design can at times be uninspired and unmemorable, but the addition of Promethean foes in Spartan Strike helps to mix up the gameplay throughout the fairly short campaign.

,Recommended,324570,19374308,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"At first, I thought of reviewing both Spartan Assault and Spartan Strike as one game, then noting their differences. The Twin-Stick shooter gameplay is similar to make you think that SS is the same as SA (which came first).However, after playing all of SA and 80% of SS, there is a subtle difference in how each game plays that may or may not to be to your liking: The mission structure in SA is less ""Halo"" than SS, which I think is to the game's benefit.It Plays Like Halo, And Suffers For itThe PC port for Halo: Spartan Strike (and Spartan Assault) is a mobile/tablet port for an isometric twin-stick shooter (made by the same guys who made Gatling Gears, Vanguard Entertainment).Almost all buttons can be remapped, save for the fire, the grenade and the pause button. Controller support is optional, and the keyboard and mouse controls are almost all perfect. The only lacking thing for controls are the vehicles. There are also simplistic options, nothing that is going to tax your computer.Importing the mechanics of the Halo franchise works, to my surprise, quite well for the genre change with some tweaks to how they all work. Along with some alterations to work within the new genre. For example, no reloading for weapons and the alterations to certain guns like the Spartan Laser's sustained fire.Some carry-overs from the Halo franchise: The two limit arsenal, the armor abilities, the Skull difficulty modifiers, the later addition of loadouts (which uses XP you earn in completing missions to unlock one-time weapon unlocks and other changes for your loadout), and the expanded arsenal and vehicles. (Yes, you can board them.)You'll fight both the Covenant from the original trilogy and the Prometheans of Halo 4. All of their AI acts exactly like how they would in the Halo games.Examples: Elites are more mobile, Grunts go on sucide runs, Brutes charge at you. Promethean Knights teleport when hurt and they try to rush at you. The droids around them can catch your grenades, ressurect fallen allies and shield some enemies.Honestly, I'm surprised they were able to impliment all of the AI abilities into this game so perfectly.(And the human AIs for your teammates are useful for once. Go figure.)The weaponry and the vehicles are much larger than in SA. You get the BR, the grenade launcher from Reach, the Warthog with remote turret controls, and a new vehicle called the Kestral (a human Ghost with grenade turrets). Most of the Halo staples are here and, again, all of them feel useful.Despite having a larger amount of weapons, their diversity is worse than in SS. Some of the human weapons are held back from you unless you happen to play a mission on a human settlement. You still have the rocket-launcher, the Spartan laser and the sniper rifle unlocks, but I'm surprised they didn't expand upon the unlock system. (Now it's Credits not XP.)As you would expect from a mobile game, your objective is to complete simple missions and to get the best raiting. In this game's case, beat the 5 to 10 min missions in the quickest time with the most flare. This is through the medal system from the Halo franchise, which fits in to providing an enjoyable experience.However, and the one thing I think will irritate players, is how the game plays more similar to the Halo campaigns. That means being sent backwards for an arbitrary reason you can't move forward, or having delays/changes to your objectives scripted for you.Campaign 1 of 5 (there are still 30 missions total) is the worst offender as the first-section of the game is padded with needless backtracking and showing off the fancier graphics and mechanics. Once you get past the first campaign, the next missions (2 to 4) feel more similar to SA.. But it still can suffer from changing the objective constantly in a scripted manner.Perhaps it's a personal preference, but if you're going to focus a mobile game on doing your best in the quickest time, you should have a simple objective with zero abitrary timers (unless if it's a holding-the-line mission). It feels as forced as the moments in Halo that pads its game out.Some Improvements/Regressions from Spartan AssaultThe narrative for Spartan Strike is as unimportant as Spartan Assault. Argubly even more pointless because you play events as a nameless Spartan who wasn't really there--it's just part of the simulation. However, this game does shed some light on the Conduit for Halo 4. (Not that it ever really bothered me to know more about that device.)Vehicles control vastly superior to SS. Now the controls are back to the Halo style movement of hold the forward button while turning with the other thumbstick (or A and D) and it looks smooth.For some reason the player now has a cursor for its direction, but the movement looks more stiff as a result. (Was that an issue to some people who couldn't tell where they were going?)While the gunplay is just as satisfying and more interesting with the larger loadout, I noticed far more delay on shooting with my mouse. (Sometimes punching would be the best way to fix it.) I didn't have this issue in Spartan Strike as often as I have experienced it here.As I mentioned before, the mission structure is almost the same, but because of those abitrary timers on your mission, when you fail an objective you'll quit far more because you'll have to sit through those scripted sections, again. Many times I would quit the mission and come back with a rocket-launcher to vent my frustration. It wouldn't be bad if there were checkpoints--optional--that would take off lots of points.Another huge change that I don't find useful to the type of game SA tried to be is the removal of the time-bonus feature. Now you have a base score, and your medal score. There is no incentive to rush through missions for a bonus surplus of points.Visual fidelity is obviously an improvement, and I wonder if this engine will be used for Halo Wars 2. (It looks good enough to work for that game.) And the environments look less samey as they were in SA. Plus, seeing other character do things in the background is a nice little attention to detail to make the battles feel more lively.Oh, and to unlock the final selection of missions, you have to earn gold stars on ALL the missions to unlock the final six. It's abitrary for all the wrong reasons and if you don't know that will extend your gametime.Needless to say, I am not a fan of how the final operation is unlocked--but it is simple to get over it without much stress.Save up credits for the score-booster, and you'll have no problem.Interested? Buy the BundleIf you are interested in these games, I would definitely recommend the bundle whether on a discount or full price. You'll get your money's worth together rather than paying for them individually.I would definitely say Spartan Assault is the better of the two games because the game plays similar enough to the Halo FPS series while making something new. Spartan Strike suffers from the same problems Halo missions can suffer from; abitrary restraints on the player.This problem is fine for a linear FPS with checkpoints, but for a mobile game with short missions, you'll find the abitrary mission objective changes the bane of your time. Not the brevity of the missions nor the simplicity of the genre."

Disfrute esta entrega porque yo nunca jugué contra los nuevos enemigos: los Prometheans, por lo tanto me hace sentir un poco más en contacto con la saga.En cuanto al título, lo considero mejor que su predecesor, Halo Spartan Assault, la jugabilidad sigue siendo la misma, con la excepción de que le fue añadido un vehículo UNSC (Kestrel), nuevos enemigos (Prometheans) con todo el arsenal de ellos. Las misiones fueron más difíciles que en las de Halo Spartan Assault, y los logros como los vidmaster challenges ya suponen un reto en el que uno tiene que batallar para poder desbloquearlos. Lo único que no me gustó es que la campaña es muy corta, un gamer casual lo podría pasar en 3 ó 4 horas, yo tengo registradas más de 15 por que me gusta desbloquear todos los logros.No se puede configurar la sensibilidad, así que tendrá que adaptarte.No está compatible para todas las resoluciones, no encontré la resolución nativa de mi monitor, pero no merma la forma en como se disfruta el juego, porque los gráficos son hermosos para un top view shooter.Y pues como es un top view shooter, es bueno para la presentación de este tipo de juegos, pero quiero destacar que se podría añadir un modo multijugador como en la versión para celular, y que hubiera misiones cooperativas como en Halo 2 y 3.

The graphics are great, colorful but not too colorful, and help make the levels a lot of fun. The story is whatever who cares. It's not like anyone doesn't know what Halo is already: in simple terms, humans vs aliens. A pretty good game and has plenty enough content to justify its $7 price. Especially since when you finish the game you can go back and gold star previous missions and when you get them all it unlocks a whole new scenario which is pretty cool.8/10 overall."

Like most mobile games the content can get a bit repeditive but unlike other mobile titles this gets repeditive before the sequal to the game and occurs between missions.due to how the game is set up you get dropped back at the level select screen about the time you start getting into a level. the missions are broken up into objectives and those local objectives are what the larger map is broken down into. I would almost expect that the entier playing area would be combined for PC users so there wouldn't be such a disconnect between areas. the game has an average play time of between 5-15 minuets before you are forcibly dropped to the menu by completing an objective.since this is a premium game it at least spares you the deluge of ads between levels so somehow subliminaly inserted into the playing fields. This game leaves a lot open to sequals or DLCs which should be relatively cheap if they are developed, however since thisisa mobile game the likely hood of DLCs coming out is low, you would almost certanly get hounded to simply buy the next game instead."

If you disliked the predecessor, you still might wanna pick this one up.Improvements/changes:-Assault Ops are easier and not as tedious-Easier to get gold stars-Pause button moved to top left corner (thank the gods for that)-Tank controll more intuitive (just press W to move and A/D to steer)-Statistics at the end of a mission-Assault Ops + progress before a mission-No time bonus-You get more CR per mission-Maps feel more natural ( you don't see much of the blue wall )-If you get into window mode (by accidentally tabbing out) the video setting will already be set to the current resolution, so you don't have to change it twice to get back to 1080p"

76561198097040414,Recommended,324570,20841437,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,ThunderWing1777,"I am admittedly an obsessed Halo fan, and to say the least this take on the franchise is interesting as it is satisfying.I remember when I played Halo Wars as the covenant teams, all I would do was give all my bases resource farms and use the Arbiter's super ability to single-handedly take on armies from the 3rd person perspective. But it made me want more. I felt that need to have the camera a tad bit closer to the player and the need to shoot something instead of slamming things to death. All the sudden, Halo spartan assault and strike come out, and BOOM! Problems solved, and more!I played spartan assault on the Xbox 360, but it just did'nt feel right, as it was'nt entirely built for such a huge screen. My biggest complaint about spartan assault was that the smooth grey color of palmer's armor blended in with the environment too easily, and I often lost track of where I was on screen. Plus, the weapon and vehicle varyiety was'nt too great. But now in spartan strike on steam, my f.o.v is closer, with a new character in neon orange that is easy to identify, as well as some new & creative introductions to weapons and vehicles.The Warthog we all love is back, and even better as you now control the gun from the driver seat, resulting in unique drive-and-shoot action that we've never realy seen before.The Kestrel VTOL is FINaLLY back!!1! I know what you're thinking, ""what? it's not 'back', this is completely new?"" well, little known fact that the Kestrel was a cut vehicle from Halo 2 that originally looked like a pelican with the same propellers that you see in the Kestrel from spartan strike. But this new kestrel is more like a UNSC take on the Ghost. Basically, give Halo 5's gungoose the levetating physics of a Ghost, and there's your Kestrel. This is by far one of my favorite vehicles in all the games. Just imagine how over-powered this 'grenade ghost' would be in one of the main games?Armor Abilities are still a thing, and dang are they better than ever! A pulse wave that damages enemies in an area around your location, the promethian timey-warpy-teleporty thing, and many more things that would be downright rediculous in Halo 4 or Reach. A new covenant trip-mine that gets up, levitates, and seeks it's target as if a needler shard. Now that just would'nt be fair in multiplayer, now would it? But that's what makes it so great, is that your fighting with all these guns & vehicles, but your armor ability can be life or death.Our old friends the promethians are back, not too different from how they where in Halo 4. Though that's nothing to complain about, because their weapons and abilities are more powerful and crazy than ever. They offer a decent challenge against you, and the weapns are just too much fun. The surpressor just tears things to peices, the binary rifle packs a punch, pulse grenades actually work, and the teleportation ability makes for a better escape than sprint or a jet pack can ever do.My main favorite thing about this, is that if you play this game and imagine it from a first person perspective, the level design and everything else about it feels just like any other Halo game. It honestly is a true Halo game on PC, but it's just viewed at a different angle.In conclusion I'd say this is another good game of this epic franchise, but that's not a bad thing. While most view this as a twist on what the game usually is, I'd say it's just as much of a seperate formula as Halo Wars and Halo 5 have been; not an extreme change, but just some good old variety on what we're used to so things don't get stale. (and not getting stale is what's important *coughcoughcallofdutycough*)"

,Recommended,324570,21547601,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,windycornertv,"Halo Spartan Strike is the sequel to 2013’s top down shooter Spartan Assault and recycles the same game play with only minor additions.Now if you missed Spartan Assault, here’s the deal. It’s a top down shooter with a twin stick control scheme. One stick moves the character while the other aims your weapon. You can shoot enemies, use melee attacks or lob a grenade. Plus  an array of different vehicles and gun turrents. Most of the arsenal and enemies were taken out of previous games, so fans of Halo should feel right at home with Spartan Strike. Although I would have appreciated if the developers had introduced some more stuff.The game play is very simple, but gives it that old school arcade charm. In fact dying sends you back to the beginning of the stage. The lack of checkpoints adds a level of intensity and challenge that’s missing from newer games. I really enjoyed the game because it just never seems to slow down. It’s constant ""boom"" ""boom"" with enemies coming from every side of the screen with no reloads to stop you from pulling the trigger. Strong pacing is constantly maintained by the game's variety in missions and weapons.The campaign is broken into 30 stages with the last 6 being unlocked after achieving a gold medal on every stage. It’s really refreshing to see a game giving incentive for repeat play as oppose to selling off levels as DLC. You also earn money that can be spent on power-ups. However the catch is they only last for one mission.Spartan Stikre is a very good looking game and remembers this thing called colour. I love all these little details that make it feel like you’re in the middle of a conflict. The orchestral music is top notch and the voice acting is solid. Cut-scenes are brief but look great when you consider the game’s low price point.In conclusion Spartan Strike is a fun, no thrills top down shooter that doesn’t bring anything new to the table. But manages to cook up 4 to 5 hours of solid action. At just six bucks this game offers a lot bang for your buck."

76561197981886905,Recommended,324570,21862033,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,TheMediator,"Pretty reasonable value - 6$ for 5-7 hours of gameplay. Very fun, fast paced, interesting combat scenarios. There is a degree of repetition in encounters but in general you'll run into a variety of novel situations and get to explore the sandbox of weapons, vehicles, and abilities. There's something in the neighborhood of ~25 weapons, ~7 vehicles and ~9 power ups; quite a variety for a ""cheap phone game"". All that said, the lack of co-op compared to the last game is a big minus, so beyond your initial experience you probably won't get much replay compared to the previous entry.If you're looking for a small diversion to tide you over for a couple days, it's worth the buy."
