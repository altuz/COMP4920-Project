I do not regret playing the game. But this is not a game I would say to someone ""yes, you should buy this and spend time playing it"".I bought this game and let's played it on the Geek Remix channel because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I cannot understand why everyone loved this game so much. It is just okay.Pros:-Cool game mechanics. Interesting use of rendering two environments and switching between them. Some of the puzzles were cool. None of them too challenging.-If you are the type of person who only cares about gameplay, you might enjoy this. Maybe. But the game is too short.-Female protagonist who is PoC.Cons:-Too short and yet at the same time too long. It's only 2-4 hours depending on how you play. By the end I was just wanting it to be over.-A lot of bugs. Sometimes cutscenes only start after .....???????? I stood in a room for a while walking around wondering what to do. Then suddenly the cutscene to progress the game started.-The story is not nearly as good as all the other reviews made it out to be. There were some refferences to the origional heroes series, and to the side projects of the heroes reboot. Nothing too amazing. Everything just felt like one of the weak episodes of a tv show. The whole game feels like a DLC.-Graphics were on the level of an early xbob 360 game. And yet this still somehow put a bit of a strain on my PC, that has 32 gigs of ram, an i7-4790, and a R9-290. Along with unusually long load screens for what seems like a low graphics game. I was playing on ""Epic"".Anyway i feel like i got my points across. It's just an overwhelming sense of ""that was okay i guess""."

Yeah i can sense it had a low budget, but this is a wonderful blend between Mirror's Edge, Singularity, TimeShift and Bioshock. This may be linear but I cant stop playing and messing with all the possibilities. Give this a chance, I guarantee you wont see combat like this anywhere else. I never write reviews but this one deserves attention."
,Recommended,324650,20623521,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,Shady Boots,"So final thoughts? Dayum, this is nice. And well worth the price, I must say. It LOOKS good, and it plays in a very unique way for a first person action game. The powers you get are loads of fun, and allows for variety in how you tackle enemy encounters. Certain parts of the platforming remind me a lot of Mirror's Edge, although it's not really quite parkour, at least not as intensive as the one in ME. And this is a small thing, but it's always refreshing in a first person game when you look down and are able to see the rest of your body rather than just empty space where it should be.I guess my only gripes are that it's really, really short. You can finish it within 3 hours, 2 if you're blitzing it, and the replay value is very little. I'm gonna play through it again to get some of the secrets I missed, sure, but once I've managed to 100% the achievements, that's pretty much it. Another thing is that I wish there were a few more...puzzle-like elements to the game. I feel like it would've been so much better if they mixed some puzzles or at least light puzzle elements into the game. Would have worked well with the powers at your disposal. The most you get is literally just a pressure plate, and that's it. Gurl please.Also another thing to add is, if you're hoping for some sort of good story with this game, you'd be disappointed. The story is really bland and uninteresting. The characters are all cardboard cutouts, and the dialogue can be very cringeworthy at times. Story-wise it's completely unremarkable, so if you ARE interested in getting this game, that's one thing to note. The gameplay is where you'll get the most out of it.But all in all I had a real blast with this game. I'd recommend it, but it's not a MUST play by any means."
,Not Recommended,324650,31912550,Posted: 22 May,all,Unabridged Gamer,"The thing you have to understand with Gemini: Heroes Reborn is that it contains some truly innovative, intriguing ideas. It combines the gameplay of Mirror's Edge, Singularity, and Psi-Ops to great effect. You can swap between two time periods at will, use telekinesis to throw objects and shield yourself, and you can bring time to a crawl. Unfortunately, these brilliant powers and gameplay ideas are wasted on a buggy, frustrating, limited game with a mediocre story and incredibly short run time.How short is it? I didn't finish the entire way through, but I was at Chapter 9 in less than two hours. That's... pretty fast. I've seen others take roughly four hours or so.How mediocre is the story? They devote several minutes in the opening just to establish basic character info that two to three lines of dialogue could summarize. Meanwhile, later on, protagonist Cassandra brushes off suddenly getting super powers like it's as average as finding you have a new pimple.How buggy and unpolished? I once ran past an in-game trigger without even trying, necessitating I run back the way I came just to activate it properly. Another time, an enemy in my grasp came with me into one time period after I warped out of the other. Getting the game to properly climb objects sometimes seems like a test of will more than anything else.I hate giving a thumbs down for this one. I really appreciate what the developers were going for, and with a bigger budget and more time, I bet they could have made it happen. As it is... get it on a sale if you're -really- curious. Otherwise, you're better off with other superhero and physics puzzler titles."

The enemies are somewhat unchallenging (at least on Normal), but the fights are still satisfying. The game is way too short, at less than 5 hours (but maybe add a few more for the find all secrets and throw 1000 things achievements), so it is only worth it on sale.I never cared for that old Heroes tv show, but fans will probably like the references found in this game.Oh yeh, another game that stupidly hardcodes the left/right arrow keys to view panning, even if assign them to moving.

There's just something really special about a game that lets you kill an armed guard by going back in time, grabbing a chair with your telekinetic powers, going forward in time and launching the chair at the guard. Alternatively, you can just launch a guard into the air repeatedly until the fall damage kills him. Massively entertaining."
,Not Recommended,324650,29120064,Posted: 8 January,all,Ultrasox,"I bought this because one of the giant bomb guys recommended it and it was on sale but I'm bored already. The mechanics are so clunky, half the time you hit a button and it just doesn't react. There is just no slickness to anything. Killing guys is basically stop their bullets, chuck them or something at them, and not a lot else. The travelling back in time and forward is fairly interesting, and the game had my attention at the beginning but it gets old very fast. I hate not completing games but I just didn't want to play this anymore. It's also quite ugly, despite being Unreal 4 and has all sorts of wierd bugs."

There are loads of glitches and bugs in it, the story is not only predictable, but also boring and unfortunately the gameplay consists at some point of ""kill enemies to find keys"". And the enemies never get smarter, only tankier, which eventually translates to you wasting more time on them. I needed 5 hours to complete the game and had to restart often because of glitches and took a long time with the more tankier enemies. Eventually I'd say it has a gametime of 3 - 4 hours, which is ridiculous. I wanted to like the game, but it's crap."
,Recommended,324650,33416861,Posted: 9 July,all,Mr. Matt,"Gemini: Heroes Reborn is a ""bridge"" between the Heroes TV show and the Heroes Reborn TV show. I watched the former and passed entirely on the latter because wow did the quality go in the crapper fast on Heroes. I loved Season 1, Season 2 was okay, and everything past that was pretty abysmal. Why then does this weird spin-off game that doesn't feature characters from the show have a positive rating? Well, it turns out the powers offer some surprisingly innovative gameplay. You get to use telekinesis to lift and throw enemies and objects, catch bullets and throw them back at baddies, slow time, look through time, travel between the same area in two time periods willy-nilly (which makes combat interesting at times), and...okay, so that's pretty much it, but it's surprisingly entertaining while it lasts.There are a handful of environmental puzzles where you need to use your powers to progress, and when you come upon enemies, you kill them all to ""get a keycard"" (you don't even walk over the bodies) to open the exit, and proceed to the next section of the level. The game features two heavily (and somewhat poorly) scripted boss fights, neither of which was all that fun, and it's pretty short. The brevity of the game is good, because it would have gotten old if the game had gone on any longer. The plot was so throw-away, and the dialog was cliche and cringe-worthy - more than you might even imagine.Some folks had glitches, so I'll add that the only glitches I ever encountered were funny physics stuff, like guards dying with their heads stuck in the ceiling and their bodies wildly twitching after death. Not a glitch, but I was shocked by the decision to not let the player shoot guns or physically attack anyone. You kill plenty of people using your powers, and can even throw bullets you catch with telekinesis back at enemies to kill them, but you cannot pick up a gun, punch, stab, kick, etc. It's a little annoying, but the powers are the real reason I was here anyway, so whatever. This is the epitome of a B game, with most everything being rather garbage, except it has curiously enjoyable powers that made me have a pretty good time playing it. Get it on sale for like $5.00, but otherwise, it would be overpriced for what it is.Oh, and your main character looks like she's cosplaying as Zoey from Left 4 Dead. It had to be said."

How did they manage to do a timetravel-telekinesis game based on a good meaty ""Heroes"" universe so mindnumbingly boring and dull? This is so... uninspiring to play. I'll try to go piece by piece here.Even if u have such cool things like timetravelling and telekinesis the gameplay itself is extremely cluncky. You are either doing pretty mediocre platforming/running from point A to point B or fighting stupid AI dummies. Four or five times across the game you are forced to solve time- or phisycs based puzzles. And that's it. There is no exploration in such a linear levels. And there is no depth in battles - the best strategy is to shove any throwable object into every single enemy up to 6 times (by using rightclick->hold-> leftclick again and again and again). There is no upgrade system - your abilities will become stronger after sertain points of the game (and you are reaching your maximum potential to have at least some kind of fun with your TK right before the last boss is coming).What did I miss here? Two (maybe three) KINDA boss battles are boring. Bonus collectibles are... kinda... meh... You are collecting random stuff that don't give you any kind of depth to this game's universe or main story plot . It is just... stuff.Ah, the plot. There is no real story here. Four or five cutscenes and a script shorter than this review. It is short, predictable and there is nothing positive I can say here. No strong characters, no unexpected plot twists. It is as generic and barebones story as it can be.What else? The graphics are mediocre and dated. And when the backgrounds can be nice from time to time NPC's models are terrible.The soundtrack is good. Both action and exploration sequences. I have zero claims here.Do not get me wrong here. This game definetly had potential. Time-swapping mechanic and time-vision are pretty cool on paper. Just imagine if you can slow the time flow and just destroy bunch of bad guys using your TK! Sounds cool but the realisation is... meh.And it is still 3 hours long game for 15 bucks.If you ever ever want to give this game a try wait for a huge sale."

At least that's what the desription and the trailers promised.The game starts with little to no exposition, there's no backstory, no nothing.Turns out it's a spin-off from some obscure TV show (I think you have to watch it to find out what's going on?), with 2000-era graphics (really, _Half Life 2_ looks better despite this being an Unreal Engine 4 game), buggy cutscenes, clunky game mechanics...How about them superpowers? Well, there's a look through time mechanic (uhh, what?) and a telekinesis mechanic (which you don't get at the outset). Other than that it's ""creep around and imagine you're in a stealth-type game"" thingy... so, not very heroic, and definitely not super.And, once you pass the initial run-jump-crouch tutorial, you get the ""look through time... or travel trough time mechanic, we did not really decide on that, sorry"", which allows you to see into a different point in time through a ""window"" - which obscures your field of vision. And then you suddely run into an armed guard in an otherwise empty building, who then proceeds to blast your face with a shotgun, with no hope of retaliation from you, because you cnat even throw a weak punch in attepmt to defend your life at least somehow.I exited and unistalled the game then and there.It's a waste of money, I spent a lot of time getting around to play it, so now I have no chance of getting my money back.My advice is simple: Do. Not. Buy."

,Not Recommended,324650,34240323,Posted: 14 August,all,Kyrii,"Games like these make we wish I could give more then two rating options.Browsing the Steam store one day brought this little game to my attention but at first I was disinterested. I only have a passing knowledge of “Heroes” but I was aware of it’s rather devote fanbase. What sold me was “Telekinetic Powers” coupled with the game promo featuring a lady throwing a tactical cop through the air. Instantly I got vibrant flashbacks to Psi-Op’s and Second Sight on my OG Xbox way back in 2004. So obviously, I got rather excited and bought the game impulsively.And for what it’s worth, I’m not guilty of that quick purchase.The game itself starts off like Mirrors Edge but quickly descends into the action. Firearms are oddly a no go but you are still fully capable of cracking skulls with crates and setting off explosive barrels en masse. A feature that honestly took me by surprise was the time-travel mechanic! Every level has two time-periods that you can jump back and forth from at almost every point in the game. This can be used to reach secret area’s, unreachable goals and even get the drop on enemies! You can drag objects and even people from each time period and use them against your foes or to progress, and honestly, it’s very fun and feels very engaging when you pull off a really slick series of counter-attacks against heavily armed enemies without even taking a hit!However, this enjoyment is brought down by a flurry of cons.The game itself is very prone to breaking. Bugs are persistent and I’ve even had times where scripted events failed to launch despite me going down the base path. This is something I expect from no-clipping through a half-life mod, not following the designated path in a play-tested game!The voice acting itself is alright, even good, but it’s marred by some uneven writing. Occasionally it’s alright and suits the mood but other times it’s just odd and even cringe-inducing. The main character herself is initially shocked at her powers but quickly grows used to it, like gaining impossible telekinesis is the equivalent of catching a 20 dollar bill in a gust of wind.Enemies are also initially fun to fight but some are just a chore. The rocket-launcher dude slows the game down to a crawl one-on-one and only gets hair-raising with multiple foes to deal with. Just catch his missiles and throw them back like it’s baseball practice.And above all, the game is VERY short! I mean, that’s good for me this summer because of my work schedule but I have to say, I’d feel ripped off if I didn’t buy this on sale! I went out of my way to gather all collectibles, search every nook and cranny, even screw around with the majority of the objects in the environment, hell, I even went AFK to eat dinner and I still only clocked in around 5+ hours! 16 levels feel overwhelming initially but some go by in the blink of an eye!I mean, this is a budget game that initially started on mobile devices, it’s not a bad looking game by any means and it’s very interactive despite it’s small dev team and resources, but I can’t by any means recommend this.The combat can be very fun when it all comes together nicely and is more interactive then some AAA games I’ve played recently and I’m not going to deny the fun I had, but with all it’s cons It’s seriously not worth the full asking price.Maybe one day we’ll get the Psi-Op’s sequel this world desperately needs, because despite the short glimpses of genius this game had, it’s certainly not on par."

The graphics are pretty nice, and the 'puzzles' are usually implemented well, with variety all throughout the game.When it comes to combat, you have a lot of options between the protagonist's different powers, not to mention that you can use the environment to your advantage. Considering that this was clearly a low budget game, the development team really spun this game's combat mechanics to its full potential.Cons: the dialogue can seem a bit flate at times, and it's a little bit short compared to 15 euro - good thing that it's currently on sale for 10 :)Sometimes the cutscenes seemed a bit random, and at tmes I'd be left in a room thinking 'So, what now?"" and waited for a minute or 2 before the objective became clear to me.I Would definitely recommend this game, especially if you're a fan of the series!"

But 36 Secrets (found 2 so far)?I dont normally write reviews but since last November I'm now heavily relying on Reviews for my purchases.First of all, this game is off the Unreal4 Engine. This alone is almost a no brainer LOL I believe Unreal4 is the latest and greatest in technology with future enhancements (for engines)Secondly yes, like others have pointed out; its kinda like Mirrors Edge with some Singularity involved (time warp).This game could get some improvements yes, but if this is an indication for a possible future game then lets give them the money :)Havent beaten it yet (100minutes)  story has me puzzled, very intriguing but yet these levels we are doing are very short.8/10"
,Recommended,324650,20715733,"Posted: 23 January, 2016",all,Roahn,"Follow my Curator GrouphereTitle: Gemini: Heroes RebornPlatform: Windows, Xbox One, PS4 (January 29th)Rating: Not RatedDeveloper: Phosphor GamesPublisher: Phosphor GamesPrice: $15Release Date: 19/1/16Gemini: Heroes Reborn is a first person action game based in the Heroes universe. It is a short game telling the story of Cassandra, a young adult who is looking for her parents in this world that sort-of reminded me of Infamous as it has people with superpowers and villains trying to capture and ‘research’ them.The thing that makes this game different from the others is its unique gameplay. You can parkour anywhere as Cassandra, even though the levels are limited and I would’ve enjoyed some more parkour areas. But for most of the time you will be fighting people with its combat system which you can kill enemies in many ways. You can pause time and run, grab objects and throw them, or use a combination of some or all of them to make a combat system that is very unique and interesting. Definitely how you can use this system with the environment.The levels are well created too and while in the middle part of the game it does start to seem recycled and boring, it soon becomes fun again with new powers and upgraded abilities.The soundtrack doesn’t do much and is pretty repetitive with its electro tone as I could’ve used for some more variety but just like the music, the levels are pretty repetitive and while Cassandra jumps through time to see the huge modern buildings of 2008 to the ruined old buildings covered with moss of 2014, it still isn’t enough variety. Luckily the game is short enough to still make me enjoy it and is costed fairly for its length.But the main problem with this game is its story. The voice acting is terrible with the moments when I’m meant to feel sad about a character ended up making me cringe and even some bits where the gameplay and story don’t tie in together. Plus the story is awfully predictable with all characters just being stereotypical and boring.The graphics though, are done very well and look amazing, this is the first game I’ve played on Unreal Engine 4 and while I have heard that other people have had a couple issues with the game, I have had none performance wise. Although there were a couple times I had to restart from a checkpoint because an objective marker would not show up.While the story and soundtrack completely sucks, by the time I finished the game I knew that it still deserved a positive review. And that’s because of the gameplay. It completely saves the game and makes it a must play to people who enjoy high tense action games, even though there are obvious flaws.We give this game 3.5/5."

It's very short, less than 3 hours and you can finish the story, but it's great if you buy it at a good price."

,Not Recommended,324650,24721601,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Gabi,"Release on PC, played by few and abandoned by the devs and that last point is the main issue. Bubbeling underneath this game are some promising mechanics that with some better level design, some fleshing out and polishing could have lead to an amazing game. However the game was clearly rushed through production to get a release soon enough after the tv show it was related to was cancelled to not be entirely irrelevant.Graphically the game is sub par, likewise the voice acting and sound in general simply does nothing to draw and beyond the average sound effects the sound work is lower then I woulkd expect from such a release. Especially how they push the sound of character tos your left entirely to the left hand side of your sound system and similar.The story is terrible, and the characters completely forgetable, but at its core there is some gameplay value. Which whilst it never feels fleshed out remains entertaining enough. However with all the negatives present and its extremely small amount of content the only time I could recommend this is once it is on a steep discount (think 75% off or more). It isn't terrible, but it misses the numerous opportunities it has to be something special and is just okay but overpriced for its length and quality."

The game mechanics kept me playing.  Slowing time, using telekinesis to use enemies as a human shield and launching enemies, catching bullets and sending them back, etc.  Its worth a single playthrough.  In the hands of the right development team it could be made into a work of art."

,Recommended,324650,33438238,Posted: 10 July,all,Bob,"So apparently this, together with a mobile game I’ve never played, is a prequel to some random TV series I’ve never seen. However don’t let that put you off it holds up well on its own. I suspect that some of the names and events referenced probably mean more if you are a fan of the series but nothing is critical to the game’s story.You play as a woman dressed a Zoë from Left 4 Dead investigating an abandoned facility trying to find information about your family when you discover you have super powers.I really enjoyed the game mechanics. You have the ability to switch between 2 time periods which is used both in combat and for navigating round obstacles that are in the different time periods. You can also see through to the other time period which gives it a feel reminiscent of the tears in Bioshock Infinite. She then straight up injects herself with a syringe of Adam to gain telekinesis. These powers can be used to throw things at opponents and catch projectiles. Then to top this off you get the power to slow down time which enables to jump further. Altogether these make for really enjoyable combat.A lot of other people have mentioned bugs but I played through the entire game without encountering any. Only on my second play through did I find a find a couple.The game is relatively short, there are some great ideas in this game but it feels like it would have had more opportunities to fulfil its potential if it had been longer. However the combat mechanics make up for that and make this game well worth playing in my opinion."
