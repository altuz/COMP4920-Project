Your enemy hates insects? Make a whole army of them. Hates bees? Why not enlarge them? Piranhas? Snakes? Why not fused together?This game is pretty much 'create your own unit' type of RTS. It has its own campaign, you can play online and with friends (or against). It may be old but that doesn't mean it can't be fun."

All of its mods and expansion, reworked the game so it can run on Windows 7 and up, multiplayer, you name it. For those who haven't played this game before, long story short its a RTS game where you get to make your own units from mishmashing animal DNA you get as you play the game, be it a Horneceros, Crocorilla, or go full Wizard of Oz and make a bunch of Flying Baboons. Their strength and weakness depends on which body part of the parent animal you use on your monstrosity, you can make them amphibious, have opposeable thumb, winged but no-legs, spit poison, the sky is (literally) the limit in this game.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes unorthodox RTS or at least have played some of the older RTS titles like Rise of Nations, Generals, AoE and AoM. It might be hard to pick up the first time around, but after you get used to the unique gameplay and manage to find a good combination of limbs and body parts for your creature you will start to have a blast.PS : If you wish to play the tutorial and campaign, select IC in the Mod Selection option on the Title Menu screen."

I actually interrupted Fallout 4 day 2 to install and make sure this was working when I saw it.  I loved this game with an unholy passion and from my short testing it seems to be working fine on modern systems now.  I did have to right-click the Steam launcher and run as administrator to deal with a 'Steam has failed to initialize'  error when trying to launch the game, but once I rebooted steam as admin it's running absolutely smoothly.As far as the game goes, it's a solid 8/10 RTS easily pushed to 10/10 by being one of the all time greats of Mad Science related gaming.  Runs very smoothly now, and graphics actually seem pretty decent considering when it was first released.  I'm pretty impressed and looking forward to playing it all over again.  Plus the expansion which I never played.I'll be going back to Fallout now, but simply owning this game again warms my mad science loving little heart more than I can possibly explain."

I like RTS games and this didn't disappoint me except with the crappy overlays on the people in close ups. The creature builder was interesting but gets kind of old after awhile because you are limited to only certain creature combos. Over all it's a good way to waste time for those who are nostalgic for the early RTS games.

76561198331771593,Recommended,324680,31944147,Posted: 24 May,all,Nexus Infinity,"Ah man, where do I even start with IC. I suppose the first thing I should say is that I own a hard copy of the original game, bought during 2001 or so. I can't really remember why I wanted the game as I was just a kid; I guess I saw some really weird creatures on the front and thought ""I want to play that game"". Probably one of the best gut decisions I've ever made in regards to video games. I used to play this constantly as a kid, and even after growing up I'd still take a few hours here and there testing a new combination or playing a match. It wasn't until last year that I stopped due to my new computer not being able to play IC after an update. Fast forward to the end of the year and I, a new Steam user, happened to stumble upon this game once more.Impossible Creatures is, as the Steam tags say, a RTS game through and through. However, it's a bit more complicated than that. As most of the game's page will point out, the units you control are all from your own design. Want a flying elephant? Just mix it with an owl. That not working out? Why not switch the elephant with a sperm whale? There 30-40+ animals for you to mix in match in this RTS to make the perfect 9 unit army. And if the base animal count isn't enough for you, there's plenty of mods out there for you to try and plenty of people to try these new creatures out on. Surprisingly, there's a lot of people still playing this game despite it being well over 10 years old, and thanks to Steam having a working online server, multiplayer battles are possible. Battles are pretty fluid, though perhaps a bit simple with more or less ""throw your units in certain directions"", but there's many ways to make a battle more interesting. If I were to summarize the game in general in 3 words, they'd be: simple, fun, and imaginative.So I've been saying a lot of good about the game, but what's bad you might be asking. Well...not a lot, to be honest. The graphics are a bit dated (though they should be, this is an old game) but they don't look terribly bad. There's not much for solo play, but there is a single player mode and the base game has a short story mode which is nice. Also the units are a bit prone to lagging out (like they will take long pauses before doing something) if you have a lot of units in the world, but that's only in more extreme situations. Probably the biggest turn-off about the game is that not every unit is made equal; certain combinations are obviously better than others, but to an extent that makes sense. That isn't to say some unique combinations won't get you far and that tactics don't mean anything, but having certain combinations will definitely present you with an edge to the fight.So what do I think about it? Certainly, it's a unique game in the RTS genre and certainly worth its price of $10. I recommend it to everyone. It's simple to pick-up and play, but you're really only limited in your ability to think up a creative way to solve a problem. And trust me there's many ways to solve problems here. This is a great game, and I (maybe foolishly) hope for the day I see Impossible Creatures 2 in development.EDIT: Oh yeah, I also forgot. This game comes with a side component called ""Mission Editor"" (referred to as Impossible Creature Editor on Steam). What does this do? It allows you to make your own maps for your playing pleasure! And it's a surprisingly modern world editor for being 15+ years old. Everything molds smoothly (well, unless you literally make a pointed mountain), objects are well organized, various methods to edit the terrain aside from standard increase/decrease/smoothing tools...it's really good! The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to paint cliffs...no seriously, if you make a mountain, you need to put on mountain side textures to make it look different than the rest of the terrain (that said, I'm lazy so I don't want to do that).So let's review; with this game, you get: a pretty good standalone RTS game with a unique feature (which is dated mind you, but still really good), a map editor for free for said game, free DLC automatically downloaded into the game, additional user-made ""DLC"" on Steam or online, online multiplayer...There's not much bad! And for $10 (and this edit was made when there was a sale, so that $10 is even lower!)! One note of caution though, this is a RTS game and thus suffers from standard RTS problems (some things are always better than othersfor example), but the unique ""build-your-team"" element more than makes up for that if you learn and understand how to counter certain units. That said, once again, this is a game well worth it's price."

What makes this one so much fun? Building your own custom units using animals. It's simple in base building but the real strategy is building the perfect units and being able to face any situation by land, sea, or air. The campaign may not be the most amazing thing ever but it adds an extra level in the army building. You actually have to find animals in the game and get DNA to unlock new animals. Not to mention seeing different unit sto give you ideas on how to build yours. In the end this is a classic RTS in my opinion and a must play for RTS fans and those who love creativity."
,Recommended,324680,34563594,Posted: 28 August,all,aidenpons,"Before I get stuck into it, I should say that youmustinstall the mod Tellurian. Vanilla IC is unbalanced as all heck. Tellurian is amazingly balanced andstillbeing updated.This game is perhaps the oddest RTS I’ve ever seen. The defining feature of IC is that you cancreate your own units. In the singleplayer campaign you can edit units on the fly but in skirmish and MP battles you have to pick an “army” consisting of nine units – which isn’t enough to cover all the roles that you can make, so you have to do some prioritising.The unit creation consists of combining one creature with another and selecting which bodypart of which you want for the stats. You can’t combine three creatures, only two. But there’s more to this than just raw statistics – there are also quite a lot of special abilities. Some of these are passive (e.g. Horns, which reduces enemy defense, Poison Tip, which reduces enemy attack…), and some are triggered (e.g. Stink Cloud, Infest, Electric Burst…). These special abilities are not OP enough to mean that they’re how the game is run, but they’re also not so weak such that they’re not worth it.Some nuances of the creature editor:Combining a Size 1 with a Size 5 animal will always result in a Size 5 animal – even if you have no bodyparts of the Size 5 animal.Stats scale based on size so that’s why a giant porcupine is more deadly (& more expensive) than a small porcupineCombining two ranged attacks does nothing but combining two melee attacks means they stack – 10 melee head damage + 10 melee tail damage = 20 damage totalThe creature’s overall strength determines its tier levelNow, I mentioned the Tellurian mod. I only got IC about a year ago, where Tellurian (usually just called “Tel”) had been the norm for quite some time. It was still being edited, adding a couple more creatures, adjusting existing ones, and upping the tier times considerably. Before Tellurian came out this game had been playedto deathby those that stuck with it (the game was released in 2003) and as such the optimal combination foreverythingwas known.  As well as how stupidly OP some things were (lobsters, anti-air towers, hovering spam, barrier destroy, the really low Tier V upgrade cost...) Now that Tellurian’s come along with new stuff there’s new strats to try, new creatures to combine, and generally new things to do.Oh, and Tellurian was nearly included with the Steam version by default. The reason it wasn’t is because this would make it more difficult to update (source: lost to time so notthatreliable, but hey – it is very balanced and pretty much nobody plays without it)As was said, for MP battles / non-campaign SP you can pick nine creatures to run with. Or swim with, or fly with – this RTS is one of the few to have a functional flying class. In fact, it has the oddest classing system I’ve ever seen:MeleeRanged – beats Melee and FliersArtillery – attacks with an area of effect, beats rangedSonic – beats anything bunchedFliers – can only be attacked by ranged or artillery unitsMelee FliersRanged Fliers – generally not worth it as they’re more expensiveArtillery Fliers – somewhat broken as they counter ranged units which counter them so it becomes a spam-warAmphibious combinations of any of the aboveAnd then of course you can start putting on special abilities – eg fliers with Electric Burst, such that you run in with ten crummy HP units and click Burst right above all the enemy henchemen! Or melee with Stink Cloud such that you can’t be shot at with ranged units. There’s also two types of stealth so you can use those too (upon attacking they become visible for ten seconds, so a lack of stealth detection isn’t a disaster)More ways in which this is a thoroughly odd RTS:One resource is solely generated (Electricity) and the other resource is solely mined (Coal), and the mined resource has a maximum rate per coal pile at which it can be mined (the recommended is 2 henchmen per coal pile)Units train extraordinarily quickly – as such a game that goes on for an hour is quite long.Rushing in Tier II (with Tel) is balancedTier II / Tier III units are thoroughly useless lategame unless they have some useful special ability. Unlike, say, AOE2, when you can upgrade Militia through to Champions, you can only get some generic “increased HP/attack/line of sight/etc” upgrades and as such you’ll just ignore your T2 / T3 units when you’re in Tier V (the final tier).The equivalent of your “Town Center” is your lab. You cannot build a second lab and if it is destroyed you are out of the game (fortunately it has pretty high HP as well as some special abilities of its own).Defensive towers are pretty trash for their price (though the standard tower does have stealth detection…)Walls areextremelytrash and barely worth the micro to build (heck, there aren’t even any gates!)On the whole this game is about map control – securing the bonus coal piles for a faster gather rate, holding Geysers for more electricity, whacking your opponent’s expansions, etc. It’s not so much about individual unit-to-unit fighting – instead, it’s about fighting for control of the map. If your enemy holds two thirds of the map and you hold one third he will be able to train twice the creatures you can – granted, with some clever micro and cunning unit selection & strats you can still survive or even win.Anyway, enough on the actual game and now what I think of it.It’s amazing. It’s one half of the RTS I’ve dreamed about. (The other half is Medieval II: Total War, where you take a Grand Campaign and fightallthe battles (if you like) in an RTS fashion.) Impossible Creatures is extremely unique. I’ve never seen any other RTS in which you can create your own units and as outlined above the uniqueness of IC doesn’t stop there. The campaign isextremelycliché, but it’s not bad level design (most of the time), a good introduction into IC, and worth playing no more than twice. The AI is okay but not great & has some abuse tricks of its own (though the only reason it’s a challenge is because on Hard and Expert it just cheats in bucketloads of resources).The multiplayer community is very much alive and kicking. Not frequent, and if you enter the lobby randomly the chance is about 60% that there will be no-one else there. But they’re still around and most of the organisation happens on their Discord (just make a post on the forum discussions asking “where’s the MP community at.”) On the whole they’re all pretty nice people, despite their tendency to spam “xddddddd” – funny that, the smaller the communityusuallythe nicer it is. Certainly they’re helpful and prompt with their tech support (which 50% of the time is “read the FAQ” xddddd).This game certainly isn’t for everyone – if you’re up for a more traditional RTS go get AOE2 retail (not HD, that’s a mess) but the unit creation is both a novel and interesting idea that has been very well balanced in Tellurian. But it’s certainly for me :DOnelast word: there’s not much of a reason to get the Steam edition when you can getthe GOG version. The Steam edition has workshop support (but you can install mods manually) and standard Steamworks functionality, but the GOG version has famously no DRM so you can run a LAN party on all your machines at once. Oh, and this is one of the games that basically goes on a 75% off sale whenever due to being so old so you can snaffle it when it’s cheap on both GOG and Steam and get the best of both worlds."

They really REALLY need to make a sequel to this, hopefully the release of this on steam may encourage that. Could legitimately be an eSport if they did it right.For anyone completely unaware of what this is, imagine Starcraft or Age of Empires except you create your own units by combining 2 animals into one (selecting certain features from each so you can have the stinger of a scorpion on the body of a tiger as an example, keeping the speed and claws of the tiger along with the poison of the scorpion). Up to 9 different animal hybrids per 'army' which you then can use in battle against AI or people acorss various maps. Also the campaign acts as the tutorial whilst still providing a decent enough story but the main attraction is creating your own army via the many creatures on offer (51 in original game, about 100 including expansions/mods) and battling friends or strangers against their unique animal army.

The AI never actually changes; only resources, triggers, and very simple custom scripts for certain missions.>Multiplayer (IC Online) - 8/10Playing against thinking opponents is certainly satisfying in Impossible Creatures. Unfortunately, due to extreme balance issues, game design oversights, and a complete lack of any and all forms of community management or organization, online gameplay often leaves me feeling dissatisfied and uninvolved, as though I could have better spent my time in a different, more recently-designed game. Still, the concept of Impossible Creatures' player-designed units cannot be found anywhere else, and presents an interesting dynamic in multiplayer scenarios.If more people used the Tellurian mod, I would have rated this higher.Interface - 9/10The user interface in Impossible Creatures offers the player a lot of control over their units and their resources. The only negatives I would say are the lack of a chat log in Multiplayer matches and the pitiful default camera max distance.Community - 5/10Some members of the community are distinctly friendly, outgoing, and helpful. Others will troll you from day one, and each bit of advice they give you is intended to do you genuine harm for their own amusement. There is no community management system in place. There are no clans, no vote kicks, no bans. There is total anonymity and many people abuse it. There is toxicity, and integration into the game's unique community requires a lot of resolve and tolerance, because honestly, very few people actually want you to be here. They'd be totally happy if you weren't, and they will treat you like extra entertainment at your own expense. The people who don't will never stand up for you. It feels a lot like being in high school. You either fit in with their definition of ""perfectly acceptable"" or they will treat you like you are sub-human, even going to the point of talking about you in the third person in your presence. There's a distinct lack of maturity and mutual respect.I've rated this higher than my words would suggest because most of the experiences described above are the experience I've had with the Tellurian community, before the game was released on Steam. Though they are a large part of the game's community, they are not all of it, and experiences vary with each person. Yours may be better than mine, and the community may even improve since the game has been re-released. Here's to hoping.Graphics - 7/10They're good for their time, and acceptable today.Other NotesModding ToolsThey're helpful, diverse, and you can do a lot with them, but they're seriously broken. The interface editor is missing a critical file and cannot function. The others have a tendancy to bug out or crash. Most of your modding will be done using third-party softwares (notepad, .dll editors, etc.). The mission editor is adequate and quite functional, though, and can be used to create very professional-feeling maps with relative ease.Tellurian ModEveryone should be using it. End of story tbhOverall, Impossible Creatures is a very unique game with some interesting systems and players. It's fun and deep, and worth trying."

The ability to customize your units adds another level of strategy to the game. Do you want a wolf with the head of a chameleon? Done. Great white and a tiger? Easy. Flying monkeys? Why not?The campaign is also enjoyable, and gradually unlocking creatures forces the player to experiment with their army, which in my opinion is a good thing.Of course, the game is not without fault. 9 creatures can be a bit limiting if you want an army that is strong at all stages of the game. Pathing can be a little buggy, and can (and WILL) mess up your creatures' positions (ranged units in front, melee in back, that kind of thing).Overall, though, I give this game a solid 9/10. It has definitely aged well for a 13 year old game. Definitely pick it up if you enjoy RTS games."

It's in line with other RTS' like Age of Mythology, so if that's your thing, then you're guaranteed to have at least a little bit of fun with this game (since so many RTS' are so alike).Pros------ Graphics are charming despite being dated.- Game runs perfectly fine on low end PC's.- Music sounds fine (RTS' aren't exactly known for their soundtracks anyways).- Making your own units is fun and done in an amusing way. Unique for the RTS genre.- Workshop adds some fun to the game.- Amusing campaign and such.- Voice overs for the characters are nice.- Seemingly a good while of content to keep you amused.Cons------- Dated graphics (hardly a con).- Workshop quite literally only has one popular mod.- Failing a mission means you have to restart, which is tedious for 30 minute missions.Overall the game is really nice for a cheap sale purchase. The one problem though is the unit customization, which is a shame when it's the selling point of the game. While cool, it feels a bit stale. You tend to combine similar groups of animals and/or class types (tank, scout, offensive types) together all the time. It works by combining certain swappable parts of animals together which in turn provides you effects (kick attack for legs versus claw attack for clawed arms) or abilities based on the used parts of the certain animals. The problem lies in the fact that you're basically using 90% of one animal but only 10% of the other, as opposed to a 50/50 split to produce something crazy. If you need a fast creature, you're probably going to combine two fast creatures with slight differences together to try to make the most optimal fast creature. Combining anything else may give you another ability to use, but the stats on the animal will be weakly split in to two countering stats, which feels worse than just having that ""super fast cheetah / wolf mix that deals more damage while still being super fast."" For example, you could combine that cheetah with that wolf to give it more damage while still being super fast, or you could combine that cheetah with that skunk to gain the skunk ability, but at the cost of all of the good stats either of them may/may not have, which feels worse than the optimal cheetah / wolf mix.That all being said, the game's fine. It's an old game, and as an old game, it was made beautifully. Worth the cheap 3 bucks I spent on it."

I've been playing it since it was first released, but there's plenty more to it than nostalgia.Pros:-Creature Customization: You can design a completely distinct army of up to nine combined creatures. These creatures can range from high-level tanks to flying units to fully aquatic units. The only limit to army design is your own creativity.-Graphics: Even though the game released in the early 2000s the graphics still hold up reasonably well to this day. Yeah some of the designs may be blocky and the textures can look awkward, but considering the time it was made the graphics are pretty good.-Balanced Combat: Unless you or your opponent have a very OP creature, combat is pretty balanced. You just have to be strategic in how you play the game.Mixed:-Campaign Play: The campaign story in the game is something I personally enjoy because of the nostalgia but it could be off-putting to some people. The characters are all interesting and the villains are intimidating (Dr. Ganglion comes to mind right away), but the campaign is very short, you can easily get through it in a few hours if you know what you're doing and the payoff at the end isn't as exciting as it was built up to be.-Resource Management: The two resources in the game can be tricky to manage properly. Electricity is unlimited provided you have enough generators/lightening rods, but coal is finite and during the campaign once all the coal is used up there's no way to get any more. You can exchange electricity for coal in freeplay, but that still won't make up for mining. Resource attrition can be a useful strategy while playing but it can also be a huge annoyance.-High Level Research and Creatures: Going along with the resource management issue is the problem of high-level resorces and creatures. While it's very useful it can easily drain you of coal and electricity. High-level creatures can easily drain your resources as well, a sperm whale x any level III or higher land animal will cost over 500 coal."

I truly believe this game had the potential to reach League of Legends and DOTA 2s caliber. It was an original RTS with online gameplay which players enjoyed tremendously. There are two major reasons the original release of this game failed.1.) The developer and published had a legal dispute over another situation. They never worked with each other again, although Impossible Creatures 2 was in development phase. Due to their falling out, everything about IC was put on hold. It was no longer updated nor maintained. Eventually the online server was taken down. The community had some amazing people in it. Many people worked together to keep the game alive. There are some people who developed amazing mods for the game. The mods balanced out the game, created new content, and kept people playing through Hamachi.2.) The game had limited advertising on release. They didn’t advertise this game nearly enough. It had thousands of players to begin with, but it slowly died off without people being aware of its existence.If you’re looking for an incredibly fun multiplayer RTS game, with unlimited possibility for strategic gameplay and skill.

Especially in the campaign where you can switch your creature composition on the fly (whereas in skirmish you have a pre-designed army of 9 creatures that you can make in that match), the odd composite creatures that can be created keep the game fresh. The campaign also has a very pulp adventure feel in it, which fits the aesthetics of the game well.The skirmish is not as interesting since you will be locked to using the creatures you designed before the match rather than adapting on the fly. It does make the armies of different players vastly different though, which will be a unique challenge compared to most other RTS games."

Perfecting an army of hybrid monsters is amazing fun and you'll be proud seeing your hard work march/crawl/fly/swim into battle. The level of tactical depth is an order of magnitude above most other RTS games not only do you use your units in the right way, but you can build them from the ground up to be what you need. I'd say there's a real art in creating a useful strategy (for example l3 meatshield +l2 range is a classic combo)- and a science to optimising your creations to be a cut above others (how do you get the best bang for your buck for a l3 tank creature).Also some of the creature combinations are absolutely hilarious especially with the auto naming system. I think 'Komodo Drunk' has already been mentioned but a great one my friend came up with is the 'Sperming Whurtle'.Overall great game and something totally unique- Hugely underrated and long overdue on steam.Buy it especially if you like tinkering or being creative."

,Recommended,324680,29309768,Posted: 16 January,all,Stargatedalek,"AMAZING GAME, but the port to Steam hasn't been handled particularly well.TLDR; gameplay is on-par with any modern RTS, graphics are decent enough for gameplay, but understandbly show their age during cutscenes, and the Steam port still has some bugs to work out. 8/10, but if you have it already you should definitely wait for a sale, it's not worth the full price just for online play (Hamachi does it well enough).Impossible Creatures places you at the helm of either your army of heroic eagle-fish warriors, protecting freedom and justice, or alternatively, at the helm of an all consuming army that encorporates the DNA of all the worlds most dangerous creatures and destroys all who stands in its way...At least in the multiplayer, the singleplayer campaign is lacking in player-driven plot influence at all, but that's to be expected given the games age, RPG elements weren't common in RTS until recent years.The gameplay is based largely around your ability to design your own units. You can mix any two creatures that are in the game, choose which parts of which you want to incorporate, and then send it into battle. Different creatures and in-turn different parts of creatures will have different costs. In the campaign you can design them on-the-fly, but in multiplayer you need to design your army beforehand, so having multiple sitting around is handy for properly expecting every map.Pros:Solid gameplay.Price isn't bad at all.Mod support, even if the workshop integration is very finicky.Cons:Steam port is a little buggy, especially around the workshop.This game was made in 2003, it just simply isn't going to stack up to modern games in terms of graphics.The availability of creatures is misleading, at least aesthetically. While you have a lot of animals to choose from, and it does in fact allow you to create very diverse armys, most of them look similar. By this I mean there probably almost a dozen big cat species, why. And almost every creature is a quadruped, excluding arthropods and snakes. The only bipeds are all birds, and they can't actually walk on their legs, even if you remove their wings, which means that aesthetically speaking, even with mods, you are going to be very limited in creature design."

It may look like bad graphics but you have to give it credit for being an early 2002 game. I have played a good 200 hours of this game due to the fact that I have had it since I was nine- probably even more hours. I love the diversity that this game has and that fact that it is a noob friendly RTS game for all you non gamers out there. It also can become pretty challenging if skirmishing against hard or expert bots(they have all sorts of map hacks and are good at micromanagement). I like that fact that you can create your own armies to match the style in which you play. I also love the 15 mission campaign that comes with it. Really fun and you can learn a lot by playing it. It is a decent story  line. My most favorite part of the game, however, is the Mission Editor. You can make your own maps and missions. When I was younger I made many maps and had fun with the diversity. It is not too hard to use just make sure you make your scenarios folder in data then make an MP folder in scenarios and your set.The other good part is that the new steam version fixed the multiplayer. It is fun and easy to use so I totally recommend that you invite your freinds to play this game as well."

I've not yet put many hours into the steam version, but Impossible Creatures featured in the better part of my childhood and this version still holds up toit's past self (as I remember it).  It's not the most unique game now or the one with the best plot, sure, but it is one in which experimenting, with the slightly odd to the somewhat disturbed, down right crazy is not only fun but productive.  I've spent many hours before assembling the wonkiest creatures I could and sending them out to fight (often to great effect) and I plan to do so again.So far, from what I've seen, this version is exactly the same as before, which is great, except for a few minor details I'd hoped would be fixed, when I'd heard this game was out:First and most minor, the black picture, When taking pictures of your creations in the old IC, sometimes the thumbnails would turn out black, especially if you moved the camera.  This could be fixed by taking lots of pictures, but you might not get that neat post you'd wanted.  Now if anything, this aspect seems a little worse than I remember.Second, connection drops.  Now, I haven't tried ICO yet (odd bit of trouble with that, did IP connection instead), but when playing, at any point, start to end, you risk being dropped.  Kinda annoying at the start, REALLY annoying if you're about to win (it's not the other player's fault, happens when we fight computers together too).Third, probably more a fault of my own than the creators.  Almost my games seem to come down to whoever get's the most coal fastest and overwhealms to enemy in one swift stroke, ending it quickly, or whoever runs out of coal last and picks off the remaining enemies dragging on and on.  It feels like there's no middle ground, no area control exchange, no games just long enough to comfortably slide into things but short enough not to get bored.That being said, this game is still one of my favourites, and will continue to be.  And is definitely worth getting on sale."

From the cheetahs with lobster claws to the chimpanzees with lobster claws, everything I remember about lobster claws is there. In fact, it includes many animals I didn't realize had no lobster claws. I know some of my childhood friends (who had no lobster claws themselves) traded rumors about hammerhead sharks without lobster claws, but all the hammerheads I saw from my beach villa had lobster claws. The musk oxen grazing along the beach didn't have lobster claws, thankfully -- otherwise we'd have needed to reinforce all our homes with lobster claws cast in gold. Musk oxen were always charging buildings, but they didn't cause much harm because they didn't have lobster claws, which greatly increase the damage inflicted on buildings. Getting back to hammerhead sharks, I learned that they sometimes possess primate forelimbs (in lieu of lobster claws), and they can hurl small rocks a considerable distance. Despite their excellent vision radius, the giraffes with lobster claws were never able to throw things very well because lobster claws are not suited to ballistic activity. Speaking of giraffes, if you ever come across one with a lupine torso, don't bother running. It's got crazy endurance and will be in tip-top shape when you're panting and wheezing and collapsed on the ground. Even though it has no lobster claws, the giraffe can easily stomp you with its hooves or maul you with its non-lobster claws. Be very careful around giraffes, their appetite for the flesh of creatures without lobster claws is insatiable. Unless you have lobster claws yourself, then you're probably safe.In short, all my lobster claw nostalgia is satisfied with this lobster claw simulator.FULL DISCLOSURE: I don't have lobster claws."

I can only imagine the possibilities, and hopefully you do to.Overall, buy this game if not just for it's pure greatness, if not for the nostalgia, if not for the amazing premise, if not for the chance at a sequel, do it for yourself and do it to experience one of the (somewhat) forgotten gems in gaming history."

Generals provided a different way of playing RTS with less foucs on micromanagement and more focus on pummping out troops and getting into the actions asap.....Impossible Creatures follows this formula but with a twist! Frankensteining 2 creatures into a new unit! Want to mix a Elephant with a Ant? DONE! Want to mix a Praying Mantis with a Coyote? DONE! The list goes on and on!This unique feature to the game gives the player hundreds of thousands of combinations that will customise your strategy and give you total freedom on how you want to play the game!Combining two creatures doesnt just enhance the looks of the unit, but planning is also required as each creature has its own unique stats. Being able to replace certain parts of a unit can enhance a specific stat. Size in this game doesnt matter! Even the smaller, cheaper units has their place in battle! Ive played around in the Army Builder portion of the game and it gives you the felxibility to create your units ahead of time and save them to play at a later date.The options are endless and I have already went back several times to retweak or replace units to give my ever changing strategy a boost or the ability to run with a new strategy.....If you think combining two of the best units in game will give you the advantage....think again! Everything is balanced to a way that even cheaper units can get the jump on tougher units as well.....you pay one way or the other when trying to make super units or just trying to invade with cheaper units....a balance is required and gives you the freedom to make those balances yourself!The only drawbacks I can see with this game atm is it needs a serious remaster done to it! The game is absolutely fun and unique if you are a RTS fan....and even if you arent, it can easily draw in those with a more creative style of play.The other is multiplayer based games. But, There is a Impossible Creatures Online group you can join herein Steam to get matches going. Its a pretty good size community and with lots of helpful players.I havent yet touched the Campaign portion of the game, I hear it maybe a little weak but still fun.All in all, it was the best $10 I had spent on Steam thus far! Pick it up, play less than 2 hours and if you dont like it,  return it. What do you have to lose by doing that?"

The story mode involves finding creatures, taking there DNA and merging it with others to create the ultimate creatures to defeat the bad guys, all while experiencing an amazing story. The vs. Computer mode is a one-off battle against a computer, creatures are not created in the verses game itself but instead you load them from a pre-created army or a custom army you've made in the army builder, the army builder is where you can create armies of nine creatures to use in your verses game, you can either load creatures you've made before into your new army or make them from scratch!

Impossible Creatures came out a LONG time ago, well not that long. 2003 to be Precise, and the graphics show as well. However the gameplay is my main concern here. Being able to create creatures by combining their positive adaptations within life, and ruleing out their cons, is fun; but commanding them to attack one another as if they were units of war, is a whole-nother story. Creatures can be created in the creature chamber and assigned to 'Armies' for use within battle. The Story is good, and the Characters have a good, vivid personality. Not into campaign? Well then Skirmish or Online (if its even still avaliable) are for you! Picking a map to fight on, send creations after anothers artocitys.

Unlike every other RTS I've ever played, this one might have the highest replayability possible, because all the units are customized.  So rather than focusing on certain canned units like other RTS, it's hard to know if the units you've come up with are going to counter whatever someone else might throw at you.The RTS has limited resources per map - so only so much coal will be available, although electricity can be converted into coal too.The voice acting is fun and the learning curve keeps me coming back.  The UI is dated.  For example the ESC key is ignored and you have to hit the ""menu"" button instead.  I've only played a few hours and so far it's been worth the sale price of $2.99 for the game.

The game crashed once in the first hour (I never had it crash while playing the disc version for thousands of hours).  The unit icons in game often came up as completely black, which makes it difficult to see which unit you are creating and undercuts the point of a thought-based strategy game.  Furthermore, during the sixth mission the endgame trigger did not occur after completing all objectives.  Had to restart the entire mission.  All of this happened in not even two hours played (yes I got through that many missions in two hours because I'm a boss).  I expect there will be more glitches if I continue.  I asked for a refund.  These are not HUGE problems, and you will still be able to experience this fantastic game.  But this is clearly a sloppy port designed for quick profit and I refuse to support a publisher who does this.I will keep looking for updates and will change my review if the developer fixes these issues.EDIT:  Developer seems to be aware of issues and is updating the game.  Most recent update was March 30, just a day ago.  One of the improvements is ""reduce the chance of glitch where game does not end after completing objectives.""  Reduce?  How about fix?  Or how about not putting a game on Steam without having ironed out the bugs, especially if they are significant?EDIT:  November 27 - Still no more updatesEDIT:  January 19 - Publisher seems to have abandoned this project.

Very hard to gauge the power of your units and the game play itself is pretty much not worth it unless you made the monsters yourself and install the Telurian mod.

So much scope for experimenting, exploration and tactical variety. This is one of those 'Thank you Steam' moments. I tried to get a copy of this a couple of years ago and you wouldn't believe how difficult/expensive second-hand copies are to get hold of.Concept: 10 - You can splice animals together to make new, deadlier, cooler animals. Then you make them fight others. It's genius. There are a ridiculous number of combinations to try out, and some are just amazing. Need a creature to scout for you? Stick a giraffe's head and neck on a cheetah. Tortoise/electric eel combo? Live tesla tank.Graphics: 7 - Obviously they've dated but they're perfectly acceptable.Music: 8 - Different music for each level/environment, creates a nice atmosphere.Story: 6 - It's ok, not great, but you'll be too busy splicing a crocodile head ontp a cheetah to care.Gameplay: 9 - All the controls makes sense. It's a classic RTS layout. I never lose track of where my creatures are or what's going on in my base. No complaintsMultiplayer: 9 - Because of the incredible tactical flexibility in the game, you never know what kind of opponent you're up against. It's shark-dog eat shark-dog out there. Just when you think you're prepared for the enemy's frontal assault - BAM!

I used to play the original game a lot as a teenager.Impossible Creatures is an RTS created by Relic Entertainment, the same company that produced the Warhammer 40K Dawn of War games, and later Company of Heroes. The main Gimmick here, however, is Steampunk mad scientist shenanigans.Essentially, the game revolves around fusing different animals together (say a girrafe and a cobra, for example) to combine traits and strengths of different animals together. Each animal is put into a class from 1 to 5, one being least powerful, five being more powerful. The better and more powerful the animals are when they are combined, the higher class they become. However, you have to level up your base, and get new buildings in order to access level 5 animals, and the animals are also more resource intensive.There is a campaign that slowly introduces the mechanics, while also telling a cheesy 1930's sci-fi story, but the meat of the game is the skirmish mode, single and multiplayer. When you start a game, you have to develop your army (or choose a prebuilt one) by combining two animals together, filling 9 slots, while balancing less powerful units with more powerful ones. From there, you play a fairly standard RTS game with resource gathering, micromanagement and battles. I'm not very good at RTS's so I can't comment on the AI, but I feel the gimmick and the gameplay is enough to make the game fun.So yeah. It's a good game, not the best, but for $10 it's quite the steal."

Although the RTS portion has all of the usual components (two resources, mine one, auto-mine the other, build up armies, attack/win), it's the ability to create your own units that really sets this game apart from anything else. With excellent free community mods, you receve around 70 creatures to mix and match the parts of. Resulting units change in cost, special abilities, and stats as appropriate - so building a team of 9 of these units that suits your playstyle then testing your composition out on the RTS battlefield is what this one is all about.There's still nothing else like it, so it's easy to recommend if you've been looking for an RTS that dares to do something a bit different."

Being able to build your army's unit composition by mixing and matching two different animals (from a list of over 50) for each individual unit is unique to RTS games, even today.Unfortunately, beyond that fact, the game is mostly strategically shallow. It's very basic in almost every way. This can be a good thing for casual strategy gamers, but not quite as inticing for the chess master types out there.It's worth a go either way, though. But that's just my biased opinion.BTW mix a tiger with a snapping turtle. Use all the parts of the tiger, but give it the torso of the turtle. Meet the ""Tiger Burger""."

There is something very satisfying in creating your own units for an RTS game, and the campaign is always fun.The optimization they have done for making the game run on modern computers works perfectly as far as I can tell, it loads and starts games 10 times as fast as the original disc copy.I recommend it."

But here it is on steam. :DSo obviously I'm bias, but this game is actually quite a bit of fun. The game is pretty dated, it's not a great RTS, and it doesn't even have a great story(though it does the job), but just the act of mixing and matching animals to create epic killing machines then unleashing them in the dumb AI in this game is pretty fun.I'd like to see this concept used in a more recent game. Creating hybrid animals from ones you've collected DNA from is a game concept that is quite a bit of fun."

And it's basically exactly as I remember it. The concept is great, you're basically a mad scientist and you can make your own army by mixing the parts of 2 different animals/insects to make your own army.If you like RTS's and having the ability to be creative and crazy I'd recommend at least trying the game, it's a ton of fun."

This however is not what makes this game so interesting. The units you can use are made by you and can be fitted to your favourit gamestyle because of that. Before a match you build your army by merging two animals and decide what it gets from which animal. This way you can create 9 unittypes you can build in your battles. The small number of types you can put in an army and the neccessity for having counters to most things makes the army building a very interesting part of the game where you often face difficult decisions. This is what makes this game awesome.

I received the game from a friend way past what most would consider an 'expiration' date on games, back when I had dial-up internet (it still exists, people!) and not a whole lot of money to invest into gaming.So when I think about this game, I'm not thinking of it through nostalgia goggles. I'm thinking of it among the greats of RTS games, like Age of Empires 2, Empire Earth, Command & Conquer: Generals, Warcraft 3, Starcraft, etc.There's something extremely charming about this game. The characters are fun, the campaign missions can be very challenging, and the creature combinations range anywhere from hilarious to awesome. If you find the underlying flavor of the humor, characterizations, and voice acting to be enjoyable, then you'll have a ton of fun with this title. This is a unique title that hasn't had many elements from it continue on in the RTS titles since, which at once is both unfortunate for the RTS genre and quite fortunate from this title.I definitely recommend this game."

How can I put this...  Ah, heres and example.  Image this scenario:  You building up your base, having a nice and quiet time.  ""By the time I'm done researching the final tech level, nothing can stop me!"" you say, and you begin setting the creature creator into overdrive.  Suddenly, out of the corner of your eye, you see a flock of lobster-eagles swooping down to kill your workers, who are then charged by a group of elephants with dragonfly wings.  Before you can react, you realize that the lab is being attacked by panther-chameleons and walrus-komodo dragons!  You try and get your army to deal with the threat, but the units you've already build have been demolished by musk ox-sperm whales and chimpanzee-zebras!I'll let you imagine the rest.  In short, what I'm trying to say is that this game can be enjoyed even if all your doing is messing around in the creature creator, or your making both you and your friend (enemy) laugh your rears off due to the absurdity of both your armies.  So yeah, get this game even if you don't want to strategize, and just want to make your own ridiculous creatures."

Seriously, if I remember someone ask Relic Entertainment to put Impossible Creatures on Steam, that was really long time ago, now finally my dream is become true!!About this game that you need to create or own creatures and fights your enemy base, yes I'd say its a ""Strategy"" game.Custom army is the best part of this game! You can choose two animals and modfied its body parts whatever you like and make them looks like its your pet lol.There's many of ways you can try out many different animals to combine it! That is your own imagination. You don't like some certain animals? Make it wrose! Its your world.Story mode is great, trust me, I never ever finish on that part lol. So I like to play custom game more, even I am alone.There is a packages come out for Steam Edition, update patchs, Insect Invasion Expansion, Level Editor, and SDK (Source Development Kit) for create a new mod even you can make a new animals, so far. I don't really use it much since I just met the modding community, but I was used to playing with someone's mods.

I've played the game until I lost the copy. Got a second copy three years later and got to play with the mods, which had even more fun (unlike the first copy, the second one didn't get lost; I still have that one). Eight years later (today), I got a third copy (this one, obviously...) and gave me so much nostalgia.So happy I was able to play this on my modern machine because I pretty much knew my machine couldn't support my second copy.I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who is either into RTS-style games or just like to combine animals just for the heck of it."
