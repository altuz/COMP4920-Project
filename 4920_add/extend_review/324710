The writer explained a lot of his jokes too much or put words in ALL CAPS to EMPHASIZE how FUNNY or ABSURD it is, RIGHT?!- Way too much money to pay for what it offers, a more appropriate price would be $5To Be or Not to Be is a really good concept of a game. I happen to be a fan of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books and this game was trying to emulate that. What made me buy this game was the Kickstarter page, where it raised more than $500,000 for an originally $20,000 budget game. It clearly had devoted fans and excited developers (especially the writer), so I had to try it out with the expectation that this would be a witty and fresh take on the Hamlet story.My biggest criticism is that the pacing is rushed. There was too much summary, like the writer is assuming we don't want to read certain bits or want to know how we got from Point A to Point B. In one playthrough, I played Ophelia and I got a choice of who was at the door: Hamlet, her father, or her best friend. I chose her best friend, but the narration declared that it was Hamlet and Ophelia can't ""CONTROL reality with her MIND. Sheesh!"" Then why would you give me the choice? Unless that was supposed to be funny, which leads me to my next criticism: The humor. There was no subtlety. Imagine someone paraphrasing Hamlet for you in a parodied slang, and then whenever a joke is coming they only get LOUDER and LOUDER to emphasize their point. That is the humor of this game.Another playthrough, I played Hamlet Sr. and I had a choice of how to kill Claudius, his brother: Enlist your son to do it, or do it yourself. I chose to enlist his son, Hamlet, to do it only to be met with judgments and grief from the narrator claiming that the choice was ""awful, dude"". So they emphasize I have to live with this choice and then attempt to save me by saying I should pick an ""afterlife career"" (to which they needlessly list a bunch of mundane careers) or I can continue with my choice. I chose to go through with my choice only to be yelled at more and the narrator refusing to cooperate with me. So they just changed my character into Hamlet instead of my original choice, Hamlet Sr., because if I was going to ""induce a man to murder"", I had to go through with the murder myself. If I refused this change of events, they gave me an abrupt ending. In Shakespeare's play, Hamlet Sr.'s ghost form appears to Hamlet and tells him about the murder, planting the seed of revenge in Hamlet's mind. Judgmental narrators can work, but not when they don't allow you to make the choice at all.As for the art (one piece for every ending), there wasn't too much of it and I don't think it was redeeming enough to make up for the writing, which is the dominant force of the game. So if you're buying the game to see the art, I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale.I went in expecting a coherent, branching storyline where ""your choices matter"" and you develop relationships with the characters in a way that was more in-depth than Shakespeare. This game is very casual and rushed, a playthrough possibly taking no more than a minute. While the ""canon"" playthrough is accurate and developed, I would suggest reading a Sparknotes version of Hamlet if you don't want to read Shakespeare's version. If you're still interested in the game, pick it up when it's on sale. However, if you share my criticisms, there are many games that do this style of game better.EDIT: A commenter pointed out that the Kickstarter was for the print book, not the game. Which in that case, I understand the rushed pace and perhaps lack of funding for the game. But my points still stand, since most of it was for the writing."

Aside utilizing the names and events of the original storyline for a setting - and paraphrasing the book now and then - this is nothing even slightly close to the original work. If you have never read or watched the play, I strongly recommend doing so before venturing into this cheesy spoof.I've always been a bit of a fan for chose-your-own-adventure format, exploring various courses of actions and their consequences presented for a singular story. I basically grew up reading them, playing on the notion of a choice action. Also becoming a fan of Shakespeare's all works as my age and experience in English language progressed enough for me to appreciate them; this game felt like a natural choice for me. Well... this wasn't what I expected.As the narration starts, you are given the opportunity to play the game as Hamlet, Ophelia or Hamlet Sr. a.k.a. King of Denmark, exploring 110 various parody paths and their endings harboring cringe and insult comedy, narrated in modern slang mostly. It's a cute and imaginative game to spare some mindless time with, sure but nothing exceptionally rich I must say. You start playing the game with a silent smirk on your face, scoffing now and then, deepening that smirk into a smile. It has its almost hilarious moments too, mostly presented in situational comedy through written narrative.  It works for 2-3 playthroughs. Yet, as you keep playing and keep witnessing the same kind of shallow remarks for the 30th time, the game quickly loses its charm.I must confess that the humor presented here was not my cup of tea. It is mostly rough parody and elementary satire, downright underrating the brilliance of the original author by taking crude logic and blatant exaggeration as its weapons. It's not a traditional or psychological reading of the concept. It's an absurd and cheesy parody of the norms of the era, story path choices, gender representations, free-will itself and character interrelations. The relationship between the player and the narrator is somewhat of a semblance toThe Stanley Parablewith the narrator constantly criticizing you, intervening with your choices and rearranging actions to fit into prearranged storyline format, and doing so while belittling your sentience mostly. Some of the scenes presented - like the naval war between Hamlet's fleet and pirates - are imaginative and entertaining; but most scenes end up being direct hits on the original play with American sitcom humor.I am aware that I've mostly presented downsides, but would I recommend the game as a final verdict? Meh, why not if it's in a heavy sale and you'd feel like watching Ophelia going on a killing spree, Hamlet time travelling or King of Denmark exploring the bottom of the sea. It is cute, but that effect doesn't last. There is nothing to actually dislike in the game. Narrative dynamic functions fine and the author obviously knows his Shakespeare enough to criticizeHamletin to this extent. This whole thing is a matter of taste. I'll refuse to downvote it for the sake of creative spark it contains. It should be some labor to write 110 different endings to begin with.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Seriously, the Prince of Denmark is a colossal dumbass. He spends most of the play in a state of crippling indecision, talking to himself, talking to the ghost of his father and on one occasion even talking to the skull of some dude he used to know. When he does choose to do something, it is in almost every instance the worst possible thing he could have done. No man of action is Hamlet, instead he's an emo manbaby whose most famous speech is basically him debating whether or not to off himself. Pretty much anyone could do a better job of being Hamlet than Hamlet did, am I right?Well, good news! In To Be or Not To Be, you can find out just how well you'd do in Hamlet's shoes! You needn't limit yourself to being Hamlet, either. You can also choose to play as the beautiful, brilliant, emotionally unstable Ophelia or Hamlet's dad! Yes that's right, the dead dude, but remember, the whole reason the play even happens is because his ghost is hanging out in the castle! If you want, you can skip getting your idiot son involved and carry out your own ghostly revenge. Pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥ eh?I couldn't reccomend this game more highly. It is clever, funny and highly irreverent. However, potential buyers should keep in mind that this is a direct adaptation of a choose your own adventure style book. That means that interaction is limited to reading (or having read to you, via optional narration) the story and making choices when prompted. If that's not your cup of tea, fair enough. But if it is, you're in for a great time. To Be or Not To Be is an awesome and hilarious interactive novel with dozens of story paths and over 100 endings, each one beautifully and humorously illustrated by a wide variety of artists."
,Recommended,324710,33062332,Posted: 30 June,all,alphyna,"10/10, Rosencranz and Guildenstern are not dead anymore.To Be or Not To Beis a hilarious text adventure that puts you into Hamlet's shoes, makes him a video game protagonist... and then Hamlet applies REASON. It's not very effective...The game goes all out, satirizing and heckling every step Hamlet made, revelling in just how easy it would have been to avoid most of the play's tragedies. The result is often comedy gold—it made me laugh aloud several times (which is a lot in our informationally-overloaded-yet-desensitized-to-everything times). Hamlet's emo teen logic in the game is just too amusing, and somehow the whole thing also manages to have a touching moment or two.You can also play as Ophelia and Hamlet Sr., but I'd say that their stories, as well as the bits from Hamlet's that stray from the original completely, are less compelling than the parody bits—although still fun and good interactive prose.The whole thing is broken into easily digestible bits that allow for reasonably simple backtracking and exploring alternative branches. And if you have a favourite comic artist of international renown, chances are that an artwork of theirs is featured in the game—although I have to point out that the artworks, unlocked by reaching various endings, are not present in the game itself, but rather serve as non-useful rewards, so if you were hoping to see a ton of cool art, you're kinda out of luck. (Except for Kate Beaton's art that's present in the game and obviously instantly makes it cooler.)Some people criticizeTo Be or Not To Befor the fact that the choices in the game aren't equal. True: the game blatantly ridicules you for making some. However, I don't think it's a reasonable critique.To Be or Not To Beis not a real CYOA  game; it's based on a work that already has a ""canon"" storyline, so different options have different weight by default, some of them being ""real"" (i.e. Shakespeare's), while others being alternative. The goal ofTo Be or Not To Beis not to provide you with an array of balanced options, each of them having its own merit, it's actually quite the opposite: the game sets to make fun of the ""canon"" choices.So, if you're looking to truly, honestly roleplay Hamlet,To Be or Not To Bewon't suit you (you should maybe consider a career as an actor instead, people say the notion of playing Hamlet is kinda popular in theatre). However, if you're up to having some fun and are not averse to text adventures, this game is definitely one I would suggest trying."

,Recommended,324710,14380944,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,Daeranilen,"To Be or Not to Be feels like being told the story of Hamlet by a really good friend -- one with whom you share a goofy sense of humor and a lot of off-kilter inside jokes -- but there are a few issues I'm hoping to see fixed.First, let me be direct here: I love To Be or Not To Be. I like that I can play a storyline in the 10-minute breaks between my classes; the writing style, humor, and references work for me; and the game singlehandedly convinced me to nickname my car Ophelia (+1 to science, -1 to water, and +10,000 to badassery). This is also a game where it is really fun to achievement hunt -- achievements tip you off to lots of silly but non-required moments, and chasing them down is a good way to structure your playtime.That said, the humor relies a lot on the inherent silliness of juxtaposing Hamlet with modernity and may not hit the mark for everyone. Additionally, a lot of humor is milked from the narrator being exasperated with and/or railroading you, a la The Stanley Parable. I found this funny, but given the way To Be or Not To Be is checkpointed, I understand why others might find it frustrating.And that brings me to my biggest problem with To Be or Not To Be: the checkpointing. Checkpoints are infrequent, and while they mostly come at sensible points (at any major scene/plot turn), you'll still end up skipping a lot of text to get back to that one spot where you didn't take the other branching path. It's a minor annoyance, but it's still an annoyance.Additionally, for whatever reason, only some of my checkpoints (and ending art!) ever persist after exiting the game -- this is a known bug, and I'm hoping it'll be patched soon. [Edit: This has since been remedied!]A lesser problem is the sound controls. Although the music and narration volumes have been adjusted since release so the former no longer totally drowns out the latter, there's still no sliders; you can only turn things on or off. My advice: Skip the narration and leave the music on. It's more fun to read the story in your own voice and give the words your own emphasis anyway, and the music really adds to the scenes and the humor in a way that the narration doesn't."

This game has humor for everyone!There were a few technical problems I noticed, but I hope these will be fixed in a patch:1) The music and narration volumes cannot be controlled. This is unfortunate because the music is louder than the narrator's voice, so you can't really play them both and get the full effect of the game.2) I could not find a way to access the options menu with my controller so I had to switch mid-game to a mouse and keyboard.3) We had difficulty figuring out the checkpoint system, but that may have just been us."

I recommend this game for the explanation of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the narration, useful for non-native english speakers who want to learn.However, this game has some minor problems, like the very low amount of checkpoints and the broken stats. More oddly, I downloaded this game twice (once for my home computer and another time for my laptop) and the two versions are different."

Everyone knows the line, and mostly everyone who hears it know that it's from Hamlet, arguably Shakespeare's greatest play, and undoubtedly his longest. But when most people think ""Shakespeare,"" they don't automatically think ""Shakespearian-based-Visual-Novel/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-Game"" as an actual, plausible way to make Hamlet understandable and, indeed, relatable to those unfamiliar with the Bard. As both an avid gamer and someone with a few years of professional training in performing Shakespeare (including a few actual performance credits under my belt), I was surprised to learn of this little gem's existance, and eagerly dove in.Having completed the ""Main"" Storyline, I am entirely satisfied with my purchase...and now look forward to going back through it again and discovering all the crazy tangents and unbeaten paths.For those who've never seen or read Hamlet, the game helpfully marks the choices that take you down the course of the plot with little skulls. To those scared of being overwhelmed with confusing text, fear not, as the game only dips into the play's text for two or three of the more well known speeches. The rest is told in a humorously critical analysis of just what the characters were saying to each other, and just how insulting and coarse the Bard's characters can be sometimes.And that's just the path that follows the Bard's version of the tale. Every choice you make could put you into the shoes of      Hamlet himself, his girlfriend Ophelia, and even the Ghost of King Hamlet Sr. without warning. One of my favorite moments so far came from a sidepath of the Ghost King that took me completely by surprise. I won't spoil it, but that moment alone has made me determined to unlock every possible ending just to see what crazy misadventure happens next.While not the most orthodox way to introduce newcomers to Shakespeare, this game is a treat that should not be passed up by anyone. I give it a 10/10."

It doesn't track with clicking ahead, so unless you only read as fast as the narrator speaks - and I bet you read faster - you'll be constantly bombarded by a voice telling you lines you clicked past 30-60 seconds before.  Incredibly annoying.*whew*  Got that out of my system.  Anyway, this game (more of a massive choose-your-own-adventure book than a GAME) is very clever and very funny, if occasionally irritating.  The humor is surprisingly arch and for all of the ""choosing"" that happens in a choose-your-own-adventure, this one can be unexpectedly railroading at times: lots of ""but that doesn't make sense; are you sure you wouldn't rather xxx?"" or ""humor"" that practically qualifies as self-impressed liberalism writ large.I do recommend it; it really is funny and clever and interesting.

If you like or at least are vaguely okay with them,To Be or Not To Bemight work for you, even if you're not really a fan of Shakespeare'sHamlet.Pros:+ The humor. It's weird and occasionally surreal. There's one route where you briefly become a horse just before the sun explodes, and another one where Ophelia and Hamlet engage in a training montage and become ninjas.+ Lots of endings, almost every one of which comes with its own piece of artwork, which you can look at again in the game's art gallery. I haven't counted how many pieces of artwork there are, but I know that I've been playing this game for almost 5 hours total and I'm still missing 40 or 50.+ Ophelia is awesome.+ It highlights some problems with the original play that I'd never really thought about before. I kind of wish this had been around back when I was studying this play in school.Cons:- The game includes ""checkpoints,"" which are basically ""save"" spots you can return to in order to try out different choices without having to replay everything that came before it. Unfortunately, all you get are the ""checkpoints"" the game provides you with - you can't create your own. The ""Skip"" button is nice and all, but I've gotten really tired of skipping through the pirate scene just so I can get to the stuff right after it. The lack of ability to create your own save points is one of the reasons why I don't think I'm ever going to manage to collect all the pieces of artwork. I don't know that I have the patience for it.- This comes from all the visual novels I've been playing lately, but I really wish there were a ""skip 'read' text"" option.- The narrator doesn't appeal to me at all. Thankfully, you can play the game with narration turned on or off. I started with the narration on and turned it off before I'd even selected the character I was going to play as.All in all, not bad. I don't know that I'll have the willpower to get all the endings and achievements, but this turned out to be way more entertaining than I expected."
