The physics are not bad, but also aren't that good. It's missing all of the Monster Jam trucks. That all being said, depending on the price, it could be just what you need. I got it for $1, and at that price, it was just what I needed to scratch my monster truck game itch. I'm on the fence about recommending it. I guess I have to go with no, because it's just got too many flaws to recommend, but if you can get it for cheap enough, like I did, it's worth a play."

I want to know what type of controller the devs used that actually worked for this game- At the start of a Race or Freestyle mode, Starting Lights do not show up the first time unless you 'restart' the event or quit. Even so, the Starting Lights do not show up even on the 2nd round of races- AI can become AFK- AI runs at half speed or none at all in some moments- AI pathfinding is abysmal- Music quickly becomes repetitive- Only 3-5 soundtracks are in the game- They released this before they even updated the Mobile version, which in fact comes out in SIX weeks- Too many bigfoot Monster Trucks, which narrows the variety- Sadly, the Mobile version of the game puts this in its place- No multiplayer (which is coming to the Mobile version I believe)So overall, this game is NOT worth for what it is currently priced at. i'd say it's worth... maybe nothing? Should be Free-To-Play considering it's almost unplayable. This is highly unprofessional on the condition it was released, due to the fact they have been working on this update for 2 years. I've supported these guys since its release on iOS and have been somewhat satisfied.Just stick to the Mobile version if you already have it or not. Do NOT buy this just yet. A huge disappointment."

I have no control over what I am doing as in choosing different types of gameplay myself. The only keys that work in each section for me are:Main Menu: Esc. , Enter/SpaceIn Game: Arrowkeys/WASD (Going backwards does not work)When I try to select any options with my mouse, nothing happens. I mouse over what I want to do in the game and absolutely nothing happens. The only way to exit the game (in fullscreen) is to CTRL+ALT+DEL out of it. I just exit the program in windowed mode. I have nothing bad to say about the actual driving part besides it is a little too difficulty when you are force to buy one of the weaker trucks first, maybe if you guys tune the trucks that the computer runs down a little bit, it would be a lot more enjoyable for a younger audience that would get frustrated to quickly.I do really think this game has alot of potential. All it needed was a little more time put in to it before its release date. From what I have seen on the trailers of the game it looks great, and that's really what I wanted this game to be. I'm sorry to say it but I can not reccomend this game yet, but like I said before, a little tweaking to this game and it could shoot all the way to the top.P.S. I would also like to say that I have the mobile game for an Apple device, which I have nothing bad to say about. Not to criticize you about another one of your guys's programs, but I see alot of updates are being released for Android phones/tablets and it would be nice if you could release them for Apple devices.

Since that debacle, I have deleted my positive review and pulled that video from youtube. I can't support any dev that attempts to bully people into censorship. This could be the best game ever made and I'd still say don't buy it. What they did was unethical, and disgusting on many levels and it will likely cause their company far worse damage than that single negative review ever did.Devs, it's simple, really, if you can't take criticism, don't make art or consumer products. And instead of going after negative reviews with legal action (that you can't actually take because that isn't how the law works) how about you reach out to the people that actually liked your game and try to build a community? You know, be positive and grow organically, instead of being toxic and unethical. Just a thought."

76561198071042916,Recommended,324760,34087727,Posted: 7 August,all,PlatinumSwords,"This is a review for anyone that wants info on the game without the ""DEVS SUCK"" or ""This Game Sucks"" short review. The game is decent but it will not be for everybody. Most trucks are based off of the Bigfoot family of trucks with USA 1 and Bear Foot included. No Gravedigger or Max D for you Monster Jam fans.The physics are decent enough for a game that started out as a mobile game. You will not do a multi back flip or anything unrealistic. You can do a back flip but you have to have enough HP on your truck to pull one off.Handling: There is a half second delay when turning so start your turn early. Sometimes after taking a jump, the truck will pop a wheelie while drag racing but difficult to do when doing freestyle. Can't tell you why that is.There are times when you get hung up on pieces of objects within the arena for no reason and that can get aggrivating. The trucks sometimes snare onto invisible objects and you are just stuck trying to rock the truck free from nothing. These things happen rarely but enough to aggrivate you when you're winning a race and you get caught for no reason.You can determine the graphics for yourself by looking at the slide show above. They are decent enough for me but other hardcore realism purists might get turned off by it.In all, I enjoy it. I just purchased it and 2 hours flew by like nothing. If you want a monster truck game based off of real world tracks with actual physics and a not cartoony feel to it, then check this game out.And yeah, the devs are jerks for threatening a reviewer the way they did, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna recommend  this game because I enjoyed it."

76561198298328960,Recommended,324760,28959791,Posted: 2 January,all,Aphix__Dejaeson,"This is the greatest monster truck game there ever was ! Lots of trucks to buy, a good number of tracks and 3 main story mode tours to do.  The game is basic when it comes to graphics and gameplay but its alot of fun. There is no look back option but there are a few good camera angles to choose from. Interior view is pretty good.Handling wise you can adjust the sensitivity slider to your liking. It makes the game more enjoyable. The A.I is pretty good for the most part, although you can see them screw up a bit too. Sometime's they can waste you and others edge you out of a win. The game isn't graphically AAA+ but it really does have a good authentic monster truck feel for whats on display. Those who watch the sport will approach driving over vehicles and barriers much like they do in real life, with ease and then a lot throttle,,, the end result is satisfying. Nothing better than seeing the caving in of cars, vans, rvs and busses while driving over them.You pick a low level truck to start with and build it up by winning races and freestyle events. Earning in game credits to do so. The crowd is pretty responsive to whats going on in game on the track as well.Overall the game is pretty good. Watching gameplay video's via YouTube just doesn't do it justice. You have to feel it for yourself.For a $5 price tag ($2.80 on sale) It is worth the price. I give the game a8.5/10.Solid monster truck game Mr. Odd Games, solid monster truck game."
76561198243279440,Not Recommended,324760,29245268,Posted: 14 January,all,EponymousX,"I'd like to preface this review by stating that this particular motorsport subgenre has been either ignored or given a pretty crappy treatment for decades. ""Why"" you ask? It’s simply not popular enough. The fan base has shrunk over the years and therefore, we go largely ignored because we aren’t the cash cow fans of NASCAR or Final Fantasy. So, developers mainly produce the same games year after year without really branching out most of the time. Once in a while we get an odd duck that’s out of the blue from companies like EA or Rockstar Games that just works and gets popular and is what we wanted. Most of the time though, us small track visiting, mug bog loving, tractor pulling, monster truck watchers get ignored. The last decent attempt at dirt track games that focused on small towns and even smaller tracks was from RatBag. Dirt Track Racing 2 was great, even included wheel support, but no monster trucks. The last monster truck game available on the market was some sort of variant of twisted metal featuring the trucks from the USHRA series (I believe). And let’s face it; Us mature rednecks prefer a purer response when we ask to crush cars from the safety of our homes.In comes ODD Games with the Android port: Monster Truck Destruction. I feel it’s a solid entry into a subgenre that has been abused like a red-headed step child.Upon my first play of this game, I admit, I had to use xpadder and some magic gamer dust to get this to work, but the patches came pretty quick and after a while, I didn’t need xpadder or any kind of trick to run it. It just works now. I find that there still are bugs, but none which make the game completely unplayable such as the tree disappearing in a drag mode. (Shut up and just hit restart, ya pansy.) There is another glitch in freestyle where it will miss tricks or fail to continuously add combos without a restart or two once in a while.On to bigger and badder fish, the trucks. They did include some interesting entries like “Wild Thang”, “Snake Bite”, and “Bigfoot 5”. Scrolling through the list kind of makes you think the game was partially funded by the good folks at Big Foot, when you realize that there are 15 (possibly more) trucks that Big Foot owns. Kind makes me long for a customization option. I’m happy for now though, as most of the trucks feature different wheelbases, and weight distributions which heavily effect driving style. After you get through upgrading a few trucks and really delving in, you’ll find that the AI is kind of Odd. The will either go fine to the finish, or lose their line and go nuts, flip over and reset. As of this review (1/13/2017) This hasn’t been fixed. Either way, just keeping your truck in line is a task as they drive pretty well and require you to fight all of those horsepower, as you negotiate turns, avoid obstacles, and mash it when you see the line. I find that when the AI is acting fine, they provide a better challenge on later levels.You will also notice that the upgrade system is a bit on the rudimentary side, as buying better parts does effect things like handling or acceleration independently of each other, all you’re really told is that the bar describing the truck’s “power” goes up with ever purchase of an upgrade. I feel like there is a lot of room to expand on this feature alone. A lot more parts could be added, maybe prices adjusted to a real world standard, and a true rating system for trucks before, during, and after upgrading would be a beautiful feature here. However, the fact that we even have this is a miracle if you consider what we’ve gotten in the past.There are several modes of play including Single event, Career, and Online Multiplayer. Personally, I prefer career. It’s just fun to zone out and go nuts. In my opinion, the online piece needs an overhaul. People will routinely leave in the middle of a match and it’s generally just like a free-for-all. Single event is good for practicing a complex track you haven’t mastered yet and for setting a best time. I feel as though they can expand on this as well. In the 90’s, they did tug of war, mud bog, hill climb, water races, and so much more. We already have the groundwork, guys, we just need to build upward.Is this game worth it? Yes, I’ve certainly gotten my 6 or 7 out of it and then some just mashing around in Bigfoot One and doing terrible things to it and the earth itself. No, the graphics aren’t perfect, no, the damage models aren’t perfect, the handling isn’t quite perfect, and there are certain things that need to be fixed but trust me, this game takes up very little Space on your drive, has a low price, and it isn’t half bad.What can be done to make this perfect? Since ODD games seems to be a little…preoccupied at the moment, I feel as though the best move would be to turn this diamond in the rough over to the modding community and let them put the shinin’ rag to it. There are hundreds of talented modders out there who could give us something incredible from the mundane. (Just a thought, guys. -wink-)In conclusion, buy this game. If you are any fan of monster trucks, 90’s monster trucks, 80’s monster trucks, monster truck racing, or freestyle, you won’t be disappointed. It has never failed to draw me back to it, despite it’s issues. Sort of like an ex that you can’t quite stop seeing but you don’t know why. I mean, they have their little issues, but overall they are a good person and one hell of a lay.So, why not give a little for a monster truck booty call that ain’t so bad to chill with from time to time and the best entry in this subgenre in decades. After all, we have to make the best out of what we have. It’s not like big companies are knocking down our doors to give use great monster truck games.-Bullet Tampon-"

I play alot of different racing games and as far as Monster Truck racing and freestyle goes this one rocks.  The physics of this game are perfectly balanced.  I do think they could of taken alittle more time and detailed some of the tracks better.  The school bus's look like 8bit graphics and when damaging the vehicles the effects are really pretty cheap, but all in all I find myself coming back to this game more and more.  And for the fun this game offers its well worth the price.  I'm really hoping they will release DLC maybe more tracks, better damage models and more trucks.

As of 27/7/2015 there is CONTROLLER SUPPORT! :D THANK YOU for adding that, developers!At last, it's properly playable on a PC and it's a fantastic game.The only downside has to be the menus - they're really scrappy and not really functioning well with the controller, but thankfully there's a mouse pointer for that. It would be lovely to see an update to tidy up the menus in the future.That said, the gameplay is top notch. At the price it's on here for, you won't get better monster truck physics anywhere else.. it's tough as nails but great fun too, with lots of content to keep you busy :)"

I really like this game on steam much better, we are using an xbox controller and it is much more fun to play and better to drive than the pe version! I highly reccomend."

Controls are really easy to master2. The graphics are GREAT3. It's crazy cheap when on saleCons:1. AI needs to be dumbed down a bit because they are way too fast in racing and win all the time in freestyleI recommend   11/10

76561198004697269,Recommended,324760,17196131,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,ScratchPruf,With the new patch. The game works pretty darn well. I loved it on the iphone and android. I love it even more now that it is on the PC. For a $4 game and the controls patch. well worth the money for any Monster Truck fan. The best MT game since Monster Truck Madness 2. Now if we can get a track and truck editor or at the very least a track editor. :)I think people were a little quick to through stones at the game. Its not like it was a AAA title at $60.

,Recommended,324760,17021535,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Boneyard649,"While the controls were slightly wonky, since I could not find the reverse key, it made it hard in some freestyle situations. all in all, however, the game plays very smooth and is overall a great game! My playstation 3 wired controller worked great with the game, so I had good controller support! Two things need fixed so far: reverse control and the texture for Bigfoot 5 when the shell takes roll damage. At least on mine, the mesh jacks up when you roll it."

All they are missing is Grave Digger and Master of Disaster and it would be complete. Actually pretty decent physics engine here, I'm not 100% about it being true to life, but it's consistant. A ton of fun though! Difficulty is at a good level I think, with going fast scoring more but going out of control will lose you races. I might be a bit biased here with nostalgia, but I haven't seen a better one on Steam.  Worth every penny imo. 8/10"
