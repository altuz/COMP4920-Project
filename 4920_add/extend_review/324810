The game feels more like the original UT than any of the newer ones.  The game looks beautiful, runs great and the AI is top notch sometimes even placing among real players.This game is not your typical shooter, it is what shooters were back in the early 2000's: arenas filled with guns and letting you loose to kill everything. No muss no fuss, this game is fantastic and well worth my $12. I have not had any issues with the multiplayer to this point, I have lost connection a couple of times but I was able to find a new game very quickly.Support these devs and buy this kickass game!9/10"

In 2017??Speaking as a huge unreal tournament fan, I was a bit skeptical of the game's claim that it is a ""spiritual successor to the FPS giants of the late 90's"". But 30 seconds into the demo, I was absolutely blown away at how closely the developers replicated the style of unreal tournament. I immediately fell into the familiar groove of running, strafing, jumping and shooting, and the game perfectly captures what made unreal tournament so great: the constant and nagging urge to get one more frag. I saw that it even has a recreation of the famous DM-Deck map, although it wasnt available to play in the demo.Will definitely snag this title once it goes on sale."

There's too many reviews that just say ""Good game."" Right?The gunplay is as you'll expect, however you might find it difficult moving at the dizzying speeds you move around. (Have a bucket ready)There is currently one map, which is all mappy and stuff - the map design is very well done and the visuals of the game might ruin your pants. (Have a spare pair ready)This are pretty much the main simple pro's and con's of the game.Pro'sCon'sGreat gunplay and movement.Weapons unbalanced according to some of player base.Fair amount of populated servers.Limited Server Locations.Amazing map design.Only one map currently.But I'm pretty sure you want my opinion, right?! What!? you dont wan- HAVE IT ANYWAY!Upon respawn, you will start with a puny weapon. You will sometimes spawn right next to people who have rocket launchers who will murder you. No matter how much you scream ""Come at me bro!!"" you will still die alot on respawn.Camping is encouraged by the respawn times of weapons actually being shown to the players. Do you want to run around with a pistol still, or wait 2 seconds for the rocket launcher? I think we would all wait the 2 seconds. In my opinion the game would be improved in future by removing the visible timings.tl;dr: The game is great considering early access, it has flaws, which are pretty much tiny. Some weapons will destroy you, but hey.. welcome to arena fps!"

It looks like a triple-A release from last gen, which isn't meant as a criticism. It's pretty.There are all the old-school movement and twitch-responses here and the weapons feel meaty and give plenty of kick. It's nice to be able to customise the avatars too and I think the developers have taken the right track with awarded-exp going towards rank upgrades.I can see myself coming back to this game regularly and I'm looking forward to how it develops in future."

But in the upcoming patches things are going to be scaled up and down so that it feels a lot more comfortable.Anyone that is a fan for Character Customization, this game has a few bits and bobs that the player can play around with to tweak their character.- Two selectable armor types [Factions]- Glow Colours for lighting- Patterns and Textures- Armor Colours- Clan Tag- Name TagAlthough it may not seem like much there will hopefully be more on the way to look forward to.Toxikk has options for 'Mutators' Just like that in Unreal, I haven't had a look into any of them, if any yet. But Player created content is going to be widely available.There seems to be a ranking system in the game but, the XP seems to scale up infinitely so... Where that goes... I have no idea, Ranks and rewards will be most likely implemented later.Other things that can be a little bit arsey with the game is the likes of it's optimization and support for other platforms such as MAC & Linux, but apart from that...In a nutshell, the game is fantastic, has brilliant visuals, isn't 'pay 2 win' or 'free 2 play' and is definately a fully skill based shooter.- Windowlicker -"

The game's credo, ""frag like it's 1999"" is right on the money.  If you are a Quake fan or UT fan from back in the day, you have to give this game a try.  It really recaptures the old feel and mechanics of arena shooters from ~15 years ago.   This game is what the DOOM 2016 multiplayer should have been.   Seriously, give it a try -- it's free, there's no risk.  I played about an hour of the free version and then bought a 4 pack to try to get some friends into the action, and to support this kind of development.Suggestion to the developer, you might have a publicity problem.  I'm in the USA and I hadn't heard about this game until yesterday.   I wish I had been playing when it officially dropped last fall.  Keep up the good work, and keep trying different advertising strategies to get more US players into the game.

The control and movement are razor-sharp yet simple - I haven't played much yet, but so far I've never felt like I was fighting the controls. The dodge modifier key is a welcome change from the old double-tap mechanic in UT99.The weapons are solid and have a good feel.  I found myself wanting to try them all out rather than just sticking with the rocket launcher.I've only seen one of the three available deathmatch maps, and haven't checked out CTF yet, but so far so good.In short, if you loved arena FPS games like UT or Q3, you will enjoy this.  If you never got into those games but you're looking for a fast-paced, fun, and easy-to-pick-up FPS, this is just the ticket.Now I just have to wait until they release the other maps.

Especially for an indie developer. The game is perfectly stable, crash-free, and runs smooth as silk on my PC. Was able to set my options and join an online match within seconds, no problems whatsoever. The game runs on Unreal Engine 4.It has all of the settings you would expect from a proper PC game. World detail, shadow detail, light shafts, AF level, multiple forms of anti-aliasing, different framerate caps, V-sync, and FOV slider that can go well over 100. I'm playing it on the ""Very High"" preset with a few extra tweaks. I'm sure I can run it on ""Ultra"" just fine, but I haven't bothered trying yet. It's such a fast-moving game that there isn't much point in stopping to admire the pretty graphics (but it's a very pretty game anyway).The menus are laid out well, the server browser is slick and functional, and - as I said - the whole game feels extremely polished.Fans of Quake and Unreal Tournament will feel right at home here. The devs have been pretty straightforward about their resentment toward F2P games and microtransactions. There's no leveling, loadouts, XP, or any other ""modern"" FPS features. No sprinting, no ADS. Bunnyhopping is alive and well. The rocket launcher is the most devastating weapon in the game (as it should be), but it's not fast enough or explosive enough that it doesn't require skill.The weapon spawn points actually have a timer floating above them to show when they will respawn. A clever feature that I have never seen in an arena shooter before.The one little gripe I had is that I couldn't modify my settings during a match. Had to back out to the main menu to change my mouse sensitivity. A bit frustrating but something you'll only have to deal with once.The other thing I should point out, is that there is, literally, only one map right now. But it's a very fun, polished, and well-designed map. Lots of branching paths without feeling too cramped. My understanding is that the developers are working on balance right now, and will release maps over time; the next map probably being sometime in early February.Really glad I took the risk on this game. The people making it are obviously pretty passionate. If you're looking for classic deathmatch-style gameplay with a modern coat of paint, it's a must-have."

Then give Toxikk a try!Still in very early access as of this review, Toxikk is a pretty damn solid arena shooter in the stylings of Unreal Tournament and Quake, and celebrates itself as one with all the polish of a next-generation game. It prioritizes the importance of a responsive, enjoyable gunplay and does it in spades, with a very fun arsenal of weapons, each with their own functions and purpose. The balancing is overall handled very solidly, and does enough to not just clone the arsenals of it's source materials and be unique in that regard.It's also a very visually good-looking game so far. Again, very early access, but they really make some good-looking character models and environments that are not only bright and colorful, but look really fantastic amid all the havoc.If I had to be critical about something, it'd be that the game does celebrate the late 90's/early 2000's era of arena shooters, but it makes me think more of something like Unreal Tournament 3 as opposed to the original of 1999. Maybe it's just the modern aesthetic, and in some ways this is to it's benefit, but I do feel it tries too hard the style of something like UT99, but being much closer to UT3 in terms of style and aesthetic.Regardless of my minor nitpicks, this game is definitely worth a look if you're a shooter guru looking for something new to try. Updates come out fairly regularly, and they're definitely doing a good job so far with the game's quality."

Lobby-based games kinda killed server-lurking, and Toxikk requires some server-lurking to see it shine. Get a full 8v8 match with real people, and it turns into a freakin' gem.It's still got some rough edges, and if you're expecting something with ""modern weapon"" values, you're best served to look elsewhere. Toxikk is tooled around spamming rockets, bullets, and not blinking for five minutes at a time. You'll probably see a lot of complaining about balance--but any player that remembers playing UT '99 when it was new will tell you that's a load. You'll see rockets, grenades, energy beams, shotgun blasts... and it's a riot. I nearly had an aneurism when I first read some of the threads cropping up about the rockets being OP--back in the day, you didn't get to tank three hits, you gibbed.My only real complaint so far is limited to the Raven starting pistol. Don't bother with it--unlike the Enforcer of UT fame, the Raven is essentially there to keep heads from popping around a corner in time for you to snag a real weapon pickup; which is disappointing. Entire strategies existed for single and dual Enforcers, and I'd like to see the same come into this as well.For an early access title, it's rather well assembled. The maps are pretty and hectic, with natural hotspots that gravitate players so you spend more time shooting and less time running, the weapons are cathartic and satisfying, and the play itself is quite satisfying when you rustle up three spare warm bodies."

As the game's description outlines, it plays much closer to older games like Quake or Unreal Tournament (incorporating things such as map placement of weapons as opposed to preset loadouts and non-regenerating health) and ends up being a refreshing change of pace from what you get with a lot of online shooters these days. However, considering there's only one map and the weapon balance/map placement is still being worked out I'd probably recommend people to wait for a couple updates just to have a bit of variety and not get burned out on playing it before the game's at its full potential. Regardless though, the core gameplay is entertaining and it seems like there's a lot of promise in this for anyone that just wants an Unreal Tournament-style game to get into so it may still be worth checking out if only to see the solid foundation the developers have laid.And who knows, maybe they'll call it something else by the time it officially releases; otherwise you might want to boot up some eroge like Sakura Angels or a valley girl simulator - such as the critically acclaimed Barbie Dreamhouse Party - before jumping on here and save yourself the embarrassment of your friends seeing you playing something that sounds and looks like a bad Xbox Live gamertag."

,Recommended,324810,15874525,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,ajerk,"Toxikk review  version .86First ImpressionsThe game has just amazing graphics, with fun gameplay that is similar to the Original UT, and is just darn fun to play.Lets start off with the graphics, this game has very good graphics, and uses ironically the Unreal Engine. I say Ironically because in my opinion this game is better than the last few Unreal Tournament games. This game runs about 30-40fps on my R9-m290x, depending on the  map milage varies. The texture detail is nice, what you would come to expect from a AAA UT release.Game play is fun, it plays just like the original UT, with a few improvements that I think add a lot to the game.  Weapons feel a lot like they Did from UT, They look similar and function pretty much the same way they did. You're going to find yourself picking one up and say this is the Plasma Rifle. Some weapons vary a little, in the alternate fire modes, but they will feel familiar.One of the little Improvements they made is after you kill an enemy they drop a health pack. What a simple reward for killing someone, it really prolongs the carnage. The health pack is available for anyone to pick up so if you are in the right spot at the right time you can grab that health pack after someone else’s kill, however the reverse is also true, wait too long and someone else will get it.I think that the bot ai might be a have a steep learning curve, as on the easy setting (ridiculous ) they will literally walk by you and not even notice that you're there.Compared to that to higher difficulty and you see situations where Ai will mop you up pretty easily. This could just be my lack of experience with the game, but it seems that in order to get off the higher difficulty you're going to have to die a lot.One of the things I can’t get over is just how much fun this game is to play. I have said it before but this game just is so much like the original UT the only way to get much closer is to Remake the Original using today's Graphics. The whole game just is familiar if you have played the original UT, the game play should just come to you naturally. I have also said that I think this is a lot better than Epic’s Newer UT, and I meant it  The game just has captured the core of what a Deathmatch FPS should be and ran with  it.Right now there are several game modes, including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, which are blood lust, Squad assault, and Cell capture, Read Deathmatch, team deathmatch, and CTF. Nothing special to note here other than they do have some vehicles in the game.They have put in a nice scoring system, for every kill you get you get x points, for and for every double kill, killing spree or whatever you may have gotten you get additional points. In capture the cell games a cell capture gets you points, so it might be possible to win the game just on the number of points.Final thoughts.More people need to buy this game and get in the online mode, just because the online play looks to be a little slow right now. That is just do to a total lack of players right now though. Buy this game and you wont regret it I promise."

After playing this for a few hours on a friends account (not mine if my current hours are any indication), I felt like I was playing UT/UT2k4 again or any good arena shooter, which is a relief from all the copy/paste military shooters out there (COD I'm looking at you). And don't get me wrong I enjoy my Battlefields or Tactical shooters/simulators (not battlefield) most of them (minus HL been playing them since 1942), but it is getting a little long in the tooth. Yes, I am well aware of the open source Quake/Quake clones (e.g. Quake Live, Nexuiz, Alien Arena, Warsow etc.), but they werent quite the same or no one plays it seems. It seemed like arena shooters were dead until I saw Tribes: Ascend but that eventually died too. It seemed like there weren't any new TRUE arena shooters to be found console or PC-wise ( well Halo is sort of, and I want to really stress sort of...)

That's TOXIKK.TOXIKK takes you back to those days in which there was an incredible amount of chaos, explosions and people dying everywhere, TONS of pickups, etc. It clashes old with new and brings the PERFECT balance between the two generations in which there are no breathers except intermissions between matches, and no standing still to aim to take your shot, just fire away.The story goes like this : Drayos and Exocom are two giant companies battling for global domination. There, done, go, fight to the death. In the profile menu when you click on customization, you get a semi-wide variety of options. Pick which company you fight for (Which you can change at any time, they just have different variants of what your armor looks like) colors of your armor, the secondary color, and the color of the glowy lights on the armor even. Name tag in which it displays whatever you want on your armor, and you can change color of the text, too, and a clan tag, so if clans are your thing (Which they aren't for me) there ya go.There is an experience ranking system like in modern day shooters which you can only earn from matches with real people, and not bots as common sense would dictate. That unlocks more colors, armor types, etc. and the maximum rank is 16.The weapons are a heavy dosage of classic deathmatch kind of firearms and they have new names and a bit of backstory, too, and each weapon comes with a secondary fire.Ravager : The Ravager was used as a demolition tool in the future to tear down buildings without having to rely on heavy wrecking gear, but it works great as a melee weapon in combat apparently as well. The drill is the primary fire and the secondary ignites a plasma flame based wielding beam that can only be useful at close range and can repair (Another subject I'll touch on) vehicles. Oh and ammo is non-existent.Raven : Your everyday average pistol but with a cool sci-fi design. It's gonna be your bread-and-butter of the battlefield basically. Primary is a shot, secondary is a three round burst-fire but requires a short cool-down, which, in a game like this, is NOT handy, but it still can quickly kill, providing your aim is more than average. Holds up to fifty rounds.Bullcraft : Shotgun! Useful only at close range of course, nice little pump-action tool to use, very handy in cramped maps or maps that don't really have huge open spaces meaning that there'll be more of a chance of close-quarters-combat scenarios to put it to good use. Primary, single shell, 6 pellets. Secondary, double shell, 12 (duh). Holds up to 24 shells, use them wisely.Violator : Very reliable assault rifle for close, mid-range, MAYBE long-range combat, depending on where the hostile is located. Primary, FULLY AUTOMATIC ASSAULT BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Secondary, pump-action grenade launcher attachment. Holds 90 rounds, starts out with 30.Falcon : A sniper-rifle. Not the most useful for clusterf**k arenas and stuff, but a not-so-populated server it serves pretty well. Primary, fires. Secondary, scope with 32x zoom. Comes with 9, but holds up to 30 ""deep impact"" rounds. Headshots cause instant death, the only thing to save you is just sheer player speed and dodging skills. Has a slow fire-rate.Stingray : Plasma rifle! Basically an upgraded in all ways Violator. Primary, shoots blue plasma orbs at opponents. Secondary, Railgun like plasma beam that can really obliterate targets providing you hit them. Energy beam is hit-scan. 80 plasma rounds, or EDEN energy units if you will, comes with 40. Headshot with beam = instant death.Dragoneer : Perfect weapon to fight off multiple opponents, for this my friends, is a flamethrower! Least glitchy flamethrower I've ever seen in a video game, so that's good. Good for close range encounters with players, and the primary fire is a ray of burning napalm, secondary is a charge-and-release napalm fireball that can travel over 50 meters, losing effectiveness over time of course before it completely dissolves. Holds 60 rounds of napalm, starts with 30.Cerberus : 90s Deathmatch arena shooters would not be complete without a rocket launcher, and here is the grand-daddy! Shoulder-fired launcher with a silo magazine and ""Hades"" missiles. Primary, fires a rocket! Secondary, aiming reticle turns circular and laser sight turns on to guide the missile. Comes with 12 Hades missiles and holds up to 20. REMEMBER, AIM AT THE FEET. And there, now you're a pro rocket launcher!Hellraiser, THE Hellraiser : Stays true to it's name, this megalith sized weapon is incredibly difficult to find and is rightfully so! Devastating amount of damage so much so, that I haven't found a safe spot to fire it from without killing myself! Primary, unguided death-struction sphere. Secondary, remote controlled sphere-missile projectile! Fueled by ONE Beryllium (Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is created through stellar nucleosynthesis and is a relatively rare element in the Universe. Beryl is a form of mineral made from beryllium and other elements and Emerald is actually a green colored form of Beryl and many other famous minerals. Sorry about the science-expo.) Fusion Gasificator. Obliterates just about...Life, the Universe, and Everything.Some maps in TOXIKK feature vehicles such as :Phantom : The PHANTOM is a medium sized assault bomber, excellently suited for providing air support to infantry units in difficult terrain. Vehicle type, assault bomber. Primary, Minigun. Secondary, unguided missiles. Special ability, maneuvers at high altitudes.Demon : The DEMON is a heavily armored BATTLE MECH. It's not really fast, but can dodge, jump and even hover/fly utilizing its limited amount of boost energy. The DEMON's weaponry comes with two heavy miniguns and a multi-rocket launcher which launches up to eight missiles simultaneously. It's a devastating beast and confronting it on the battlefield shouldn't be taken on lightly. Vehicle type, battle mech. Primary, dual minigun. Secondary, multi-rocket launcher. Special ability, dodge, jump, hover/fly (Not so special to me).Rhinoceros : The RHINO is a 4x4 powered high mobility vehicle for two passengers. Press [1] or [2] to switch between the driver and the gunner seat. Press [SPACE] while driving to activate its boost mode. While in boost mode, press [E] to eject from the Rhino and to initiate its self-destruction sequence. If there's a gunner aboard, he'll be ejected too. This way the Rhino can be used as a high-speed land torpedo to destroy heavy targets. Vehicle type : 4x4 high-mobility vehicle. Primary, plasma projectiles. Secondary, focused plasma beam. Special ability, Kamikaze torpedo/ boost mode.Streamer :  The STREAMER is a very fast and highly strategic vehicle. Whenever you need to cover long distances, press [G] TO SPAWN A BIKE (keep in mind that the spawn requires your suit to be fully charged and the map to support vehicles). It's also good to know that THE STREAMER IS THE ONLY VEHICLE THAT YOU CAN USE WHILE CARRYING THE ENEMY'S ENERGY CELL. If this doesn't mean anything to you, ...you're not supposed to read this. Vehicle type, hoverbike. Primary, N/A. Secondary, N/A. Special ability, very fast/ can be spawned.There's also the Banshee, but I'm running out of space! All in all, an excellent well-polished and made game. I feel like I made this review too long and all of you just skimmed through it. 9/10 The reason being the community is small and you mostly have to play with bots. Definitely worth your time if you like games like Quake II and Unreal Tournament."

You'll see over the top weapons, vehicles, and trick jumping. It has the modes anyone who played UT, Quake, DOOM, DUKE 3D, ROTT, etc. will remember. The quintessential Death match, and Team Deathmatch, along with Point Capture, and Capture The Flag. UT2k4 fans will be pleased to know that a few of the maps make for VEHICULAR CTF, and VEHICULAR PC stages too.But there are also some things for people who never played these kinds of FPS games before. Particularly going through the tutorial levels, as they'll get you better acclimated with the trick jumping. Which is tied to the layouts of the maps. It's also crucial for avoiding the myriad of bullets, lasers, rockets, grenades, and fireballs headed your way. It may seem daunting at first but I highly recommend checking it out.

However, because it is plagued with the disease commonly referred to medical practitioners as ""EA"", the game suffers from a lack of content at the moment. There is one map and two gamemodes. Gamemodes right now include Bloodlust - Free for All and something something Team Deathmatch. That is not to say it is boring, it certainly caught my eye with stunning visuals: Explosions, gun animations, fluorescent lights, reflections, etc. are all very well and pretty.I hope that in the near future, we will see the maps and vehicles shown around E3 2014.

I know it's early access but I still paid for the game give me at least 3 maps.-The lens flare on the lights is distracting-Map hitboxs are inconsistentTHE CEREBUS - Let me start by saying that this is the reason I stopped playing. The Cerebus is a rocket launcher which you can pick up near the center of the map. It's an OP weapon which almost everyone uses. People would rather not use skill and instead use this OP weapon and think they're good because they're getting loads of kills. YOU CAN NOT USE ANT OTHER WEAPON BECAUSE THE CEREBUS IS BETTER. The damage of the weapon isn't the problem It's the firing rate of it. You can't escape it and it just ruins the game and until they tweak the weapon I'm not playing online because I'd rather use a veriaty of guns.Overall the games great but maybe don't buy it yet...

Toxikk seems to want to be a small niche shooter for those gamers who want to enjoy a arcade/arena shooter, it runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and plays quite well. The speed seems to feel faster and more intended compared to UT3 which is a blessing but as you can tell by any screenshot it feels very much alike in terms of design. Toxikk seems to copy the atmosphere of UT3 which can feel kinda wierd with how simple and clean arena shooters are meant to look, more of an opinion, but they certainly could have picked a more vibrant map to showcase the game with then the one in Hong Kong, which can feel very much like Shangri La off UT3.Now the movement and fluidity of the game feels overall very good as it should be. I spend a few matches alone just dodging in and out of areas. And the guns used in our single map seem to work really damn well. The guns so far implemented are the...Raven (Handgun with an alternate fire burst of 3-4 rounds EXTREAMLY like UT3),Bullcraft (Shotgun with a great alternate fire with a pretty beefy blast radius somewhat feels like a flack cannon), Violator (Assult machine gun with a canon style launch alternate fire kinda like flack guns alternate),Falcon (Simple sniper rifle with nice looks but wish it was a lightning gun),Stingray (Acts like a much quicker link gun with a shock rifle type alternate fire),Dragoneer (Flame through that does quite good in close quarters usually I would think these would suck in arena fps),Cerberus (Rocket launcher, unfortunately doesn't fire more then one rocket with alternate).Weapons seem pretty good so far and there alternate fire is very well done.The developers might have a pretty good flushed out game on their hands that really has released at a good time. A lot of arena shooters are in development and the only big one thats open source is far from completion on the new UE4. If players continue to recieve weekly or biweekly updates on maps and they are flushed out and don't feel sammy there will be great success. Keep doin what you're doin devs. I hope to see that one map in the preview with snow and a mountain/lake soon! Show us players other gametypes that we could put those weapons to use with, looks good."

If you enjoy any of those games, you'll know what to expect.Negatives:Vehicle modes, which I found the most interesting aspect of the game and would actually set this apart from Reflex Arena, are downplayed in favour of routine run-and-gun arena shooting. But the weapon set is generic and not very enjoyable to use, resulting in a very average experience that doesn't really excel in any particular area.Most dissapointing, though, was how the developers left the game to languish in early access for too long, with too few content updates to maintin a healthy playerbase.

The controls are tight, the game is simple and hard to master, and it is frantic without being chaotic. The game lacks some maps, i think only 8 maps atm give or take, but the steamworkshop communitty has got that covered, and they have even brought some maps from Unreal Tournament over into TOXIKK too. Also, if you have ever played Unreal Tournament then you know what the game is like. In my opinion, it doesn't really matter if URT is better than TOXIKK and vice versa, TOXIKK is fresh while still maintaining that old classic 90's shooter feel. Not to mention that TOXIKK released in todays internet society, meaning it has alot of potential of becoming popular because of things like Youtube and the like. Also, the developers even offer a shareware (free) version of their game, meaning if all you wanna do is frag like no tomorrow without any preference then you can just download that instead. Now I must confess, I was not old enough to experience the hype and success of the games Doom and Quake (where deathmatch started, though TOXIKK has way more in common with URT), and I didnt really understand Unreal Tournament when I played it, I was too young and still in diapers. However, I DO get to experience a game like this, something that is similar but slightly different to those two games, something that I can call my own. This game has the potential to pull in fresh players like me and old vets from Quake and URT to play TOXIKK, and boy do I hope it does just that and its not me having wishfull thinking. This game makes me want to go up against masters of this type, to see what true skill is to see a player dominate the map with all weapons. So to anyone having doubts, try the shareware version before you buy! I did and I don't regret a thing."

I can keep selecting ''apply,' but it won't go away, forcing me to manually close the game.The game plays fantastic. Currently only one map, but the game feels fantastic. I'll give it a cautious recommendation and hope that it gets updated very soon.EDIT: The game seems to be locked at 17 fps for me. This is...odd. I get 30fps at the splash screens.

The gunplay is satisfying and every weapon feels good to use, even though some of them are highly unbalanced at the current moment (looking at you Cerberus).The graphics are great aswell as the artstyle, really fits the game.So far there is only one map available which is a bummer but it's Alpha/Beta/Early Access/Whatever-you-want-to-call so it's not too much of a hassle. The map layout is good with some open areas and a lot of chokes and close corners that ""enforces"" CQC, kinda wish they would add a larger map aswell so we would have a bit more variety.To sum it up:Pros:- Great and clutch controls- Satisfying gun-play- Good graphics- A bit of fresh air from the current trend of modern military shooters- Brings back memories of the good old days of Arena FPS's- Good hitboxes and netcode (atleast what I've experienced)Cons:- Only one map, will be fixed eventually.- Unbalanced guns- Seems to be a bug that when you spawn your gun doesn't pop up immedietly meaning you are defenseless for a few seconds (might be server lag?)- To remove mouse acceleration completely you have to edit .ini files."

Toxikk sticks to a very tried and true formula, which is great, however the biggest flaw right now isn't even with the game itself, but with the community, or lack thereof. Although this game has over 1000 reviews (at the time of this review), I sadly rarely encounter other players, many servers at least in the US are either completely empty or sparsely populated at all. There are very few maps, 3 in total I believe (Twin Peaks, Foundry and Artifact), which might be why the lack of players. Luckily the Bot A.I. is pretty well done, especially at the harder difficulties the A.I. opponents can provide more than enough challenge for those who aren't Arena Shooter vets. What I think this game needs right now is some publicity, and maybe a small sale to encourage people to adopt early."

,Recommended,324810,14187850,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,fortris,"REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED AS GAME PROGRESSESIf you don't want to read a long review, then here's an easy choice:If you LOVED UT2004 (or the Unreal Tournament series in general) and want to support/play a very early version of what could be a phenominal game buy it for the cheaper price now.If you always preferred Quake over Unreal Tournament, or don't want to buy a unfinished game, don't puchase this.It's as simple as that.For a more IN DEPTH review, here are my thoughts so far.-ProsFantastic movement system, you can set how fast your double taps dodge or even use another key entirely to dodge in the position you're moving, which is excellent for newer players (or baddies like me).Weapons actually feel varied, and a lot actually adapt to team colors when picked up (like the stingray, instead of the traditional teal shots they will change to a darker blue for the blue team or a red for the red team) which is a nice touch.Game looks fantastic, running on the Unreal 3 engine (sadly not 4, but I supposed it's been in development for a long time) and still looks great. Plenty of graphical settings to tweak, which is expected of a PC only game.Is actually FUN to play, one of the most important aspects of a game period. It's entertaining and if you've loved Unreal Tournament you will most likely love this.-ConsIt is early access.At the time of writing there is only one map, and two modes.Now has two maps and three modes, deathmatch, team deathmatch and CTF.Know what you're getting into and realize the possibility (not assuming anything, just stating it could happen) the devs abandon the game similar to other early access titles. Only buy this if you trust that the devs will deliver on their plans.Balance is off right now, again it is early and this will most likely be sorted out, but it's worth noting that the cerberus is a one hit on fresh spawns and fires far too quickly, while the starting pistol is essentially worthless. While it's worth noting the starting pistol should be BAD, this is almost unusable.Game has been properly balanced, weapons all feel fair as of now.Leveling system is, well, superfluous. It doesn't do anything at the moment, it's incredibly easy to level up (even bots give levels) and the numebers go rediculously high (I think I'm level 670 at the moment?). I don't understand why a system that is completely unneeded or unused is in the current build, but this is basically nitpicking since it doesn't do anything.So overall, if you trust the devs to finish the game and want to play it now, it's definitely worth the $19 (on sale for $17 at time of writing). I'll try to keep this post updated, but honestly I'm a pretty forgetful person. Solid recommendation as of now.EDIT: I willstrike outany outdated info andadd notesstating what changed."

Actually a very impressive feel through a pad. The mouse has alot of acceleration so you might want to turn that down.Tonnes of customization options (paid version).You will die alot, but as with some of the old greats, there does not seem to be any limit to how good you can get at this game, which is why i compare it largely to Quake 3 Arena.Mutliplayer is a bit hit and miss atm, but in time it will grow. Also there are some community made maps! Easy to install, it takes you to the community page, you simple click the sub button, restart the game and the map is playable.

HOWEVER, additional content should come in pretty quickly since a lot of the content shown in the trailer is not there yet, meaning it's probably almost ready to be added to the official build. On top of that, the core gameplay is 99% done I think, the 1% left being the details they MIGHT change according to user feedback, so IF I'm right and the core gameplay is mostly done, that means the focus will be on adding content to the game (even maybe additional gameplay).>EARLY ACCESS DETAILS<----------------------------OMG. That's what I think of this game. I never felt such a tension since I played UT2k4. Actually the whole game is a love letter to UT2k4 with modern graphics and a whole new set of weapons (it still have classics projectile but powerful weapons, explosive-type weapons, widespread weapons and charged weapons but there is many fun and new primaryand secondary fire modes. Cause yeah, the game features two fire modes, something introduced by the Unreal serie and used almost nowhere else (unfortunately IMHO) and here it goes.It's exactly what I excpected from UT3, an evolution of UT2k4, with better graphics, a few twist of its own, and a competitive gameplay.In short there are now 2 main ""competitors"" that aren't really in competition. Reflex and Toxikk. BUt as I said they do not compete, Toxikk, is UT-like arena shooter where Reflex is a lot more akin to Quake ;) Still you should own both at some point (wait a bit for Reflex it's not that much polished as of now).Last but not least, the game features a SDK. I didn't download it, but on the website they say that every registered player have access to it for free, so I guess it might be a Steam tool or a download on Toxikk website ! This SDK will allow players to create skins, maps and so on, so I guess this so on could possibly mean developing your own mod and mutators like in UT2k4 (hell, the match creation screen even has a category mutator with no mutator as of now, but still it exists so my prediction is 90% accurate)."

If you played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of UT, just like me, and want to have some arena fun till the final release of UT4, then this is for you.Graphics are fine, it is bug-free, performance and netcode is great. The weapons are still not perfectly balanced, though. Melee weapon and pistol seem weaker than in UT and the shotgun, although it is strong, doesn't make you feel the ""punch"" that the Flak Cannon has.The price for the full game is fair, online matches are fun and there are too few arena shooters out there anyway.I'd love to see more of this, maybe with a little more individuality... however I understand it is hard, looking at UT or Quake which, although released many years ago, don't leave much space for improvement.As I played the UT series for thousands of hours I am really happy to find kinda the same gameplay in another game.

Toxikk is by no means a bad game, far from it. But it is definitely medicore from it's aesthetic to it's weapon roster.Customization is pretty sparse. Still only 8 armors to grind for in multiplayer, a fair amount of colors, a bunch of camos you have to also grind for, and the option to type your name onto your breastplate. This isn't really bad, I'm just surprised armor selection is still so small even long after the game's release.Map pool is pretty small, and vehicle CTF even smaller. There is a workshop, however very little has been introduced to it. So I'd say there are about 2-3 modders working on maps and models. It's practically a ghost town.Speaking of ghost towns, the online playerbase is quite small. God bless 'em but the devs have made several attempts to fix this issue. Even giving the game a free demo didn't help by much. Despite this, there is still a small playerbase left and they are still devoted to the game.The game isn't unreasonably priced and there's a free demo up for anyone who would like to try it. Can I recommend this game though? No. No I unfortunately can't. Toxikk is an 'okay' game just not something that stands out aside from being based on a niche genre. If I was a very creative individual I'd throw out some suggestions. But I have no idea how you would save this game from being left behind.It's clear these days people want more team based games with all that loot crate nonsense, like Over Watch or Paladins. The day of arena shooters is quite possibly long gone. Not even Bethievesda's Quake Champions could muster enough people to bring it back. So either this is the death of a genre, or it will eventually get back into style. Either way, this doesn't change Toxikk's current playerbase."

But what you do have is a short list of weapons with vastly different power levels placed at specific points in the map. I know the people who really liked Quake and UT are used to this, but it leads to people camping the rocket launcher endlessly. There's always one guy with the launcher and you can't touch him. If you manage to get it yourself you're gauranteed kills for as long as you have ammo, but then you have to go find it again if you die.

TOXIKK manages to bring the FPS genre back to basics, gameplay found more typical in '90s shooters a la Unreal Tournament and Doom, but in a way that's refreshing and just purely fun for this current decade.My only gripe is that no one seems to play online compared to other FPS games. I might recommend making this game free-to-play to bring in more players, but that could cheapen the quality of this game.

Sound-wise the game is satisfying and well done - a step up from the old breeds.  Graphics-wise the game is gorgeous but there are some textures errors here and there, but nothing really noticible (you have to look to see them, and it could have been on my end).  The controls are tight, responsive and well produced.  The guns seem to be balanced and offer a good variety of strategy and tactics in order to master the elements for success in this game.  However, despite all the goodness in the deathmatch mode, the capture modes are weak and not fun - the maps are too big and feel lacking in the arena feel.  Overall the deathmatch maps at this point are great, fun, well designed, and balanced.  They are gorgeous as well and feature wonderful and engaging sounds/music.  The team play capture maps, I personally think, are lacking, not fun, and battles are too spread apart.  So far at this stage in the early release there are always good US servers to play on.  Netcode seems to be tight and responsive.  If you are an arena fan, get this game.  Also the developers are responding to the community very well, and very quickly.  Great Devs!"

Most of the rounds I've played in this game are so called ""Boot Camp""-games with bots. It's sad. Especially when it's an awesome game like this one.I know it's in early access and people don't wanna buy it just because of that. But hear me out: Even in early access, this is hands down one of the best FPS-games I have ever played. Now, that could be because I like Quake-ish, fast paced and not too complicated games that doesn't rely too much on intricate strategies, but rely more on direct combat strategy and good aim.The Options-menu in this game is also very well implemented. Detailed mouse settings also include in this game, which is essential in a game like this.The bottom line is, if you like old school shooters like Quake and UT, you have to try this game. It's still early access, I know, but you still won't regret it. Because they are constantly working on it.UPDATE:I was optimistic about TOXIKK. But not so much anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game. I don't have anything against the game itself. But the fact that no one ever plays this game online, except for some very few instances, made me ask Steam Support for a refund sadly. I didn't get it though, considering I've had it for too long and played it too much.So I'm changing my mind about the review. It's a great game thus far, but I don't recommend buying this game.

Thankfully there are good people around if you keep poking about; don't turn down a server because they are using custom content or show 160 ping.That being said, the game itself is largely solid. It handles high ping well. I really enjoy the Bullcraft and Dragoneer. Rockets and AR 'nades are one-shots, though, hope that gets patched out. Maps are decent, though very tight and random (need a few more, specifically orderly and/or spacious ones like Dekk and Ganesha IMO). Dekk looks fantastic, whoever worked on remodeling that map needs a bonus and to be told to make a novel map.I am marking not recommended (for most) because early access + diehard tryhards clearing the only server or two = rough.

The graphics are decent but the multiplayer is too slow for an arena FPS.. (atleast the map I played on) The guns aren't soo balanced. The game feels more like Halo rather than an quake or unreal tournament it shows. A dead halo for sure...

But I still wouldn't recommend it, because there is the original out there with way more content.In that regard I feel this review might be a little unfair, because objectivly TOXIKK is not a bad game and is targeted on fans of classic arena shooters, which don't need much innovation in the first place. But since here we have basically none, I don't really see the point of investing into this game.Gorgeous graphicsBeing based on the Unreal Engine, this game looks really great. It surpasses modern standards and runs fluently on halfway decent PCs. I would definetely call this game the best looking arena shooter at this point.Godly AIAnother thing this game makes good use of from the Unreal Engine is the great AI, which results in very smart behavior of the bots. Even though currently there are barely any multiplayer games going on, as this game is not really popular, it is not a big deal because you can practice just fine with bots and have fun with them.Lack of contentAt this point there are only a couple of maps with just 3 modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and some sort of Capture the ""Flag"" on bigger maps with vehicles. And apart from that there is really nothing you can do. That is rather poor.Lack of innovationWhile the description of the game claims ""fresh ideas"", I haven't really found anything that makes this game unique compared to other arena shooters. This is the game's biggest problem. A simple arena shooter is nice, but without something that makes it stand out from the crowd, this game won't get far.All in allI don't recommend this game to anybody who is not into arena shooters, since there is nothing special to see here.

Epic Games detailed why manipulating the HUD on the Z axis causes problems with readability when moving at high speeds, and the HUD in Toxikk is difficult to read as a result of that transformation.  On top of that, the HUD was made using neon colors, which makes it even more difficult to read against bright backgrounds, or in some of the neon city maps.And if you are still thinking about buying this game, download the UDK and check out the sample game (which is just stripped down UT3.)  Notice how the game feels very similar.  If I had a guess, the Toxikk devs took the movement model from the UDK sample game, and just turned it into Toxikk.On top of that, everything just feels like a very uninspired UT clone."

Also you may sometimes not be able to join a server due to not being in the right ""skill class"" and I can't believe there's no server browser access mid match.Also I find it a bit funny how a game with a trailer stating in big bold text ""NO FREE TO PLAY""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B28oQvaL7Mggoes free to play...And:“The price for the full game will be higher than the current one, but if you buy the game in Early Access, you'll get the full game for free.""Yeah not really...

Servers are either full of people or barely anyone, and bots.When you qeue up for ""Quick Match"", it will try to access servers that are full, then say SERVER FULL and throw you back out into the main menu after waiting for the server to load.If you do get into a server, it will either be crowded with people who have been playing the game for years and know all the moves and maps and will pwn you, or its filled with bots and maybe 1 or 2 people.B. Gameplay is boring.Jump dodging is tedious and repetitive and made for try hard game enthusiasts who think they're elite somehow playing a game that requires so much practice just to be good at such a crappy game. No sprint key. Default movement is set to ""Run"", but running feels like brisk jogging, and if you want to move fast, you have to ""Jump dodge"", using a combination of the shift button and jumping, and it turns ever match inevitably into players jumping around like stupid gorillas firing rocket launchers that kill you in 2 hits, and yet, seem to miraculously do no dmg randomly, when you fire right at someone it may not even affect them with splash dmg, I have repeatedly hit in the vicinity of someone with a rocket within 2 feet of their body, and somehow they survive after 5 hits and kill me in one hit, even when i have full armor.They advertise vehicles in this game. They are clunky to use and after the novelty wears off, you realize you're better off out of them. Also, there are only 2 maps that even have any vehicles, and most of the nerds playing it will monopolize the servers with the SAME map (Hong Kong deathmatch) OVER AND OVER again. I only saw ONE Map the entire time i was playing with the air flying hovercraft vehicle, which is kind of cool, but NOONE even likes the map and it never gets played. Good luck getting into a match with more than 3 people in this map, and most of the time 2 of those 3 are bots.ONE vehicle, the hoverbike, isn't even sitting in a garage anywhere, its activated by the G key, (what does my guy pull it out of his♥♥♥♥♥?) and when you get back off of it, it disappears and you can't use it again till you die. LOL WTF??Primary weapon hand gun is awful. Its only primary weapon, i know. But its shot is so delayed that even if you have your sights aligned, when you push fire the guy doesn't instantly fire it, it goes through some kind of animation when it fires, and it throws you off on making accurate shots.Rocket Launcher does lots of dmg if its a direct hit, can even kill you in one shot, yet splash dmg seems to be completely random. You can make a kill on a guy hitting within 5 feet of him twice with it one time, then be firing withing 1 ft of him 10 times in succession and he somehow survives then kills you with a shot that hits near you. WTF?Other weapons are useless and you find yourself just looking for the rocket launcher the main weapon everyone uses.C. The hit boxes are ****ed up.You can be pointing directly at someone that isn't even strafing or dodging just coming RIGHT AT YOU, fire 10 shots directly at them, and only 3-4 shots hit.Who designed the hit boxes on this thing? The people who made Counter Strike?Graphics are nice...i guess?You can customize your guy and make his armor look different types, but it requires Experience points. *rolls eyes* Yet another modern fps that has decided to add in RPG features to its game.You need to play 5000 games or something in order to get the xp required to make your COSMETIC helmet and armor all the types it shows you you can choose in the ""Customization"" menu.In the end its an awful game that you should STAY away from and save your money. Trust me you aren't missing out on anything.  I guarantee you you will play it for a couple days, then just wish you hadn't bought it."

For a game that's ""taking the arena fps back to it's roots"": the movement speed is as slow as Halo, there's vehicles (including a jet), there's a periodically spawning super weapon that can blow up half the map, the pickup items are virtually impossible to distinguish, there's dodge jumping and double jumping, you can turn invisible for 5 seconds with a 10 second recharge. Also most importantly: There are no players online, it's emptier than reflex.EDIT: I recently started playing again. It's a step in the right direction to make a free version to get more players. But the ranking system prevents players of different skill/experience from playing with each other. For a game this new, the player population is too low for this restriction and Toxikk will continue to suffer of low player base. I criticize this game for having vehicles and what do the devs do? They invent a new vehicle, good job. Let me also emphasize the item respawn times are ludicrously long, 15 seconds for a weapon to spawn really? Also 1 minute for mega health and heavy armor?? We might as well not have items on the map, especially since shotgun ammo, sniper ammo, and 25 health look practically identical.The ability to spawn hovor bikes is also another pointless additive just like the temporary stealth. Why does every FPS have to add these pointless additives for the sake of being unique or for the sake of adding ""depth"" and ""strategy"". If you're going to add these things, you might as well go all out and make it another class-based moba shooter, but please don't make an appeal to old-school shooters if you're going to add stealth, vehicles, and clumsy movement mechanics.This game lacks strafe jumping, lacks rocket jumping, lacks 144 hz performance. The only thing good about the game is the graphics. But a real ""frag like it's 1999"" type of player does not care about graphics. This game's graphics serves more to hinder player skill by having too much glare, too much detail (even on the lowest graphics settings) and not enough distinction between the pickup items."

There will be more maps though, Its basically in Alpha state as I call all early access games alpha.I know this all is going to be adjusted but for now the only weapon I have issues with is the Rocket launcher ( forogt wat they call it)  It is overpowered, unbalanced and every single person flocks to it.

So i suddenly found this game on my Steam list and when i saw the trailer i thought my dreams were coming true. I instantly bought the game and tried it out.So first here are the good things about the game:It really holds its promise of being an old school arena FPS. The combat is fast and dynamic, there are dodge jumps, wall jumps and even rocket jumps.The weapons feel unique in their own way, Some work well on long range, some work better on short range and then there are those that combine these things with the primary and secondary fire, but they have some balance issues (I'll talk about that later).The graphics arent really impressive but they look nice.So here are the things that need improvement:The only weapon thats too strong ATM is the rocket launcher, but its already been confirmed that its gonna get nerfed so that isnt really an issue anymore.Probably the biggest issue of the game at the moment is how the weapon pick ups work. As soon as someone picks up a weapon it takes 15 seconds for it to reapawn. Thats way too long, especially considering that when you get into a 1v1 against someone when you only have the pistol and he has any other weapon youre 95% gonna lose.Another point i really dont like is the weapon design. The weapons look way to realistic and they are all white. Take Unreal Tournament for example. Youd never see anything close to the rocket launcher or flack cannon in real life. Also you can see what weapon you are carrying only by looking at the colour.There are no HUD customization options. Quake and Unreal Tournament had a lot of hud customization. In Quake you could even select your weapon to be on the centre of the screem wich gave a really cool old school feeling.On the current map 8 players is too much for a deathmatch. I recommend going on a 6 or even 4 player server,So heres my final verdict: The game may be frustating at times or feel unfair because of the weapon spawns, but the really good old school FPS gameplay makes up for all the issues."

The concept of bringing back arena shooters has been a great thought and this game is really well done so far.You can't go in thinking it's a completed game because it really is not. You have one map so far (which is well made and feels balanced) and like 5 guns that you will know well if you have played any arena shooter before. It feels pretty balanced although some guns can use a bit more tweaking.Graphically it looks really good for how well it runs, and it feels like a futuristic battleground, but for now with only one map and a couple character models you can't really see how well it holds up under other environments, but I have high hopes.It's fun, that's all that matters at this point in early access, I'm hoping they can advertise this and get more people on board, because it's looking good."

This current build of the game puts the version number at .86 parsley not sure what all the herb references are in the build names but whatever :).If this is true that means they are saying this game is 14 percent from version 1.0. With that in mind I will say the game play is superb the movement the mouse feel and options all feel awesome graphics of course it's UT engine so they are very nice and yes the gameplay feels nearly identical too UT. I don't consider that a poor design choice as I enjoy being able too carry over what I know from other fast pace first person shooters from one game too the next without feeling that I have too relearn the game completley. Now if they add a map and a really unique mutator too the game for the remaining development up too 1.0 I will say it's worthy of a purchase price otherwise I won't be able too recomment it without more content. The reason people arent playing allot is largely due too that issue right now. This is early access so again not an issue unless never addressed. I look forward too more maps some unique mutators not UT ones. Then I will truly be able too frag like 1999. The gameplay and weaon feel/balance is very good.

Small penalty as a better implant could have went in but way ahead of the times. You used to fight in the outzone to hold territory called get outposts to be able to get factory or research bonsues, dependin on the OP, to mass build/research weapons, armor, vechicles for the gratest chance of 5 slot weapons. Keep the best and sell the rest at yo's pawn shop! You had your own appartments, items to put in their, cabbies, and no AH you had to trust peeps. Tech parts were IDed from warbots or tech mobs to piece together rares weapons and run around with bad♥♥♥♥♥shit in the outzone or red light district just to drop it! Epic days of good times. 1 locked slot weapon slot you would not drop, so not full full loot, such a good balance. Running around in the OZ at night with rare weapons with neon spinny orbs around the barrels looked sick, especially durning war time! Oh and power armor, Ohh and no questing!Anyways so far I got about an hr into their newest title and its a total throwback. Character models and unlocks for the camo look sick as your character progresses you can unlock this. There are mechs and vechicles on some capture maps. So far there is 3 game modes I found. CC Cell Capture, Blood Lust, and FFA. Had alot of fun with 3 friends, but it was difficult to get on the same server because of the 8 slot servs. Couldnt host our own server,  probly needed to forward a port.Verdict: Worth the few bucks they are asking, I hope it funds Neocron 3!!!

Average players like to join 1-7 SC games instead of 1-12.-free version has more limitations than UT 4 including customization and ingame server browser (there's a workaround)-UT4 has more maps-Lack of translocators makes it harder to catch up with flag carriers.-Ravager is absolutely garbage.-some irritating lagspikes.

,Recommended,324810,16284357,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,King ButtTouch,"My opinion on the game so far: FUN.What I like:- Gameplay is fun! A fast-paced fragfest, just as described by the devs. Simple gameplay (move, jump, dodge, primary fire, and secondary fire). No classes, and all weapons are gained by picking them up in the map.- Weapons seem relatively balanced.- No glitches. The game, in terms of playability, is completely hashed-out. Everything works perfectly, from what I've seen. Nothing about it is broken or unplayable, which isn't too common for early access games.What I'd like to see:- More maps. I know development is ongoing, but no vehicle maps exist yet, and there are only three available maps currently. All are a maximum of eight players.- Multiple save slots for key bindings. This is due to my desire to use my Xbox 360 wireless controller with the game. Currently, it is perfectly compatible, but controls must be entered manually via the control options. This means that if you decide to play with mouse and keyboard again, you must manually enter all of the keyboard and mouse controls again, which is a bit time-consuming if you switch between them decently often (from couch gaming to actually sitting at your computer).- More weapons. I like the ones currently in the game, but I feel there could be a bit more variety. If no future weapons are planned, however, it wouldn't be a huge letdown.- More players online. I know this is not something the developers can correct on their own, but there have been VERY few servers with any players actively online when I've been playing. You can still play bot matches, but it would be nice to play with a larger quantity of other people.The bottom line: I buy games in Early Access ONLY if I'm comfortable spending money on the game in its current state. TOXXIK has not disappointed! For the $19 I paid, I have gotten a fantastic experience. Sure, there are only three maps currently available, but the gameplay is fun and there are very few flaws with the current game. I absolutely recommend it for anyone who has been worn out by the current generation of military shooters, and I look forward to additional content that the developers will be rolling out for the game!Basically, grab a copy. It is the most fun I've had playing a PC game online in a while."

To be completely honest I can't imagine why this game would have more players as it is at least to me one of the best Free to Play games on the market right now and with the game it self being quite balanced not like other F2P games like Paladins. So although I do recommend the Free To Play version of the game I would advise not being like me and wasting $15 on a game that is more dead then Battleborn."

Not sure if there will be a storyline at some point ."

This game is really fun and addictive, if the playerbase was significantly higher and most of the servers weren't in Europe and America I would have loved it! From what I saw from the server browser there was about 4-5 servers all of which were full. It seems most people didnt even bother to pay for this game as pretty much everyone I've encountered has had no customization. Such a good concept, if only more people played it.PROS-Well optimizedFun fast paced action that makes you want to come backIf you bought the game: Fun singleplayer missions and cool customizationCONS-Very few playersVery few serversAll servers are only in america or europe."
