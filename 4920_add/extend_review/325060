,Recommended,325060,14837472,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,DaxterSpeed,If you've played Portal or Antichamber and liked it you should absolutely get this game. Visually it should reminds me of Antichamber but with a lot more polish. The puzzle mechanics are minimalistic but they all blend really nicely.I'm a little disappointed that you can't see your best level performance anywhere. The replay value is raised quite a lot by challenging yourself to beat each level as fast as possible.Update as of 2015-03-26:The developers has done so many amazing things to improve this game for our little niche of speedrunners. While it still doesn't keep track of best performance the game now has a much more detailed in-game timer and in speedrun mode there's a timer for your full run as well. Huge amounts of praise to Toasty.
,Recommended,325060,15147621,"Posted: 31 March, 2015",all,Le Master,"I'll start by saying Parallax and The Talos Principle arethefirst-person puzzlers of the past 12 months.  At their core, they are each archetypal puzzle games: begin at a starting point and arrive at a predetermined goal with the means provided using logic and reasoning. Like any well-constructed puzzle game, the levels start simple and gradually become more complex while introducing more concepts which build upon themselves.However, they are also much different from one another. TTP is immersed in a story which drives and motivates the player (much like Myst or Portal) with its mystery and philosophical ideas. It has large, beautiful environments that provide enough to explore and add to the experience.  Parallax is a straightforward puzzler. There is no story, no environments or landscapes to explore, nothing -- just level after level of puzzles. But this isn't exactly a negative. The game really works in its simplicity. It somehow creates a lot of incentive in the player to move forward and to complete the game (I would sayat leastto the extent of the recent Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube and non-director's cut Q.U.B.E.).The unique concept to this game are the portals to a parallel ""world."" The portals shouldn't be dismissed as a sort of copy of those from the Portal series. They are only alike in name and that you walk through them. The portals here lead to and from another environment that has elements connected to both environments and also has elements local to only each respective environment. The player moves to and from each environment to activate switches and traverse to other portals in order to reach the goal. The swtiches can rotate portals the opposite direction so that the player can enter once inaccessible switches or portions of the level, and the switches can even rotate portions of the level itself.The level design is mostly very intelligent. Most have that ""aha!"" moment. And I really think it is because of those moments that the player is rewarded and driven. There are a small number of poorly designed levels, ones which make use of laser beams that have no purpose to the overall puzzle and only hinder the player's ability to traverse, and ones that obscure the player's ability to see where switches lead and what they activate.It is a wonderful exercise of the mind, and it is a rewarding experience. Any fan of the genre would be sorry to miss this addition. I only hope a level editor becomes available before interest subsides."

Nowadays every new puzzle game has to have a unique gimmick to it to make it interesting and challenging for the player. In Parallax's case, it's parallel dimensions coupled with some gravity defying platforms in the later levels. The challenge is fair and balanced and the difficulty increases steadily as you progress through the game. While some levels can look quite intimidating at first, with a bit of thought, careful planning and memorization you can beat everything fairly fast and achieve perfect level completion within very few actions.Even if Parallax doesn't break any new grounds in the audiovisual department, its simple yet futuristic looking monochromatic art style along with electronic beats lend themselves well to the game creating a pleasant overall experience.The game's price is perfect for its length of 4 chapters with 8 levels each and it still has a lot of replayability to offer after completion. As of March 14th 2015, the developers have already added a game mode specifically designed for speedrunners, which will exponentially increase Parallax's lifespan.If you're a fan of first person puzzle games that are not only well designed, but offer substantial replay value, then you mostly likely already own Parallax. On the slim chance you don't, buy it. You certainly won't regret the purchase.The Good:- Balanced difficulty- Very good level design- Simple, but fitting audiovisuals- Good replay valueThe Bad:- Might be too short for some players"

The developer claims that it's a puzzle-platformer, but this game plays more like a puzzle game than a platformer despite the platforming features.Overall the game is very well done.  The art style is very minimalistic, even more so than Antichamber: just two colors in the entire game, menu and all.  Really my only complaints would be that there aren't customizable color schemes and there's no thematic music on the dark side of all the puzzles.  If you think that the game has no narrative or story, you'd be right, but let's face it: gaming for gaming's sake hasn't been appreciated enough.Estimated initial playtime: 3-6 hours (for 32 levels).  It's as solid a game as (say) The Swapper!  I give it an 8/10 rating."

There is no loot, inventory, enemies, resources, gold, or anything else but you versus the puzzles themselves.Each level gets progressively harder, using portals, switches, and tricks that start to bend your mind between the black and white realms, very addicting indeed.With 32 total levels now, plenty of graphic and audio options, plus the ability to play with a mouse & keyboard or a controller, this game is a good value for your money.  - Especially if you enjoy these kind of games."

Here the 'Portals' are fixed, and like mirrors have a front and a back face - Only side transports you to an 'inverse' dimension and the other side acts as a blocker. Switches and wires link to mechanisms that can spin these faces around to help you reach the exit.The individual elements of the game are pretty simple and it breaks you in gently with the first few puzzles, but things get quite a bit more complex in the end. Getting your head around what's happening in each dimension at the same time as working out how to use the mechanisms is very rewarding.The graphics are simple and you can change the two colours involved, but you are still limited to only two colours. This is a good thing in a way, as the game runs very smoothly and does not clutter up your screen with unnecessary details. There's no story or enemies in the game, although it does have a weird inter-dimensional atmosphere and some mood music. Really this is all you need - The puzzles are very good and are allowed to stand as the main feature of the game.I'd definitely recommend it."

You move between these 2 maps with portals, with the objective of reaching the ""goal"" (exit) point. Not only do you have 2 map layouts for each puzzle to work with, but, well, the portals and some of the platforms rotate on their x-axis or y-axis at the push of a button... Yeah.The aforementioned mechanics result in having to move between 2 maps for each puzzle, while rotating various portals and platforms, in order to orient yourself towards the exit point.-Graphics sometimes seem more ""bare"" than ""minimalist""-Somtimes you have to spend the first 5 minutes wandering around to learn which switches rotate which portals/platforms+Bends the brain (forces the player to imagine the 2 maps twisted into different states)Recommended if on sale for those who enjoy first-person puzzle games."

The rifts will be in the same place in both rooms, but nothing else necessarily will be. The puzzles are primarily based on orienting the rifts properly to over obstacles and reach switches to eventually make it to the exit. It starts off very simple and the difficulty builds in a very natural way. At the end I definitely felt challeneged, but never so much so that I wanted to stop playing. Eventually you are required to use platforms that manipulate gravity, which where the game really shines and will put your spatial reasoning to the test.The aesthetic may not be for everyone (I personally loved it) and there's no plot to speak of, so if you're for anything besides puzzles you might want to keep looking. Otherwise this game provides a fascinating and unique take on the genre of first person puzzlers.

Some things come across as frustrating - if anything you need some patience in figuring puzzles out. A well executed 'pure' puzzler.For those who need show, feel and/or glam - rather just avoid it altogether. But if you like your serious spatial mental exercise and aren't scared of old skool think-it-through with more contemporary minimalist dress-up this should be your cup of tea.I do think the puzzles in the beginning are a little easy. In the second half the intrigue/ difficulty ramps up rather quickly. I can appreciate that some of the level design can be tricky - but there certainly could have been some more of the  up/down/sideways/where-AM-I/take-a-break-and-try-again puzzles - maybe an extra 8 levels as a bonus for some or other achievement."

I enjoy a good puzzle on occasion. Knowing this, I was excited to play Parallax.I've finished the game, and I only used a guide for the very end of the last stage of the last chapter because the lasers before the turnstile confused me (I didn't think you could go under them). So, I give Parallax credit for being relatively simple but not too simple to the point where it was child's play.For some reason though, I found Parallax incredibly boring! And not the relaxing kind of boring either. It's not like I haven't played similar games in the past (Hook and Colortone come to mind). It took me about a month or so to force myself to play through this game. It isn't even that long! I did it in 3.5 hours. Those felt like the longest 3.5 hours of my life. After one or two stages, I experienced extreme Parallax fatigue.There are no jump scares, but part of me wishes there was something so it could wake me up to play this game longer than 30 minutes."

Set with absolutely no context and the simplest, most efficient graphics that set the bar for what it means to be minimalistic, Parallax exists as a pure puzzle game. That said, the puzzles themselves are very, very cleverly designed, but not very rewarding to solve. They are so tightly built that solving them feels like staring at a tangled knot, figuring out what order to pluck strings, and then doing it. There aren't many choices in these puzzles; progress is measured, rightly so, in switches pushed, and so at any given time, the fork in the road ahead rarely has more than three paths. When you do figure the puzzle out, you don't feel smart -- you feel like the level designer was smart, albeit very, very smart."

When I first saw the game I was concerned that the platforming would add an unnecessary amount of fake difficulty to the puzzles, but thankfully the first-person control proves to be very fluent, responsive, and not slippery in the slightest.

There are booster, objects that change gravity, flippable portals and moving platforms to complicate your efforts.Pros:-Cool mechanics. The idea of travelling between two worlds to effect each puzzle (although not entirely novel) is a cool idea.-Great visuals. These visuals are created by cascading portals and flipping of perspectives that can be trippy at times (in a good way).-SImple gameplay. It's fairly obvious what you can interact with and what you can't. That helps to make the puzzles more streamline.Cons:-I'm a third of the way through the game and have not been challenged. The puzzles barely rquired throught to complete them. Admittedly, things like boosters and lasers havn't been introduced yet, but one would expect to see some diffuculty in the first third of a puzzle game.-There is no penalty for death. Death came to me in the form of an endless fall, and death was a merciful companion. When you die, things do not reset. In a puzzle game that has so far been so easy, I see this as strange. There is no risk involved is you hurtle yourself to your doom.In the end, how do I feel about Parallax? Well, (as I've said already) I got a thrid of the way though the game in twenty minutes, with no challenge. I hope that the challenge will come. As I play the game more I'll update this review. I feel that Parallax is a good idea that could have been executed a bit better. That being said, these twenty minutes have been fun. If you're looking for a puzzler, this is a decent game to check out."

It's scope might not be as large as the big name titles that have come before it however Parallax manages to an incredible amount with the minimalistic stylings it branded itself with. The puzzles could do with some work however, forcing you to retrace your steps all too often adding tedium where there needn't be any. The style also gets boring after the 3rd hour or so and, whilst you can change up the colours a bit, it doesn't go far in alleviating the visual boredom. Suffice to say though I think it's worth a play, even with those few caveats hanging over its head.Read my full review here:http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/03/27/parallax-which-way-is-up-again/"

,Recommended,325060,30400614,Posted: 8 March,all,Mr Ribbits,"Great puzzler! Just the right amount of mindbending -- The mechanics are introduced nicely and the level designs are challenging but not cruel. The goal in each level is clear, and the solutions are pretty satisfying. Perfect visual polish too (although gray-on-gray is the only color scheme that didn't make my eyes hurt.)"

Remembering two worlds, the crossing points of those worlds, and which actions will affect both worlds is quite a task. Overall, the game is enjoyable if you aren't easily frustrated.Pros:Challenging without being impossible. Planning moves ahead makes it significantly faster, but just doing things will show you what you need to do eventually.Simple controls. Meaning the puzzle is entirely in the gameplay, not the correct button pressing.Cons:Short, only 4 worlds, 8 levels a world."
