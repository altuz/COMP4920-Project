It has super retro graphics, music and style - but a very modern foundation. On the PC it's not going to scratch any deep desire for gameplay, but it is still a fun and simple game to kill some time if you're not looking to do anything serious.You have three abilities, attack, defend and use an item. Everything else is basic timing (dodging attacks, avoiding their defenses, finding weak spots), collecting loot (you can only wear one piece of equipment), potions (you can carry one) and gold, buying gear and unlocking new passive abilities. There are three classes with a different passive tree that bring different strengths/weaknesses. It sounds absurdly basic and it is, but it's a nice dose of old-school fun.Some of the boss fights are actually suprisingly challenging despite the basic abilities and you will die - at least whilst figuring out their moves and timing. Death is not permanent and in the PC game has no real serious setbacks except for your time and frustration; you can revive and restart the dungeon but will lose your hard earned loots that you have on you. In the iOS game you had to pay microtransactions to revive and death was a costly endeavour which really upped the frustration.It is ultimately a game that's designed for the casual mobile platform - meant to provide a small dose of entertainment whilst you're bored or travelling, not hours of deep gameplay. I would still recommend it, but people should be aware of that before buying.Personally, I like it. It's simple, it's fun, it's addictive and although I think that it is a game well suited to the mobile market, paying $5 for the full game with zero microtransactions is worth it."

They haven't added anything to compensate that fact in the PC port, so the result is an extremely simple game that gets quite frustrating because you lose most of your stuff every time you die.The difference between having a specifc item or not is huge. Once you lose a specific item, you need to re-visit dungeons you've already completed just to harvest enough money to get a similarly powerful item.Leveling up and buying new items is all based on coins, and they are not that abundant.The fights are like a mix o memory and quick reaction challenge.Cool retro style and music."

Even with all of them at once(this game could be easily played with a controller as well, but it's not necessary);+ Nice pixelated graphics;+ The text is funny without trying too hard;+ There are some secrets for you to find out;+ Although the game is easy, you can get a bit carried away and have some silly, stupid deaths (and like a good rogue like game, dying means losing your stuff!). In other words, it can be challenging.Could be better:> Option to Mute the whole game (you can disable the music, but the SFX keeps playing);> Indicator of how many levels each dungeon has. If the idea is to make it a 'surprise', then let it be visible after the dungeon is beaten;> A Warning telling me that I WILL lose all my stuff if I opt to leave the dungeon. For this kind of game is understandable if you lose everything if you die. But not necessarily if I want to leave it.Edit:On my original review I'd stated that having a Windowed Mode would be nice. Now it does have! Thanks, devs!All in all, it's a good $4 game. It delivers what it promises. Nothing more, nothing less."

I make it sound juvenile, but try it for yourself; you'll find it's worth more than that.And the game's got good humor as well, and graphics that fit perfectly for the gameplay.It seems to be a rather fresh game, as I've already come into a half-minor bug - no, nothing important like infinite ammo or walking through walls or that crap. It's just a minor glitch towards post-combat cleanup for gameplay objects and all that. It's perfectly playable and everything happens as it should.Overall, 9/10 will play later once I get some studying in."

Simple, addicting gameplay: Choose a dungeon, press down to explore, press attack or block at the right time, get treasure, repeat.It's challenging and rewarding in the right amounts and certainly worth the $5 for the time you'll spend.My very small complaint is that this appears to be a direct mobile port and not translated from the Ouya version.

76561198000698735,Not Recommended,325090,12915636,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,Last Knight Down,"I actually adore this game's design and concept; The art is great and the characters are excellent. The plot is straight out of a classic table top campaign from the early days of D&D, Forgotten Realms, Warhammer, etc. The theme is very gothic, grungy and brutal, from the backgrounds to the enemies, everything fitting in nicely.So why don't I recommend this game? Because the gameplay falls flat. The controls are simple, which is normally great, except that every character basically plays the same, and the strategy for beating each mob doesn't vary much from character to character. The equipment system is also unrewarding as once you find a decent item for one of your two slots, you're going to be hanging on to it for literally most of the game. Moreover, it's hard to decipher what's going on with the retry screen without looking it up. There's soo many mobs that are unintuitive and need to be fought in a specific way which is at times VERY frustrating to try to determine. You will die a lot just because you don't know what to do. And looking it up is not satisfying.Now, if there was more going on with the gameplay, I could see how people could try to claim this was just a Knights of Pen and Paper clone, but at the same time, the art, hardboiled plot, the grizzled monsters and action-style of gameplay would convince me and others otherwise. There was and is still a lot of potential here for future titles. But this one isn't fun. So skip this one and look at the next one."

Gameplay itself is as simple as pie; attack at the appropriate cues, block damage depending on what signals your enemies give you, use potions and whatnot, etc. all of which is done with just a few keys. Nonetheless, combat is quick-paced and quite fun, there's plenty of variety and diversity to flesh things out, and it's overall an excellent dungeon crawler. Seriously, this is well worth picking up."
76561198085349542,Recommended,325090,33408551,Posted: 9 July,all,BlueHaven,"I got this game for a buck (or two?) during the summer sale, and think it was worth the price. I've noticed it's now $4.99. Personally, I wouldn't give that much for it, perhaps, $2.50 at most.Although I enjoy this game, I think that there are many who would not. The graphics are retro, very pixelated, which some may not like. Also, the game is somewhat simplistic, not too much thought involved, reminding me of those 8-bit games from years ago. Another con is there is no music volume control, except on/off.The basic notion of the game is to time your blocks, while attacking the enemy in-between time. The whole premise is to learn the patterns of your enemy, so as to not attack too soon/too late, or fail to block their attacks. The enemies always have an indicator they're about to attack, although it can be a subtle or very quick gesture.Added on that, the same enemy types can vary. On one encounter, you'll memorize the patterns of a dire bear, only to discover the dire bear on the next floor has changed patterns, which adds to the challenge of the game. Also, some enemies will punish you severely for not blocking, so beware!After completing dungeons, you are rewarded with gold. You can use these to upgrade your skill trees for your three classes (Crusader, Mercenary, Witch). You can also buy equipment or potions from shops. That being said, I think the items and skills are a bit expensive, which means you may have to grind old dungeons some, to save up the gold. Also, you can only take one equipment piece and only one item (which can stack) with you to each dungeon.If you fail a dungeon, you can choose to keep 10% of your gold losing the rest along with equipment/items, or take a chance at recovering half of your items you have on hand (a slot machine type of thing). This makes failing somewhat disappointing, but adds an element of hardcore to the death aspect.There are also missions to do which, when done, reward gold. These are similar to daily quest rewards from other games, except that you can do them anytime, with up to three available at one time. Each completed mission is replaced with a new one. The rewards for doing these are fairly decent, so I generally spend more time doing them than anything else.Overall, I'm satisfied with the game, given the price I gave. If you're thinking of buying it, I'd recommend doing so during a sale. That, and watch any videos of gameplay beforehand to make sure it's something you'd enjoy."

,Recommended,325090,12756142,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,d.Tox508,"First off, this game met one of my prerequisites immediately: Looking like it was made in 1991 for MS-DOS or the Commadore 64, and this game fits it better than a condom. This Android port originally made for tablets, despite what some may say in forums, is a great port to PC and although simple, is still incredibly fun. Initially the graphics reminded me a lot of a recent release called “Ultionus” but the gameplay however is incredibly unique. Deep Dungeons of Doom takes a bunch of elements and blends them all together to create a playing experience like no other. I love everything from the painstakingly perfect pixel graphics,  intense and spectacular soundtrack, all the way down to the deep, rich and in-depth story straight out of the times of King Arthur.Deep Dungeons of Doom is what I would call a “Timing Based” dungeon crawler. Meaning you can’t move your character on the screen and you only have 3 actions, attack, block, and use item. Simple and straight forward controls, my only complaint would be the lack of controller support, but I can only hope that will come in the future. Starting out is pretty basic, but it takes a short period of play to get the timing down for blocking and attacking enemies. You face your opponent in a turn based style, but battle is very much real-time. Seemingly simple at first, Deep Dungeons of Doom ends up turning into an involved and intricate game that continues to keep your mind at work and make good use of your keyboard skills. You can cause extra damage if you attack an enemy while they are attacking, but be aware; it works both ways, so watch out. The fighting isn’t as cut and dry as it seems. During boss battles, like the first dungeons boss Pitch Black, you need to learn his secret before being able to inflict any damage. Each enemy has a unique attack and block pattern, so stay on those toes and attack when they aren’t blocking, and block while the enemy is attacking.You will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. You may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary – in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest – but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself. – Deep Dungeons of DoomThe whole point of the game is to clear dungeons and build the characters stats with special items and skills. After completing the first dungeon you are given missions to complete with the Crusader. Once the first dungeon is cleared you are then able to view the map, this is where you can visit the shops and are able to purchase potions and upgrade your skills. The first skill upgrade for the Crusader is “Holier Than Thou” which gives you +5% Miracle Heal & +1HP. In the dungeons you find Altars, these Altars are where you exchange gold for enhancements. Usable items make up a large part of gameplay and are essential to success… most of the time. Some items like “Contract of The Vampire” that gives you +1HP & deals +2 normal damage to your opponent have nothing but positive effects, but others like “Devils Contract” where on use you pay 8HP but receive +60% resistance to all, +6 attack & +6 agility for 3 floors have some negative effects as well. There are also equipable items found in random chests after you defeat an enemy in a dungeon, or in shops when on the map. Items such as “Sturdy Sword” gives +1 attack while equipped, or even better “Ring of Magic Cure” which requires 2 magic but gives +2HP per floor. With continued gameplay you unlock 2 other playable characters, also upgradable. This gives the game a bit more “depth”, using magic with the Witch and swift moves with the Mercenary, combining items with the heroes passive skills makes for an even better chance of victory.The soundtrack stays true to the 8 bit era, composed with astonishing perfection. Songs don’t get overly boring or repetitive they actually keep you interested and are pretty catchy fitting the game perfectly. Graphically Deep Dungeons of Doom is brilliant with incredible pixel art capturing the essence of the original games we call retro that paved the path before it. The cut scenes are awesome with beautiful 8 bit graphics to tell its incredible and strong story line. The death animations are on point, imaginative and gorey as hell. I don’t usually promote games made for the tablet and ported to the PC, but in this case, its was done perfectly. I’ll be honest, I had no clue this was originally Android based that’s how good the gameplay in Deep Dungeons of Doom is. This is an incredibly fun game, and for the price completely worth it. Not only does it have several hours of gameplay, but the “replay factor” on this game is huge, because remember those dungeons do get deep.Graphics: 8/10Playability: 7/10Story: 9/10Challenge: 7/10Replay Value: 7/10"

You manage a roster of characters, investing in their skills, collecting loot, and unlocking the map bit by bit.Gameplay is very simplified. Right to attack, left to block, down to go one floor further down in the dungeon. Each floor has one encounter, enemy or otherwise.Each enemy has their attack and defense pattern and you need to learn it to fight them most efficiently. Blocking is generous, giving you a margin of about a second.Optional secondary objectives are given to you constantly, rewarding you with gold and points to invest in skills.It looks and sounds very nice, with nicely drawn pixel art and cutscenes.I'm not sure how long it will hold my attention: it's definitely very casual, and I can tell that it had microtransactions on mobile that were removed, but I can't see that they were replaced with anything, so the game feels rather unbalanced.I'm kind of indifferent to the game. I'll give it a thumbs up for presentation, but it's not worth 5 dollars. Get if at 75% off. If they had bothered to rebalance it when porting to PC, it would be much better.Or play it on mobile."

You either Press D to attack forward or Press A to defend yourself from attacks. Each enemy has their own animation and ways of attacking you. As you go deeper and deeper in a dungeon, Enemies will have different attack patterns or ways. Some even get new attacks. You are able to time your attack on the same moment the ""Attack button"" shines, By doing so your next attack will have a cooldown of 50% less. So you can attack much faster. Holding the defense button will let you charge an ability. But this will leaves you open for attacks. Killing enough enemies will level you up in that dungeon, but whenever you die or reset. The level will start back at 0 again. Once you are dead - you can try to buy back urself into the game and get some of your loot back. Sometimes with additional effects too.

Combat is based on pressing left or right to execute timed attacks or blocks, and the entire rest of the game is about gearing your characters up so that their attacks and blocks have maximum effect.Everything about DDD is charming and retro, except for its design. Its pixelated graphics and chiptune music are a treat, and for a few minutes it definitely holds the player's interest. Then the lack of depth sets in. Deep Dungeons is really only skin deep. Progression is based off of farming side objectives (aatack five times, get blocked six times, etc) and tiny sums of enemy-dropped coins and offers mostly sidegrades. Gear likewise consists of sidegrades, occupies a single equipment slot, and can be dropped or lost.This is not a bad way to spend a few minutes, and it would be lovely as a cellphone game. As a steam title, hour for hour, it doesn't hold up to any of the bigger names in the genre.But that might not be what you're looking for.If you'd like a quick, fun, twitchy distraction with some vague progression, you could do a lot worse than this.$5 is a reasonable price here.

I'm enjoying it enough that only 2 hours or so in, I'm giving it a recomendation.The controls are extremely simple. Left blocks, Right attacks, and Space uses your item. You battle one enemy per floor using these simple controls. There's more to the battles than that though. After you attack you must wait a small amount of time before attacking again and there's a fraction of a second window at the end of the cooldown to ""combo"" which if you hit the cooldown will only be 1/3 as long! Or if you attack just as the enemy is telegraphing its attack you will do 2x damage, but recieve their attack as normal.Your character can only equip/hold 2 items. A peice of worn gear that buffs/debuffs certain stats or has certain effects like +1 HP/MP per floor or drain them usually for a benefit. The other slot is for potions (hp/mp), scrolls, wands are things I've found so far. It's a tough decision to what to have what to leave behind.Thankfully if you leave a potion on one floor you can go back up and grab it / swap items. Except if you buy something from the vending machines you sometimes find, then the item you already had vanishes. You have a chest to store items from the map screen if you don't like the item(s) you currently have on the hero you want to use. This is a great surprise to me for a game like this, I'm happy they inluded it.During the life of your hero you will level up and level ups keep between dungeons until you die. When you level, you select one of four stats to raise: Health (Max HP), Magic (Max MP), Agility (how fast you can attack again), and Attack (Damage).When you die you lose your levels, both items, and any money you found during this dungeon. You can choose to retry the dungeon with the same character and get a chance to respawn with various different items or buffs, and one slot on the wheel is a revive that brings you back with your previous gear... but one slot you get nothing.Between dungeons you can permanently upgrade your heroes passive abilities with gold or buy items, so there is a sense of becoming more powerfull outside of the leveling sytem. There are three columns of upgrades, only one unlocked at start, you progress through a few levels to gain access to the other two, and you may have one trait selected per tier from them. But beware, some come with negatives. What do you expect from an Evil Altar?"
76561198077105674,Recommended,325090,14030489,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,Mr JC Denton in Da Fresh,"Deep Dungeons of Doom is like what is said on its website. easy to pick up but difficult to master. DDD is in some ways a tribute (or parody for the cynical observer) as it pokes fun at dungeon crawlers and what is usually found in games of the type. Even the plot is filled with it, there is a crusader who wants to bring an end to the evil and along the way he meets a shadowy mercenary and a pretty witch.The gameplay is simple, as DDD is obviously developed for a more casual style of play. It is after all available for handheld devices using Android and iTunes, and it shows. You choose either the Crusader, Witch or Mercenary, then enter a dungeon and you fight a single monster on each level, till you face the boss of that particular dungeon. On the PC version, you have a few keys for Attack, Defend and Use which is all you need to play the game. The game revolves around you watching your enemy (there are many types) and remembering cues which show that they're going to attack. You have to then pick the right time to attack, defend and also to counter, which does double the amount of damage you normally do. Simple, right? However, as you unlock more dungeons and face more difficult enemies, the cues become harder to observe and the much tougher enemies will not only hit harder but faster as well. Bosses also cannot be defeated by normal means and you'll have to either spot or figure out their weaknesses.Enemies drop random items ranging from potions to items like armor or weapons that give your three heroes the edge along with gold that comes from a treasure box behind each enemy on each level. Gold can either be used to buy items at shops or upgrades. Another aspect of gameplay is the secret rooms that generate randomly in dungeons. Sometimes, you'll find a devillish merchant or a vending machine but the most common one would be statues that give different sorts of blessings that would help your chosen hero in that particular dungeon.DDD's art is very simple and pixelly like the games of old but that actually suits the game's somewhat silly atmosphere and the soundtrack is surprisingly good. For a game of its price, it is a great boon. If you're looking for something a little simpler that doesn't stress your PC out, Deep Dungeons of Doom is more than worth it. I also recommend purchasing the game on iTunes or Google Play so that you can play the game on the go."

You have like 5 min or 3 hours to loose? Go in there, deeper and deeper! You won't regret, unless you bought this game on regular price.We need just three different heroes, some monsters, repetitive levels and loose story with no point in it and we have a clickable masterpiese to keep you busy for a couple of days. Let's be honest, this is just a regular arcade game of reflex and (again) repetitive actions, but everything in it is interesting and pushes you forward. Graphic is awesome and I can guarantee that it will never get old! How awesome is that?! Sound can be a little dull when you listen it for like a hundred of times but it build up that climate of old games.There are some cons as well. Mechanics shows its weakness when you delve into the last dungeon, that's the biggest one. Grinding! Damn, you need to grind as a pro to earn something and it can be really boring sometimes. A pain in the A*s.So, buy or not? Of course you want to play it! Just watch for a price drop and get it. The best addiction ever, fully legal."

While the structure of the game itself is very Role-Playing Rogue-like. Gathering equipment and consumables which provide specific benefits, are lost on death and often found only in the dungeons. Players also able to level up and customize their build between four statistics which are wiped back to base each death, and buy items outside of dungeons from shops. Meanwhile there being multiple characters to play as, each with an upgrade tree of permanent customizable passive abilities.The game has many different maps and arrays of enemies, all with fantastic looking sprites, animations, and decently varied attack patterns. The only field that the game really fails in is the generic fantasy world, with of course generic fantasy women outfits. But in terms of gameplay and design everything is very well done.Considering how high the production value and just all around sensible design of the game is, it really should be worth a little more. At its current price it is absolutely worth purchasing."

It's hard to describe DDD's combat experience with words, but I can say that it scales very well as you progress through the game. While the controls never change (press right to attack and left to defend), the game begins to add in mechanics that require situational awareness in order to complete more difficult levels, such as timing your attacks in order to get an attack speed boost or watching enemy cues to defend against particularly deadly attacks.The thing that makes the whole of DDD so satisfying for me is that you don't defeat harder enemies by levelling up or unlocking passive talents (though there is a cool talent tree feature), you defeat harder enemies by getting better at the game, and the game uses enemies to teach you important tactics that you'll use to defeat bosses.It's an action-packed arcade-style game that can easily be picked up, put down, and then picked up again whenever you want.

I came in to it expecting nothing, armed only with the knowledge it was a fantasy dungeon crawler, and I didn't read any reviews/metacritic ratings before I got it since it was only a buck.I have to say I like it. I didn't realize this game was originally on mobile, but apparently it was, along with microtransactions.  I didn't really think that it was a game adaptable to microtransactions playing through it initially, because if you have a decent sense of rhythm and can memorize the enemy's attacks, you can easily clear all of the dungeons without taking any damage - I did that, basically, and found I could have beaten all of the game's content in about 4-5 hours or so. However, even during that time, some grinding was needed to beat various dungeons.Pros:Very fast paced, can be played in small chunks.Gameplay is fun, simple, and addictive - just the right blend of rogue-like and action RPG.Art is well done for what it is, music is catchy as hell.Story doesn't take itself too seriously.Cons:It's relatively short for the main storyline. For a dollar, I didn't care, but if you paid more than that you might be disappointed.There's a lot of grind once you finish the main story. For example, unlocking secrets: In order to unlock secrets, you need to do specific, strange actions in the game, or get certain rare drops. The rare drops is what the issue stems from - some of the items you'll need to unlock the secrets can require you to do the same dungeon over and over.It lacks some of the basic settings you'd expect from a modern game, like the ability to mute sound effects.Overall, if you have the oppourtunity to buy this for cheap: e.g. at a heavy discount on a Steam sale, or in a humble bundle/similar, I'd recommend it. For $5, though? Not worth it."

I felt that it was justifiable to buy it again, especially since it's only 99 cents. It is fantastically simple while being incredibly intricate at the same time. The combat system is so simple you can literally play it with 2 keys on the keyboard. The real depth of this game comes in timing your attacks and defense just right, depending on your response to the opponent's movements. Along with the customization and RPG aspects of the game, it becomes an almost flawless game of strategy. The graphics are crisp and clean pixels, the animations are done well, the gameplay is quick and responsive, and the music and sound effects are very fitting with the setting of the excellent story line.The only thing that bothers me about this game is that fact that you can only have one item of equipment at a time. It makes it frustrating when you get new items in the treasure boxes and you feel like you are forced to throw you item away. I mean really.. why can't I wear a helmet if I'm holding a sword?

You can find items in dungeons or purchase them in stores on the world map which alter your stats and sometimes possess unique abilities.The artwork is excellent, but the soundtrack is like something out of a 90s mascot platformer. It's incredibly ill-suited to the game, and frankly, kind of annoying. Sound design is adequate, but nothing to write home about.That's pretty much it.

When on sale, DO NOT hesitate.Additional comments on game mechanics:The game is made of multiple dungeons that you have to beat successively. To beat a dungeon, you must (not surprisingly) survive all through it. If you die, you can restart at the beginning of the dungeon or try another one. Each dungeon is made of several floors. On each floor, you must fight a foe, though some floors are kinda bonus and provide you health or an increase of stats.Fight is simple : you can either attack or block, but when you do so, you must wait for a gauge to empty before attacking or blocking again. The goal is to time your attacks as best as possible, to avoid being struck (so you have to block at the right time) and inflict as many hitpoints as possible. The system is well thought-off, and works smoothly. You can perform combos if you attack just when your gauge has emptied, or you can hold the attack button for other effects. Anyway, fight is not as simplistic as it may appear first.You also collect items that you can equip, and gold of course, to buy items outside the dungeons or to unlock skills.A very good mechanics of that game is brought by the missions: You always has a set of three tasks that you can try to achieve.
