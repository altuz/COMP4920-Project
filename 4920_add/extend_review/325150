76561198055814197,Recommended,325150,16537674,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Krauvando,"TL;DR --> This game should be calledBuy or Die. Why? Because even at full price it costs less than a junk food menu.----------------------------------------------------------------As a non-casual player of the genre, Run or Die caught my attention very fast, and I was sure I'd grab it when it had any sort of discount.The game is basically what you see in the trailer: a RNG side-scroller where your main character has multiple skills to help her avoid obstacles and trying to reach the ending (is there really an end, actually? :P).The main mode of this game is the Endless one. Contrary to many games like this one, you barely gain speed in case you're reaching further zones in the game. Instead patterns become harder to avoid and faster, more complex and more accurate reflexes are needed to keep going through.GAME FEATURES:- Endless Mode, Challenge Mode, Training Mode, Tutorial and a Daily Run Challenge.- Many leaderboards, depending on the mode and the time lapse.- Five skills to play with (Dive, Leap, Dash, Ion, EMP).- Complete gamepad compatibility.- Customizable controls.Despite having a total of 5 skills, in this game you can only use 2 of them at the same time. As I said, this game is RNG, so skills are chosen randomly and you adapt yourself to them. Patterns will appear according to your skills. In case you get far enough into your run, you'll eventually reach ""Safe Zones"", where skills can be changed for others and further patterns will become more complex.So that's it. This game is basically opium for those people who loves de genre and for that price it can give you a very pleasant entertainment.PROS:+ Controls are, as usual in these kind of games, very tight and very responsive.+ Even though there's just 1-2 tracks, music is catchy.+ Gets the idea of the ""Just one more run..."" feeling of addiction.+ Easy to learn, challenging to master.+ RNG element, making every run dinamically different.+ Huge amount of patterns; when you think you've seen all of them, a new one simply appears.+ Pixel art looks pretty cool.+ Workshop for level editor.CONS:- Even though there's a training mode, complex patterns are simply impossible to practise unless you're skilled enough to reach them again in multiple runs. ""Try and fail"" feeling is never welcomed.- Even though pixel art is good, the main character looks surprisingly different from the real model.- The fact that you're always playing with only 2 skills can get extremely confusing. Some skills like ""Dash"" usually goes to LB (gamepad), but when it combines with ""Leap"" it changes to RB. Unless you're very, very focused, you can just screw everything basically because your brain just got used to another setting.- Lack of content. The context shown in the game somehow looks very interesting, as if there was a cool storyline behind it... but then you find nothing.- Most achievements are farm-based. Ew.Overall, this was the kind of drug I wanted and as long as devs keep doing games like this one I'll never get tired of the genre.Final Mark: 7/10 for the game in global, 8/10 for the game in its genre"

Early levels/areas are relaxing, later bits are super stressfull. Daily runs were a great idea that'll extend the game's life quite a bit."

The atmosphere puts you in a state of trance which makes the time go by. The controls are very responsive which is essential for a game like this and the different abilities gives it enough variety to keep every run different (if doing endless).Definitely worth it!
,Recommended,325150,20906528,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,<TrF) Wolf3D™|๖[=ASM=],"I'm not necessarily in for Endless runners, or at least usually... However the atmosphere of the game - brought to life with both the graphics and the simple, yet amazing soundtrack - is just overwhelming.Remember the feeling when you get home from school/work/everyday tiring life event, wanting to do something, but lack any capability to do so?This game just changed that. Even if you fail spectacularly in-game(Like I did more than I could count), the music combined with the aesthetics will keep you running!All in all:It is WELL worth the price, and whoever you may be, if you buy this you'll be in for a treat :)"

Gameplay is challenging and fun (definitely play with a controller, it's really enjoyable). Soundtrack is only two songs but they are SO good that I haven't gotten tired of them and felt the need to play something else. I was even impressed with the menu and it's audio transitions. Well worth the $5."

,Recommended,325150,14449460,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,(YouTube)Dragnix,"An endless runner that does bring something new to the table with the powers change up. That allows for some change up in the gameplay because of it, as you have to use your 2 powers wisely to get through the map. It's nothing earth shattering, but those who like ""play until perfection"" gameplay will enjoy this one. I found myself saying: ""just one more run"" several times, which should be an indication of the addictive quality the game has.For more gameplay and first impressions, check out the video here:http://t.co/t9PwjWpYfY"

,Recommended,325150,13870730,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,Splendid Naked Officer,"This is the best endless runner I've played.  The art is great, the skills are interesting, and the randomized nature of what ""powers"" you have each run keeps things interesting.  Endless mode is tough but fair, and the daily challenges could add a lot of replay value and competition between friends.  (Silly thing that clicked with me - I like how the character portraits are high quality in comparison to the more minimalist sprites.  It shows that the in-game graphics are an artistic/aesthetic decision, and they contrast each other nicely.)One recommendation to the developers:  when skills change, flash the new skills in the middle of the screen (or something like that); currently you have to pull your vision away from the ""danger zone"" to see what your new skills are, which negatively impacts the flow when playing multiple games in a row.  Just my opinion though!"
,Recommended,325150,13761374,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Athywren,"This game is surprisingly difficult to put down. It's a runner; you run (or you die). It seems like that should be it, but there's a charm to this one, and I'm not quite sure what it is.When you get into the flow, the game becomes almost meditative and, even though the threat of explosion is always hanging over your head, you start to relax and operate on instinct, picking paths almost before you see them... and then you trip on a step.I can't really explain why, but this game is worth it. If you like games that are awesome for reasons that you can't quite pin down, then give this one a try."

76561197966134367,Not Recommended,325150,31627453,Posted: 8 May,all,Luihutin,"I'd give this a mediocre rating, but since there isn't one, I'll lean to No.A decent and well-thought out runner that's completely ruined by the level design (or the randomly placed seeds of it, anyway) and a color palette that keeps you constantly guessing at high speed whether you can land onto or crash into it.It commits the worst mistake of running reflex games; You see better forward than you see up or down so it becomes a memory game of remembering what kind of level blocks have what kind of stuff ahead (you could say of course the view is mainly forward, but it's really so restricted to just forward that you can barely see anything below or above you, and the game demands you do big leaps downwards). Add to that the fact that one skill has charge-up and two of the skills have a period where you can't activate your other skill so everything you do has to be prepared in advance. It's a memory game, not a reflex game.Plus even hitting the upper half of a corner isn't enough when the character is falling or jumping, it will just kill you. Even when you think you can just run over a gap onto the next platform, the character will stub their toe and you will die. I swear I have never seen a platformer be this petty about landing onto the edge of a platform.It's cheap and the powerups mixing between levels are interesting, but the art design fails to grasp proper contrast to your surroundings at high speed. I wouldn't pick this up for serious play, it just stays in a rainy day-pile."

Althought it isn't perfect, I recommend you buy it if you are in the mood for a runner game."
,Recommended,325150,24222533,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Zectifin Pulgris,"I like this game a lot.I have one problem. Its very hard to tell the foreground and background pieces apart. I don't mean the scrolling background of the city. There will be pillars that are connected to the platforms you jump on and many of them are very close in shade to each other. Sometimes you'll run into a wall and it looked like a background piece. Sometimes you'll take a wrong path and have to waste a continue thinking that it was a wall when it was the correct path.If you can get past this annoyance, its the best runner ive played yet."
,Recommended,325150,24586360,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,Kakashi,"If you like platformers then this is definitely  worth the 5$ and the reasons being that the art style is phenomenal, the music is amazing and does not get repetitive or annoying, the characters have emotions, the idea for the characters and powers all comes together very nicely. Also you can see that the developers had some fun creating the game (the secret achievement) I bought the game and only played 2 hours of it so far (planning to play some more) but i would say you would get at least 5 hours if you complete easy and normal challenges on 1 star, do a little bit of training, play the intro, play some endless mode. If you do end up getting the game press backspace on the keyboard when you die so that you respawn quicker because that seems to annoy some people a LOT and you can save 2-3 seconds this way. Also in my opinion it is nice that they took the anime genre in a different direction from dating sim visual novel, 2d fighter,  jrpgs or bullet hell to something new.All in all it's a very good game that did not recieve as much credit as it should have. Also note i said at LEAST 5 hours. Completing a lot of the game, achievements, community levels, time spent on endless mode vary from person to person which means if you want to complete the game (or get close to) you can get well over 15 hours."
,Recommended,325150,15904980,"Posted: 19 May, 2015",all,Loerwyn,"It's a rather lovely-looking endless runner-style game that's, IMHO, a fair bit harder than Canabalt. It's not right to say it's endless**, though, as there is an end goal you are supposed to reach, but instead of just making jumps or dodging obstacles, you also have to use your powers (that change every checkpoint) to get through the course. It adds a slight puzzle element to the game, and does make it a good challenge. Expect to make dozens of runs before you even get halfway!**Developer Correction: At least to start with. Once you hit the end point a 'True Endless' mode is unlocked."
