I kept on buying them, some even blindly, because I wanted them to be good. But they rarely even met the standards of the 90s games they tried to emulate.Bik - A Space Adventure, on the other hand, is a great game. I mean, a proper one.It contains timed passages. Deaths are frequent, but never unfair (the game always autosaves beforehand). I just fought some sort of boss, I could move freely and shoot it with my blaster. It still is a classic adventure game, not a hybrid, but developer Zotnip knows this genre is about letting people DO things, not restricting them.Think ofZak McKracken, a game where you could switch on your TV - in almost every other adventure, TVs are always broken or the main character doesn't want to watch.InBik, you're constantly asked to handle situations, fix things, work something out. And because everything is fast - no painful, slow dialogue, fadeouts, dragged-down-by-Unity interfaces - you're never punished for trying things out.Now, for the presentation. People call this game ugly, done with MS Paint and so on. Maybe, as a fan of reduced EGA-type graphics in general and titles likePleurghburg: Dark Agesmy opinion isn't that valid, but ...I'm glad about every developer breaking the mold. Here, it's more about perspective and grain than choice of colours, since the cyan magenta-thing isn't that new. Sure, there are traces ofMutation of J.B.andMission SupernovainBik, but please, why call it ugly? It's bold.Sure, Wadjet Eye Games for example do their thing very well, but they're are also stuck in some conservative 90s with benefits limbo. They are miles away from having a style you could call ""distinct"".It is obvious that each screen has been composed with lots of care, neither too empty, nor too cluttered and I find that very pleasing, except for some particle effects, which are really not very good.The moody and well-produced music, by the way, is the best I've heard in this genre in a long time."

,Recommended,325160,20417973,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Emblem Parade,"What a delightful point-and-click space adventure!If you enjoyed the lighthearted fun and wonder of the old Space Quest games, you will enjoy Bik. It's not a clone of those, but rather an original concept and story, a homage to the genre.The game is surprisingly long and varied, taking you to several settings (planets, ships) with different moods, things to do, and characters to meet. The story will keep you on your toes, and the puzzles will (for the most part) keep you engaged without being too frustrating. (There are one or two that don't make much sense, but if you persist  you will solve them.)The many charms include the lovable characters, the original music, and the family-friendly humor. The graphics and animations, though, might fail in striking the right balance between retro charm and being just bad. There are some cool cut scenes, but sometimes it seemed that the artists were just lazy. For example, characters will fade in and out instead of walking into rooms. Was it really so hard to animate a door opening?Despite the retro, pixelated graphics, the game is a bit heavy in resource use. My dinky little netbook would heat up considerably when playing it.Very much hoping for a sequel! What adventures will Bik, Ammut, and Tatenen get into next?  Also very much hoping that the devs will invest just a bit more in fleshing out the art.Finally, many thanks to the devs for supporting Linux! It made my gaming experience so much easier."
,Recommended,325160,16823491,"Posted: 1 July, 2015",all,Sandalwood,"Bik: A Space Adventure is a must-play, especially if you love point-and-click adventures or plan on designing one.  It serves as an excellent model for point-and-click adventure games and other developers could learn quite a lot from it.  In particular, this game flawlessly executes three objectives upon which the entire genre depends.1 - Avoids punishing the player for guessing.If you've ever played one of these Zork descendants, you know that sometimes the solution to a puzzle is unclear.  Sometimes one wrong move can be the end of the game.  Bik circumvents this somewhat with a sense of humour.  Some of the deaths are outright ridiculous and great for a laugh.  Not only that, but if you make a fatal mistake, the developers were kind enough to include a feature that autosaves your game retroactively to your critical error so that you can try again from exactly the moment you fumbled.  It keeps the game fun, especially in the middle of difficult or complex puzzles, of which there are very few in the first place.  Short loading times mean that you're ready to try again in seconds.2 - Leads you in the right direction.As I played through this adventure, I felt a mild disappointment at how neglected some of the object descriptions were and how mundane the non-essential parts of the game were.  I saw it as a missed opportunity to develop the world.  But then I considered it in a new light and realised that it ... might have been on purpose.  All point-and-click adventures suffer from one critical conundrum--in the effort to build an immersive world full of detail, the player is often overloaded with information.  When every object seems significant, none of them stand out clearly enough to lead us to what we're there to do.  A few pictures or disheveled bedsheets in the background may have lackluster descriptions, but that's the point.  It's directing your focus toward the puzzles' real elements so that you can progress without ever feeling 'stuck' and clicking every random combination of items in frustration.3 - It still tells a solid story.This ties into the previous point.  Even with the background and details somewhat simplified, Bik manages to tell a good story with a classic outline.  It strikes a perfect balance between storytelling and puzzle-solving and shines by that accomplishment.  It's simple, it's relatively short, but it's consistently satisfying to progress.  The characters' personalities are not sacrificed to this end, the integrity of the world remains intact, and it really feels like a window into a new universe.  Sure, it's not the whole space opera, but it's enough of it that we want to see the sequel.  I'm waiting for Bik: The SET Strikes Back and Bik: Return of the Sandwich.Take my money, Bik.  You've earned it."

,Recommended,325160,15866629,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,Venetia,"Okay the game isn't worth much money. The art is rudimentary, the story/characters are a little silly and simple, the gameplay is about as advanced as any early-age point & click adventure.BUT the game is seriously cute, and will make you smile more than a couple times. Imagine a story written and drawn by a nine year old about going on a space adventure (in a cute, innocent way, I mean) -- that's Bik.If you don't like classic P&C games, you will be bored to tears, but if you enjoy them, you should like it. Definitely room for improvement all over the place, but the team that made it was just a few people so cut 'em some slack :)"

I realize the old style graphics are kind of off-putting to a lot of people, but they really reminded me of my childhood. The puzzles are well thought out and some of the ways to die were pretty humorous. All-in-all, this was a solid game!"

Bik has a great story, highly likable characters & a hell of a lot of charm. Sure at 1st glance it looks a little ugly. But it quickly becomes apparent the look was intentional. The grainy amateur looking asthetic actually turns out to be quite beautiful. The puzzles posed a little bit of a challenge. Although there are some sequences that can be a little annoyingly repetitious, until you figure it out.Overall Bik left me wanting more. I hope to see more of this in the future. This is well worth the $1.19 I paid for it, but at $5.99 it may be a little steep. I'd say grab it fast if it's $4.00 or less."
