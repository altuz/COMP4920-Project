,Recommended,325320,12674391,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,cpyap,"Just bought the game and finished it in about .. 4~5 hours.There are a few things that can improve the game more:The length of the game seem to be a bit too short. Consider I roam around constantly to look for more enemy in order to gain EXP, it still take me quite a short time to finish it.After I'm roaming around, I found that the amount of enemy is pretty much fixed. No random encounter (as opposed to traditional RPG games), which is actually making me quite sad. I do hope that I can slaughter more enemy on my way.As such, the warning at the beginning of the game that said: There is a limited number of EXP, is true. The most negative part here is that this could mean you will stuck within a certain area forever, because you don't have enough EXP to perform certain thing (potentially spoiler hence skipping this).The other thing I noticed is that the EXP you will earn from killing enemies is also fixed, no matter how many enemies you encountered in a battle. This is not totally something bad but just feel unbalanced.Oh, and the puzzle solving is actually a bit too easy, especially seem like all related document can be found in the same room.Now on the positive side, this is quite a different combination of gaming experience. Mixing horror and RPG together may sound weird, but it work (at least for me).Will actually recommend this game. Just hope that it will be longer in the sequel."

The gameplay is standard tuned based RPG goodness; you can attack with psychic powers, physical attacks, guard, heal or use buffing powers.  There are several statistical categories that govern how powerful your characters are and also many skills to purchase, all of this is done with experience points you either earn in battle and also by trading in unwanted items.  The character building is quite deep, allows for some different playstyles, and absolutely necessary to master and maintain as this is not an easy game, even on casual difficulty.  Took me 6 in game hours to complete my play thru on casual difficulty, but 10 real world hours due to dying without getting to the next save room, and I have beaten many and old school RPG in my time and am no novice to this style of game.The story itself is suitably creepy and mysterious, the writing is decent, the voice acting is poor but for a small project like this I was great full to have any voice acting at all.  The music adds to the atmosphere and never gets tiring.  The asylum you explore is filled with puzzles, monsters and mysteries to solve, and how you choose to do so is up to you.  Suck at the puzzles, spend some experience points on your intelligence levels and you can bypass them.  Want to unlock that door or decipher that secret evil looking book, purchase the appropriate skill powerups.  You have to pick and choose as XP points are limited, making Mythos a fun, deep and challenging adventure fit for any RPG gamer that likes lovecraftian horror and old school charm.   First part of a planned series, but Mythos: the beginning stands on its own two feet as a complete story, and plays great with a gamepad."

It could use some improvements, but I recommend it if you're looking for a somewhat different RPG. I am looking forward to the sequel."

Indeed, there is a good time lurking behind this game's one big problem; balancing.If you don't make the right decision with spending your experience points early on, then you are screwed when the difficulty level suddenly ramps up. And boy, does it ramp up suddenly (in more than one place in the game). I ended up playing the same fights over and over and over for hours on end before I could beat them.I managed to slog my way to the final levels (in the other world), but in every battle there my party got slaughtered in 2 rounds flat. So, after many hours of getting to that point, I finally had to throw the towel in and give up.Avoid, unless you are a glutton for punishment.[Edit: this review was written before a major update. I haven't played the newly rebalanced game]"

Mythos offers much flexibility to players in determining the starting player and how they would want to play. Either going in full force or playing with avoidance, Mythos is fun for many.Mythos the beginning offers well crafted locations with appropriate background music which adds depth to the environment. The difficulty of Mythos for every playing style is equal. Whether you are fighting every enemy or avoiding every enemy, this shows how Dark Gaia really thought about the execution of this game.Mythos the beginning also has many puzzles in which some require a keen eye to detect and good logic reasoning. Mythos will wreck your brains on some puzzles which are yet fustrating but interesting.I highly recommend this game for those who enjoy the classic survival horror game. Mythos is the quintessence of a survival horror game done right."
76561198120530775,Recommended,325320,29708302,Posted: 4 February,all,Mr. Boogie,"A survival horror-rpg game. Pretty much in the first Resident Evil style. Visually is modest, but is not bad at all. You just need to get used to it. Found no bugs or crashes. I saw lots of negative comments regarding the voices, but there are non now, just text, and that is OK to me. A few scares now and then. Also the game got a free expansion and some stuff was changed for good. So old reviews might not reflect this.Now, I had to play it the casual way, cause it is very hard otherwise, specially at first. The monsters are really though and you will not get any followers after several fights. In normal difficulty I was pretty much about to quit. Playing casual allowed me to finish the game, still not very easy, but the challenge was more fair. And you really need to fight, cause this is all about getting experience points and getting stronger, so you just shouldn't avoid fights. There are a few puzzles, not very hard ones. One or two are head-scratching. There are different endings too. So some replay value.Overall, despite it is lacking some balance, once you get into the story and learn a few things is entertaining and provides plenty hours in return for the money you paid and there are also cards. Is a good little game and the Mythos theme is always welcomed."

It looked like they used original graphics, original music and sound, and an original idea. All of this couldn't make up for the incredibly and insanely difficult combat system. I read prior reviews and even had the forsight to put the difficulty on the easiest possible. The very first enemy, was way beyond my ability to even hope to kill it. Even using all the healing items at my disposal, I could not survive long enough to wittle it's health even below 50%. Other than that aspect however, the game looked really fun. I wish I could say something better as it's very obvious a lot of work went into making this."
,Not Recommended,325320,12881218,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,Leafy Greens,"PROS:It launched without any issues.It MIGHT have a good story. I don't know, because the controls and lack of save points prevented me from actually progressing in the game at all.CONS:The graphics are extremely rough (spites, text, AND animation).The voice acting suffers from both poor audio quality and poor acting talent.The controls are somehow oversensitive (selection) and undersensitive (movement) at the same time, and are non-customizable.The item system uses up items if you cancel partway through.Object interaction only works when standing in VERY specific spots, with no indicator of where you're supposed to stand to interact with any given object. You generally end up trying each side of the object one at a time, because there doesn't seem to be any pattern.OVERALL:As of this writing (11/10/14), this game is not fit for public release. I appreciate the amount of work that goes into making a game, but this game is simply not finished. I might give this game another shot a few months from now, but at its current stage, it is simply not playable.Bear in mind that if the devs continue to patch the game, this review will become obsolete, so be sure to check how long it's been since I wrote this. A year from now, this will hopefully be completely wrong. If that happens, I'll update this review with a new date of reviewing and new analysis."

It just changed into a normal RPG with the caveat that you were now looking for ways to exploit whatever XP you could get, whenever you could get it. Purposely choosing skill gains in an order to get the most XP you can gain and such. Additionally, the Healing skills are way more valuable than their cost and turn healing items into things that are better off being exchanged for XP. I just don't know how to fix that without making the problem worse.It's not a 'bad' game, and quite frankly doesn't deserve the negative recommendation, but there is no 'meh' option for more of the same. Otherwise, the extra DLC that was added did help the overall thematic elements of the game."

76561198029904609,Recommended,325320,16552125,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,bear_storm,"So, as I was writing this review, I switched my recommendation from yes to no and back about three times.Consider this a very conflicted 'yes', with a lot of qualifiers.For example: $1 is about what you want to spend on Mythos: the Beginning. Allow me to explain why.Mythos is a survival horror rpg with heavy-handed Lovecraftian elements. It's a very short game (clocking in at about three hours, playing as a completionist, on the hardest difficulty) so long as you don't get stuck, but it's also got puzzles and lacks a walkthrough, so your mileage may vary.In Mythos, you investigate a semi-condemned asylum/hospital/thing, skulking around in the dark and occasionally falling through the floor to your death. The game is class-based, and it lets you freely spend exp in safe rooms to progress your character's combat abilities and investigative chops. Raise your int stat high enough (60) and you can bypass every puzzle in the game. Raise your sense stat high enough, and hidden items start appearing on the floor around you. Stats are reasonably well balanced, and most character builds are viable. So long as you build high int and throw spells, or build high attack and hit rate. Some combats can be optionally sidestepped, but a lot of monsters on the map clip towards you at just barely sub-sonic speeds, making evasion unlikely. Monsters and investigation points are also your primary source of exp, so I found myself combing the asylum for every squamous horror I could locate in order to make my intestines stronger. Optionally, you can also spend items for exp, which was kind of a neat feature. I mulched my entire inventory into my statline and promptly discovered I did not need to be healed when my defense was so high that I could not be hurt.Which brings me to game balance. Mythos is a little wonky in this regards. Played properly, it probably is a nail-biting exercise in inventory management. However, exp costs for stats progress based on how many save rooms you have discovered, not on how many points you have spent, so I just scooped every single point I could find in the first few areas  and made myself indestructible before even seeing a boss. If I hadn't decided to spend points to pad the survivability of my companions, I would have breezed through the final act of the game too.Regarding raising any of the stats on your companions: don't. Them dying in combat has no actual repercussions whatsoever, so just use them as one-hit distractions for the monsters. Get your luck and guts high enough, and status effects and damage will not touch you.Mythos' design also falters when it comes to its graphics and voice acting. The rest of the sound design on the game is utterly lovely, and evokes just the right atmosphere, but I've never seen worse (and buggier) voice-work. Everyone you meet sounds like they're trying to force a British accent through a sieve of rusting fish-hooks and razors, and that in turn is wrapped in some kind of low-fidelity distortion that made me take off my headphones every time someone spoke. I believe you can turn voiced dialog off, but you have to go into a menu in the game. Which means the intro voiceing is probably unskippable.Graphics are not much better. This is an RPGmaker title. It shows. On top of that, all the character portraits and monsters look like they were whipped up using some sort of 1991 home edition 3D modeling software. It's garish at best, and comical at worst.So, what's good about this game? Why did I eventually switch back to a 'yes' rating?Unfortunately, it's fun.I genuinely enjoyed most of my three hours playing it, and I even managed to get kind of immersed in the story and ambiance a few times. Mythos does not outstay its welcome (I'd say it understays it), and I found myself thinking about it after it was over - and not just in a ""what did I put in my brain?"" kind of way.I don't think this was because of the writing, which was bog-standard Lovecraftiana. I don't think it was strictly the gameplay either. But somehow the whole of Mythos is greater than the sum of its jumbled-together parts. Dollar-for-dollar, I wouldn't take it over Alien or Amnesia, but if you want to support a pretty cool indie dev or slum it with a project-on-a-budget, you could do worse than this."

Final Fantasy style graphics are used in combat (eg. no animations, just effect overlay to show attacks).SOUND/MUSIC 8/10I liked the sound and music very much and found it quite evocative.CONTROLS 10/10The game was clearly made with RPG Maker or a similar clone so the controls are perfect.PLOT 8/10The locations are diverse and well illustrated. The story as written (ignoring combat, gameplay, etc.) is very Lovecraftian and well written. Lovers of Lovecraft, such as myself will be quite pleased :3.GAMEPLAY 5/10This game is the opposite of fun. Enemies in later areas are impossible to beat unless you ""cheat"" and only use the first save room to save your game.Every time you enter a save room the cost of upgrades increases to the point where it becomes impossible to upgrade yourself enough to fight enemies.If you do cheat then the game becomes ridiculously easy. A happy medium would have been nice (eg. make it possible to win without cheating ;p). I sense they were going for a Resident Evil style experience where you have to avoid enemies but it is impossible to avoid all of the enemies or use alternate solutions (bosses, etc.) making the game combat heavy yet ridiculously,,, avoidance based \0_o/. I was having quite the time passing the first boss until I figured out that I had to beat every single enemy in order to level up enough to stand a chance against more powerful enemies.FINAL VERDICT = Pick a play style and stick with it }:|.OVERALL 6/10 C-"

I know the dev and have seen how hard he works on his games over the years. The amount of work and detail shown here is unlike a lot of other RPG maker games.I like the horror theme of the game but many parts of the game take you out of it. I hate hard/easy modes in games, there should just be a pure mode the game was made to be played in. This goes along with the rest of the spam text that takes away from the horror theme of the game.What I really liked was the amount of voice acting here, very bold to try and add so much of it to a RPG Maker game and I think it really stands out strong and loved it.The jump scares got me everytime which was both sad and funny. The amount of combat you are forced to do seems kinda bad, I like the combat but having random enemies in small hallways that you really can't avoid seems pointless. I think random fight and story fights would have been better.I liked how much your choice of char affects the game.I would say this game is worth it on sale and hope to see some more content updates for it."

It has a certain charm to it, even if I do get stuck now and again.  I like the optional talents (for lockpicking, convincing people, investigating things), and the way that can unlock things.  The battle system is unremarkable and either difficult or effortless -- I'd recommend putting everything you've got into the Combat stat for a while, and trading most/all items for XP.It was worth the dollar or two I put into it, though it may be a bit rough around the edges for some.

The game hints that it's discouraged, but at the same time, it's mandatory in order to get experience to get further in the story. Not to mention, two of the background choices hardly survive their first real combat after the tutorial fight.
