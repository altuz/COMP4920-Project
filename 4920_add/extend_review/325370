76561198010095304,Recommended,325370,17717309,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,manylegged,This game is really fun. The mechanics are deceptively simple but the interactions between objects are rich and the potential for clever play is very high. Dodging between enemies and tricking them into killing each other is really satisfying.  The art/music/levels are very polished and doing simple things like bonking walls feels satisfying. It's kind of relaxing and makes me feel smart at the same time.
,Recommended,325370,17823822,"Posted: 31 August, 2015",all,Reyan,"Very fun and relaxing.  A great blend of turn based strategy with brief moments of twitchy panic - just enough to keep you moving at a comfortable pace, rather than agonizing over every move.  It's pretty unique; a mix of puzzle, action, and strategy.  There are a lot of game mechanics being introduced over time, and each one is cool and new and unexpected, and adds more complexity to your decision making!Nevertheless I've found it very easy so far.  I've gotten partway through the second major area (about 2 hours of play), and the only real puzzling I've had to do is to find a couple of the secrets, and I am typically passing up on the majority of health pickups.  However, I still have a lot to explore; even of the areas I've completed, I intend to go back to get those secrets I missed, and to try to decrease my time/turns spent (since they show global ranks for those stats).P.S. so people are calling it a roguelike?  I would noooot call this a roguelike.  Only resemblance to Rogue is that it's tile based.  No procedural generation.  No permadeath.  No randomization of any kind."
,Recommended,325370,28739758,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,monsterpancake,"Nova-111 is an excellent puzzle game with some really fun innovations to a pretty stale genre. If you like old-school 2D puzzle games like Adventures of Lolo, then this is for you. At first, Nova-111 seems like a typical turn-based puzzle game on a grid. But quickly you learn that some elements in the environment are in realtime. For example, you have to juggle turn-based enemies with realtime laser turrets. This makes for some very fun maneuvering. At first, all your ship can do is bash into enemies, but as the game progresses you gain some additional abilities like a smart bomb and a teleport gun that lets you move two squares in one turn. (And more powers that are better left a surprise.) Overall the game is not very difficult but if you want to save every scientist and find every secret area (while also minimizing your damage and number of moves) then you can make yourself a real challenge. The enemies are fun and varied with interesting patterns to memorize. Not to mention a lively sense of humor and polished art style. Recommended for puzzle lovers!"

Visual and auditive feedback are present in every action making the game instantly pleasant to play.It's very visually consistent, with great colours. Scenery looks spacey but lighthearted and everything fits together nicely.Enemies! The enemies are by far the best designed foes I've seen in my humble experience with games that feature turn-based movement. They all telegraph their attacks and have specific patterns the player must do to dodge effectively.The real-time blend with turns forces you to take action quickly but doesn't devalue tactical play.Music is pretty, fits the ambience and doesn't get repetitive as far as I've played.The story isn't indepth but Dr. Science's comments are fun to readConsAlthough the scenery visuals look great, sometimes tiles feel misleading about their collision.The lack of equipments, loot, upgrades and randomization doesn't make this very likely to be replayed once it's finished unless you care for getting a better score at the areas.Sometimes the real-time elements feel tacked on or way too simple.Difficulty is rather low, but this may change once I progress further.Definitely not the kind of depth I was expecting, don't let the Roguelike tag fool youOverall8/10"

That said...What becomes immediately apparent from the initial stages is the interconnctedness of real time and turn base strategy that permeates throughout this game. It's a fresh and funky idea that hasn't been thoroughly explored until now. You control the Nova spaceship and transverse through space and time to unlock the mystery and the aftermath of the Great Experiment.The game plays out in a level by level fashion where you explore a 2D grid and utilize precise and timed movements complete each stage. Each stage adds a new level of complexity that enhances your toolkit as you progress forward.What I like about the game is that you can play the game in bite size pieces, squeezing in a level when you have a moment but also replay stages to unravel all of the secrets for the completionists out there. Not only that, I really appreciate how this game pays homage to the classics that preceeded it (wouldn't want to spoil anything for the avid gamer).Unsurprisingly, I'm a huge fan of Nova-111, from the conception of the game, watching it come to life through beta testing and demos and now being able to fully play through it. It's worth the time"

It suits a more patient or casual gamer.If that sounds like you then it's a perfect game - I highly recommend it.If you're impatient like me, or you're looking for a challenge (ie: something not trivial) then I would have second thoughts.Check out my video review for more info @https://youtu.be/OeCswUl_GZ0Cheers,IceSaffroN"

Opening everyone up to a broad array of possibilities to get out of even the most difficult situations. At times punishing but not frustratingly so.I would recommend all types of gamers, new and olld, to give it a try.  I would like to see more creative games like this which combine gaming elements I have long enjoyed into something which seems original and fun."

Now that the eyebrow raising attempts at humor are out of the way you are in for the great cerebral ride through the pleasant visuals and novel concepts.

The thing is, that I want to enjoy the game and not just rush it. Since I have no time at all, playing games can be hard. Really hard but I can guarantee that this game is awesome! Definitely worth a try!"

76561197973801195,Recommended,325370,26140714,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,[Acumen] CaptN3mo,"Captains Log, 12.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Nova-111. Dr. Science could you explain to us what this game is all about? Well yes, in a jiffy, my good lad! But don´t go and science to hard please! Aye!First look at the game:also available as VOD on twitchNova-111 is a game that combines turn-based exploration with real time events. You have to set your mind to this fact or you will not be able to beat this game. Here is what happens:You are in control of a crashed science vessel (lets call it “ship”). Your tasks are to a) survive the dangers of an unknown planet/area/habitat/region/time/space and b) rescue scientists on the way to c) reaching an exit portal.While doing the aforementioned you collect upgrades for your ship that are becoming more and more important parts of solutions to different puzzles/challenges the game starts to confront you with in a very moderate speed. You can take your time to learn the ins and outs of science You become more and more versatile at defeating enemies and removing obstacles. But there are also bossfights, and secret areas, and more upgrades and a lot of different enemies and other hazards such as falling stalactite.You have to manage a lot of different information to do the right thing per turn and sometimes also very quick decisions and fast planning are necessary. Very intriguing concept! Also seems unique to me. That is a bonus point in my book!You have to solve multiple zones per level per world. So I think there is enough content in this game to keep even a dedicated player at it. The global Highscores do help in that department of course.Look and feel and sound:Despite its cute and colorful comic/hand drawn art style, one may even suggest casual look and feel in the beginning, the game gets really demanding and tougher by the level. You get some time to get into the zone for some levels. But if you don´t improve, the game will bite you in your ship’s hull a lot. The music and sound accompanying the turn based/real-time movement are working perfectly in unison with good controls and generally well designed levels.Captains Orders:If you can combine smart gameplay with the need to adapt every 2 minutes in between more relaxed puzzle parts in a game that looks good, feels solid and well done. Go for it. It may not have tons of replayability if you are not into achievements or time racing. But for what it offers in one first play through, I still say go get it.Verdict:Treasure!Not because it is the largest awesomest game in the last 6 month, but because it is instant fun! It takes you in or should I say lets you in real quick and then demands a lot of brainpower and/or quick reaction on the player part. I enjoyed it a lot!For more Reviews visitCaptNemo's LogFor Gameplay Videos and live streaming visitCaptN3mo's twitch channel"
,Recommended,325370,23710653,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,⸎peth,"Definitely giving this one a recommendation. Had a lot of fun with this game.The whole package is well polished, good sound design, fun/unique mechanics, a silly and unassuming narrative that didn't distract from the focus of puzzling.I believe it currently has a bug with tracking a couple achievements, but this is a wholly immaterial issue that I would never hold against the devs, I trust they'll iron it out down the line.To speak of the game itself, its got a very fun blend of turn-based activity with a bit of real-time action interspersed in with it. Watch a stream or catch a video of it, its got pretty distinctive gameplay and art to help you decide in its favor :)"
,Recommended,325370,19383910,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,pango,As far as I know this is the first grid-based combat game to successfully blend real time and turn-based combat _at the same time_. As such it is important in the history of roguelikes. Unfortunately it is not actually a roguelike at the moment as it has infinite lives and a set map. Crossing my fingers for a procgen permadeath challenge mode.

Clean graphics with great animation.  A lot of the puzzles are really innovative and fun.So why don't I recommend it?  For one thing, it's pretty expensive for this type of game.  The story is barely there at all.  I know plot and characters aren't incredibly important for this type of game but I appreciate caring a bit more about progressing.  Finally I would have prefered if the game had just stuck to turn based.  The real time portion feels like innovation for its own sake.  I think it slows down the game and makes it less fun."
