It has the *potential* to be something interesting, but you can get the full current gameplay experience by watching the 8:32 video in the description. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO YET.TL;DR it's currently a tech demo for the ""convert smooth terrain to blocks"" idea. Which is, admittedly, a pretty neat idea. But that's not a game. Keep an eye on Cubic for when actual game-like features appear...Other thoughts:* the walk speed is SLOOOOOOOOOW. We're talking ""20 seconds to walk across your 'lair'"" slow. Holding down Shift to run makes the speed tolerable, but then you get a continuous loop of heavy breathing after about 10 seconds.* the fabricator GUI *desperately* needs better camera controls. This becomes obvious in the tutorial, when you have to stick a button on the back of the door you've just created. Good luck panning, rotating & zooming until you finally get UNDER the object.* thin circular bands of light in the lair: can you say ALIASING, kids? Unless ""dancing jaggies"" is actually the decor, this is gross - and totally voluntary. I can understand that the engine is still being tweaked, but what about just not *doing* things that look terrible?* meaningless placeholder content is annoying. As far as I can tell, the different ""elements"" in the fabricator don't DO anything different. Most of them don't even have block icons. And then there's the black-text-on-dark-grey UX.* speaking of meaningless, let's talk about the ""embarcation level"". It may do something someday, but all it does now is add clicks + animation cycles to getting into and out of the lair. Oh, and sometimes you get stuck UNDER the elevator and get to reset the game..."

Buggy in it's current state. The tutorial felt broken from the start, and I feel like I skipped important parts.2. Player animations NEED WORK, BADLY.3. Though he's a creative touch and really nice to have around, the AI in the beginning can get annoying kinda quickly with his constant rambling.4.

This game has already become better then most sandbox games in my opinion. I look forward to the many feature updates to come but as is, the game is worth the money. People tend to forget that this is a early access game and they expect it to be a finished product ( which it is not). Early Access games are more for the hardcore gamer and developers that like to see the game evolve and the most important part of that is playing the game as is and letting the developers of the game know what you would like to see or about a bug/glitch that is unfound and needs to be addressed to make the game better. If you want a game that is finished then just stick to minecraft untill this is finished but expect to pay more for the finished game, I love early access games and this one is at the top of my list due to the many features that i already see in game that are being developed. For being soo early access as this game is it has very little bugs and FPS is fairly constant. I highly recommend this game for all serious developers and gameres alike."

76561198133338690,Recommended,325430,12752999,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Link,"I like this game, it's fun how it is right now with the building aspects but I can't wait for what the final result of this game will be. The description for it is very interesting. Anyway, here are my pros and cons to it.Pros-------------- The tutorial was helpful, from what I've seen it covers what's currently in the game.- I liked the fabrication area and though it took me a bit to figure it out controls for navigating around when creating objects I liked the bar at the bottom which had the ""pan, zoom, rotate"" down there until I learned the controls.- I enjoyed the idea of going out to collect things such as dirt, stone, etc.. then de-composing it into different ingredients and such.------Cons----------------- The sprint speed was a good normal speed, but the walk speed was so slow. Besides this it would be perfect.- I found a weird glitch with 'climbing' things... for example the giant mountain you find somewhere around the end of the tut that you should go and climb... you can just hit space a whole bunch of times and if you hit it's surface you can keep jumping. Same thing happens if you dig a hole straight down into the ground.- Since there is currently no menu at all I'm not going to say much about it as I'm assuming it's still in development. But, some things I'd like on it is for the tutorial. Currently, the tutorial although perfectly good (as said above), if you miss something he says that you're supposed to do, you lost it, and have to reset the whole thing. I know you can completely exit the game and re-open it, and it will take you to the last checkpoint.. I did this while inside the fabricator machine making the first door because I missed what I was supposed to do.. closed down the game and re-opened, and did it. It didn't keep my backpack in that one area in the lair though, so I couldn't move the door into it.----------------Can't wait to see how this game turns out!"

Here's a breakdown of my first 30 minutes. The intro repeated itself 3 times before it recognized that it should probably start the game up. Once started...1. Movement is extremely choppy. When I'm walking the screen is shaking violently.2. Only about 80% of the environment renders in view.3. Pressing action buttons hardly work on the first try. Found myself pressing E to pick stuff up 6-7 times before it would actually perform the correct function.4. The scavenging portion of the game is functional however the building portion is extremely difficult to use since the movement is so choppy and positioning of objects is buggy.Overall, this game in it's fully functional form is worth the $20, the potential is obviously there. As of now, don't expect to find too much enjoyment because this game needs a lot of work from development."
