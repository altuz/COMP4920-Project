Most of the reviewers here tell that the game is short and one mentions that it is around 6 hours short... I understand that every player's time may vary, but this number seems too overexaggerated.It took me personally 2 hours exactly to complete the game without using any hints. I didn't go out of my way to find all the collectibles (coins), but I managed to find 17 out of 30 in those 2 hours I spend with that game. 100% completion would be possible in 3 hours most.Otherwise, I loved the game a lot. Reminded me of Gobliiins. Except that the latter was much more difficult and required much more time to complete...NB! My in-game time record is way off because I left the game running for some time without actually playing it."

It felt as if they tried to save time developing multiple language packs so they just invented stuff. The videos make it look better than it is.As others have mentioned the game is also really short (I would recommend getting it on sale)."
76561198034820380,Recommended,325520,16404401,"Posted: 14 June, 2015",all,Gingergal,"Such a different game from Daedalic usual long point n click games and I actually loved this and had more fun playing this than some of their other games which is the usual type of game I play, so for fun factor alone was worth $5 I paid.  It's the type of game you play between those long adventure games, when you just want fun and to relax and not work too hard!I only recommend it if you can get it in a sale and at 50%+ off as yes it is short but if you like to get 100% complete on games as I do, working out how to get those last 5 or so coins, is and of itself a puzzle and actually took me as long finding them all as I did on playing the main game!   As always if you look to w/t for any help or not look for ALL coins it will be a lot quicker.  I've paid the same for long games and didn't enjoy them half as much as this so it's not all about the length.The game comprises of 10 different levels and at most has 3 different screens.  So it's not what you expect an adventure game to be and in fact I'd class this more of a puzzle/interactive game. So you can't get lost and maybe that coupled with the graphics and some easy parts to levels some think it is just a kid's game but it's not as I had a lot of fun with it.  If you want it longer do what I did  and don't hit the spacebar which shows you hotspots.You play as a caveman and your aim in each level is to release/catch the firefly and there is no dialogue (apart from some cavemen speak)    It's funny, witty, clever and I would love to see more levels via DLC.Puzzlesare mixture of logic, clicking quickly, trial and error and arcade type.  I am bad at arcade but that side was very easy.  If you normally are not good at puzzles I think this is a good game to start on, as they aren't hard.  Warning to the hard of hearing there is a level that is mostly music related, you could figure it out by trial and error (or look at a w/t).Do not leave the level to check on coins, map or anything as you will have to replay it from the beginning, as I frequently found out as I was trying to find the manual save button in level which there isn't any.  But once you figure out your level it is very quick to replay.Re achievementsit'smostly, or if not all auto gameplay related apart from the 30 coins  I do advise you checking after each level that you got 3 coins so you know where you missed them, I was stupid and didn't so hadn't a clue where I missed them it's not just clicking on them when you see them but some you have to do things and then they are auto given on completion.I also would recommed you playing with at least audio on so you can hear if you got them or not.I wish this game was longer purely as I had a blast playing it, I play enough head scratching games so love these more relaxing games for a change, so if it's on a super sale (IMO under $5) grab it and just have fun for a couple/few hours."

Because I wasn't able to finish it thanks to all the bugs! When a level bugged (one item simply disappeared)  I was mad, but I was determined enough to start the game anew, hoping that next time I'll be more lucky. And I was - I finished level four without any problems. But when the game bugged AGAIN in level five making it impossible to finish it (hotspots stopped being interactive for some reason), I lost my patience. I uninstalled the game and I have no intention of coming back to it again. Do yourself a favour and don't play it. It's not worth all the nerves."

As others have commented, some puzzles are quite difficult, and not in a satisfying way: there is no ""a ha"" moment in which you realize the meaning of a clever clue. The puzzles are just obtuse.I can't see a child playing this on their own and ""getting"" it. Even playing with an adult will result in the unpleasant realization that their adult is stupid. It might even be worse if they see the adult rage quit. :(I'm also very annoyed with a bug that won't let me get the final achievement. I worked hard to get all the coins, but the last one is just impossible to get. I followed the video walkthroughs, but cannot replicate them.And, it's short.

The graphics and the story are both funny, and the controls are great.The game consists of a series of levels where you solve independent puzzles in a relatively small area. This makes the game relatively easy. That said, each level has a unique style of puzzles which is certainly interesting.The reason I am not recommending the game however is not that the game is bad, on the contrary, it's an excellent game. It's just that it's too short for its price. If you have noticed play time of reviewers, barely anyone has played above 5 hours. A game like this, where once finished, there is not much any point for replay, 10 euros is too high.That said, if you see this game in a sale where you could buy it for 2~3 euros, by all means, buy it! It's short, but fun.Personally, this game could have become one of my favorites, because with every level you have a different style of puzzles, only if it were substantially longer so it wouldn't be just a game you played for a couple hours and forgot about."

The trailer made me think there could be some unusual mechanics, but nope, nothing of sorts.Really liked the looks of the game. The locations are really funny, backgrounds are rich and nice to look at and explore, as the bg artists hid there some fun sleepy animals. The main character animation is also nice and fun, but exept for that he's not very deep (yes, i'm aware he's a caveman, but still).The gameplay is linear, you have to finish one scene to move to the next one. Not as levels in hidden object games, but close to it.

In actual fact the game does strike a very good level of difficulty, the puzzles are pretty casual but satisfying. The game has discrete levels so you don’t have too much back tracking and clicking everything at random when you get stuck. The soundtrack is not too bad either. The game is fairly short but it is about the length I would expect from a relatively cheap point and click game. The only thing I didn’t like was the music puzzle in level 4. I’ve ranted about music puzzles before so I won’t repeat myself but they are pretty much incomprehensible to me. Fortunately this one can be solved pretty quickly by just cycling through all the combinations. So overall a pretty solid game."
