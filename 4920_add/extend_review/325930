It's fantastic.Let's talk a little, quickly, about the lane brawling and then I'll cover the elephant in the room. I think that lane brawling is absolutely the tightest way to cram as much information on the screen as possible. Now, onto the elephant.Castle Crashers.This is not Castle Crashers. There are mechanical similarities, sure. But castle crashers was ultimately a game about mashing attack while laughing. This is a game about timing, cooperation, and careful resource management. Lane brawling means that the screen is far more legible and that player interaction can be a lot deeper. The characters are much more differentiated, with hitboxing and charged abilities designed to create disjoint battlefield utility."

,Recommended,325930,26111636,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Urine Trouble,"This game is good. DAMN GOOD.Just a refreshing take on the beat em up genre with new ideas, but solid arcade gameplay.Every character has a different play style in this game and the combat depth is decently deep.  You'll need more than mashing buttons if you're going to make it to the late game.The gameplay goes as follows.1) Go through a level bashing as many enemies as possible2) Survive and bring back treasure/loot to upgrade your character stats, and buy gear3) Use money to buy potions and keys for treasure chests (any unspent loot is disgarded)4) Set sail to go through another levelYou're given the opportunity to go back to camp with your loot and money at the end of each stage, any unused loot you disgard before your next run.Controls feel great and 3 players is just enough to keep things chaotic but managable. The game scales with the amount of players you've got.There's light puzzles in the world that you need to figure out that give you pretty cool rewards.  They're clever but not too hard. Some hidden stuff in the world too, you just have to pay attention and experiment.Drop in, drop out multiplayer offline and online (Note, you join an online game when they finish a section of a stage).You only have one revive in multiplayer where your partner needs to get to you before the valkyrie gets you.There's a new game + that has its own content not accessible in normal mode.I've primarily been playing it solo by choice and occassionally hop online.Game is awesome for the price."

Are you a fan of cartoony styled art like those found in games such as Castle Crashers and Gang Beasts??? Well you're in luck, because the devs at Slick Entertainment got you covered with their latest entry into the world of indie gaming with Viking Squad. A co-op brawler that is as much fun to play solo as it is to tackle with a band of your buddies. The plot is pretty simplistic within it's self: Choose a viking (from four playable options) and see how much treasure you can plunder from the enemy's clutches. Stylistically, the game is extremely colorful and vibrant. Lead Artist Jesse ""The Drawbarian"" Turner gives you amazing aesthetics similar to the ""cutesy-chibi"" art style of The Behemoth's Dan Paladin, but with more of a comic book feel. As an artist myself, I have to rave about the art direction in this game: Jesse's work is just too awesome for mere words to convey. This title is worth the price of admission on visuals alone...Gameplay is pretty simple and straight-forward... You have a basic attack, a special attack and a magic attack that can be charged once you've unlocked that particular upgrade. You can also unlock a series of weapons and equipment to further enhance your viking warrior with stat gains, useful for tackling the later stages in the game. There is also a leveling system based around all of the treasure you accumulate over your travels. These treasures can be used to increase your health, rune power (mana/magic) and attack power. As you progress the amount of treasure needed to upgrade an ability slot will increase as well, encouraging replays of previously played areas. Just like the title Golden Axe, there are a few ""mounts"" to seize in the game, each with their own unique abilities and style of play. I must say that I found the masked ostrich to be my overall favorite mount in the game; the combination of speed and attack style proved too much for enemies to handle lol!!!The music is very good in my opinion... It complements the art style, making you feel like you're playing a live action comic book or cartoon for a better comparison. It adds to the experience ten fold, and puts it on par with Castle Crashers which has the same sort of vibe going for it as well. A very great 9 out of 10 for the OST...If I had to complain about anything in the game, it would have to be the collision detection during attack sequences and control sensitivity. It's not really a huge hindrance, but it's something to keep in mind while playing the game. Overall, I'd give the game a solid 8 out 10 and recommend the Steam community to pick this title up and give it a whirl. The Nordic gods (as well as the gentlemen at Slick Entertainment) will be pleased with your decision!!!"

The music is dull, the combat seemed only shades deeper than other beat 'em ups, and I was only in it because it had online co-op.Hours later, I realized all of the secrets (equipment, hidden side levels, unlockable passives) the game held that provided interesting challenges. I also came to appreciate the differences between the characters and how their abilities complemented one anothers; for example, combining the hammer viking juggling ability with the shield viking's frost powers to disrupt mobs and bosses, respectively.Viking Squad could use online voice chat, and some unlocks - and perhaps character levels -carrying over between characters would respect the players time, but it's still one of the best beat 'em ups I've purchased and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a co-op game. Those looking for a solo beat em up might be a little overwhelmed at times."

No.This game offers very similar atmosphere to CC, but after spending few hours of gameplay, I counted 3 major parts that makes Viking Squad different.1. Viking Squad is LANE-BASED.In CC you could just run around in circles and it was somewhat difficult to calculate the hit radius. Lane-based mechanics in Viking Squad makes the game more strategic, making it feel close to turn based strategy combat.2. Levelup progress.In CC, you could only gain experience pts by constant fighthing. Viking Squad has a bit different system in rank-ups. The stats upgrades are based on the loot which you gather from adventures. The same loot is used in home to buy/unlock everything you've found before.3. Graphics.The art comparison is not even close to properly compare. Castle Crashers was first made in 2008 and the graphics are mostly well performed animations. The art is very childish and cartoonic, but can't blame it for its age. Viking Squad is one of those games with moving images. Games with this kind are usually easier to make, but the art quality in VS is insanely high detailed! Clearly a lot of time and effort was spent in the art alone. It still has the same cartoonic 2D look but you don't find many games with high 2D details such as this anymore."

Then this game is a solid addition to them.The 4 characters in the game all feel different to play and are quite fun, the hit feedback and lane designation is much more well done than Castle Crashers- but ultimately it still doesn't beat Streets of Rage.Still a solid 5-10 hours you can get out of this with your friends, Would definitely recommend. My only complaint is that since there are only 4 characters (no unlocks) the artificial replayable is low, there are fun achievement runs involving bringing an item along with you through each act.So its a pretty fun sidescrolling beat'em up, but it doesn't have as much artificial replayability as Castle Crashers. Still would recommend though, I hope maybe we get a dlc act+characters in the future."

,Recommended,325930,26951242,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,steef,"Very fun local & online co-op brawler. Movement is in lanes to make it easier to gauge positioning and attacks, as such the movement feels a little strange at first when compared to a game like Castle Crashers, but it is easy to pick up. Decent progression through character levels, armor & weapons, as well as a Hard Mode & Boss Rush Mode. Some of the boss mechanics are repeated with re-skins and minor changes, which could be a decent gripe for some players but was easily overshadowed by the fun gameplay, crisp mechanics, and co-op brawly goodness."

Also features 4K and 144HZ support, and runs great which is always great to see. The combat is tight and very satisfying, though I would very much recommend using a controller (they have options to switch prompts between XBOX and Playstation).There is the option to rebind keyboard keys if you want to play that way, however there is currently no mouse support for menus and whatnot."

And also, flying enemies only give off a very small shadow on the ground of the lane they are on, which visually does not match the actual height you perceive them as flying on. In general, during actual battles, you are most likely going to be confused with positioning most of the time, which is critical, due to all animations being cumbersome and heavy on frames and there being no animation cancelling as far as I could've figured out, which is dumb, considering that even common enemies can have super armor on certain attack animations. To be honest, the combat feels pretty unresponsive, chaotic and same-y button mashy.The movesets are also very limited, the few ""combo"" moves there are are very difficult to pull off consecutively and most of the time aren't worth it, because they lock you in unfavorable animations or positioning as well.Bosses are very generic, high HP beatsticks with massive damage, even telegraphing attacks does not help combined with mob summons and the frantic and obscuring lane system. Plus the later bosses also add very irritating mechanics like an impending pit of death, where you have to kill the massive HP pool boss before you reach it, or constant spamming of ""barrage"" attacks while fighting off mobs and the battlefield not fitting inside one immovable screen, so the boss can run away from your screen, and you have to chase after him while dodging everything through the obscuring lanes as well.Accidentally jumping, falling off, or being knocked off ""lanes"" in all four directions is very common as well, and the battles are just too chaotic and frantic to follow even with a single player, not to mention with 2 or 3 players at once. Golden Axe style ""mounts"" are a nice addition.Progression is there, but it's lackluster at most, items and level ups only add mostly insignificant + or - numbers to your stats. The few (as in 2 or 3) new moves you unlock also give you a message that you've unlocked them and the button combination ONCE, with no other way to show a move list of some sort at all.Overall, kudos to the art and sound designers, but the gameplay guys were probably slacking off.Get it only if you have some friends for COOP who can share the frustration and hopefully make it a more enjoyable ride."

There are so many good challenges and new easter eggs to unlock that I haven't gotten even close to bored yet.

Blake!Viking Squad is a wonderful little side-scrolling brawler filled with Nordic goodness from stem to stern. Everything from the soundtrack to the taunts you can lay down feel very appropriate to the theme, the controls are incredibly tight and handle exactly like you'd expect, but there are a few bits of polish gone into this game that most brawlers overlook. First off, the lanes are locked in. I know this sounds like a bad thing, but if you've ever been frustrated about an attack just missing because you aren't on the ""aren't plane,"" you'll be happy to know that instead of walking between lanes, you hop amongst them, meaning that once you are in the lane, you're in it to win it. There is no space between lanes, there is no chance to miss, there is just good, clean hits. Second, there are TONS of little bits of polish to look for, the backgrounds are super detailed and interesting, and every inch of the world just seems... alive. It feels really great going through the game and wondering, ""If I just did THAT, what ELSE could there be?!"" and that sense of discovery becomes the driving force as you go across the map.I genuinely love this game and if you are a fan of Golden Axe, Castle Crashers, or have always dreamed of pillaging the good life, look no further than Viking Squad."

But oh boy was I wrong, the more you play the less the game unlocks anything significant/gameplay changing, it just repeats everything, upgrading your character doesn't change your moveset / expand it, anymore, and the game is full of recycled encounters.The last level is just all the bosses in the game again, and the last boss is a recycled bossfight with minimal changes  followed by another recycled bossfight, may I add the worst two bossfights in the game.The more I played the more frustrated I got by design decision the game made (such as knock down/CC invulnerability missing, sometimes leading to stupid chain dmg that is unavoidable), and just wish it would have tried to make skillfull play, and not dodge and attack mashing the most effiecient way to play the game (and don't get me starteed on bow charge shot spaming). It is also rather short, but even then feels too long cause it's so repretitive. If I had to recommend this or castlrecrashers or another brawler I would prob never recommend this one over it. Oh and the balancing is utter horse♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from way too easy to boringly repetitive ""challenging"" (dodge that attack a 100 times ♥♥♥♥♥ so fun you will stop caring and then BAM) and back to way too easy. Levels tend to drag on forever especially if you end up doing an entire world without returning to base. (I never figured out if I even had a choice in that matter).On the pro side: The art style and music are ok (but ♥♥♥♥ that overusage of chromatic aberration) and bugs are reltively few.And I played the game with my GF in two player local coop, so that should usually make the experience feel a lot more positive for me than playing alone. We both really came to dislike the game equally over time. So this review is with the added ""coop fun"" bonus already included.(Sidenote:I am a gamer that loves very challenging games since his childhood like contra/ ghosts N goblins etc. and would say I am above average skill/experience, and my GF is rather on the casual side of gaming, so you bascially have two very different users expressing the same concerns. I do not mind easy games either, as long as they are fun and engaging.)"

It does have rebindable keys but without mouse I just couldn't get past the first few minutes of gameplay.

You can see the care and passion that went into this game right on the screen as you play it.I've played it single player and with a friend co-op (online).  It looks to allow mixed local and online co-op.Definitely recommend playing it with a controller - I haven't tried keyboard, but my friend until he found his controller, and he reports it's night and day.This game is a blast - how is it not a best seller already?Already beat the game once, and I'm replaying to figure out some apparent hidden puzzles, as well as complete it on the unlocked Hard mode."

I wish it had lots of characters (loved how castle crashers had tons), but the items can change gameplay a bit, too. Hit detection is better since it is played in lanes, movement still feels comfortable. Short campaign, but it was good and clearly designed to be played through a few times with friends."

It is even MORE fun when played with friends in multiplayer! Its really addiciting satisfying combat can bring the YAYs during clutch plays and the SALT when the game shows you whose BOSS! Definitely a MUST for any gamer who enjoys alittle hack n slash! Slick Entertainment has a winner and it can only get better!

,Recommended,325930,32537757,Posted: 18 June,all,Harmon,"This game was heavily influenced by Castle Crashers which is one of the best 4 player local co-op beat'em ups I've ever played. I didn't expect it to be as good as Castle Crashers and it wasn't but it was good enough to recommend to others. The cartoonish violence, button-mashing beat'em up gameplay, big boss battles. It was a lot of fun to playthrough with two of my friends.However...I get together with a few old friends once a month and we pick a local co-op game to play and the game wasn't quite what we were looking for and we didn't figure that out until the end. When we made it to the last boss and found our characters to be under-geared so the task of beating said boss was far too exhausting. We wanted a game we could stroll through, have some good laughs, and with enough resistance to make us feel like we earned our victory. But we found that we needed to farm/find gear by backtracking all over parts of the map that we'd already completed. This game isn't Diablo and the thought of going back and searching for better gear was a bit of a buzzkill so we quit at the end. On to the next game. Sucks because the game was fun up until that point. I'm sure younger, more dedicated gamers with more time on their hands won't mind backtracking but we were not up for it. Not for Viking Squad at least."

,Recommended,325930,32876266,Posted: 27 June,all,Tenmar,"Looking for a simple fun beat em up in the vein of Castle Crashers with a Viking theme? Then try Viking Squad. Supporting up to three players local and online you plunder loot for your Jarl (that you happened to curse by freeing Loki, good job) and ravage the lands to stop the chaos you started.Mechanically you collect new gear and weapons through levels and plunder loot to buy and level up your stats. In combat you traverse levels moving up and down between four lanes and sliding to dodge enemy attacks at the last second. Each viking has their own speciality and play style with their own special attacks that you can charge which cost rune power. If things get overwhelming you can also unleash an ultimate attack to clear the room.Viking Squad is a great game to introduce people to beat em up games  with colorful art direction, great cartoon viking theme, and a folk-rock soundtrack that makes replaying the game a good time. Short and sweet to beat once, but to do everything (achievements) will require multiple playthroughs."

Expect to farm levels to gain gold and experience before advancing to some of the harder levels. At times it can seem a little too repetitive and cumbersome, but it is still an enjoyable game."
