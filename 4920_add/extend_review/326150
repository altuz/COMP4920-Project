,Recommended,326150,13037640,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Akriloth2160,"An incredibly visceral experience that is best described as the setting of Mad Max, the structure of FTL, and the gameplay of Spy Hunter. While the game's blatantly juvenile sense of humour and ham-fisted pool of refereces definitely isn't going to be everyone's kind of humour, there is simply no denying how addictive it is to try and get as far into the game as possible, as well as how satisfying it is to take down enemy vehicles along the way by ramming them off the road. If you're looking for something to play to simply pass short periods of time, wihle still being potentially addictive enough for longer play sessions, I would absolutely recommend this one."
,Recommended,326150,13653853,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Your Best Friend,"Mentally check these off as you read.1. Do you like (slightly) toned down South-Parkian humor?2. Do you like (slightly) toned down bullet-hells?3. Do you like the idea of playing the same game over and over ten times, always failing in some regard but learning and still having a fun time in the process?4. Do you like great rocking tunes and hand-drawn art that fit the mood of smashing a Nazi filled car into a fire-spewing robot and watching them both explode in a glorious union of metal, fire, and meat?If you like two or more of those, then get this game, and you'll learn to love the rest right fast. Here's some quick explanations:1. The humor is  quite good, in an evil sort of way. Just three of your reoccuring enemies are Neo-Nazis, Inbred (some are pigs and ♥♥♥♥ing CORNCOBS, how does that even happen?!) hillbillies, and scary-girlfriend-level possesive groupies, all hellbent on killing something. Along with that is the random name generator, every enemy and ally will have differnet names, from the quirky to the absurd. (I actually saw a priest named Lester the Molester.) Along with the goofy looking art and the limited but funny voice acting, it throws some pretty funny stuff. Also, I should mention that nearly every thing in the game is a reference, but the good kind. For example, nearly every car is based off of a famous one, like truck from Duel, or the rocket powered race car from Deathrace. You can even kill Chuck Norris and the Teletubbies evil, unemployed bretheren.2. Now, bullet hell may be a bit of a stretch. It's more, 'There will be bullets, but instead of dodging everything that moves like you're a balloon in a fishhook factory, you should go and headbutt those hooks and show them who's the real ♥♥♥♥♥.' You will shoot bullets, the enemy will shoot bullets, but it's not just sliding back and forth, you use your car as a weapon. You'll learn when to hit and when to miss, and it turns into a lovely display of carnage.3. This is the first time I'll make a reference to FTL, there's another coming up. You will die a whole lot. At the time of this writing, I haven't won the game yet. May it be one of the bosses, or just a tough stretch, you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed up. A lot. But there's three things that draw you back. First, because you're a ♥♥♥♥ing man and you want to win, second, achievments in game unlock new cars, which really change the playing style, and third, your kill count in your past games become a 'currancy' of sort, which allows you to buy early bonus's in later rounds, like hints on a boss and more starting money.4. Here's that second FTL callback, the music is fantastic. I'd dare say it's on par with FTL, Braid, and Binding of Isaac (the original) in the sense that it fits perfectly with the game. The headbanging punk metal and great bass playing alone will turn you into a season mullet-wearing road warrior. Add on some truly personality-filled art that keeps all the characters, allies and enemies, fresh looking, and it all wraps up as a wonderful game.Sure there are a few problems, just little things that I would have differently, but I haven't come across any game breaking bugs, and there seems to be promise of more great stuff from these developers. So yes, I really recommend this game, it's a bullet-ridden Camero's load of fun.EDIT: I finally beat it after 16 combined hours of trial and error, and I'm no where close to being bored playing this game. Protip- The ranged damage stat of the driver effects the amount of damage the Red Rocket Dog's flame cause."
,Recommended,326150,18532572,"Posted: 17 October, 2015",all,Baphomet,"It took me a while to finally like this game but I'm glad I kept trying!Death Skid Marks is more-or-less what would happen if you combined Spy Hunter with FTL and put it in some sort of Mad Max style universe with roguelike elements. The visuals are gritty, vulgar, and generally hilariously exaggerated either through blood and viscera or goofy stereotypes gone horribly wrong. The music and sound effects are pretty fitting for a highway drive full of wanton destruction and I never felt like they were getting on my nerves at any point.Like I mentioned earlier, gameplay is akin to Spy Hunter in that you race down a highway full of other drivers either trying to kill you or getting in your way. Along the way, you can pick up additional characters (hikers) that can be armed with a variety of ranged or melee weapons, shot up with drugs to improve stats, or used as guinea pigs in science experiments or Russian roulette (also to improve stats, but with a chance of failure/death).By the way, this game is really, really hard. Chances are, you will probably get ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG dozens of times during your first few hours of playing the game as every possible thing is randomized: store inventories, hitchhikers present, enemies spawned, and bosses encountered, you name it. This can, unfortunately, result in runs that are impossible to win (like getting sawblade groupie without a good ranged weapon or brain tank without good enough melee). In that way, DSM really reminds me of FTL’s habit of randomly giving you the shaft and forcing you to restart, which can be kind of a bummer if you’ve been having a really good session and believe me, it can be absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating to get 75% of the way through the game and get obliterated by some enemy who just happened to be the perfect counter to your build.All in all, the overall atmosphere and fun-factor behind Death Skid Marks kept me coming back again and again, even though playing it was like getting randomly kicked in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ so there’s something to be said about that. This game is a must-have for anyone who enjoyed playing FTL but wanted a lot more action, violence, and ridiculous humor."

,Recommended,326150,24432468,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Rémoche,"In this review, I will mostly talk about the game's difficulty and the place given to RNG. I hate video games purely based on RNG and I hesitated for a long time to buy this game because of this. I think it's important to clarify this point.You may read customer reviews saying that this game relies too much on RNG, that it's unfair, stupidly hard, unbalanced... etc. I disagree with those statements.It's hard for sure, and unforgiving. But after more than 35 hours of gameplay, I'm now able to finish every single run I start (except for some really special vehicules). It has nothing to do with luck, it just requires a lot of learning.I'm going to expand on two points : bosses and essential items.*I saw a lot of people complaining about the bosses. And I have to admit that they were really painful the first time I met them. But they all have a specific pattern, and a weakness (except for the clowns, they're just a bunch of HP wandering on the screen, but they're quite weak so it's not a big deal). Once you know these things, you'll never die because of bosses anymore. You'll just have to be careful, and everything will be fine.*However, you can't finish the game without some essential items, and that's the second point I'm going to develop here.IMO, a wrench (allowing you to repair your car while driving) and a good ranged weapon are crucial.A medikit (allowing you to heal your characters while driving) is really useful too, but on some cars you just have two seats (one character is the driver, so there's only one character able to use an item) so you have to make choices.Given the fact that the game is a rogue-like, it's supposed to give you items randomly. So you may think that it's unfair : there are items you have to get to finish the game, but you're not even sure the game will ever give them to you.Actually, RNG is quite insignificant in Death Skid Marks. They are a lot of shops, and not many different items. When you start the game, it's just a matter of minutes before finding a wrench. Will you be able to buy it? I think that's where a lot of beginners have problems. It's tempting to buy drugs, car upgrades, weapons and stuff. But Death Skid Marks has rogue-like elements, and it wants you to manage your resources.I hope this review makes things a bit clearer : this game has flaws but RNG isn't one.Don't be afraid to give a try, it deserves it."

As I write this I've only played around 2.5 hours or something, and only played 2 runs (both of which ended in death). However I can definitely say that this game is worth getting. The pixel graphics during gameplay, while similar to many other indie titles, look great. The art style for the characters is even better, I can imagine the artist behind them was just told to make them look as grotesque as possible (but in a comical way).The gameplay is is at first nice and simple and easy to grasp, but after a few miles of feeling like the king of road rage, the game suddenly starts throwing groups of three enemies and bosses at you. This is where you start to die, and have to think more carefully about upgrades and who you have in your crew.There is already a good handful of weapons, hitchhikers, and vehicle and character upgrades, however I do hope that the developers keep adding new content, as there is potential for them to do so. Basically, if you like retro-style rogue-likes and a good challenge, you can't go wrong with this little gem."

But it's honestly not very good at all. The problem comes with a really inconsistant execution. A lot of the bosses are ""puzzle bosses"" that you can only beat with a specific build or playstyle. But you don't know what sort of boss you're going to encounter. This leads to the game being ""rock paper scissors"", but on a 30 minute time delay.

Problem is, everyone else on the road is trying to kill you! Rednecks, cops, neo-nazis, furries, religious fanatics and other nutjobs - everyone wants you dead, so obviously you will put an end to that by killing them first.Upgrade your car and your arsenal, take lots of drugs, pick up friendly hitchhikers and leave a trail of destruction behind until you make it to that epic concert, or die trying - and you WILL die a lot, but will still come back for more, because at that point you'll be addicted already (and/or are a sucker for punishment).The game has a kind of humor that manages to be immature while still being funny instead of obnoxious. The art style is a great blend of cartoony and gritty, which totally suits the mood of the game (as a fellow artist, I couldn't help but admire it and feel inspired).In short, Death Skid Marks is addictive, kickass, fast-paced action, all to the sound of a badass metal soundtrack that will make you want to headbang.

,Recommended,326150,18647285,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,Mr. Hicks,"Most would say, ""Hicks, you are a sucker for rogue-likes,"" and I would flat out admit it's true.  If any developers approaches me and says, ""My game is a rogue-like-"" I will interrupt their speech by just throwing money at them.  Many would say, ""but what about the bad roguelikes?""  Honestly, I haven't found one yet.Death Skid Marks continues to bolster my statement on the matter, only instead of wandering around in a dungeon this game puts you through what could quite easily be the road trip from/to hell.  Pick a car, start driving, kill people, pick up hitch-hikers, collect cash, and upgrade, upgrade, upgrade to what is supposed to be the most ♥♥♥♥♥ing concert ever (I wouldn't know, I still haven't gotten to it).  However looking past the rogue-like quality DSM posesses there is also a surprising necessity for twitch controls as your enemies spray bullet after bullet on you and your passengers while you're engaged in vehicular combat. To some degree there at times when it actually feels more like a bullet-hell shooter than arcade-esque roguelike.The topping to this superb sundae of a game is a soundtrack that really gets blood pumping, and art style/humor that borders on funny yet possibly inappropriate.  In reality I literally said to myself while playing this game, ""The only way this game could get any more awesome is if I could drive a damn tank.""And then I magically started driving a tank by a method I won't even explain.

Every single run drags on for way too long for this style of game, and the vast majority of them will end with you being screwed over by some asinine overpowered combination of weapons on some regular enemy, or the one boss you didn't get good enough ranged/melee for.  Most of the game's problems stem from the extremely unenjoyable ""rng"" shop system with not only its arbitrary spawning system (the fact that you get a shop almost every single wave early on in the game when you literally do not need them and can't make enough money to even use them, then can't get a single one for half a dozen waves when you're far enough to actually be taking damage), but the similarly arbitrary selection of things that are actually available to buy in any given shop.This system in tandem with the distasteful pricing balancing of weapons/items/upgrades just drains any enjoyment from a run you play well, and makes ones in which you don't even more frustrating. To add on to the frustration, the only persistent mechanic in place is spending your kills, usually in amounts that take an hour or longer to accrue, on a trivial one-run stat boost. The reason so many games these days implement some kind of over-arching progression mechanic is so that you don't automatically feel like you just completely wasted your time when you get blindsided after half an hour by exactly the kind of cheap trick deaths this game is filled to the brim with.Ultimately, the game is not terrible, but I can't recommend it to anyone that I would know. If the runs took 10-15 minutes to reach the deaths that almost always feel rigged against you, then it wouldn't be so bad, but the dragging nature and the frustrating mechanics just make it a bad experience overall."

You can't really expect to get too far in this game at any given time.  Sometimes things will go really smoothly and at others you will get crushed and will wonder exactly what you did wrong.  Sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it's your fault.  Most of the time it's difficult to really tell.Occasionally the enemies will just sit there and let you soot them with ranged weapons while they sit out of range of their own flame throwers.  ?!?!Occasionally you will go from shop to shop and never get a relevant powe-up, though you desperately need them to have a chance. ?!?!So it's really hard to say if someone will like it.  I enjoy it well enough, but it can be frustrating even if you like it.  Maddening if it's not your cup of tea.  Many situations will probably be unwinnable and rogue like games use the term as a cop out for actual gameplay balance.I will say that the art style is a lot of fun.  It's absurd."

It's hard and can get even harder for people who like it that way.It has a voiced tutorial, so that way you don't run into the brick wall face first and end up dying right off the bat, because the game will do that for you anyway.It has fun, wacky characters that you can add to your team of roadies and a hilarious number of enemies based off appropriate car jokes and all-around hilarity.I appreciate it for the close-to Rat Fink art style and the fact that the character portaits reflect their overall health. I appreciate this game, for being a wacky top-down car game where you can kill everything, and are encouraged to do so. I like the challenge modifiers that play a crucial role in actually improving.I like the music, for the most part. After the first few hours though, it can get a little obnoxious but you can turn it off.I will now give a Review thing and then Cons:Graphics: Unique. It's a different style of artwork that brings back memories of old car magazines and wacky cars of all sorts. It looks good and has no real problems. More than satisfactoryDifficulty: Challenging. It has a number of modes, modifiers and ways to play and the additional in-game modifiers that alter your play style basically gives it a huge number of ways to play from up close to ranged to hit and run. Additionally, since you have to actually get people to the concert to get their ending parts, there is an actual concrete goal you can see ticking down as you get closer and closer.Gameplay: It's a Rat Fink Style Wacky Racers Deathmatch where anything goes. Your crew will die, your car will die and you will laugh and bite your tongue, desperate to prove you can beat it. It's also good for a quick 15 minutes of fun. You can pick it up, put it down and it will be just as fun as you remember.Current Cons or Bugs? Nothing I have really noticed. Everything seems well made but if I find one, I'll make sure to say so.Overall Opinion: Death Skid Marks is a game that you can give you a lot of entertainment for challenge and for how little it costs. It looks good. It sounds good. It plays well. I wish I had something to say that was negative about it, but really there isn't. Unless you count it being hard, but that is entirely based on your skill level. It's not so easy that you'll just breeze through it, but not so hard that you can't see the point. It's like, how I think it should feel, like an old arcade game.However I do have one word of warning to people: If you die, you have to start All the way over. It is rogue-ish in that fashion. And while I feel it would be appropriate for you to be able to respawn at your last pitstop, or even have lives (hey I found my one complaint) I do feel it is a bit too unforgiving.Tips and Tricks:When playing if you find the mad doctor, use the cancer guy. I have had him healed and maxed 3 times in a ride and if he's fully healed and upgraded, he is a nice shade of pink.Don't trust ??? it leads to a mad gamble machine that essentially gives you a random trade that can and likely will ruin your games.Remember, your character stats do matter and the positioning does also. If you can't ram the side with a guy that has a buzzsaw, get on the other side. Use other cars on the road to your advantage.I think the Alien increases difficulty or something, because randomly the game seems to get harder when you have him, and considering he has +'s in all areas, I could see the developers adding this trick.Always get the food you can get when you need it.

Death Skid Marks has got to be possibly the most engaging and unique Roguelites of it's kind. The game prides itself on it's ""trashy humor"" which I still get amused seeing the 50th time an Aryan Roadkiller car rolls up with the driver's name being something along the lines of, ""Ryan Dickfingers."" The art style also complements it's trashy nature with the old computer terminal overlay and the downright freaky characters you pick up off the side of the road. Not only style though, the game itself is amazing.Each game starts off slow. But the game progressively speeds up with each road segment and passing km. Handling one car at a time with up to a driver or a single passenger is fine. But having to deal with 3 cars filled with sniper rifle carrying neo-nazi's, flame thrower toting religious zealots and assault rifle and shotgun crazy rednecks is damn stressful. Wait, WHEN THE ♥♥♥♥ DID THAT ROBOT GET THERE?! This game is punishing if you don't manage your hitchhikers, car, money, and jobs properly, a single hitch hiker killed or one upgrade not purchased 2 roads back is enough to end your game IMMEDIATELY. Which is fine, because it keeps every game feeling fresh and having you learn your mistake and adapt correctly.The only thing I can really say that's wrong with the game is that it's horribly unbalanced. Sure, melee does alot of damage, but late game you really can't afford to bring your hitch hikers anywhere near the other cars. Sure, I could take that dismemberment job for 50 dollars per person, but a 1/10 chance to actually earn that money doesn't make it worth it. Basically, All Ranged Weapons, Ranged Crew Kill jobs, and Wrench/Medkit strategy is the easy mode, and it works every time.Other than that, try this god damn game. It's a s**t-kicking, hamburger devouring, smash n' crash of a game that hopefully the two creators will update with a bit more content. (Right guys? New cars and hiker friends on the way guys?

It is kind of a mashup of spyhunter, Carmageddon,  and any road trip movie. Mix in a heavy dose of Fear and Lothing in Las Vesgas with rude crude humor, and you have a recipe for a good time. Easy to grasp  controls mated with simple and intuitve menus quickly turn the family seadan the into a rolling mosh pit of death.Plenty of power ups to fuel the mayhem can be had at the many roadside stops, along with various hicthhikers to fill your car with violence  needed to get that  mega-metal concert at roads end. Purchace items from baseball bats to flame throwers to golden concet tickets to help you to arrive on time, in style, and mostly intact.Did I metion the humor? The game pokes fun at most everything, never has dying in a flaming car been so funny, and die you will lots. The roads many nutball factions are built to grind you to dust, and the bosses will just stop your butt into the pavement. There are no saves only continues, so there is no way to aviod your nasty  un-timely demise, but you can just start again and again, wich you will due to the addicing nature of the game.Game upsides1. Nice to look at art work with a full range of painful gory ways to die.2. Many ways to build up your crew with a large list of weapons and  drug to boost your stats. Dont forget the quickly boost stat over the barrel of a pistiol provided you survive the encounter.3. Lot of new buddies to share the road with you from all walks of life.

It has a bit progression, so that when you meet certain condition, it will unlock more cars.After almost ten hours I can say that I wish I could like this game more, but I don't.My problem with it and the reason why I don't reccomend it, is that you lose really fast. Depending on the enemy or your car, you can go from 100% to 0% in a matter of seconds.Getting back from the start is not a big penalty, luckly, but the punishment is too harsh, and quite often too fast to understand what you're doing wrong. Even following the users' guides doesn't help you much, and you're left with the frustration of not getting why you failed.Many people compare this game to FTL, but it's not right.

It's got a Mad Max-ish aesthetic coupled with filthy humor, which I like, great graphics and an awesome punk and rock soundtrack. Cars exploding, blood and guts flying and music pumping, what's not to like?Like I said, the gameplay! There is no flow to it at all. It starts, stops, starts, stops, starts and then stops. This game is a simplistic car combat game where the goal is to destroy one car, most of the time, and then pick your next destination by picking a highway sign. Go straight ahead to attack a neo-nazi convoy or turn right to chase down a car full of Westboro Baptist nutjobs. With each choice, there's also a bonus destination you visit before you go to the next stretch of road. It can be an event that gives you a random car, a place where you can mutate your characters or a place to upgrade your weapons. Those are rare, though, and 99% of the time, the bonus destination is a shop.The shop is just a menu where you click on things to buy them. You can sell, but you don't really have an inventory (only what your characters can carry, which is one active and one passive item). You can upgrade your car and the characters in them, replace the characters if you find a better one, buy more weapons and find special items. These things are all great. The problem is that you also have to visit the shop, you have no choice in the matter, because you must find and buy ""tickets"" that allow you to actually win if you survive the game. These tickets are completely random. In the session I just had, there had only been a single ticket for sale when I died about 70% to the goal. I needed four. Because apparently surviving wasn't difficult enough, which it is, winning has to be totally up to random chance over whether or not you find these tickets. Because that's fun.Not only do you have to keep visiting the shop in search of tickets, you also have to find ""jobs"" for your characters. That's how you make money. There are a bunch of useless ones like ""here's $50 (a miniscule amount) for managing to destroy a car without killing any of its passengers (which is hard)"", and then there are the good ones like $100 for destroying a car (which is what you do on every single level, so it's $100 guaranteed unless you die) or $75 for beating a level. I think you can guess which ones are in every single shop and which ones are rare, forcing you to visit every shop you can to find them and maximize your income which in turn maximizes your killing potential through buying upgrades.And there's the problem. You drive for 30 seconds, destroy a car, then you spend a minute looking through the menu. Drive for 20 seconds, menu for 15 seconds, drive for 10, menu for 40, drive for 20, menu for 120... See where I'm going? There's no flow! You can't just choose to have fun and destroy cars, you have to sit around and stare at a menu half the time. The only way to have uninterrupted fun with this game is if you have the enormous luck to score four good jobs and four tickets in your first four shop visits. Then, maybe, you could actually focus on driving and shooting and smashing and having fun.As it stands, this is half an awesome and hilarious game and half a boring menu-clicking simulator. I've only played about an hour and a half, but I can't see myself going back to it."

Winners Don't Do Drugs - Studio Whisky Tango Inc.Most Magnificent ReviewDEATH SKID MARKSIntroAh Death Skid Marks, so wrong, so fun, so good. This is why humanity is doomed so say I Lord Rexes.Death Skid Marks is a vehicular slaughtering game in which religion, nazis, and every single dark side of humanity is left bare for all to see and shoot. Basically it is a topdown action vehicle slaughter roguelite game where you drive cars, shoot or whack other cars into explodium entertainment and using the money you get from amusing off-screen spectators to upgrade your car into more slaughter. Oh I love it. Let us dive in.PresentationOffensive, vulgar, and crass. Yet it all mixes well together in this pot of hedonism and greed where heavy metal music blares into your skull and every form of the worse humanity has to offer arrives to knock your skulls into your that puny brain of yours.Visceral and bloody. This is the game that took the theme of rock, senseless violence, hitler, and redneck to the extreme and ran with it all the way to the finish line.Does it run well? Controls? Or perhaps the option menu?Yes, yes, and no.It runs like a charming dream at a constant 60 fps despite the huge amount of destruction and carnage on-screen.Controls are so good even a T-Rex such as I could maneuver myself deftly enough to deliver a killing blow to the schumck beside me. Assuming you are using the keyboard that is because its hard to aim using the two noobly things on the controller.Unfortunately options menu are rather bare where the most minimum options are present but it already runs well in the first place so it is not as bad as you think it is.Graphics!Does it look realistic? No it does not but it does look silly. And despite the look you will be surprise at the amount of detail that little death on wheel you call a car can have. Burn it and scorch mark from hells will appear and smack it until it shows its terrible soft hide at below.Everything from the menu till the character art looks great but more variation for the stores would not hurt.The SoundI am a cold blooded animal and what better way to get this veins flowing than to jam along to the rock music this game is packed to the brim with. Smash your enemies skulls with an array of excellently done tracks.GameplayIt has come to this has it not?Pick a difficulty, pick a car. Then start smashing/shooting/ramming your way to vahalla.The objective of game is to reach the end of the road which happens to be a concert, preferably with the head of everyone still intact. To aid you with that you have an array of vehicle to choose from at start although it does lock you in once the actual game starts. Things like armor, amount of passenger, and strange passive are up for consideration.Having done that you now pick up people along the way to take up space in your meatlocker so they can shoot/smash or act as a general meatshield. A legitimate strategy trust me. Each crew also has their own specialty so mix and match those bodies.You choose a path to take at the end of every encounter with symbols telling you the remaining distance, enemy types, and special event on display. You earn money by completing job while on the road then you use these money to buy tickets, weapons, armor, health, and other typical things.Then it is back on the road killing things until you die and restart over or reach the end and savor the delicious ending [and unlockable new vehicles by bringing people [alive] to the concert!]Along the way enemies from all shapes and sizes will try to stop your holy pilgrimage.The longer you survive, the better the reward, weapons, and enemies you will be force to duel with.Thoughts and ConclusionWell it certainly takes the theme and turn it all the way up and unlike some games it does it well, enjoyable, and fun.I would give this game a solid recommendation so long as you know that you will be facing a lot of restart, a lot of trial and a solid roguelite combat.Nom!Check out these delicio- I mean great reviewer besides myself in our humble little group.No drama,Just Reviewshttp://store.steampowered.com/app/326150/If I may, get the OST and jam out to some seriously wicked tunes."

Maybe they have really easy solutions that I haven't figured out yet, but it's always been a ""game over"" situation when going up against those two, even with a decently upgraded car and passangers.Despite that, the game is an utter blast. There's a real solid feel to all of the action and upgrading you can do and the unlockable cars add a really fun sense of replayability with each one requiring different tactics to use well.

The game is very enjoyable to play even if its just a ""car game"" as some might see it as BUT its more than that. Everything has to be upgraded from the cars condition, cars performance, characters heath, characters stats and choice of weapons. So its not just another drive from point a to point b without thinking cause if you do then you won't make it to far. As some reviewers said before - it takes a certain skill and a chance of luck to beat this game. It is also unforgivably hard to some players but if you stick to it you might just beat it in medium mode and continue to the other 13 Super ultra hard modes (I know I haven't yet).I suggest giving the game a shot & since its on sale its a steal to grab for your collection.

It's Mad Max meets Wayne's World, set to the pace of some of your favorites like Faster Than Light, with strategy being an absolute necessity from the beginning. Don't be surprised when you die. This will happen often at first. I haven't tried lowering the difficulty yet but given my near-disgust at losing time and time again, I'm sure I will at some point. Your measly winnings from each leve--nay, survival, barely pay for repairs and flapjacks to feed your carmates. And at some point, you're going to have to upgrade that shitheap you call a ride, so you're expected to deficate coin here and alot that appropriately. It's delicate.. juggling finances in such a chaotic environment. I mean, the entire point of the game is to reach some effing concert (I'm not even sure whose playing, let alone whether or not thay're any good). The music is fun and almost earthy at times. It can appeal to your metalhead or his hidden inner-hippie. Expect to see and hear nasty, truckstop-quality persons throughout the game.

You will die alot. You will not complete it without a lot of time investment as there is a lot to learn and you will need to train your skills. You will be overwhelmed by the amount of upgrades and equipment that you can spend your limited death dollars on. As mentioned earlier the only way to overcome this is to experiment and die. Lots. And then some more. I still stick by my comment regarding the guns in the game, they seem weak compared to other options. Maybe I'm just impatient.It is however a very good game and extremely addictive. The music is fairly good too.After reconsideration, I believe this game deserves an 8/10, among it's peers.""Seriously I almost didn't recommend this game....Everything about it is great, except the difficutly is just off the scale; even for a roguelike; even on the 2nd lowest setting. Don't get me wrong, I like hard games but this just takes this biscuit. It needs retuning for sure.If i can't work out how to kill a boss (the same boss ( the saw boss)) in 3.3 hours played, without resorting to watching a tactic on youtube (this isn't WoW ffs) then something is wrong. I'm sure I could learn some really more important stuff in that time.Also the guns in this game need to do double the damage they currently do; melee weapons and ramming are just so much easier.Great concept, fantastic style, will probably play it again and again.

It's easy to start up and get into, it has a ton of different modes and unique cars, and combining roguelike elements with car combat is definitely inspired.However, I consistently run into the same problem that ultimately chased me away from FTL. With a little luck, some careful maneuvering, and decent resource allocation I can get about 75% through a run before hitting a brick wall. Sometimes I'll get worn down in a way that feels organic, like my death was the result of mistakes I was making. But more often then not, I run into a ridiculous combination of enemies and environmental challenges that no amount of skill or preparation could defeat.For example, I was just driving a tank and laying waste to everything. The very first boss I encountered (The Buzzsaw Alien) destroyed my tank in literally less than 5 seconds. In almost 40 hours of playing, I've managed to beat this boss twice (maybe). Usually, whenever it shows up, I just kind of resign myself to death. I still have no idea what its patterns are, or when the ""shield is down."" Also, the boss is surrounded by a giant saw that is always rotating. Sometimes the saw actually damages your car, which is usually enough to kill you almost instantly. Sometimes it doesn't damage you at all. I have no idea when it does or doesn't cause damage.When it comes to roguelikes, it's always difficult to determine whether constant death is the player's fault, or the developer trying to escalate the difficulty and going a little too hard in the paint. The general response to complaints about the game's difficulty have been of the ""Git Gud"" variety, so I'm not holding my breath about any future patches balancing the late-game a little more in the player's favor. However, for the sake of this game (which IS good and worth the effort), I hope I'm wrong."

It can be incredibly controller-throwingly frustrating (as good roguelikes tend to be), but it hits the sweet spot so many similar games miss where you can lose and actually _want_ to try again and get further next time.  The entire journey is humorous and badass and just raunchy enough to keep it's audience coming back for more.Gameplay:top down view of your vehicle and enemies.  You can move pretty freely on the screen, but want to avoid going off of it on top or bottom, or slamming into the rails on the side of the highway.  As a car, you have options at your disposal including ramming and pushing enemies into the rails or off the bottom (or if you're beefy, the top) of the screen, or shooting if you have the money for ranged weapons.  Ammo is unlimited though, so once you get that shotgun or ak47, you can keep firing it forever.  Your goal, no matter how you achive it, is to destroy their vehicle (or passengers) before they destroy yours.  Is this easy?  HELL NO!  Some enemy cars have mounted sawblades, or built in rocket launchers or gatling guns  Add ot that a crew of passengers armed with who knows what, and a driver hell-bent on scrapping you first.That's the game in a nutshell.  You go through ""stages"" of Highway, battling the tropes of Post Apocalyptic societies, such as Anarchists, while also sometimes encountering Nerds (who have super-weapons), Corrupt Police, and a few other oddball groups.  You get paid based on how you score your kills via ""jobs"" so you can choose whether you get your money from murdering passengers with melee weapons, or blowing up the car, or pushing it offscreen or whatever.  At first, this seems like you should pick based on your playstyle, but after playing a while, I found it much better to pick jobs based on what your car and crew can do.  A car with sawblades is just going to be better at melee than a car with a machine gun mount.Then there are bosses.  They're gonna waste you.Pros:The interface isn't too difficult, and despite staying on theme, it's clear what nearly everything does from just descriptions.Most games are short unless you choose Endurance Mode.The Soundtrack is badassThe graphics are sweetThe violence is epicThe cars are ♥♥♥♥♥inCons:You can run out of hitchhikers to pick up and instead of randomizing them, you just get the same one repeated infinitely after that.There are a number of one-seat vehicles that make it impossible to finish with other hitchhikers for their achivements and unlockable cars.Lernie.10/10, highly recommended if you're into violence, music, the trashy style, difficult actionpacked games with no dull moments, or any of the above."

This is a fun game, and is up there as one of my faverouites.It is also wall-destroyinhly hard. The art is nice though, so there is that.

76561198211938387,Recommended,326150,24419292,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,MEDIC!,"Welcome to the world's most bada** road trip through Route 666, populated by crazy rednecks, the Westboro Baptist Church's crazy inbred cousin, a raving pack of Aryan Brotherhood knockoffs, and mental patient furries, on your way to a kicka** concert at the end of the road.Gameplay:This ain't your grandpa's roguelike! Strap yourself into one of many vehicles, strap up with whatever you can get your grubby little hands on, and pick up as many hitchhikers as you can fit in whatever hunk of junk you decided to take to the show. All the way down there though, you're going to have to deal with various factions that all want you dead, and they are more than happy to do far more than just run into your car a few times.On the way there, you'll find a few road stops along the way with more than just greasy truck-stop food (though don't fret. They do have greasy truck-stop food.). You're going to need more than just you, Mark Skid, driving the car if you're going to make it down to the rock concert in one piece. Hitchhikers can be found at the snack bar, you're going to need vehicle upgrades and repairs at the garage, arms dealers can get you outfitted with weapons, jobs can be found there, drug dealers can get your characters to deal more damage and take more punishment, and the Lernie (TM) Mart gan get you special items and your concert tickets. No. I have no idea how the game's equivalent to a gas station gets an RPG.Other times, you'll find stops where some fool's playing Russian Roulette. You win, get two stats added to all your character's stats, saving you a helluva lot of cash in the long run. Lose, and you can guess what happens...This game is all about the long haul. If all you're doing is fixing what the last guy did to you, you're going to get outmatched by later vehicles. That Redneck husk of a truck is pretty easy to kill, but dealing with the Aryan Roadkiller's rocket turret WWII artillery vehicle is going to be a bit more difficult if you haven't done anything to your vehicle. Stock paneling might stop pistol bullets pretty well, but minigun bullets, rockets, jackhammers, geek super weapons, etc. will rip through that easier than wrapping paper on Christmas.Pros:+Gameplay is very well executed.+Music gets the job done, even for a guy like me who generally hates harder rock.+Difficult, but not impossible.+Pretty darn funny, especially as the logic of the game gets more convoluted. Seems like it can easily come right out of some young metalhead's book, if he wrote one.+Good variety in how one builds their road to success. No two rides are the same, save for the dying, which will happen a lot. Trust me.+Rewards you with repeated playthroughs by allowing you to pay total death count for bumper stickers.+Don't like standard gameplay? There's a boss rush, arcade mode with no stops, and turbo mode.Cons:-BEWARE: RNG is present and higher than your standard roguelike, but I found this did not hamper the experience too much, and is controllable if you do the smart thing and get a wrench, medkit, and a balanced attack strategy. You will be annihilated if you don't heed this sage advice. There are bosses built to punish overly focused battle strategies.-LURNIE'S SPESHUL ADEVENSHUR WIT MURK SHKID!!!+Hidden pro. Killing Lurnie and stealing his tutorial car. Stupid Lurnie...-Unlocking more cars can be a bit difficult in the beginning, however once you knock off enough of the major bosses, you can get really decent cars, not that the ones you start out with really suck or anything. The Standardo XL is like the stock weapons in TF2. Statistically the best, but other cars have more specific playstyles. The Standardo XL is not going to have as strong a melee game as the combine harvester with its rotating bars of death.Final Judgement:At about $10 when I bought it, I got my money's worth, but it might be a touch too much for others. However, if it's on sale at all, get it and get your rock on today!"
