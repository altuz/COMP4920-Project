It was never intended to be a serious blood and gore vampire game, It was a satire on the whole vampire thing, and I found that refreshing. It was also corny like a 1950 B movie, which I believe was done intentionally. There is a lot of comedy in the game. I also liked the fact that the achievements were easy to obtain for a change. The game was also short in length which I consider a plus. I get tired of these epic 100 hour plus games that developers seem fond of creating lately.If you want a relaxing game that offers amusement and won't take weeks to complete then you will like this game."
,Recommended,326180,18934644,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"I've played many hidden object games but have never bothered reviewing any of them, partly because I think everybody generally gets the idea by now and more or less knows what to expect, but also because, with a few exceptions, there's usually so little difference between the content and quality that were I to write reviews for each and every one I'd essentially end up trying to find dozens of different ways to say the exact same thing. (By the by, just about anything published by Artifex Mundi should see you right if you're looking to get into the genre) But I'm writing one for Sinister City as I feel I need to come to its defence a little and share my own take on it.It seems like such a cop-out when people say the only reason somebody doesn't like something is because they don't understand it. It's sort of a thinly-veiled way of calling someone stupid rather than accept they might understand it perfectly but just not like it, that they simply have a different preference than you. But after reading a lot of the negative reviews, this is one occasion where I actually feel like some people kinda didn't get it. As pretentious and w*nky as it is to say, there is a difference between something being parody, pastiche and just plain bad, and this game dips its toes into all three, which is where I think a lot of confusion comes from.Let's get it out of the way and say what needs to be said, many parts of this game are bad, unintentionally so. Graphically it's kind of somewhere between looking like a PS2 and PS3 era game and there were quite a few times in the hidden object sections when I wished everything was clearer or more distinct. In other games in the genre these sections can have a more artistic slant with their high quality renders of interesting scenes and items. Here, everything is far more workmanlike and pretty forgettable; a straight on view of some open cupboards or top down into a box with a small handful of items in it. They don't feel hugely inspired. But worst of all are the bugs and glitches that plague the game. It happened to me a few times where some strange artifacting would appear in the form of white blocks across the screen and completely obscure my view, or every time I'd click anywhere in a hidden object scene it would kick me out of it forcing me to manually enter the scene repeatedly after every object I found. In fairness, this only happened to me in the second stage of the game then never bothered me again after (exiting to the main menu then hitting Continue eventually seemed to fix this for me. In some cases I think Steam pop-ups may have triggered this to happen, but I'm not completely sure). They were the only issues I had personally, but others have complained of far worse, like losing save data every time they closed the game or buggy achievements not registering properly, or in some cases, not even being able to start the game at all. And if anyone had these issues then they'd be absolutely right to give it a bad review as their experience with the title. But, thankfully, I had a far better time with it. Well... eventually.[View Comments for the missing 4th paragraph]You play as a sort of Tom Cruise lookalike trying to find his kidnapped fiancé and being lead to Sinister City in the search. A kindly old hotel receptionist tells him to stay away from there, that it's a vampire city, and the guy doesn't even bat an eyelid at the mention of vampires. Nor does he when he's invited to a session of telepathic communication to try tracking her down, he just accepts the offer and follows an old man into a darkened back room. I think pretty much everyone who plays it either laughs their *ss off at these points or else says it's stupid and loses all hope for the game, I know they were certainly my reactions. But then I got to a point where it just sort of clicked with me. I realised they understood these games are dumb and their stories make no sense, so they start having a little fun and going all out ridiculous with it. The head vampire kidnaps his own daughter to arrange for her to marry a kid's TV presenter to vicariously live out his own failed ambitions of movie stardom that he's secretly harboured for centuries. Oscar Wilde, this is not. But I love that they have fun with it rather than being so serious like most of the other games and I was surprised at how much I laughed at some genuinely funny moments in it. If you have to make a crazy, nonsense story, I think it's way better to go funny with it instead of trying to be respectable with how legit you are with your craft, and I applaud them for making that move here.Like I said, if anyone had a bad experience with this on a technical level then I can't argue with that, and to begin with I was right there with them. But by the end this game thoroughly won me over and I had a great couple of hours with it. With some funny moments, some interesting hidden object play that I eventually came around to, and at least an attempt at a new variety of mini games for the genre, I can easily say this was the best 9 cents I've ever spent."

Everything in this game was cringy, but I still enjoyed it. It's like a Bollywood movie, complete with bad acting and scenery, but it's part of the joke. Plus, puzzles and mini games.You play as John, who is searching for his bride Nina, who is being held captive by her father Count Orlock. You must solve puzzles and unlock the path to free her and complet Orlock's wish: to become a famous Hollywood actor. Not much more can be said about that, pretty much tells it's own story right there.Aside from the acting, I enjoyed the puzzles because some actually were challenging.P.S. How is Ipkis married?"
,Not Recommended,326180,30578892,Posted: 17 March,all,~✿Blissy✿~,"This isn't a horror or scarey game.  It's more like a spoof with funny vampires.Clunky interface.  I had some buggy issues in the start of the game.  Disappearing graphics (like whited out boxes in some parts of the 'hog' scene) and when I was in a 'hog' scene at this part not long from the start every time I clicked on an item it would go out of the 'hog' back to the scene and I had to keep clicking back and forth to finish.I fixed both things by just going to the main menu and back in the game but at first I had to do it a couple of times.After that I didn't run into any more buggy stuff like that.Graphics are a bit clunky.  ( older game though)I didn't take this game to seriously and just played it for something to do.The game is  short.  I think it says I played for 2hrs but I'd say you can finish this in less then that.  Those times are reflecting me trying to figure out what was going on with the bug parts and leaving game up when I afk'd so this is a really short game if you play straight through.Humor is rather silly though I laughed a couple of times because it was so campy.   Dialog a bit corny and over the top and not particular well acted.  One vampire had such a terrible voice but I think that's supposed to be funny becausehe is an actor in a children's show..There is one voice I know I have heard before, he's an actor and that voice is unmistakeable however I can't place the name.  I didn't wait to read the whole credits so I may just look that up.   It's kind of fun to hear a recognizable voice in games.The Hogs, nothing special, kind of silly and uneventful.   Puzzles? uhm not really.you find yourself clicking a lot because the mouse icon has no visual changes to them like object icon, area icon and so on.  I played in advance mode though didn't get that achieve because at one point I simply clicked off advance in the main menu options to see what the other mode was like and then switched it back when I realized advanced mode for this game is better.anyway I'd say don't bother to purchase this game unless it's in some bundle sale ( which is how I got it) and it comes down to under a dollar or less.There is nothing Sinister about this game.happy gaming~"

In other words, she'll be wed to a vampire the next morning. Your only way is  to convince him that you're the one for her...Sinister City has probably one of the worst plots in HO games if you take that seriously. In reality, the plot is a great parody of horror stories as the father wants to be an actor, the mother is a powerful businesswoman and that every vampire met is friendly.The gameplay is the same as other games of the genre: list of items, objects to find and to use, puzzles to solve. Everything is quite easy. However, there is a game-breaking bug at the beginning and the only way to get past it is to exit the game and relaunch it. If you don't know that, you may be frustrated to be stopped so early in the story and that you can't do anything about it. Once past that, you can enjoy the game that isn't so bad as you could fear.The graphics are correct, even if the vampires aren't really terrifying as they should but as it's a parody, it's normal to have them behaving comically. The soundtrack is correct too.I played the game more than a year ago and I suppose that you can feel that with my review. But I remember clearly that I said to people: Once you get past the famous bug and if you can handle a silly plot, you'll enjoy the game.  So, while Sinister City isn't the greatest game out there, it's still a good moment to pass. Other titles from JetDog are better (Frankenstein: Master of Death is the best example) but well, Sinister City will not make a hole in your wallet and will not hurt you."
,Recommended,326180,28206252,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,Sweep,"About Sinister CityWho would name their town Sinister City? Vampires, of course! When John discovers his bride-to-be has been kidnapped by Sinister City's number one bloodsucker, there's only one thing to do - search for hidden objects! And kill vampires! Or at least insult them until they give your girl back.Sinister City is a casual hidden object game in which we play as a character that goes by the name of John (quite rare among these parts) and he, for the reason unknown to man, decided to take a trip with his bride-to-be Nina, to a lovely place called Sinister City.Now you might find yourselves thinking who decided to give this city such an...inviting name, but from what we see of the town throughout the game describes it really well, so kudos to you, unkown peasant, you did well.So our hero in the making has to find out whatever happened to his fiancee, by doing all kinds of silly stuff for the eccentric townfolk. The game itself is very straightforward and you can't get stuck on a puzzle if you wanted to, thanks to the unlimited hints system.The puzzles are not at all difficult and won't be a problem to anyone, while the hidden object screens will occasionally annoy you with the low res graphics, but still won't be much of a problem.The StoryThe story is not trying to be serious at all, it almost felt like a parody in a way. The bad guy is a vampire that is apparently the one responsible for your finacee's disappearance, and you will have a chance to talk with him as the time goes on. The game is quite short, took me less than 2 hours to finish.I did encounter some bugs while playing, like sometimes the graphics of a certain objects will disappear, or while in the hidden object scene, every click of the mouse will exit the screen until you go back to the main menu and reenter the game from there.The MusicVoice acting was ok, I've heard better, but it's tolerable. All in all, if you like hidden object games you are probably gonna like this one too. If you have never played a HO game, you probably want to try a better game to see if you'll like the genre.All in AllSinister Cityis a very nice Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep"
,Not Recommended,326180,31306090,Posted: 22 April,all,Audish,"Games can be bad in a lot of ways. They can be too hard, they can be too dumb (it's true), they can be too rough, and so on. I've played plenty of games that were perfectly good at what they wanted to be, and what they wanted to be was bad. Sinister City is the opposite, in a way. It wants to be dumb and goofy in a charming way, and it would be, if not for being genuinely bad on the technical side.You play John, a regular joe who looks a little like Tom Cruise with a painted on short-sleeve button-up and tie. His girl Nina gets whisked away by a vampire to Sinister City, an actual ♥♥♥♥ing place full of vampires that everyone is totally okay with for some reason. After getting his bearings and some vampire hunting tips from the melon-headed veteran, John makes his way into the auspicious burg to wrest his fiancee from the clutches of the undead.It's nowhere near this epic, mind you, and that's a good thing for once. Whatever you're expecting of Sinister City is going to get upended because the story is acutely aware of its absurdities and tries to top itself constantly. Within minutes of starting the game (spoiler alert I guess?) the kindly hotel manager assembles a mystical hypnosis machine that sends you to the astral plane. To defeat the villainous vampire you'll need the help of his real estate agent wife and his therapist. There's a vampire Teletubby. And all of this is spilled on you not with a wink and a nod, or awkward tryhard dialogue, but with some refreshingly earnest humor and a willingness to just roll with the weirdness.The reason I'm telling you all this up front is because despite the solid kookiness, you really shouldn't play Sinister City. As wonderfully campy as the story ends up being the gameplay cannot sustain it, and the technical issues just demolish what's left. The hidden object scenes here are a combination of the genre's worst habits: You can only seek five items at a time, you have to move completely unmarked objects to get at things behind them, the scenes themselves are hard to spot and tend to be in strange places, and you have to do them multiple times until you find almost every single item. This means that scenes are incredibly easy as long as you're randomly clicking on everything, which is the only way to find the movable objects anyway.On top of that, you need to find multiples of items across multiple scenes or areas to get inventory items to use on NPCs or puzzles. These can be hidden anywhere, including hidden object scenes for OTHER items, and you get no indication that you've found everything in a given scene. Plus, you can't even pick up obvious items until you trigger the dialogue telling you to get them! On top of all this, some scenes are misaligned graphically which make it super hard to click the right things, and some objects blend far too well into the muddy backgrounds.The amateur-hour graphics don't do Sinister City any favors either, with inconsistent 3D models and some incredibly blurry backgrounds. I must admit, though, the sound design is decent and features some nice, campy voice acting and appropriate music. But it is clear this was a mobile title first, with a lack of options and plenty of ""Tap here to X"" prompts. It wouldn't take you more than 90 minutes to beat even on the harder mode, so as decent as the story is in its goofy way, you're better off staying far, far away from Sinister City.Did you enjoy this review?

What they don't say is that it's bad, poorly made, and glitchy as hell ""satire"" (let's be honest though, this is not satire, this is a parody). Even its puzzles are a laugh (to a point where one could theorize that maybe it wasn't intended as a parody of the vampire genre but of HOGs -hidden object games- in general).Yes, it has a couple of funny moments here and there and yes, it's real cheap, but that doesn't make it a good game that's worth your time.If you get it at it's current sale price (0,09 cents) you won't lose any money, since it has trading cards, but again, this doesn't make it a good game, just an affordable one.If you like over-the-top, absurd comedies that feature vampires and don't mind glitches that could prevent you from finishing the game, then yes, it's worth it. You'll get a couple of chuckles and I have to admit, a funny HOG is a rare and refreshing thing. But that's about it.I am tempted to give it a thumbs-up for it's campy glory, but it has some of the worst glitches I've ever seen in HOGs and that's one of the biggest faux-pas a game of this genre can have. I can stand bad art, bad or non existent voice acting, a flimsy plot and random fetch quests. But I have to be able to play the game, to say that it's at least mediocre, don't you think?"

You will spend the entire hour or so of this game in constant fear and...Whoops!Got my intros mixed up.Your fiance has been kidnapped by a vampire! Are you a bad enough dud to rescue your fiance?! Action and adventure await in Sinister City!Hmm..Nope...That one kinda sucks too.Truth is, there's not much to discuss when it comes to Sinister City. Not too long ago, this game was on sale for around 10 cents. On top of that, it has cards, so you're all but guaranteed to profit off of the purchase. Therefore, I'm going to assume that you already own this game, and are just reading this review because you assume there will be some funny jokes.You know what they say about assumptions right?In the interest of being ""helpful"" I'll talk about the actual game. Sinister City is a hidden-object puzzler. Look for the object, find the object, click on the object, become a winner. I must warn you though, the objects tend to be hidden. Occasionally there are puzzles to break up the monotony, but nothing too strenuous. For those exceedingly rare situations that you're actually stuck, a handy ""HELP!"" button is always nearby.Not all hidden-object games are equal, and Sinister City is IMO an example of a mediocre one. The images are of a lower resolution, which makes objects muddy and difficult to spot. Yeah I know, it sounds ironic when you think about it, but bear with me on this. Another unfortunate technical issue is the prevalence of bugs. These can range from disappearing images to the game no longer properly responding to your inputs. Thankfully, these are usually cleared up by quitting to the main menu. The game saves automatically and constantly, so all you have to fear is those wacky vampires, not the possibility of losing progress.The following couple paragraphs include SPOILERS!----SPOILERS----This next aspect is not so much a complaint about Sinister City, but about adventure games in general. All too often they rely on this logic that is baffling to normal human behavior. At one point in this game you have to find some books so that somebody will talk to you. There is an abandoned bookstand nearby, but the protagonist doesn't want to steal the books. In order to pay for these $20 books, he finds 75 cents in loose change scattered on the ground. If that made too much sense, consider that the protagonist steals a key from the bookstore to open a mailbox.Sinister City's attempts at humor are also...pretty laughable. Early on the protagonist acquires some vampire hunting equipment. He's getting geared up to kill a vampire, but then some guy points out that not everything is as it seems. The protagonist takes a closer look at a stake he picked up, and he finds the words ""MADE IN CHINA"" engraved on it. The ""Made in China"" gag is as old as time, but it doesn't work when written on a stake. A stake is a piece of wood sharpened to a point. It's possible that the Chinese stake is actually made of soft rubber, but wouldn't the protag notice that? Here's a thought: Crosses are also commonly used to fight vampires. So how about having the Cross say ""MADE IN CHINA"". Eh? Eh? Okay whatever. The point is this, when you're trying to make a gag out of something that's almost impossible to screw up, it doesn't really work. Yes, I have a nasty habit of nitpicking. What can I say? I love talking about mistakes.----END OF SPOILERS! YOU CAN BREATHE EASY NOW.----Even with its faults, Sinister City is still an enjoyable romp. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, the voice-acting is amazing, and the game ends before you get tired of it. I'm not usually one to recommend bad games - even the ones that are ""purposefully"" bad - simply because they take too long to complete. This game delivers on hidden objects and puzzles, which is always nice to have when you're not in the mood for more Counterstrike or DOTA2 or Sakura Angels. It's nothing difficult, but at least it'll give you something to do if you have an hour or so to burn."

Each of these achievements has certain requirements that needs to be completed before they can be obtained.There's no inventory panel that's visible. It only shows when an item is collected.Most of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists, find ""x"" amount of an item.  Some of them do require little or no interaction. Please note that later part of the game, you'll have to keep entering the hidden object scene, after each item is found. Maybe it's glitch/bug in the game that the developer of the game didn't bother to fix.The puzzle, at least the first one, it's rather simple to solve.There are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Bottom line, the game itself, doesn't has the quality of replayability.

The characters are interesting and their role well played considering the storyline is short and doesn't make much sense other than to amuse you.I also enjoyed the scenarios and the city map, although I wish I could visit randomly more places just for the fun of it!I enjoyed the storyline, even though it's short and looks silly at times and extremely stupid in a funny way, I think most people would enjoy a good laugh or two from a trip toSinister City!5/10"

Just because :) I will explain it:Pros (+):+ 1€ game+ nice story (i expected worse), but still nothing extra+ puzzles are fine, but mostly just find hidden objects+ funny jokes, lines and references (i dont't want to spoil anything, but, you know, the line: ""Thanks, Mom, I'm going to kidnap Nina back!"" is not something you can use everyday :D+ around 2 hours to finish the story+ achievements (you can get almost all of them in one play)Cons (-):- bugs (i found some, but they can be solved by restarting the game)- not really game in which you have to use your brain (especially in story, just let it go, enjoy that simple story)- some of hidden objects puzzles are quite dark and hard to find some stuff (and also, you have to move some objects, because there is another object under them)- that's all, you can't nitpicking every single thing in 1€ game (sorry, but it is true - indie game for that price can't have the best graphics and overwhelming soundtrack)There's one more thing. Logic in some puzzles. Like, you have to install some computer software, but you have to find 10 floppy disks in the office. Well, one is in trash, because, why not. You will have to prepare a tea for psychologist. But you have to find teabags. And they are everywhere. Literally. Her office is messy, same as she is.

,Recommended,326180,17701422,"Posted: 24 August, 2015",all,Espresso,"In Sum: Playable but not great hidden object game with some glaring flaws. Do not buy at full price.  3/5This is another grudgingly recommended game, which I would have preferred a neutral rating on.  This is not a horrible game, and I have suffered a share of stinkers on Steam.  It is just a hidden object game, not much more or less than that, and I suspect a lot of the objection here is due to the casual nature of the game.  However even as a genre, within hidden object games, there is something to be desired.The concept is seemingly inspired by Dracula and early vampire movies that novel inspired, but with a twist that comes off somewhat amusing but not pulled off as well as, say, a similar theme in Magicka.  Unlike most hidden object games, you actually get to play a character and move around some parts of the game.  The visuals are actually decent for the non-searching parts of the game, and the voice acting is not bad.  It feels like it would have been a well-received, even high quality game in 1998.  I am not saying that the graphics are that ancient, just that I can't help but recall the casual  games of that era.The game consists of exploring very small areas for hidden objects, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles.  Through playing, you effectively unlock search quests where you must find a certain number of specified items.  In some areas, there are item lists that must also be found before a quest item is revealed.  Once the quest is completed, a puzzle must be solved.  The puzzles are not complicated in the least.Some HO games are difficult for various reasons, including devious trickery in design, such as putting similar looking objects, wordplay in clues, shifting images, interactive objects, and so on.  This game uses it's own method of frustrating the player, and it unfortunately is not very satisfying.  The objects are often hidden behind other objects that are not related to the puzzle (like a book or a plate), which must be clicked on to reveal the item underneath.  Makes it hard to search for something that isn't there.  Worst of all, the lighting and visibility of the objects is often terrible, to the point where I found myself clicking the screen randomly...and still succeeding!  Despite screen settings, the images can be so dim that they are practially not there, and I am sure on some monitors, would not show up at all.  And with the secret movable items and the poor display of items, and a lack of consequence for random clicking, it can become as much of a clicking game as Cookie Clicker...but without managers.Some seem to say that the objects are hard to find because they are not what people are expecting.  I have played many hidden object games, and as far as the genre goes, this one is actually very good at properly telling you what you are looking for.There are two major glitches, however.  If you are using Windows 7 or above, you will need to set the game to XP compatibility mode, or it won't even launch.  Sometimes during the game, you will not be able to interact with environments after a cutscene.  Going to the main menu then resuming will fix this.All together, it is an acceptable HO game, purely casual and good for destressing or a waste of time.  On the easiest mode, there is no pressure and no consequence for wrong, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.  It was worth the 9 cents, but not the $10 full price by any means."

,Recommended,326180,18921209,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,Ganondork,"This game is a perfect example of why I wish Steam had a ""Meh."" option, instead of just yes or no to a recommendation.I have played several point-and-click, hidden object games at this point, and there are definitely some things that Sinister City does that I appreciate, albeit not well enough to not be a bit, frankly, dumb.Here's the break-down for me, + signs being positives and - being negatives.+Incorporation of 3-dimensional character models. While most games of this type simply present you with a two-dimensional scene, in this you do actually have to move the protagonist, John, around in a space.- However, on that same note, the areas where you can move are more or less two-dimensional and not all of them seem to have been designed with a character walking around them in mind. This results in some frankly hilarious looking scenes, like John and the TV Station security guard just hovering above the ground in front of the TV station, as if they were part of the door and not actual characters.+ Voice Acting - for a casual game of this type, it's actually really good.- Except for John's voice. And he's the main character. So he talks all the time. (Ipkis is pretty bad too but you only have to talk to him a couple times)- The background music isn't bad, but it is extremely repetitive.- Game is short, even for a HOP game.+ Price. Guys for real, it's a dollar. Even if you end up despising it, are you really gonna cry over that dollar?+ Story...it's satirical of your typical spooky vampire motif, which is actually genuinely amusing at times. Not funny, but amusing. Worthy of a slight smirk. Also, John and Nina's lovey-dovey-ness is so over the top that it becomes a humorous exaggeration of dime-a-dozen love stories. Whether or not this was intentional is debatable, but seeing it as satire makes it more bearable.- Story ... buuuuutttt a lot of it feels rushed and nonsensical, even for a game about a town full of vampires (who completely openly exist and no one really questions it....?). Spoiler free example: When your character finds out his fiancee is being held in a town full of vampires, he at no point stops and says, ""Woah, man. Slow your roll. VAMPIRES? Vampires are real?"" He's basically Anakin Skywalker in Episode 3 of Star Wars, but without the death, (""Oh my god, what have I done? Waaaahhhhhhh""  ... ""So you wanna join the Dark Side?"" ... ""Yeah, okay."") He just immediately accepts something that you would think would be a hell of a revelation for your average human dude who just wants to get married.- Saw the last bit of the ending coming a mile away.+ All the characters actually have a unique design and personalities, however minimal those personalities may be.+ Several objects in the HOPs were genuinely difficult to find, which I like.- But all the other minigames were horrendously easy.All in all, it really is a ""meh"" kind of thing for me. I didn't like it, but I didn't dislike it. Had it been fleshed out more into a bigger and longer story, and more time taken on animation, it could have been really good. The developers definitely have some skill; it's just in need of serious refinement.I labeled it as recommended in the end because of the price. It's only a buck, and there are definitely worse things to do when you're bored, and worse games that I've played for more money--on sale."

Only fixable by restarting the game.- No fast travel, This shouldn't really be a complaint but when both of their other games have it and this one doesn't with even more back tracking it really needed it.- Normal hints on the puzzle are fine but this game really doesn't tell you where you need to go most of the time where the other two did via their fast travel system.Overall Score: 6/10 I was pretty harsh on this game, it was the first hidden object game I played by Jetdogs Studios and the least enjoyable. It's still a playable game and has a good amount of hidden object gameplay to it but it's just not quite the same quality as their other products. I would be giving it a 5 instead of a 6 due to the bug i encountered twice but I didn't see anyone else complaining about the same bug, Additionally the free soundtrack is a nice touch.In the end if you need a hidden object game there are better to play and worse to play, If you enjoy games by Jetdogs by all means get this you can tell it's one of their games. But if you haven't played one by them play their other ones first, Save this one for later so you don't put yourself off of the experiances their games can provide."

Some minor bugs and annoying mechanics are out-weighed by the exceedingly low price and the genuinely fun story and dialogue. If you enjoy the genre and you enjoy a good B-movie story, you should have a reasonably good time for a low price.ReviewYou play as John, a generic American guy looking for his missing bride who apparently got kidnapped by her vampire father. You chase her to the titular Sinister City, the haven of all that is unholy. If that sounds rather silly, don’t worry, that’s the point. Not at any point are you supposed to be taking the game’s story seriously. That, combined with competent voice actors and well-written silly dialogue, provided a good amount of fun for me. Luckily the game does not last long enough (I finished it on advanced mode with all achievements in apparently 2.6 hours according to steam) or use the silliness too ham-fistedly for it to grow stale. I especially liked how they incorporated the silly story with the already silly “go find X items” or “go fix my Z” missions that are the staple of hidden object games. It made it amusing instead of just silly.The mechanics of the game were not the best admittedly. The hidden objects and mini-games were decidedly average for the genre coupled with an annoying tendency to have items hidden by other items with no indication that you can interact with the covering item. For example you are in a bookshop looking for item X. Item X is hidden behind a book… you need to click the right book to show it, but your cursor will not change as you hover over it. So basically you need to click all the books in the scene to show it. Sometimes it is more obvious which item is the covering one, but quite frequently you need to click a huge number of random items to find the right one. Which is not great design. However, there are no penalties for misclicks and there is a robust hint-system so when you get used to it, it’s not a huge deal (using the hint-system will costs you an achievement though if you care about that).Though old areas remain open as you open new ones, the items you need to find is always in the new areas or the game makes it obvious that you need to return to an old area (like, a character tells you to go back to the castle) so there is no annoying backtracking.People have reported a lot of bugs it seems. I only ran into one in one area and it was partially fixed by exiting to the main menu and totally fixed by restarting the game.Overall, I had a good time with Sinister City. I enjoyed the silly dialogue and story. The mechanics were nothing exciting, but I quite enjoy the genre so that was fine. For the price (I got it for 0.99 euro) I would definitely say it is worth it."

The problem is that this game clearly isn't for everyone, the story was alright, but not the best. When I read the description, I thought, ""Oh, maybe this game will be horror related perhaps or at least have that sense of 'scary' vampires as well as his future wife turning into a vampire possibly making him turn into a vampire."" Although, instead it gives you more of a comedy like relief than anything else, to me it really ruined the whole dark, 'scary' vampire part that I wanted. If you want a puzzle related game with a story that has nothing to do with dark vampires, but instead gives you a light-hearted, childish related vampire scenario, then this is the game for you. Although, paying only a dollar just to get it wasn't a total waste of my money for I did enjoy the game.The problem with this game is the lack of the horror element in the game, this is a vampire game after all and therefore the characters should feel scared. It's also easy to beat the game, I beat it the first time in roughly 3 in a half hours, although that was on 'easy' difficulty.Overall, I did enjoy the game, it was light-hearted, seemed more like a kids game than an adults game, especially with the 'find the items' part added into play. Do I recommend this to everyone, no, I only recommend this to people who want a light-hearted, puzzle related game that is kid friendly.I rate the game 7/10."

It is visually appealing as far as character design graphics, but it has standard bland backgrounds and props. The puzzles are 99% typical hidden item interactions and mini-games, with only one that stood out as unique. The click and touch recognitions are wonky in spots, but a majority operational.  The audio and dialogue are bland at best. Support for the game is untested, as it was unneeded. I was able to complete the game on both easy and advanced in a total of about 4 hrs of gameplay. It has very little replay value beyond its second playthrough.In short, on my 10-point scale of rating games based on Concept, Appearance, Content & Replay Value, Mechanics, and Sound I would have to give Sinister City a 5/10. This is an overall decent game, but has very little replay value, is short in content, and contains minor flaws.In the end, I would recommend this game only if it is on sale for the cheap, as in less than 50 cents, so you can make almost half your money back.

You get what you pay for I guess. I recommend this since I was happy with my purchase, see the pros and cons though to see what exactly you're getting with the buck this game costs. Some of the things listed are strong matters of taste.The reviewThis game is an extremely short and extremely easy hidden-object puzzle game. It's very silly and the whole plot is just finding your girlfriend, freeing her and [spoilers]kickstarting her vampire father's film career[/spoilers]. Voice acting is bad and the texts don't match the lines, but due to overall campy feel of the game I really didn't mind.Gameplay consists of you mostly clicking a person / object and seeing what he / it wants / needs, finding the items from nearby and then usually solving a puzzle of sorts. Some of these necessary items are often hidden behind some other items that are involved in a hidden object game, totalling to about 11-16 items (5 at a time), the last of which usually has the final items you are looking for hidden behind them. It's really simple and usually you can just get through most of it by randomly clicking the obvious items in the scene. If you want all of the achievements though, check the items required and then click through 5 of them (the hidden objects, not the quest items) in 10 seconds to get the achievement, that's basically the only one needing bit more effort.The puzzles are the most interesting part in this game (beside just seeing the silly plot and clunky conversations go by). Unfortunately there were like 2 or 3 puzzles requiring actual thought while the others were passable by randomly doing stuff or just matching things together. There's not much explanation to them, but they're so simple a child will understand their point, you really don't need the included hint system. (also there's an achievement if you don't!)- Funnily, you can actually tell the main character to walk somewhere in the scene, but it really has no function as clicking on hotspots trigger them immediately.That's about it. Game really doesn't span far. I played it 100% through on hardest difficulty in ~2h. More lucky person can probably do it in less time. Well, here's the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cheap (like really, got it for 9 cents)+ Campy (got a few chuckles from some events, couple unexpectedly silly ones too)+ Money's worth of entertainment and ultra-light brain exercise+ Achievement icons look pretty cool+/- Easy even on hardest difficultyCons:- Some bugs (backgrounds messed up or characters floating in the backgrounds, also one time (in the psychic dimension) game didn't let me click any hotspots, closed and restarted the game and it worked again though)- Typos- Lame story (and there's barely any of it)- Harder puzzles can be calculated with a single quaternary digit- Finger got tired from all the basically useless random clicking+/- Bad acting+/- Easy even on hardest difficultyScore 6 / 10"

If you have not played HOG games before I would suggest you look else where, because this game might make you hate them before you have given the genre a chance.  I have played a little so far and probably plan on finishing it eventually.  This game is filler at best and not in a good way.  There are very poor tutorials and the graphics feel a little dated, then again this could be just a re-port of an older title.  When compared to other HOG games I have played this game does not seem very polished.  The voice acting is hokey,  Im not sure if it is intentional or not but it is not very good. The graphic are okay I guess but the lips of the characters don't appear to syc up with the speech.  The game comes off like a very jerky hybrid of a point and click adventure game that is trying to be an HOG game, and the soundtrack doesn't fit with the game in my opinion.  Im not sure but I don't think the way the game mechanics are very well explained and leaves you hunting around.  Honestly can I reccomend it?  Barely.  The price is not so high that you are really going to regret it (At the time it was $1.09).  If you can get it cheaper by all means do it.

I often found the main character standing in places that made no sence (Ie, outside of the hotel, floating in the middle of the door, or standing on top of the garbage can) That is the only bad things I am saying about Sinister City in this review - so if you can't over look those, you can move along now.Now to the good points: It's very, very original. I love the storyline, I adore the characters, and despite not lining up correctly, I love the voice acters. You do enough moving around the game that it doesn't get boring easily, although at the same time I would love if it had some more variety to it - although that's not a big issue. It can be slightly hard to find your main objective objects in scenes if you're not sure what you're doing, so I reccomend playing on beginner's mode first.Now the main conclusion... Even if you can't or don't want to get through this full game on your own, I promise it is worth it. It is a fairly short game (Maybe about 2 hours for me to complete), but the ending scenes are so funny, and really make a nice tie-in for the end of the game. Over all, I reccomend this game - more so to those who have good patience- and am definately going to play it again.

As for the ""game"" itself, and i say that quite loose, It is what it is. Being a more or less point and click adventure and a discovery title, the gameplay is rather stale. The story and graphics are nice enough for the pricetag the developer posts for the product and the OST is given to the player as a gift for purchase which is also a bonus. It is impossible to fail at this game, and the achievements can all be earned in a single playthrough (which takes even the sluggish of sifters maybe 1 or 2 hours max) making this a steam perfect game in no time at all. You play John, a man in search for his missing wife to be, whom was kidnapped by a mysterious vampire of sorts.

Horror-trope homages, nice graphics, and a good variety of puzzles. The part of this game I did not like that caused me not to recommend this game? The hidden objects aspect of it. More than half of the time I spent in this game is looking for hidden objects to advance to the next segment of the game. I wouldn’t mind it so much if the hidden objects puzzle appeared once or twice, but it appears in every area I go to and it gets to be really tedious after the third area in the game."

I paid 15p for it in a sale and i'd be annoyed if i'd paid any more than that for what the game offers, especially as in total it offers around 4 hours gametime for 2 play-through's on both modes.""Normal"" mode though is a joke as if you just stop to look for 5 seconds then the screen lights-up telling you where everything is, it doesn't give you nearly enough time to search for yourself.Objects to be moved bear no distinction to background objects. So often you will find you cannot see what you need on the screen and you have no way of knowing which objects can be pushed aside to reveal more.The only way to get around this is to play it on ""Normal"" difficulty and have the game tell you where you're supposed to be going next then remember for the next time. I can't imagine playing ""Advanced"" mode without this knowledge; it would be uber-frustrating.The game is locked to a 4:3 image stretched to widescreen: there is no option to reset the ratio. This is the first and only game that has ever done this to me so i just ignored it and played regardless; not going to upset my gfx settings for 1 game.Overall it's a thumbs-down from me, there are much better HOG's out there and you only really need play this one if you've literally exhausted the other offerings out there."

But nonetheless, if for some reason you'reseriousabout hidden object gaming, you'd do better to avoid Sinister City.  It doesn't take itself remotely seriously, and there are some serious weaknesses in the game design.If you're just looking for some brief, cheap, casual fun, though, Sinister City can be just the quick, entertaining, romp you need.  The puzzles are few, the HO scenes pretty easy, so there's little to distract you from running through the goofy, parodic story that plays around with the classics of vampire film.  While there's nods toNosferatuand Lugosi's classic portrayal of Dracula, Sinister City clearly draws its influence from schlockier fare likePlan 9 from Outer Spaceand the low-budget Hammer Horror films.  If not laugh-out-loud funny, the story is at least far more entertaining than a typical HOG plot.Gameplay is the weakness here.  Your next action is frequently unintuitive; you often cannot pick up an item you'll obviously need until explicitly told to collect it.  At one point, an object's graphic failed to load, leaving me to collect a white rectangle.  At another time, the game glitched so that I could not progress -- exiting and reopening the game solved the problem, though.  Finally, Sinister City relies on a mechanism where objects that are not your current targets must be clicked to move them, to discover target objects behind them.  This means you must click pretty much everything, rather than just hunting targets.  What's more, an object that was immobile in a previous visit to an HO screen might spontaneously become movable at a later time, requiring you to click everything on every visit to a screen, in order to not miss a potentially hidden target object.At the price, especially if on special, I can't not recommend this game.  Tolerate the gameplay; enjoy the story."

While good for a laugh or two it's hardly engaging or suspenseful but considering it's dirt cheep you can't really expect Shakespeare.Taken for what it is, a cheep brain teaser with a B-movie plot then it's worth playing if only to score some easy acheaves or take a break from shooting zombies, but if your looking for something more serious I'd give this a pass."

The story is corny and the reasons for you to clear nearby closets and trunks of lists worth of various objects grow increasingly absurd as it unfolds. Some actual puzzles are thrown in here and there which adds a bit of variation to simply looking for various items in the scenery. If you get stuck you can have the hint-system flat out show you what to do next, and any actual puzzle can be skipped for those who are just in it for mindless clicking.The game is a short affair, and I can't imagine it having much replay value, but it should be good for wasting a short hour for anyone who are into the hidden object style of games.On a side note, the game did glitch out pretty severely on the second ""act"" when I played it, with both broken textures and issues with the game mechanics, but this was solved by simply restarting the game and continuing from the autosave."

My favorite line was Ms. Seward's: ""Now, goodbye forever, you handsome manifestation of my childhood complexes!"" I agree with her. The voice acting was fine, except for Ipkis, who was overdone. It was hard to believe he was star material.This game should be called ""Fetch Quest City""; and many of those quests were silly or illogical. A bunch of lazy characters waiting around for a needy fool to show up and do their work for them. The innkeeper was particularly inept at keeping track of stuff in his own establishment. Also, some of the HOG scenes closed after every click, requiring a lot of unnecessary work because I had to reopen those scenes and click, and reopen those scenes and click again, ad nauseum. Upon replay, I discovered that by exiting to the Main Menu and clicking on Continue, that problem was resolved.The game has no help system to explain how the game saves. Since exiting to the Main Menu and clicking on Continue resulted in a ""loading"" message, I figured that it was a way to force the game to save, which was handy for working around the bugs. I saved a lot to avoid problems.I have two issues with the game's graphics. The first problem was the screen aspect ratio. It was stretched side-to-side; so everything was wide, which was especially noticeable with circular objects like wheels and gears and the two globes on the HUD at the bottom of the screen. It looked like the game was designed for a standard monitor (4:3 ratio). I tried the only option available—Window mode—but the window was the same wide-screen ratio and everything was still distorted. And the window could not be resized to reduce the distortion. My nVidia graphics card is incredibly capable of handling aspect rations, but this game did not cooperate.The second graphic problem involved HOG scenes and puzzles. Parts of the screen were blank. Meaning: solid white. In the case of the HOGs, I was able to able to access the Main Menu via the HUD and resolve the problem as described above. When I clicked on Continue and returned to the game, the visual problem was solved. However, there is no HUD available in the puzzle screens; so, there is no way to work around the problem, except to cancel the game via ALT+CTRL+DELETE. I was unable to solve one of the puzzles because of this problem and had to skip the puzzle; so, I didn't earn the Enigmatist achievement. Upon replay, I exited to the Main Menu prior to the puzzle and clicked Continue to fix the graphic issue and earned the achievement.""Sinister City"" was cute and fun, but clunky. I'm surprised that such a recent release has these problems."

I finally figured it out about halfway through that it is meant to be hilariously bad -- but it shouldn't have taken me that long to get it.So, ignore the voice acting and story, both of which are either bad or hilariously bad.  As a hidden object game, it's okay.  It has two modes: easy mode and advanced mode.  I wish there were a middle one.  In easy mode, if you don't find an object or a location within a few seconds, it will sparkle for you.  So you might as well just mindlessly click wherever is sparkling and you could finish the game with absolutely no brain power on your part at all.  But in advanced mode, sometimes locations were finicky to find, so I spent several minutes just clicking randomly around the screen before giving up and switching to ""easy"" mode just long enough to get the hint, and then switching back.I enjoy hidden object games as a mental break.
