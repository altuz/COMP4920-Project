My friends, I will never forget this sports festival.Let's do the pros and cons thing real quick.PROS- Kunio-kun on Steam- Badass story- Badass characters- Beautiful 3D backgrounds- Beautiful 2D sprites- Character and team creationCONS- Sloppy English translation- Some bad formatting- Some fights (and losing) can be frustrating- No way of checking how to execute special attacks mid-game or when picking a player- Very few people online and game is ridiculously slow if you play with people from other regions- Some broken achievementsGo!

,Recommended,326340,19747249,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,[BLD] Boochan,"1) Must buy this game2) Recommended buy3) Recommended steam sale purchase4) Dont botherWhen i saw this game come up I was excited to fall in love again with all the classic characters from NES, and boy! do they deliver, not only are the visual animations true to the old days, gameplay is also the same.The game has simple buttons to navigate with only 3 commands punch, kick, jump with manouvers run and dash and these same commands are used to pick up weapons/items. Each character can also have special attack moves.There are 4 types of sporting events including Cross Country, Obstacle Relay, Camphor ball and Battle Royal. The first two are pretty much the same except obstacle relay obviously includes obstacles. Camphor ball is a game where you need to beat the oppenent in climbing a pole to reach a ball in which you punch till it breaks. Battle Royal is a fighting arena where you fight other contestants. In all of these events you are able to hit the oppenents during any stage of the game to hinder or even eliminate your oppenent from the round. There is defienetly some fun to be had in each of these modes.One of the greatest features of this game is that you are able to customise almost anything to your liking. This paired with a quite impressive story line with many hilarious scenes starring familiar characters gives the game an authentic feel.A big part of the game is playing through and unlocking teams, characters, special moves to use in your arsenal and this is quite dragging in it self, but essential.The most significant downside to this otherwise enjoyable game is the fact that the rules are too convoluted and contrived. I'll show why by dissecting a race. For starters, the screen doesn't advance until all players reach the end of it. Upon entering the next screen, each combatant starts in the position that they finished the previous screen in. Therefore, you really only need to try during the final screen in which any player can easily claim victory. You get points according to how well you placed but you also collect them throughout the race by such actions as beating up other players. This means that you can ""win"" a race flawlessly only to discover that you actually lost because the player in last place beat up more people than you. It's a confusing mess with no clear method that guarantees success. Additionally, the poorly translated text is a chore to understand. If you can't grasp how to play then good luck trying to decipher the instructions.River City Super Sports Challenge: All Stars Special is a game that'll feel right at home for fans of the Kunio-kun series. Although it's not the best of the bunch, it has enough redeeming qualities to not make fans ""Barf!"" with disappointment.[\h1]On a quick end note, i do find this game to be a bit pricey for its release. My initial decision was to suggest this game as a ""Recommended steam sale purchase"" but due to my love for the series and nostalgic NES memories i have marked this as a ""Recommended buy""."
76561198031299753,Recommended,326340,21363143,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,Yukimazan,"First of all, press M if you want to start the game on the title screen. It's also the same button for pausing the game. Also if you ever played Nintendo World Cup during your childhood, you oughta look into this game.Warning! If you don't want any spoilers, avoid reading this review until you have seen/played the game yourself!So River City Super Sports Challenge All Stars Special AKA River City Ransom x Sports is a beat em up game with sports modes in them. As a River City Ransom fan, the game keeps what makes the series fun to the BARF and Street Fighter-like moves with a mix of 4 modes/games you and your team will experience. Game comes with Story Mode, Free Mode, Online mode and customization.Gameplay2 to 4 teams (normally 4) contest each other in a competition consisting of 6 characters for each team. For each event, you are to pick 1 member from your squad and use him/her for that event. Your goal is to simply win as many events or points as possible in these events. At the end, the team with the most points wins.The combat is pretty much what you expect from River City Ransom games: punch, kicks, hit others with wacky normal day items like WWE. The twist is that depending on which event you play it's either focused on running or beating up rivals. During the running events (Cross Country and Obstacle Course), you are encouraged to finish 1st place in many sections of the course to obtain highter points. Your punch and kicks would be more on palm pushing or elbow back hits to either slow your enemy down or reduce their HP to 0. However, you are allowed to use special moves to spice up the game to your favour if used wisely. Good news is that EVERY character has their own 2 special moves that have their uses. What's better is that there are TONS of special moves so you will have fun trying them out in curiosity (and remembering).  Here are events you will expect:Cross Country (running mode) : Get most points by reaching the end of every section of the track. It also has wind to slow or speed you up sometimes.Obstacle Course (running mode) : Same as Cross Country but the course is more focused on enviromental hazards and elements  such as treadmills, holes, spikes, a bit of platforming, etc. If you know that TV show Wipeout, this is pretty much like it.Camphor Ball: The course is more like a tag team battle of 2 vs 2  (friendly fire is applied here) where both teams must climb or reach the big ball hanging on top and damage it until it opens to obtain victory.Battle Royale: Nuff said. It's last man standing.Surprisingly you are like the coach asking which player would be most suitable for the event in terms of their stamina/HP and special moves. It gives a tiny bit of strategic value in choosing who has the better chance of doing well in the event. (That is, if you're good at controlling them too). Some are meant for running and agility, others are brawlers and great at kicking others in the nuts so know your team!So that's pretty much what you expect from gameplay. I do wish there are more events but I find all 4 to be really enjoyable especially the fact they all have different varieties of courses and tracks to pit you in. Other than that, the gameplay keeps what makes River City Ransom itself with a mix of sports.GraphicsI admire the mix of nostalgia and 3D enviromental graphics here. Characters are in the form of pixel/sprites just like the NES days of River City Ransom. The background is more of a 3D graphic which pleases the eye though I have heard of issues with it from other players. My laptop has no problem with it so therefore, it's a fantastic mix.ControlsRemember when I stated the M button on top? Yeah, this is the game's first problem. The game's controls is playable and smooth but the button keys are super confusing for some. M for start and pause is an odd key to use and you punch, jump and kick with only 3 buttons: J, O and U. I find this setting to be very weird which might not please some trying to get used to it. Thankfully in the Options menu, you can switch which keys for which role. Downside is...you're only limited to J, O and U keys. At least once you get used to the keys, you can still play the game without having problems doing special moves.MusicSurprisingly some are remixes of some of themusic of the River City Ransom games and spin-offs which actually fits the game. Bonus points for nostalgia.Replayability and customizationNow this is where the big part comes in. The game has a feature for you to customize your own character, River City Ransom NES sprite style. You get to customize the name, hair and face. For clothes, there's only like 3 or 4 of them but at least you get to choose the colours too for all. Best part is when you get to choose almost EVERY special moves for your character which brings more replayability to the table as well. From Shoryuken to a throwing homing item attack, the special moves are what keeps you addicted. Heck, some special moves are (sadly) limited to certain characters in free mode which encourages you to try them all. The special moves can be executed in the form of punch, kick, item, throwing, mid-air attacks, etc. IT'S RIVER CITY RANSOM!You also get to create a team of your own as well as create your own set of stages though they are just adding sections of the course and switching the order. But it's still fun if you want to have a bit of a challenge.Overall, this game being the first River City Ransom game on Steam will definitely please those that are into the series and those that are into beat em up. The game is very fun for a beat em up both casuals and fans of it. I'm grateful even though the English translation isn't top notch, it's enough to satisfy me and understand the mechanics of the game.I recommend you buy it or wait for a little discount if it's not your price. But it's still a great game nonetheless! Any questions you can ask me in case.And if you're interested, River City Ransom Underground just got Greenlighted on Steam! Go check it out if you love this beat em up series!"
,Recommended,326340,31466661,Posted: 30 April,all,crazyhogwon,"Awesome! just awesome! brings back the memories of 1980's and 90's NES games, especially the kunio series. I didn't enjoy the SNES kunio games but enjoyed all of the NES kunio games. So the art style is just awesome too! IT DOESN'T END THERE THOUGH! Improved upon the original style! the enemy AI might get a little annoying at times, but eh, it was like that in the old NES games too so whatever. It could be improved because it is 2017, but even if it doesn't, I'll still enjoy the game like I am doing right now. :)"
,Recommended,326340,33109385,Posted: 1 July,all,Blue Klaw,"There's not much to this game. There are only 4 sports events, which can be broken down further to 2 types of races and 2 types of battles. The name entry screen, a relic of the old Japanese version, allows for a dissapointing maximum of 6 characters for stage and character names. The english translation of this game makes Chroma Squad look like Shakespeare. The AI is dumb as a rock, and online play is virtually non-existent.So why am I recommending this game? Well, for all it's flaws, I still think this makes for a great local-multiplayer experience. I also love the setting and characters - nothing beats badass Japanese delinquent highschool melodrama. Only purchase if you plan to play it with frends. It makes for some pretty fun and intense competition, at least on the surface. The controls are very simple to pick up and learn, just explain to your pals that you double-tap forward to run and that you can swim faster in water if you are holding an item. These are two ""tricks"" that aren't explained well, but are easily enough figured out.I would NOT recommend this game at full price, though. Only if it's on sale."
,Recommended,326340,25812205,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,HeatGenbu,"A little history on this game for those that didn't know or were too lazy to look up what this game is and was.So first off: this game is a remake. This game is a revisioned version of what was orginally called in Japan: ""Downtown - Nekketsu Koushin Kyoku Soreyuke Daiundokai"" that's originally from the NES. Like, this is a DIRECT remake. Almost everything is the same except it's more expanded in terms of story, gameplay, and presentation. So this english name we got for the game is actually a reused name from a Nintendo DS title. Same function, a remake of the above, but overhauled most of the game. The DS title mentioned above is the first time America got its hands on it. The NES version has NEVER gotten a American release. So color me suprised that Arc systems did this again (as they were ones who did the DS version)For timeline explaination, it takes place after River City Ransom. You don't need to really play the Japanese version, the american release gives a good explaination of how it went down. Just that your gonna get your names mixed up if you do. So speaking of names: i really appriciate Arc Systems kept the names of the material rather then make up new names like Techmo did for the NES release of these series. (Crash n' the boys, River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball, etc.)On gameplay. Unlike the DS version, this version was kept very faithful to the NES, almost too much. On the two racing portions of the game. They are ALMOST identical in gameplay, but they added a few things to shake things up. Same exact transistions, just given a new coat of paint. Anyways, if you somehow you got around to play the NES version (somehow getting a japanese famicom and playing it or just emulating it.) you are still missing a good party game. Many different characters that span the whole series make cameo apperences, they all have their similarities or differences.On visuals and sound. Visuals are amazing. Damn good mix of retro and modern. Sounds are nostelgic, same sounds that span 3 decades, just better quality. Music, superbly remixed in a modern fashion, but the catch is it has music that spans 30 years as well. Some music never in the NES game, rather music came from the whole series.For TL;DR for above- It's a remake of a NES game. Its different though. Its a sports game, it's not a beat em up. its good for what it is, just it has it's problem."

I really don't know how they took such a simple formula and screwed it up this badly.Pros:* NostalgiaCons:* ""Full Controller Support"" does not actually mean your controller will be supported.  Expect to use your keyboard.* An action game with undocumented controls you have to guess.  It took me a couple minutes to get past the intro screen because it didn't occur to me ""Press Start"" meant the ""U"" key.  I wasn't even sure the game was registering my keyboard until I hit Escape and the game closed.* Somewhat unresponsive controls.* The keybindings options only let you remap Punch (a.k.a. Start), Jump, and Kick, so you can't even use that page to find out what all the other buttons are.* There is no documentation with this game (either in instructions or walk-throughs) for anything else, either.* Each event has unique controls, which (as mentioned) aren't told to you.* Race competitions don't make it clear where you have to go so the only way to become faster at them is to memorize what the game should have told you.  Oh, the right arrow meant ""Go up to the door"" rather than ""Go right"" like all of the other times?  Thanks, Game.* I only got through 3 of the 4 competitions before I just gave up, but all of them felt really slow.* Many competitions make it feel like your character is perpetually running in sand.   It's also unclear how you run faster or why you wouldn't run faster.* Still don't know how to swim faster.  Did I mention the game doesn't tell you what the buttons are or how to do things?* Many of the thrown weapons fly entirely differently than each other, and since the first two competitions are races, you don't exactly get to practice using them.* Only the computer can punch people while swimming (as far as I can tell, since none of the attack buttons I know actually do anything while swimming).Not Applicable:* I did not get around to multiplayer."

Also the story is funny if you are familiar with the japanese school delinquits.Where it falls short is the unfamiliarity of controlls and how the game works.There are 5 pages of move sets you can do and you can only select 2 of them to use while in competition, however how to execute these moves is only posible to see in the main menu. So you basically have to exit and restart the game to look it up if you forget.

It was a campy beat ‘em up with RPG elements. The title of this game had me excited, so I picked it up on Steam’s Fall sale for $4.99.RCSSC offers 3 modes: Single Play, Free Battle, and Online Battle.Today we’re going to talk about the single play mode, because the free battle is essentially just practice of the single play, and the online battle was non-functional because there was no one else to play with, so I couldn’t even try it out. This fact will not come as a shock to you when you get done reading this review.The Single Play is a “story mode” that pits you up against three other rival High Schools.There’s a story with extremely poor translation which makes zero to little sense, with characters such as your friend Ichijou who “insists that he becomes a badass to get used to the city life” After all, didn’t we all have a friend like that in high school? Then there’s Hiroshi whose hobby is “Watching badass movies”. Yeah. These characters have about as much depth as the trials and tribulations of a group of four year olds.Story aside, there are literally a whopping FOUR events in this game.The first is the cross country, which is a thrilling race from one side of the screen to the other, with a pre-rendered background. While you move from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen, you can beat on your opponents with your fists and feet, or dropped weapons such as brass knuckles, sticks, or other items that are frankly, unidentifiable. It really makes no sense to stop running, so while the computer may decide to beat on other opponents, or try to beat on you, you just need to be the first to get to the other side of the screen, where you may either have to enter a door, or randomly climb a wall. My first time around, there were a couple rooms that I didn’t know how to exit, and had to watch the computer scale one of the random walls. Each time you finish the room, depending on which place you come in, you earn points. Whoever crosses the finish line with the most points wins the challenge. One amazing feature in the cross country is the presence of lens flares in the room. It’s just so breathtaking to endure the usage of the lens flare whether the backdrop depicts a daytime sunny motif, or a dusk motif, the lens flare just SCREAMS at you, “LOOK AT ME! I’M A LENS FLARE! ENJOY ME!”The second event is the obstacle relay that takes place in a warehouse, which is more or less EXACTLY the same thing as the cross country with some different rooms, and obstacles like spring boards, pot holes, or a room with a big giant vat of chemicals where the lights go off and on. Amazingly, all you have to do is just go UP as far as you can, then RIGHT to avoid the chemical pool, and then it really doesn’t matter if you can’t see or not.  However to my dismay, there was no lens flare to be had in the warehouse. Not sure if there just wasn’t enough light in there or not, but it was sorely missed.The third event is the camphor ball. To sum this event up, it’s reminiscent of the classic ladder match in the WWE, except what you have here is two poles, where all four opponents are vying to climb up the poles to punch on the big metal piñata. Eventually it will break open and whoever breaks it open wins the match. You can tug on your opponents while they are above you, to attempt to pull them off. It was incredibly frustrating, and since I had won the other two events, I basically just took my chances and let the computer win this one.The fourth and final event is the battle royal. This is the MOST similar gameplay to the original River City Ransom. It takes place on a large scaffold on a warehouse, and you have to be the last man standing in a 4 way match. You can either beat your opponent until their lifebar is down, or pick them up and throw them off the scaffold to eliminate them.In the story mode these same four events just repeat over and over, sometimes you need to win a certain amount of times to actually “win” the event.  After 2 rounds of this, I could alas take no more and stopped my story mode dead in its tracks.Graphics:  The characters resemble their retro counterparts, while the backgrounds are all pre-rendered…..with lots of lens flare.Sound/Music: The music is extremely grating, and loops continuously. It’s the lens flare of music.Playability: Well, you can play it… I’m not sure why you’d want to, but you can. It’s fun for about 5 minutes. If you enjoy lens flares, you might enjoy playing count the lens flare as a side companion to this game.Value: I bought this for $4.99 on the steam sale, and I will be requesting a refund. Normally this game sells for $19.99 which just absolutely BLOWS my mind. If I had paid almost twenty dollars for this game, I would be extremely irate.Overall, I would give this game ONE lens flare. Stay away."

It's work well with only Xbox controller.It is difficult to use Keyboard to control though a few keys to use.No way we can play multiplayer mode with only keyboard.Do not download this game if you don't have Xbox controller."

There is no way of atleast grinding youre character or none that i know of sadly. I will change my review with more time in game or atleast new updates.

Do new games with 2D throwback style pixel art give you a warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia? Or maybe you just like games about school rivalry. If so, this game is for you.Pros:Character Editing and UnlocksUnique Sports Beat Em' UpGood StorylineTons of Special AttacksCons:Needs More EventsNeeds More BackgroundsMy Rating:9/10 Kunio for the win!"

,Recommended,326340,33135372,Posted: 2 July,all,Amor Fati 117,"Well, it's the best thing we have on Steam for a Kunio-kun game at this time. It's much better than the new River City Ransom: Underground (which I was looking forward to, and ended up being disappointed in) but it isn't a River City Ransom game regardless, which is a shame. Maybe some day we will see a proper River City Ransom ported to Steam."
