We had a single cannon shot to obliterate the landscape and attempt to destroy our opponent.  Shellshock Live includes over 250 weapons, I had hesitations that this would work.  Sometimes too much variety can be overload.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624332808Gladly this game has a massive grind to open up all the weapons.  I hate grinding in games, especially in PVP games.  So why do I think it is good in this case?  Well, the basic weapons are enough to enjoy the game to its full and recently the playerbase got a MASSIVE influx due to popular streamers publicising the game.  Meaning you are pitched against other players of same experience with same weapon loadouts.  I can imagine it could've been a problem with a small playersbase but not now.Maybe preferably I'd like to have access to all weapons without a grind and be able to custom select which to include on the server I create or join a server that has a selection I like to play with.  250+ weapons is a LOT to get to grips with so maybe the devs have implemented their introductions in the best way.  Time will tell...One thing I didn't realise with Shellshock Live was that the most popular way of playing isn't turn-based but actually phase-based.  So every player is setting their power and trajectory and deciding which weapon to launch at the same time.  The result is very little waiting time for other players!!  It keeps the game and the fun flowing extremely effectively.Touraments have been added recently, I can't wait to try those!The game is simple looking in design but the graphics are clean and effective.I'll be spending a lot fo time in Shellshock for sure, highly recommmended!!"

Despite having toxic community with gross personalities and expert players with great accuracy as I mostly don't count them for reviewing the multiplayer games.This game is a lot like the main Worms series but with tanks, explosions and realistic terrain. Gosh, I love tank games like this! Even one of the greatest Worms-inspired official games on the gaming systems ever! Also a real video game now as it is the Steam version so everyone and I have to refer this as the actual ShellShock Live since it's like as made for Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One too.This game's got:• 8 player sma- I mean... match (Wow!)• 8 game modes to play, enjoy & even master• About a hundred of weapons to unlock, use & level up as weapon levels are not counted• A lot of color themes for terrains to make the matches more cool & stylish• So much match settings including the turn time• The true maximum level of 100 that takes about a year to level up to from the beginning• The final boss with his name based on Master Hand from the Super Smash Bros. series• No spaghettiEven though I am a Nintendo & Touhou fangirl, this game is still enjoyable for me to play despite it being much smaller than Team Fortress 2. I can even do YouTube videos of this great game similar to KoopaKungFu, WiiLikeToPlay and also Superjombombo who are three of my favorite YouTubers. Neppu neppu!Becareful of the toxic community as it's a problem that have half chance of making 9 years & younger boys break their PC with their rage. Luckily, Steam has the COPPA so you don't ever have to worry about breaking your PC with your rage since the age requirement. Still becareful if you are a cute teen girl gamer as there's even some middle-aged men (and bronies) that are very gross instead.I shall become the very best player of this game, like no one ever was. Oh wait, how about I shall level up to 100 and complete every challenges instead?You don't have to see this but it's actually importantBetter not encounter that damn evil Kongregate community as they can also treat you, my friends & the Nintendo/Touhou/Hyperdimension Neptunia/Bloons fans & YouTubers like my alts for having any same favorites, interests & personailities as me. Even WiiLikeToPlay, VenturianTale and the YouTube Rangers can't stop this idiotic thing with their teams.

Featuring an insane array of weapons, customizable tank bits, and maps, ShellShock will keep you playing for hours.Unlocking new weapons and other bits doesn't feel like a grind at all. You earn them by leveling up, using other weapons until they get better, or by sheer luck of the draw. The in-game store has a bunch of different addons you can buy for your tank, but THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO IN-GAME MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. Period. Everything you can buy in the in-game store is bought using ""Gears"" that you earn by actually playing the game.

76561198209679328,Recommended,326460,30942051,Posted: 4 April,all,gIamnotairl,"I have played shellshock live 2 on the browser for quite a while before I played the steam version. One thing I did not like in the browser version is in game purchases which they took out in the steam version. So I am really happy about that. It gives everyone an even ground and provides fair combat.I love the steam version and would recommend it to anyone having an interest in artillery games.Here is the pros and cons for shellshock live.PROS:1. Simple yet elegant graphics design. One does not get bored looking at it.2. The massive amounts of weapons to obtain and upgrade. At the time I wrote this review, there are 367 weapons including the upgrades.3. Active developer and community. The developer works with the player community to constantly improve the game with new content, new features or bug fixes.4. Many game modes to choose from ( 8 I believe). With countless customization options that will satisfy every need. For example, you want to play with players your level, you can do that, you want a more fun and challenging game play, you can set mods to one weapons and wind to high etc.5. 4 sections of tank upgrades to master!5. And many more!CONS?1. Time consuming. Is it? I have played for 60 hours and I am already level 83. I know the game is a grind, but isn't every multiplayer game? For example, I played warframe for 360 hours, or grinded for 360 hours. Shellshock live in my opinion is a grind, yes, but compared to some other ""popular"" games out there, it is not a grind at all. I know low level is frustrating and everyone wants to level up, everyone wants to win. But be patient and you will eventually reach level 80 in 100 hours. Besides, the real grind starts at level 90. Unless you're hardcore and want to get every single achievement. Which I advise to not to do if you want a social life... Don't make such a big deal out of it!2. The music gets repetitive after a while and sounds boring, but that's not a big deal. Just run some music in the background or something.3. Hackers? This is also a big deal according to a lot of people. IT IS NOT! I have yet to see a hacker in the 60 hours i played. And besides, the latest updates reinforced security to eliminate the piratically non-existent hackers. And also, people complain about rulers......... yes, there are people who use rulers, but there are multiple ways you can take care of this. First, play a game with them, and lose, then set atmospheric nudge to ON, or set high wind, and then play the next game, and then accuse them of using a ruler, and they will be too ashamed to admit it and leave...  and yeah.Overall, shellshock live is a really fun and addictive game to pass the extra times you have. There is so much to do, so much to learn and so much rage when you miss a shot.... ayyyy.GET IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"

Made me nostalgic of scorched earth and such.The only thing someone could complain about is the community itself at times (toxicity and such, but what community doesn't have some toxic users), or the fact that the higher level you are, the stronger of course, which means it's not always fair - But there's a mode for that which puts everyone on equal ground if you so wish.It's a pretty cheap game really, no reason not to try it out if you're interested and hesitating.

,Recommended,326460,15470788,"Posted: 20 April, 2015",all,I'm not that cat,"Decided I should finally add a review for this.Anyway it is a much better game than the flash versions with the main P2W element gone all you have to do is pay for the game and you're golden.The good about this game is straight away the graphics compared to the flash is substantially better to the point of me going back to ssl2 and wondering if the graphics were made worse.The main negatives are lack of people which can be helped by more people buying the game and due to the vast majority of people owning this game in the american time zones it is rare for me to be able to get a game during the day here, but once again that is only due to the amount of people who own the game.The weapons are good in most cases but they seem to encourage close range gameplay over mid to long range and the xp requirements are just way to much for some weapons (shot, breaker, bulger to name a few)But as it is still in early access there is much room for change, improvement and new stuffs.I recommend people give it a try before you pass it up as it can become addicting ^^This cat gives it 8/10 at the minute =^_^= €15 well spentEdit: The game is now almost a year out and now with the recent boom in players it is finally beginning to feel like a decent game. I still recommend this game to all, it is now half the price it started at and at least 10x the player base it started with ^^"

,Recommended,326460,14911213,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Black Widow,"If you've ever played the flash versions of this game, you'll love this one!From the very two shellshock live games on flash, i became hooked. But not in a bad way at all!This simple, yet fun game isn't very demanding in terms of computer specs, it manages to still look great even on it's lowest quality settings it offers. But when it's quality settings are set to the maximum it allows... It looks simply stunning and beautiful is all i can really say.Features: Multiplayer.Single player (campaign).Robust graphics when set on the highest quality.New HUB.Over 58 maps to choose from! I think, i counted but i could be wrong.Customizable tanks.Use items to get a little upper hand on your enemy.Up to 8 player battles.Team Death match, and Free for all to play against your friends.Over 200 weapons!More things to come as this game is updated!The gameplay: The gameplay is different from the first two previous games. You'll notice that the power of your shots are much more powerful if you've ever played the previous flash versions of this game. But don't allow that to deter you from purchasing this wonderful game! Sure it's hard at first to master the way you shoot, but after some practice you'll be good as you were before. And if you're completely new to the game, don't worry a thing. it doesn't take long at all to learn the mechanics of the game.A little info about the game:The single player campaign has 80 missions to do, some more hard than others. You'll have a tough time with them garuanteed. Some require you to really think hard on how to succeed in them but don't worry it's not impossible some have already beaten all of that already!When you first start off you won't be able to do many things such as move as far as others when you join a match, don't worry this is normal. You must earn these things called ''Tank Tokens'' you obtain these from leveling up that you may use to upgrade your tank. You can choose to upgrade your tank as you see fit choosing from ''Chassis'' ''Armor'' (which also allows for the possibility to regenerate armor), Gun (chance to deal more damage to enemies), ''Track'' (let's you move faster and climb up and down down hills), and ''Luck'' (this helps you get loot from crates such as weapons, and armor).You can use items to help you out a little these are the items.Tracer: This item allows you to see where your shot will land before you shoot it, helpful if you're unsure about the shot you're about to take.Teleport: This item is new and was not in the previous shellshock game, it can teleport you anywhere on the map randomly.Jetpack: This item allows you to jetpack to a location within the radius that the item allows you to.Shields: Pretty sure this one is self explanatory, but i'll go ahead and explain anyways. This one engulfs you in a small bubble that protects you for one turn from all weapons. The weapon earthquake is an exception.Supply drops: When using them item you will see a small box float down from above your tank which provides you with random weapons.EMP Blast: This one is also new, currently this item messes with the enemy's aim.Final conclusion:I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to just have a good time with friends, and likes to play something simple, fun and a little addicting once you get into it. So if you do get this game i hope you'll have as much fun as i do when i play it."

76561198149704161,Recommended,326460,16533744,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,xXTacocubesXx,"PLEASE READ BEFORE LEAVING THE PAGE OR BUYING. While you get way more value over ssl2, it requires so much grinding to unlock everything. But at least you don't have to pay $300 for it all!The game's still in beta and needs a lot of work! A tough job for just one man. Even now, the developer is continuing to update the game with bug fixes, new game modes, new weapons!There are so few players it's difficult for everyone to find a game. Most of the few including myself who went and bought the game early are now high levels, making it difficult for new players to grow. But that's why I'm advocating this game here on Steam! So we can have more players and hopefully all the new players will be able to find a game with people of their level! I so desperately want this game to grow. It's 5 freaking bucks, what are ya waiting for! If you don't like it you can get your money back!The aiming is different than ssl2! Now it takes less power to shoot farther. If you were good at arcing in ssl2, you're gonna have to relearn those angle numbers. But it's very easy to adjust! You're going to find the aim makes more sense than in ssl2. Certain weapons have been nerfed and buffed. For example nuke did over 100 on ssl2, now it does 80 on steam. Napalm did around 88 dmg without crit on ssl2, but now it can do well over 100 depending on your upgrades. But maxing out your barrel yields a much higher chance of crit hits than putting several coins on a crit barrel on ssl2 which is probably why the nerfs are there. Some weapons that have been made weaker become very op with a maxed barrel!There's still many weapons missing from ssl2 that are not currently in the steam version. Spligger, EE bomb, fast forward, zits, phantom, moon ball, bullseye, supersniper, drill bits, kamakazi, anvil and some others I can't remember. But there's some cool new weapons too!The way you unlock weapons is different. First you have to unlock the first tier of a weapon, then you have to keep using it to unlock the next tier and so forth. For example you start out with a digger. Keep using it to unlock mega digger. Keep using that and you unlock excavation! So instead of just using the strong weapons and ignoring the weak ones, the game basically forces you to use everything so you can get a well rounded arsenal. The kicker though is that while you may unlock higher tiers it's still possible to get lower tiers in the mix. For example, if you unlocked excavation, you're still gonna get regular diggers sometimes. The tank leveling system is also different. In ssl2 there are 50 levels, then you can prestige and restart to lvl 1. On steam there's 80 standard levels. But after that there are 19 ""prestige"" levels up to 100 that require much more xp than the previous levels. It's done this way so the people who have less time can still get to a high level. If you got a lot on your plate and can't play all day, you can reach level 80 in maybe 3-6(?) months with occasional play. But those who have the free time can still level up and get to the REALLY good stuff.There are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS and there never will be! It's pay once and everything is yours! You can still collect tank coins now dubbed ""gears"" but they appear way more often. You will get gears almost every single game! You can spend them all in a shop where you can buy new weapons and maps and themes. There's currently not much but it has good potential.There is a single player for new players that will help them gain a good amount of levels before competing with the big boys online. The missions can get very annoying and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ty especially in the last few sets, but EVERYONE can do them!There are more game modes and variety online! You can have up to 600 hp games! You can have up to 8 players in one game!While many of the players now are high levels, most of them are very polite and fair and will be willing to help anyone if they are simply asked politely. WE DO NOT WANT TO TURN ANYONE AWAY! We are desperate for more people! There are still problems with the game. But it has ENORMOUS potential and I strongly recommend that you at least give it a try!You can choose not to buy and stick with ssl2. Or you can buy it now while the cheap price lasts and help grow the community and recommend this fine game to others! Or if you are completely new to this little franchise, go for it! It's very easy to learn the gameplay and a lot of fun! I hope this answers any questions and uncertainties you have about the game and I hope this helps you decide whether you want to buy the game or not. Leave me a polite comment if you have a question, I will try to answer as soon as possible!"

,Recommended,326460,25292654,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,MGMons,"I'm sure you know the feeling that you get when you pay money for a game and after playing it you feel as satisfied as if you have done one of the best purchases ever. I'm not even sure why this game is in Early Access. I cannot possibly imagine how cooler they can make it. Can you devs?Now, I've played a game called Artillery more than 20 years ago on a 8-bit computer. Believe or not the magic is still here in ShellShock Live. The biggest difference is that my buddy was next to me and we were able to shout at, mock, laugh at, annoy ourselves in our faces while doing another round and here you're doing the same at the computer screen (unless probably you're talking with your buddy over the wire). The common thing is that it was and is a lot of fun.Other differences are:* The colors (Artillery was green on a black background ;). The game is very colorful as seen in the screenshots and it's super cool at the same time. Nothing negative here in my opinion and I don't like colorful graphics. There are some effects here that I guess make it work.* The sound is great. Music could be better but still it's pretty good.* There are LOTS of weapons. LOTS of weapons. LOTS. Each base weapon you get has one, two or up to 4 levels. The best part? You upgrade them by ... using them and scoring damage with them. That's a pretty solid progression mechanic if you ask me. Sure, some weapons are better than others and they can be balanced further but it doesn't matter in the long run. This is what I believe is the luck factor in this game because you don't choose with which weapons to play. A set of your current loadout is rng-chosen at the start of each round and at certain points in the game.* There are tank upgrades. Each level you get gives you a point for upgrade. This mechanic is nice because it allows for a build but I guess (haven't done the math yet) you can level up everything by the max level. Still, until then you have to play LOTS of games and during that time your build is quite important. This also allows for very diverse and interesting games because no two builds are the same.* There is a shop where you can buy stuff with tokens. Still here? Oh, there are no microtransactions, you must get those tokens by making your enemies blossom in awesome explosions. Also there's a daily reward roulette that gives you tokens. Unfortunately I fear that the devs are experimenting before introducing in-game purchases one day. If they don't do it, then this will remain an awesome incentive to make you play more because all those items are purely cosmetic but very awesome. Also when you see someone with them you know they are badass.* There are single player missions. Lots of them by the way and they are very hard. They put your skills to the test and make you learn new stuff. A great addition to a great multiplayer game.* Multiplayer is top-notch. There are some problems here and probably that's the only area I've had most issues with, all concerned with connectivity. You get into a game immediately but too often it has either started or been filled up to the max. There is a superb chat system that functions as normal chat in-game and in the lobby but in-game each message pops up above tanks. It's super cute, I love it. It's as if the tanks are talking among themselves, it's super fun.* Last but not least, and this is the most important aspect of the game to me, is the amazing community. Seriously I rarely enjoy such a positive and generally playful community. I've been in many toxic ones and this one ain't like this. Sure, there are exceptions here and there but usually everyone gets along with each other nicely. Once my teammate started dissing on me at the start of the round because I missed my first shots while our enemies hit us hard, then he/she quit but until then I had scored more damage than him/her. My enemies were suprised and were very friendly pointing out the irony in my teammates attitude. Wow.* The game is lots of fun and it is a skill-based game, make no mistake. You'll suck in the beginning unless your curve geometry is top-notch.* Oh, there are game modes. I forgot about that mainly because I'm playing only deathmatch. There are 6 or 7 off the top of my head. Look them up if you need info. One is extremely hard, putting your skills to their ultimate test - Rebound. The rest are quite different than each other and the gameplay in each one is different.* Oh, how could I forget? There are teams, yes. You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. How amazing is that?Honestly there's not a single major con in this game for me. I think I've layed it all out but if you're still making up your mind, first ask yourself whether this kind of gameplay is for you and then watch a few videos (gampelya or/and reviews) to get the hang of its visual style and mechanics.One of the best multiplayer games that deliver lots of fun and skill-based progression.Please devs, only make the game better. Community, stay awesome!9.5/10"

The many types of different weapons makes the game much more interesting, as well as the many gamemodes to play on. The system for upgrading weapons is different from much other games, and also much more difficult, making the game harder and also more fun. The tank upgrad system is hard but not impossible once you get to a high leve, but by then your weapons will be powerful enough for that to not matter. Overall this is one of my favorite games ot play with my friends or just alone and i recommend anyone considering to buy this to stop considering and buy it now!

One problem was aiming, it was quite hard to aim exactly where your shots went, and even high level players rarely scored direct hits. UNTIL, a very easy exploit was found and made very public by a popular youtuber, this meant that all players that wanted  to win created an aim ruler, forcing any1 that wanted to play vanilla into obsoletion, me and my friend created a ruler each, and homestly the game was still quite fun. However it felt repetitive, because there were 2 scenarios that might happen 1. Both players have a ruler, and the one with first go/ a sniper wins or 2. One player hasnt made a ruler, and loses without doing damage"
,Recommended,326460,21227651,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Kerma,"UPDATE: Kchamp has made the EXP curve better twice, and I am extremely satisifed with it now. Level 46 now with ~20 hours played, it's still long enough to keep me hooked and unlocking stuff but is fast enough at the beginning to allow new players to fit in easily.I originally wrote a review for ShellShock Live when I first bought it during the sale, but I wasn't satisfied with it. I've been playing the crap out of this game, and now want to go back with better knowledge and give it a more in-depth look.The game is in early access, but I'm going to be mostly reviewing it as a full game. The game has been on Kongregate since 2010, also gaining a sequel in 2012, and has slowly grown and gotten better over those years. While I'm sure there are some features kChamp wants to implement before calling it a full release, as it stands the game is pretty much completed minus a few details that are small enough to look past. So keep that in mind while reading, and keep that in mind if you're thinking of buying the game.There's two main modes to this game: Singleplayer and Multiplayer. Singleplayer has skirmish mode (just multiplayer against bots) and Campaign Mode (We'll get to it later). The multiplayer is online only, which is kind of disappointing since this seems like a hotseat kind of game. The developer has stated that it would take a re-build of the game to add hotseat, so don't expect it any time soon- if at all.Going to start off with the multiplayer to explain how the game works. You're a tank, you shoot other tanks, your shots are affected by gravity, it's turn based. Sound familiar? Yes, it's like every other physics based fighter like worms, only the gimmick here is the sheer amount of weapons you have at your ""disposal"". 200+ apparently? You might think that's a bit much- sounds like quantity over quality. But most of the weapons are rather unique, and the ones that aren't are still upgraded versions of other weapons, meaning that there are only a handful that are ""bad"" or ""useless"". The sheer amount of situations that you can take based on your loadout each match is amplified greatly by this arsenal. Why the airquotes around ""disposal""? You don't have all 200+ weapons unlocked to begin with, maybe only something like 15. Through levelling up your tank and your weapons, you unlock more weapons, subweapons, maps, parts for your tank, and skill points for your tank. This means that somebody who is level 80 is literally going to wipe the floor with a level 1. So my personal recommendation for new players is to buy the game during a sale or during some event that will draw more new players to the game for a while. But how is the levelling system? To start, fun. Later on? Long. The maximum level is around 80 or something, and apparently there's prestiges or some system similar that adds even more weapons to unlock. I've been playing this game at time of writing for 13.2 hours, and I'm only level 20. I doubt I'll ever hit anywhere even close to 80, and I doubt most players won't either. So there's going to be some weapons, maps and abilities that you'll just never see unless you're hardcore about it. The levelling up system for weapons is even LONGER, since they only get the exp that you damage people with. The only weapon i've upgraded currently is the sniper, and that's just because it deals crazy damage when you hit things with it, raking in exp. I have no idea how you're supposed to level up the basic shot 4 times, even if the threshold for exp is lower.The campaign is like the grinding system: at first fun, then slowly becomes tedious. It's a series of skill and sometimes luck based challenges that net you crazy amounts of EXP the first time you beat them, and weapon unlocks for beating chapters. They start out fair, giving you difficult target practices and skirmishes with limited weapons, but then become absolutely ridiculous with no margin for error unless you've grinded in multiplayer to a crazy high level. About halfway through the target practices required so much accuracy and the bots became so hard that I just looked up a co-ordinate guide and restarted the mission until I got snipers. However, I still sort of enjoyed the campaign even though the difficulty curve was a bit steep, and think that it adds to the variety of an easily stale game otherwise.Other than that, the graphics are alright for what they are, the music is generic and there's only like 2 tracks (turn it off and put on your own) and the sound design is satisfying and chunky sounding. If the EXP rate gets fixed and the game retains at least a portion of it's playerbase, I'd definitely say this might be one of my favourite pick up and play multiplayer steam games. As it stands right now, it's just simply alright. The balance of having to grind forever to get something new and a too split playerbase just makes the game boring after a short time playing. It's definitely worth the price if you like the genre even right now though."

I really like the weapon progression, here's an exampleshot-> big shot-> heavy shot-> massive shot. Also if you are going to buy this please do single player before multiplayer it will help immensely and when you finish a set of single player missions you get a pretty good shot. The leveling system is great too you have to make hard decisions, you can get the +1 upgrades and and a really good one at the end of the upgrade chain or branch off and get the +2+3+4+5. No buying Crit barrel now its a part of the damage skill tree same with grappling hook. Overall i would reccomend this to someone who really liked SS2"

However, when you start devoting more and more time to this game, you realize that the amount of content being distributed by the developer is pretty miniscule. Most of the updates are features that the game should've had on release, such as more features when creating a lobby or other quality of life improvements. In terms of the experience system, it feels pretty great at first from 1-81, but after that, the amount of experience required to level up starts to increase dramatically, so much that you question the worth of actually leveling up. You don't even get weapons for some of those levels, which is just ridiculous, considering how much devotion it takes to get them. I should also mention, that every time you level up you get a ""Tank Token"" when you put into one of four sections, which are Chassis, Gun, Luck, and Tracks. At first, the upgrades are miniscule but as you level you start getting checkpoints which help. This feels pretty lackluster, but combined with the weapons from 1-81, leveling isn't that bad. The developer is adding weapons for lower levels instead of catering to the higher levels, which is a continuously growing portion of the community. I understand this is just my opinion, but thank you for taking the time to read this review. At the end of the day, it's not a bad game, but don't be looking forward to new content after 200+ hours of playing the same content, as I learned that myself."

This is the only real way to play the game.The singleplayer missions are challenging enough to keep you busy for a little while, but again, you'll only level up to about a maximum of 15 or so and everything else in these missions will absolutely wreck you.REVIEW: ONLY buy this game IF you have enough to get a nice clan of friends and try and keep at the same level.

Because No is pretty harsh for this, but a Yes it just too dishonest for me to say. This is definitely a 'if you want to, but I probably wouldn't pay for it again' sort of recommendation.Cons:This is not Scorched Earth. It looks sort of like it and follows many of the physics based game mechanics, but the heart of Scorched Earth is not here. If you don't care one way or the other, then by all means, buy the game. If you are like me and were under the hope and impression it would be a Scorched Earth of yester year, know that it isn't.AI is terrible. That is the singular reason I have no desire to play this game any more. As other people have commented, they are way overpowered and really sucks any fun out of the game.Campaign is terrible. Don't even bother to keep going past the first couple levels (mainly due to how terrible the AI is).Pros:Looks pretty. The graphics are very nice.Multiplayer looks like it could be fun, but I only tried it once. And it was an ok experience. Other people seem to enjoy it.There are a lot of upgrades. A lot. Some don't seem to do anything though (but again, I spent most of my time in the Campaign, which may not utilize the tank upgrades...I'm not entirely sure I understood when upgrades were applied, if only for multiplayer or not).A lot of weapons. Which also might be a con, but I could just be saying that because I'm still wanting to compare it to Scorched Earth, which did not have this many.The developers seem really open to the community and are committed to improving this game, which is great.Overall: Yeah, if you have some extra money and don't really mind that it is not Scorched Earth and have friends to play multiplayer with, go ahead and get it. You will probably enjoy it. If, however, you have other things to do or have any reservations about it or have no friends to play with and can only do single player, I'd just wait until they patch the AI or something.

We skipped the tutorial and still learned how to play very quickly.  There are over 200 weapons and learning to use them is half the fun.As you level up, you earn more weapons and can spend more skill points to upgrade your tank.  I understand if you play against other people and they happen to be significantly higher level than you, then you are at a decent disadvantage which can be frustrating.  This can also be a problem is you've been playing for awhile and have tons of items and your friends just get it and are low level, lacking certain items.There is a single player mode, but I believe the games intent was to play with others and if that's what you're looking to do (especially with friends) I would definitely recommend it.  8/10If you would like to see some gameplay, you can check my video below of my first experience with it.

Overall it's just as much fun, a bit of a grind to level up both your tank and weapons but I don’t mind it too much.The game is constantly updated with new features every few days to keep it interesting and has received a surge of new players due to being featured on some popular YouTube channels. I recommend this game if you don’t mind that it takes a while to grind up in levels (to put it in perspective, I played 180 hours and I am level 88).My only complaints would be the unbearably difficult single player missions that pretty much require you to be lucky or have upgraded weapons to beat (such as the piñata and boss levels). Also, the match default setting puts a difference in level of 20 in order to join. This is understandable as higher levels would have an advantage but it also makes players who have high levels not able to play in a lot of matches (for me it's around 6-8 games available out of 60-70). That diminishes some of the enjoyment once you reach a high level and can no longer join a lot of games. It would be better if the default setting was ""all levels"" for matchmaking but you could change it if you didn't want to play stronger opponents so that there isn't as much of a downside to ranking up.Overall I'd say this is a 7/10"

Initially you only have access to around 30 different types of weapons (and their upgradeable trees). They are the more basic of all weapons, which really are not exceptionally powerful, but generally have good tactical ability, since most of them can be used in any situation if you can aim well.As you gather experience points, which are accumulated as you play the game, you get access to newer weapons, which behave differently. Like the Dead Weight shot. Which once it reaches it's highest point in it's arc, will fall straight down.The only real problems I have with the game is the level discrepancy between a person who has played for a year, and people who play new today is the fact that as you go up a level, you upgrade your tank. Certain trees directly improve the amount of damage output, this is usually offset if a person of the same level uses the defensive tree. The problem lies where when one person is maximum level, and the other is at a minimal level. The person with upgrades will have a significantly higher chance of defeating the lower level player. Partially due to having superior weapons, and partially due to getting boosts to the tank, such as higher starting HP, and higher critical ratios. However, it is easily possible to beat a ""superior"" player with base weapons. That and low level players now get a small XP boost for ""playing out of their league"".Other than the above statement the game is excellent. This is a game that deserves more attention, there are just enough players to get a few servers running, but usually never more than 3 8 man servers. Hopefully this review would bring attention to it.Apparently Twitch brought more attention to it, not it's hard to NOT find a game.Another plus side, I just noticed. The game is being constantly improved. There are updates nearly every day, and the developers actively play the game to get feedback from players as the changes are made.I think it's definitely worth the 15 dollar price (it was when I got it, and still is now!)"

,Recommended,326460,33014341,Posted: 29 June,all,ichrome,"One of the easiest to pick up and play, casual pvp games out there.If you're familiar with artillery games such as Worms, Tanks or Artillery its self, then you'll pretty much know exactly how this game works. You are a tank, you estimate your power and trajectory for your shot and hope for the best that it hits. Mostly multiplayer (which has latency issues) but can also be played in single player.Why should you choose this over other tank games with some of them being free? Well it all really depends on how much you like this genre. This game is in a way, one the most content rich out of all the artillery games out there with the amount of weapons it has, however it comes at the cost of being very grindy, especially for a casual game. This game has you grind for levels and in turn, weapon unlocks (which can also be leveled) and skills. This is also the reason why I consider this game more casual than competitive, since this game is far from being a balanced game, since not only do players have level advantages/disadvantages but each match is randomized.Pretty much everything from the weapons you will recieve (based on what you've unlocked) to the layout of the level is entirely random, in a way this can balance out level differences, but the game still heavily favours higher levels since they straight up have access to better and more exotic weapons that would otherwise need to be obtained via a random crate containing the weapon, which once again favours higher levels since the contents are based on the players luck level and are easier to obtain if you have high tracks (speed, traction and fuel).On paper, this game sounds like it would be terrible but to be honest, the games weaknesses are also it's strengths. The game gives you inncentive to keep playing so you can be in a position of superiority. It's also really fun when you're the underdog and you come out on top. This is on top of all the games other strengths such as weapon variety, the satisfaction of hitting an enemy and what I consider its biggest strength, an excellent game to play while multi tasking such as watching tv, movies, youtube etc (it's why it is my second most played game).The community is kind of decent. Definatly better than most mainstream multiplayer games but still has a lot of bad apples. Your experience should be fine for the most part but do proceed with some caution.As for it's early access state, it's basically a complete experience. New content still gets added but for the most part it feels like a full game. Some issues here and there but nothing super game breaking.I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys artillery games and also would like a game to play while multi tasking. Easy to pick up and play and overall an enjoyable casual game."

76561198043435874,Recommended,326460,14860775,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,Mallard King!,"Review last updated: 5/18/2015 (mm/dd/yyyy), Shell Shock Live Early Access v0.9.1.2Shellshock Live is the much anticipated reboot of the free to play flash game Shellshock live 1 and shellshock live 2 that personally I been having a lot of fun with in recent times.GameplayTo those coming from the previous flash versions of the game you will find that Aiming weapons is much more difficult to do in this version as all weapons have a different drop-off weight and how much power you put in your shot is much different compared to free to play versions of the game so it will take a bit of getting used too. One issue I been having is the traction as it seems very weird in this version as of the game, in the free to play version of the game even if you do have a low traction level you were able to go down any hills that aren’t at a 90 degree angle but you were unable to go back up that same hill without a higher traction level, where in this version you cannot go up or down most hills without the proper traction level which gets frustrating at times when you find yourself stuck on top of a hill as you are basically a sitting duck until the hill is destroyed enough for you to escape from. The portal mechanic is a welcome new feature that gives a whole new meaning to trick shots as they often enable shots that are usually impossible, possible if you aim well which is always impressive to look at.The single player mission mode are a nice and very welcome addition to the game that enables new players to the franchise to slowly learn the basics of the game without jumping straight into multiplayer games unprepared, but I feel the difficultly curb goes up by huge spikes every set if you plan to go through them all at once with plenty of missions relying on perfect aim on a single attempt to complete without the assistance of the angle and power meter. Personally I feel this can be improved on by giving players more than a single attempt or at least give some tracers to assist the player as it can get frustrating with the lengthy trick shot missions. On the flip side if you put the missions to the side and level up your weapons a bit you can completely trivialize the difficulty of a lot of the missions. There should be a form of weapon lock system that only allows you to use the tier of a weapon that was originally meant for the mission or later mission additions won’t pose much of a challenge.Shell shock live currently offers two different weapon system to choose from, one of them is the classic randomized weapon system that veterans of the series have come to know and love and the second is a selectable tiered weapon system each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Leveling up your weapons has also changed drastically compared to SSL2, instead of leveling up a single weapon multiple times for more power with that shot you now level weapons to upgrade them to superior versions of the weapons. The game also offers tank upgrading system, each time you level up you get an upgrade point for your tank which you can spend on either improving your traction, adding armor to your tank, adding higher critical chance to your tank, or just increasing your luck with certain aspects of the game.Currently the multiplayer needs a bit of work because as of right now there are only a small handful of game modes to choose from which can cause the game to get stale after a while playing each of the modes. Finding a game can also hard at times due to the low but slowly growing population of the game, this is especially true if your one of the higher leveled players as a majority of the lower leveled players will tend to avoid you for good reason. Overall though the multiplayer is very enjoyable to play though it could use a couple of new game modes to mix up gameplay.Training used to be very sluggish, but recently the exp required to level up was greatly adjusted to take out a large portion of the grind required to see everything the game has to offer which makes the game much more accessible to the casual audience while at the same time giving those more hardcore players that want to go beyond the traditional max level of 80 to grind the 20 additional prestige levels that will require tons of time and effort to achieve the real max level of 100. Though right now you might want to hold yourself back on grinding those levels as currently unlocks behind those levels are in development so there is not much reward currently for achieving the real max level aside from maxing out your tank.The achievements can also be improved upon, for the most part I love the achievement system and I hope to see it expanded upon but I feel right now some achievements requires unrealistic amount of time and effort to obtain to unlock lack luster rewards if compared to the work required to get them. Usually I have no problem with achievements that require a lot of work to get but I feel they should be achievements for achievements sake with no rewards behind them and the more doable achievements having unlocks behind them.Graphics and performanceThe game looks very nice with all weapons and various effects having their own unique look and charm to them and also runs very smoothly on my computer, but I feel some weapons generate too much needless smoke sometimes. Another problem I have is the bloom, every shot and the background have a kind of bloom effect I feel is much too bright for comfort. Personally I feel there should be more options for adjusting certain graphical functions to optimize the game for computers that do not have the best specs because as of right now you don’t have many options and if you do not have the best pc to play this game with you will have no choice but to put up with the lag.CommunityThe community is a very competitive one, but with competition comes toxicity so expect drama both in game and on the official forums. For the most part you can ignore these people by simply muting them or staying as far away from the drama as humanly possible, but I feel there should be a way to blacklist players from your games as there will be many times where people cause a lot of trouble for you by either quitting midgame because things are not well going for them or being generally disruptive in your game to the point where it ruins others fun. You are able to kick them from your room but that does not stop them from simply rejoining the room and the process repeating itself until either you finally let that individual in or they get bored and go elsewhere.ConclusionTo new players of the franchise I would recommend playing the free to play flash version of the game first to get an idea what to expect with this game before buying it so you don’t come in with high expectations. If you are a veteran of shellshock live 2 give the game a shot but be aware currently shell shock live does have less weapons to choose from currently compared to the flash version of the game which will slowly be fixed over time but still don’t expect a large amount of new stuff. With the games recent price cut to the cheap price of $6.99 and the overall improvement to the game, community and developer involvement with the community I am much more prepared to recommend others to try out the game then I was previously. There is still lots of work to be done, I feel the single player mode should be expanded on with options other than missions and the addition of a local multiplayer mode with everything unlocked to play from the start so you can just grab a friend and experience everything the game has to offer without buying the game a second time and putting in the work required but of course that does not carry over to your actual multiplayer profile. Kchamp keep up the good work with the games development and continue to interact with your community as much as you have been lately to ensure the quality of your game only continues to only up."

You play as a tank trying to destroy other tanks and sometimes targets. Simple right? Not exactly… SSL is chock full of customization, with items, new bullets, and when playing the multiplayer, various obstacles that appear on each turn. This variation ensures that no two games will be the same, and each fight will be a challenge. The first thing that grabbed me was after each level up you unlock a new weapon, and upon my first unlock it shows you the SHEET of weapons you can unlock, each with multiple stages of power. This was at first a bit overwhelming, but I soon came to look forward to each upgrade.WhimsySSL doesn’t take itself too seriously, in the weapons department, I can launch my standard bullets, or I can launch cats, or I can launch bananas. This is a bit silly at first but then falls a bit flat, as the rest of this game doesn’t match the humor, my biggest suggestion on what they can do is add in the little sort of “damn you” that the tanks give off before they die in Scorched Earth. That would help keep the humor consistent throughout the game, instead of just being an afterthought.HD neonSSL steps away from the pixel art style of its predecessors, using smooth edges and semi high definition art, that isn’t on its own too substantial, but there is one factor that makes it look amazing. The lighting in SSL is some of the best lightings I have seen in a 2d game, and it is on everything. The bullets, the tanks, the barriers, the powerups, the supply crates EVERYTHING has this superb glow that makes everything pop, and stand out from other objects. This distinct look is awesome and really shows off how lighting can make a game great.Ready, Aim, FireThe game controls fairly well, and intuitively instilling total noobs like me with false confidence (until you get to the multiplayer that is). You control with a hybrid of A and D for your movement and the mouse for aiming. I was concerned that SSL would rely on the arrow keys for aiming, and I am glad that isn’t the case. The early turns will employ a lot of trial and error, as you get your shots dialed in against your partner, and then you will have to account for their and your movement as staying in one place is not the best idea. Some weapons work with this and help you get some damage in early without requiring a ton of skill, and some will reward your diligent aiming with high damage outputs. All of this put together gives a gameplay scheme that feels and looks good to play with.Wham Bam AlakazamThe Sound effects and music are both good. Wouldn’t say it is anything to write home about necessarily in the SFX department, but the music does do a good job of maintaining the energy. SSL uses metal and rock tracks instead of your standard electronic music, which is a nice break from the norm. And while I can’t see myself downloading the soundtrack, it served its purpose well and was pleasant to listen to.Better Find Some FriendsThe multiplayer for SSL is the main component, and while the single player missions can be fun, you will want to play against others. The multiplayer is very extensive, and multiple modes are available. It is super easy to set up your own match and then you have swaths of customizable options. Things like whether or not you want the wind, how much HP you want all the players to have, and choose the map. The latter one is important, as the default option is a random map, which can end up with you being screwed in a hole for the majority of the game. This is helped after the first 10 turns when, provided you don’t die, the terrain levels a bit and each player get supply crates of weapons. The multiplayer is fun, and the community is decent, considering how other gaming communities are (a cough).OverallShell Shock Live is an entertaining experience. Revitalizing a long dead genre with just the right improvements. The humor fell a bit flat, and the SFX were boring at times, but the art style, lighting, and gameplay were superb. Pack that in with loads of customization and replayability and you get yourself an 8 out of 10 games with a label of “hectic”."

Believe me. There is loads to do from single player to multi-player. The fun. never. stahhhps. Basically aim, move and fire. The game has growing multi-player functionalities including chat, clans and more. Plenty of achievements and goals. Weapon and tank upgrades from experience and progression. The game caters to all audiences as long as you are ok with 2D and this graphic style, which I would describe as sleek, simple, and classic. I would buy this game with Obama dollars. Save your Trump dollars though cause they will go up in value."

A simple game that has a lot of content to unlock in terms of new weapons, upgraded weapons, new maps, improvements to your tank such as better tracks, more armor and more critical hits. I have played the game for more than 200 hours and I am still playing. The only negative I can say about the game is that it can become fustrating at higher levels. Even though the game is fairly simple (just move your tank, aim and shoot) some players don't realize what they need to do to help their team at higher levels. At the begining of the game the area effect weapons are not very powerful. It doesn't matter if your teammates are close together. But at higher levels, as the area effect weapons become more powerful, it can really hurt your team if they bunch up. It can be very fustrating if another teammate moves close to your tank because the enemy will target you with their large blast radius weapons, knowing that they can hit two tanks with one weapon.Overall I highly recommend this game, it is a great value for the price and alot of fun. Just be prepared for some fustration at higher levels if you don't have good teammates on your side."

I expect it to make it into final release, it is only a week at the moment since Beta release.*** Has been added to the game$15 or £10 seems quite steep for this game, but im sure the final release will justify it, i probally spent more than that on SSL2, and no in-game purchases in steam version.If you're new and undecided about Shellshock, give SSL2 a go for free on your browser... then add up the cost of lifetime deluxe, wepon packs etc, and you will see how $15 for this game is better than SSL2."

You set power and angle and click fire and chaos ensues. This game adds a lot of single player missions, some of which are very hard to complete. With those you should be able to have a decent selection of weapons without ever having done a multiplayer match thanks to large XP rewards.The update frequency is insane and it isnt mundane bug fixes either but rather constant small batches of extra content. (and the price got nerfed in one update so thats also cool from the developer).At this point it outshines its 2 predeccesors in every way imaginable. It has an insane amount of weapons to just keep on unlocking, a lot of which are actually unique. There is even pop culture reference weapons like a mario turtle shell or a portal gun.So far there is 8 unique gamemodes of which 4 focus on killing one another. and there are many more to come.The biggest disadvantage is that high levels eat low levels. I'm not nearly the best at this game but I will crush you every time in a 1 vs 1 should you just start and then play against me, because of having a much larger damage potential thanks to a much larger weapon selection. Though the weapons you will have are chosen at random every ten turns. The best way around this is either playing a non killing mode and accepting losses, playing in a team or only joining rooms with people around your level, which is something you can set.And yes it is turnbased but that doesnt mean one after another it can also mean that everyone waits till everyone clicked shoot and then everybody fires at the same time. And now imagine 8 players at the same firing weapons that on their own can already destroy half a map....absolutely beautiful.Also there is a hot seat mode so you can use it as a local party game.The community has grown so much compared to when this game first came out. This means rooms always fill up easy AND it means far too many cancerous players that make you thank the dev for adding a mute button. Currently a reporting mechanic is in the testing phase.Awright chumps lets sum it up:You got friends and yall looking for an online multiplayer or  local game to play together. Or you like the concept of games like worms in general? You want to nuke things and have mindless fun? This and much more awaits you, worth it even without a sale.And it is NOT a dead early access project. It is already a full game, you could release it like it is and it would be considered a good game that gets a lot of updates.P.s:Someone needs to do something about the volume of how the game first receives you. Finish that tutorial quick then you can at last turn down the music."

The weapon list and arsonal keeps things vastly different each match.While the main focus of this game is multi-player and definetly should be and the community is still small, so far the players are friendly from all my games.  You can level up and unlock more maps and weapons.  Your weapons upgrade from using them in matches whether you win or lose.  You can upgrade your tank stats as you level up your Tank/Rank.You can even play 8 sets of single player missions I believe each set has 10 missions and can be Quite tricky.  I am only on the 4th set of the 8 myself and you gain experience, levels and weapons for it as well.

Since I've played it for the last few weeks, I haven't been disappointed.  The graphics are simple but bright and eyecatching, the physics are well-done, the weapons are fun and funny, and the upgrade system is interesting and encourages you to use as many types as possible rather than just stick with a favorite few.  Tanks are also upgradable with armor, movement, damage, and luck, and can make for some interesting builds.Along with all that, there's extras like shields, teleports, and jet packs, an in-game currency won during matches to buy goodies like bonus weapons, battlefield customizers, and victory music.  And if you don't feel like fighting against real people, there a challenging (and occasionally frustrating) single mission mode to help introduce you to the game, various weapons, and concepts like bumpers and portals.  It's also hard to believe this game is early access; it shows much more polish than some more expensive and bigger name games I've played in the last few years.My one complaint with the game is one that usually befalls multiplayer games; there are the odd occasions where you have rude, stupid, or rage-quit players.  This is pretty much expected, though, and to be honest I've encountered far more nice players than trolls.Overall, its a fun game with a surprising amount of complexity for a simple concept.

Early Access gives us the opportunity to build the game while receiving feedback from players to ensure that SSL grows to fulfill its potential.”This goes with my point of him never talking to us, community driven isn't even shown anymore.“ShellShock Live is already a fully functional game jam-packed with content. There are currently over 200 weapons, 100 maps, and 80 single-player missions. There are probably a few stubborn bugs here and there but we'll iron those out as Early Access progresses.

,Recommended,326460,32331649,Posted: 10 June,all,Chrismas95,"Shellshock Live is that classic 2D tank game you probably know of…but with online Multiplayer and a crazy weapon selection that surpasses even Worms. For the most part, the gameplay is turn-based where you move your tank a small distance each turn, then put an angle and set power into your shot, then hope you calculated it right and it hits the enemy. The huge weapon variety prevents it from being stale, though, as you may have to plan different strategies depending on what weapons the crates give you. There’s not much to describe, but I assure you it’s fun and easy to get into, especially with friends.There are a few flaws, though. The biggest flaw is the upgrading system. As you play more, you can upgrade your tank’s health, movement, etc. This can create unfair discrepancies between you and friends if one decides to play alone or if someone’s new. You pretty much have to reset tanks at that point. Also, you unlock weapons and the player with the wider weapon pool is usually at an advantage. The game has a few ways to try and balance this, but I think it would’ve been more fun and easier to pick up with anyone if everyone had the same tank stats and all weapons unlocked.Otherwise, I think this game is definitely worth a shot. If you can get your friends in on it, I think that’s definitely the route to go…as long as you all stay leveled near each other."

It's a highly enjoyable tank game and it's quite easy to gain XP and levels fast. More levels grant you better weapons, better weapons grant you even mightier ways to conquor your enemies. However, as you dwell deeper into this game you begin to notice more and more faults plaguing such a sleek game. Some of the singleplayer missions are so difficult it's almost completely up to luck and repetition to pass (Fiesta Forever, I'm talking to you!). On occasion the game glitches out and you lose your progress in a mission/game that you were currently partaking in, seemingly with no explanation at all. This problem is actually what prompted me to write this review, I was almost done defeating the final singleplayer mission when I was whisked away back to the homescreen to join the charade of protests from the other players. As with the majority of unmoderated games certain trolls lie in the shadows waiting to ruin your game (and your day, if you let them).Even excluding the listed problems, sometimes this game just gets too annoying to handle. If you perservere through all the pain and agony though, you'll eventualy unlock amazing weapons like the bouncy ball. Which bounces around an excruciatingly painful amount of times before finally bouncing out of the screen or if you're extremely lucky (and I'm talking about a one in a billion chance, here) dealing a minuscule amount of damage. This game may have it's share of brain-bashing, I'm-about-to-jump-off-a-cliff moments, but it also has it's enjoyable ones. After dedicating countless hours to this game, even getting kicked out of my final boss battle (as previously stated) I'm still going to go back and finish it. I have that undescribable need to finish what I've started, even if It'll be my eventual downfall. So if you are also willing to invest in this game, be prepared to get mad. Be prepared to get angry. Overall though, be prepared to never hit anyone with that damn bouncy ball."

,Recommended,326460,24381551,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,Rex Draco,"This game demonstrates the overlooked importance of simplicity.The game uses a lot of dirty methods to make you want to progress in the game. EVERYWHERE is an opportunity to level up or complete an achievement. This game would be a dangerous free to play game, it was apparently at one point was one. With the massive variety of weapon unlocks you need to grind for, there is ALWAYS something to look forward to that gets you practically addicted to the game.It's a fun, relaxing, game with a great variety of color... something lacking in modern games, color. You have a vairety of modes, such as trying to shoot targets, trying to shoot through rings before hitting other players, a mode where everyone versus a single player with a massive amount of health, etc. It's great it has variety, but the modes basically don't deliver the same amount of fun as do the normal free for all or team battle modes.It also has a variety of maps you can play on, a good number of them feeling unfair to some of the players balance wise, and they're so terribly simple I just don't understand why they don't just give players some form of map editor. Over time, these maps rebalnce themselves within battle, giving players otherwise potentially stuck in a hole some wiggle room. You cannot create tunnels in the game, which arguably is a good thing due to most weapons not being designed for them. So if you ever are in a hole and did not upgrade your tank to drive up steep hills, you're probably stuck until you make yourself a ramp which can, at anytime, be sabotaged by other players.You can upgrade your tank in a variety of ways. It's not super diversed in exactly how you can upgrade it, some trees feel lacking in fact as if the developer ran out of ideas. Despite that, it does the job right and makes you really feel you're designing the tank based on your playstyle more than how the game wants you to play. You even have a ""luck"" tree which increases your odds  of getting good weapons, even if you have not unlocked these weapons yet.Each weapon has its very own skill tree that can unlock an improved version for you to fire at some point. Even if you unlocked the best variant of a weapon, it doesn't mean you will get it and can very well still obtain an inferior version of the weapon. For most weapons, labeling the earlier variants of the weapon ""inferior"" can be inaccurate for it's more about trade offs on some. This is a game where you'd have to spend a long time to completely finish and you'll likely stop playing by the time that comes for a moment.This game doesn't have a whole lot of gameplay, so you will likely play it a lot for a moment and then slowly take breaks and coming back until you stop all together. However, you will definitely most likely play it again at some point. Despite the simplicity and the grindy design of the game, it's a good game. For the price, it isn't too bad of an investment as long you have other friends on board.There is some problems, however. Though few, some players use various exploits that is impossible to detect in game, such as rulers. Because of this, it's hard to know if players are good or cheating which causes a lot of drama. This game has, multiple times, attempted to fix this with various methods and all of them were more toxic than the cheaters in my honest opinion. One example was nudging, which only hurts the players playing honestly since what it did was adjust shots slightly, causing it so the good players no longer have the feel of the game and the cheaters to simply adjust their measurments method. Another example was like nudging, but randomized, meaning ALL players are going to have inconsistent shots, except the players already bad at the game will be even worse and the cheaters will still be dominate. There is a wind option, which is honestly a good mechanic despite it not being a good tool against cheaters since it makes the game fresh and more challenging.Another problem is that the game implements tank customization, but you literally have like five options for each piece. This might be an exaggeration, it could be less. I feel that it could give more variety, some way. I believe it's difficult because of how simple the tanks are, the developer probably has no clue what else to really implement other than what is already available.This problem exists in a lot of areas in the game. Maps and weapons have an overwhelmingly huge variety, but other areas do not most likely due to, as mentioned, lack of ideas. This doesn't hurt the game in anyway, but it's worth noting that the game does sometimes feel empty in some areas.Pros-Great weapon varietyLots of progression opportunities to casually introduce other parts of the gameSolid gameplayCons-Some bad maps for fair playVERY grindycheating is very easylacking in content in some areas, such as tank customization.Overall, I believe 7/10 is a deserved score. It's a great game and I think every gamer that likes laid back  gaming sessions should consider this. However, it's not by anymeans revolutionary but it never really was meant to be. It's just fun."

Maybe if the developers made it a free game with many weapon maps or map packs or even tank packs to get the money. That way more people will play the game and will ask their friends to play and then their friends will ask their friends to play and it will be a game widley played by everyone. If the developers was to make this a free game they should also give the people that payed for the game some sort of bonus like a cool weapon. Overall this game is so addicting and has a lot of potential however it is hard to get into the game when nobody plays it as this is the main selling point.

There is some illusion of a skill tree but everyone at level 50+ maxes armor, because regeneration and tankiness is overpowered. People create custom games with rulesets that allow people to grind EXP the most efficiently. If you're with friends, there's an understanding to try out creative angles and fun builds when you play.

So you feel unrewarded when you beat a level, but thankful its over. Only to be presented with 4 other extremely hard levels that pushes you into state of frustration. Which is one of the reasons I stopped playing, as it became a grind rather than a fun playful experience it intitally gives you.The Multiplayer is fun, it can be unbalanced at times with Huge High level players dropping into your lobby. I can understand why they can. As the playerbase dies they have no where to go. The reasoning to return to Shellshock Live to play another round is pretty limited. You either get stuck at a nearly impossible Sinlge Player mission or you stumble upon lobbys with people setting the requirement of players too high for them to ever get filled. Once filled they are unbalanced uber players that reap all the points and are impossible to kill. The balanced challenge is pretty much removed and turns into a grind than a fun experience.Overall ShellShock Live is a fun game, would recommend. Thanks developers."

I mean, I remember few years ago playing ShellShock Live 1 in Internet, and last year, ShellShock Live 2 in Internet too. The graphics of steam version are way better than the Internet version.There are some options and bugs that have to be upgraded (however the game often receives updates)My personal opinion abot the game:In my opinion, this game is one of the best games out there, because is so complete. When I first entered this game I was shocked when I saw ""Single-player mode"". That's was a insteresting way to play the game (because in the Internet version you only could play Multi-player mode). I bought the game with a friend, so we play together, and we were amazed of how the games looked, because the weapons were so cool, and the graphics were AWESOME (specially Nuke, WOW)But, the game has a problem, that if you play too much, you will get bored. So i'm waiting for new updates with new modes or new missions (for Single-player).What i think this game should add, is Co-op Single-player mode. That would be so goood! I mean, playing missions like Single-player mode but with a friend, would be soo fun.Also, i think this game could add some new tanks, but made by the community. Like workshop, it would be cool that people could make new weapons or tanks, etc.So that's my review.Graphics★ ★ ★ ★ ★Multi-player★ ★ ★ ★ ☆Single-player★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆Interface★ ★ ★ ★ ☆(I had the game since the old interface, it was good, but the new one is better)."

Wether you spend the few bucks just for some laidback turn-oriented gaming, or you buy it because you have already squahed every player in every other game, it can be fun for either types of people. This game features a few different gamemodes, my favourite is assassin, that either hit or miss for the player. There's deathmatch, team deathmatch, assassin, juggernaut, and a few other more...degenerate...gamemodes. The community in this game is pretty chilled out, of course you may come across the young kid who can't play COD on his comp because it's from 2008 or the sweaty tryhard, but what game is complete without the good and the bad? This game is a HD throwback straight to the newgrounds era (infact I think I found this game originally back on Kongregate, a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of newgrounds). If you suffer from""flash game nostalgia""it's definetly a game worth trying out.Now on to the gameplay aspect.God, the gameplay. It's great, it really is! There's just one problem: Weapons. The weapons in this game are either really epic and overpowered, or they are something like shooting goldfish in bags at the enemy. I'm not lying, that's a real weapon in the game. The weapons become better as you play and level up the weapons and earn more, and even though the weapons are simply herendous when you first start playing doesn't mean that all of the early weapons you get are terrible. Some of them are really ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!Overall, I highly recommend this game to everybody.

You are a tank, you estimate your power and trajectory for your shot and hope for the best that it hits. Mostly multiplayer (which has latency issues) but can also be played in single player.Why should you choose this over other tank games with some of them being free? Well it all really depends on how much you like this genre. This game is in a way, one the most content rich out of all the artillery games out there with the amount of weapons it has, however it comes at the cost of being very grindy, especially for a casual game. This game has you grind for levels and in turn, weapon unlocks (which can also be leveled) and skills. This is also the reason why I consider this game more casual than competitive, since this game is far from being a balanced game, since not only do players have level advantages/disadvantages but each match is randomized.Pretty much everything from the weapons you will recieve (based on what you've unlocked) to the layout of the level is entirely random, in a way this can balance out level differences, but the game still heavily favours higher levels since they straight up have access to better and more exotic weapons that would otherwise need to be obtained via a random crate containing the weapon, which once again favours higher levels since the contents are based on the players luck level and are easier to obtain if you have high tracks (speed, traction and fuel).On paper, this game sounds like it would be terrible but to be honest, the games weaknesses are also it's strengths. The game gives you inncentive to keep playing so you can be in a position of superiority. It's also really fun when you're the underdog and you come out on top. This is on top of all the games other strengths such as weapon variety, the satisfaction of hitting an enemy and what I consider its biggest strength, an excellent game to play while multi tasking such as watching tv, movies, youtube etc (it's why it is my second most played game).The community is kind of decent. Definatly better than most mainstream multiplayer games but still has a lot of bad apples. Your experience should be fine for the most part but do proceed with some caution.As for it's early access state, it's basically a complete experience. New content still gets added but for the most part it feels like a full game. Some issues here and there but nothing super game breaking.I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys artillery games and also would like a game to play while multi tasking. Easy to pick up and play and overall an enjoyable casual game."

There are some differences, and some pros and cons to this game that may or may not have any comparison to the previously mentioned game.Pros:New Game, Actively UpdatedEnhanced GraphicsOnline GameplayUnique Weapons that reward strategic thinking.Possibly one of the best gaming communities online at the moment.(I nominated this game for the ""Best Community"" award.Cons:You don't have access to all weapons at the start, so you may at times be at a disadvantage.However, weapons are randomly selected for all players based on unlocks, so it isn't like the other players are ALWAYS going to have better weapons. Sometimes they have too many situational weapons to put up a decent fight. Which is another con in my opinion.While the community is amazing, there are a few who will literally put a ruler up to their screen to get snipe shots with 100% accuracy. They're technically not doing anything wrong, but it is a little cheap. Changing winds could help fight that.All in all, highly reccomend this game if you're looking for a relaxing arcade game to play in the office or living room."

Those 40 levels are so easy that's like if the real levels were 60. After 47 hrs played, i reached level 64; the exp curve is not so fast but you can still earn 1-2 levels per day by playing moderately, so you get close to level 100 within a reasonable time. After 93 hrs played, i'm level 75; at this point i'm out of achievements (some of them are pointless), and yes, you have to farm to level up. However, be aware that's playable even if you are not level 100, or even better by using the match settings in order to block low or high level players.About game modes (all modes support 2-8 players, except Tournament):- ""Juggernaut"" mode picks a player and sets him as Boss, so it's All-Players VS 1.- ""Marksman"" mode every player turn spawns a dartboard at random position; don't miss it, or lose.- ""Points"" mode is without death. You play for a limited number of turns, and you have to rack up more damage than your enemy.- ""Rebound"" mode spawns bumper surfaces at random position; all your skillshots must bounce on them first.- ""Assassin"" mode automatically marks a target: you have to destroy it.- ""Deathmatch"" mode... you know this classic; 1 VS 1, All VS All, or Team VS Team.- ""Tournament"" mode allows you to create a tournament for 4-16 players, but it's basically 1 VS 1, where the winner challenges the other winner.In the past i played other games of the same genre, and i have to say that's pretty good, except the maps (every map looks like the others - there are no high floors, just a ground floor for all players), and the graphics... it's way too simple, with horrible phosphorescent colors, no terrain details, and even worse background, but i have to say that quality is appreciable as it's well polished in its simplicity.*** NOTE: NO MICROTRANSATIONS, the only way to use the shop is the in-game currency called ""Gear"". You randomly drop gears by playing or by completing the daily quest, and you can use them to purchase extra weapons, maps, cosmetic parts for your tank, etc..."

The singleplayer really seems like it's geared towards teaching you how the weapons work without explaining it, rather it lets you experiment around to see how each weapon works. Some of the missions are hard for the wrong reasons (Lookin' at you, Get Lucky.), but generally you're in for a good time.Now for the multiplayer aspect of the game (which let's face it, you'll probably get this for the multiplayer), it's about the same as ShellShock Live 1 and 2. You shoot other tanks until they die. There's no Points mode yet, but they make up for it in the currency called Gears. Gears are the equivalent of the Tank Coins in SSL 1 and 2. You get Gears when they pop out of tanks after they've been hit, and you mouse over them. Here's my only complaint so far: THE GEARS CAN OFFSCREEN THEMSELVES BEFORE YOU CAN REACT! If there's a tank to the very side of the screen, the gear will bounce offscreen and you won't be able to get it.Now, this game isn't Pay 2 win like SSL1 and SSL2, but rather it's based on how much you level up, making it somewhat of a meritocracy. I like that. The more you play, the more experience (both in-game and actual experience with the game) you get, the better weapons you get and the more Tank Points you get. Tank Points are your stats, of which you can improve 4: your gun (attack power), your luck, your armor (defense), and your mobility. Each of this has a different advantage in battle, and provides for very unique builds.I would recommend this to anybody who loves the idea of a 2D turn-based Tank MMO."

I thought it looks pretty cool, but I saw many reviews that talked about the poisonous community in the game. I was afraid to dive into it, for I feared people would be constantly cursing at each other, calling others cheaters, and so on. When i get into the first match, those people were very nice. They gave me a warm welcome to the game, and even some tips on how to shoot. As a progressed, people still remained kind, fun, and encouraging, except for a few who I believed got a bit frustrated at the game. Very good community; I suggests interacting more with those people :)2. Graphics, features, etc: I watched several (many) videos about SSL before I got it; I felt like I needed more guidelines as to whether I should get the game or not. In my opinion, the graphics are amazing 10/10 neon colors. I am also the type of guy that gets bored really quickly (within 25 minutes maybe?) of something. This game featured amazing features for such a low price. I love the upgrade, customization, and shop system in this game. In addition to all of these amazing ""upgrade"" features, my feeling towards this game is that the devs only create this for money partly. The other fraction is for pure entertainment for others. One extra thing to mention is the extra AI campaign and skirmishes, where if the community really doesn't like you, you still have an option to enjoy the game.3. Yes, this is getting long, so here's my last point: Based on my opinion, this game is perfect for me. I like tanks. I like ships. I like planes. This has all of those, or at least things relating to each of them. I should re-state the fact that this game offers bright, colorful neon graphics! :)) Finally, just to show how 11/10 this game actually is, it is the first ever game (not just on Steam) that I've bought for actual money.

Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

,Not Recommended,326460,31831370,Posted: 18 May,all,DragoZeroNova,"(Too long, didn't bother to read: Love the game, but the way early people are being treated is bad, not gonna deal with it; Don't buy now, wait until full release.)Disclaimer: I have only been playing for half of the games lifespan. I have seen some of the big changes Kyle has made, but not all of them. I started playing when ssl was in v0.9.5.17, so yeah.Now, I know what some of you might be thinking: ""How can someone who has over 1000 hours dislike the game?!"" Well, I don't. I love this game a ton and it is one of my favorite games. But, I've also been playing this for a long time, which is why I've seen most of the different changes Kyle has made that have somewhat/fully altered the game. Some were good, like new weapons, better screen and more modes. And the recent new achievements? They're fine. But some of the other updates have changed things, not for the better. For one? The weapon nerfs. Some of them were somewhat necessary, but the level it was nerfed by is just too much, Granted, the napalm one was fixed(ish), but I still don't approve. However, that's a minor detail to me. The exp nerf for rebound was, and is, rather annoying, but overall, the change to modes played? Not much. Points EXP farms that technically don't actually work everywhere? Yup, but that's not the games fault, so I'll give that a pass. But, the new achievement fixes are just bad. First off, reducing the amount of the wins/kills/games played for the achievements was a good idea, but reducing it by 80%?! That was a major shock to me, and one of my turning points. Half would've been fine, but that's a kick to the face for long-time players. After all the work they put in to get said achievements, he reduces it by that much. Not only that, but he also now has the rule where beating a level 100 will net you god rays if they have it? That's another sign that he cares only about money and not the players that have supported him from the very start. I have postponed getting level 100 for quite some time, but now I don't want to. Reaching level 100 at this point would be painting a target on my back for other people to target me during games. In fact, I'd probably have to play with all friends ONLY every game and if there isn't any friends on at that point? Too bad, just gonna have to die every first turn. Honestly, my advice is to wait until full release, unless you can handle being screwed over 4 months later.Edit 5/25/2017: I forgot to mention, but he removed the Persistant achievement. Was it a bad one? Yes. Should it have been removed? Yes. Should he have waited over a year to remove it? No. That was very rude to the people who grinded for the achievement. Even worse, when someone asked about it, Kyle just said ""You'll get the 1000 exp that no one else got."" That, is just bad. All that time doing grinding for that just to be kicked in the face multiple times, and all you get is 1K, or like one games worth of exp, maybe (Probably) less.Edit 6/3/2017: Added some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics, so....Yeah. Even less worth now.Edit 6/4/2017: Fixed it, mostly. (As far as I'm aware) At least he realized that. Has also added some new stuff, which is nice, but it's not really that relevant.Edit 6/10/2017: I was recently told that by ComplexOri that the 10K achievements used to be 50K, which means that it's been nerfed a total of 96% from the original. Yikes. (But, 50K was too much, tbf.)Edit 8/4/2017: Also the ton of germans, I guess. Sorta strange, but I mean, I'm not racist, so as annoying as it is, can't exactly complain either."

While many players have brought up the fact that cheating has increased dramatically, my concern is with the developer himself who in my personal opinion ""Just doesn't care"". He fails to address any of the bugs and issues that the communities have tried to bring forward (Both on the official forum and on the steam community hub) and that doesn't give us anything to look forward to.Will these problems be fixes in future updates or not? That's what many players would like to find out but the fact he isn't informing us of these issues makes us believe that the game is being left on its own. All the updates that have been happening are just extra weapons being added to the game without first addressing the more major problems with the game. The time I had with the game before was great but it's turned to s**t now.TL:DR - Game is buggy. None of the issues being addressed by the dev. Just sugar-coating the game with unnecessary updates that doesn't fix the issues.Guess I'll stick to Worms from now on.Review as of the 26th MayIf you're a fan of the Worms genre, then this is for you (Yes, you right there. The short one on the right).The fact that you start off with a limited amount of weapons is great as it allows players to adapt to each one and feel more comfortable before moving onto a new weapon. While the game is still in early access, it's done extremely well during it's time as well as constantly getting updates for new content and bug fixes.My only cons is that their official forum is crap. Bad attitude that basically doesn't permit any fun whatsoever. Don't bother with it. The other con is that cheating is still a problem and needs to be solved as soon as possible since many players are using it which deters players away from playing again.Out of 10, I give the game a solid 8/10 and my personal thumbs up (I know you can't tell if my thumb is pointing up but trust me, it is.)"

( I even think some of these kids play it cause please don't spend your time in the in build lobby.. that's hell on earth.)The game has some awesome missions which of some may seem impossible but they're really do-able!I really dislike the ruler cheat but really, every game has their toxic players, and if you don't want to take the risk to play against these people, invite your friends and have a tank battle!One think I also dislike is the achievement of which you will have to defeat kChamp in a round, which is linked to unlocking a weapon, if you're a collector (Like me) you want to be able to get all the weapons, without having to bother to be a lucky person to end up in a match with 1 person in the entire world..But yeah to sum it up.Pros:- Awesome graphics, I like the effects/light effects, etc.- Smooth gameplay, I haven't encountered many bugs, so I can't complain (Sometimes resetting a mission when an enemy attacks makes me have to reset it again but meh.)- level up system! I love those, I spend my points not realising I was creating a swastika.Cons:- Shizzle ingame lobby, I dislike how their toxic personalities effect my gameplay. I get forced to look at it, maybe have a setting to turn it off?

While this doesn't affect ur gameplay, your tank can look pretty cool.

The gameplay feels very simple, yet the game mechanics are quite elaborate! I found myself easily addicted to this game. This game is in Early Access and the developer drops fairly frequent updates with new weapons, game modes, and field-changing obstacles (which are awesome).I highly recommend ShellShock Live, especially with its low price!"

,Recommended,326460,33500918,Posted: 13 July,all,ISIS Bucket Challenge,"It's a good rehash of the browser version with better graphics, however I don't like how you can upgrade your tank. This gives players with a higher level a large advantage. All players should not have any advantages, and a level 1 should have no advantage to a level 100, but that's my opinion. This makes it nearly impossible to play as a low level because almost EVERYONE is much higher level than you, so you have to suck it up most of the time.Aside from that, it's a good game with a good concept, and it's so satisfying to get lucky shots. Incredibly satisfying."

,Not Recommended,326460,30401682,Posted: 8 March,all,RS,"Controls/Mechanics: Ok, The controls are decent, the physics are very bizarre and you really cant get use to them which the game is fully based on. There are over 300 weapons in the game and a large majority of them are not good weapons, a lot of these weapons do not have good damage, you cannot truly aim them and its luck if they hit the target. You cannot choose what weapons you would like to use and its luck if you get decent weapons to fight enemies. 6/10Sounds/Music: Ok, The music is nothing special and is quite boring after a time of listening to limited tracks that are not behind a in game pay wall. 6/10Graphics: Ok, Simple graphics that most computers can run which is nice but nothing special and boring to look at after a time. 6/10Difficultly: Bad, There is a leveling system from 1-100 and can be very unfair for the reasons being that higher leveled players have better weapons then lower level players, they also get more perk tokens which farther increases the difficultly fighting against higher leveled players. These tokens can give them extra armor, more random critical damage, extra items, fuel to move a larger distance, etc. 4/10Replay Value: Ok, The community in games is what brings people into the game but a decent amount of the community here is not to friendly and you will not have fun unless you have friends to play with. 6/10Originality: Ok, There have been games in the past that have done the same style of game and have done it better. 6/10Enjoyment: Ok, Like what was previously said, you will have a tough time enjoying the game without friends to play with because of the unfriendly community and the large issues with the game. 6/10Total: 40/70, 4/7, or 57%"

As I got the opportunity to actually play more multiplayer matches and progress further, it starting becoming more fun.  Also, they lowered the price to be more around what it should be.  It currently suffers from a major lack of AI bots and arcade-style gameplay, but I decided to change my review because it is very actively being developed and they are listening to feedback.When the game is fun, it is really fun, but it has a lot of work to be done.Overall, it's good, but a few cons:I dislike flash-style graphics like this.  Just a personal preference I guess.  They feel cheap to me.It goes back into the lobby WAY too much.  It's particularly annoying in single player missions that are easy to fail, and it replays the jarring transition animation over and over and makes you go back into the level you were just in.  In multiplayer, there should be multiround games.Some missiles take way too long to finish; particularly the bouncer, digger, and grenade.The digging missiles don't feel like they actually dig through the environment.  They feel like they just morph the top of the landscape, which isn't too bad but it's be cool if you could actually see things fall.Overall, good game that I will keep playing, but I'll be patiently waiting for more gameplay options."

(the one with 20 levels or more wins almost all te time)but some of down sides can be counterd by having some friends to play with.overall i think this is a great game. but  do have a friend to play with or create one as you go,  it might not be as fun."

,Not Recommended,326460,29710587,Posted: 4 February,all,Derk,"I absolutely loved playing Pocket Tanks many years ago, so after finding this game on the store I decided to give it a try. As many people have said, community is extremely vulgar, toxic, and racist for some reason.Upon playing the game I found out that you end up in games against players who are a higher level than you, thus meaning they will have better weapons and better tanks (in relation to health, weapon power, etc.) They can also spawn items during matches that they have collected through playing the game like health pickups, shields, weapon crates, teleports, and so on. You start with none of these things as a level 1, so you are at a major disadvantage until you level up.I also learned that there's many players in the online multiplayer portion of the game that go the lengths to divise mathematical formulas, tape an actual ruler to their screen, and solve equations with pen and paper so they can exactly calculate the angle relative to your position in which they need to shoot so that they can hit you **100%** of the time. Additionally, players were actually sharing the formula amongst a topic in the game's forum while defending their own innocence when being called cheaters. To put it one way, using a ruler is essentially the equivalent to taping a crosshair to your TV screen to give you an ""edge"" at centering your shots when aiming with hip fire, or even an ""aim bot"".Like this is a $7.00 soda and chips game, not some elite eSports title.Even though the game only cost $7.00, I can't justify keeping nor recommending it under any circumstances. I will be requesting a refund.[TL;DR] Anyone who uses a ruler is a weaboo furry-fetish degenerate nerd virgin that spends every day of their sheltered lives playing video games, binge reading manga, sh;t-posting edgy memes on iFunny, intimately fantasizing about Overwatch characters, as well as openly criticizing or discussing video game news in personal facebook statuses with 1-2 of their ""internet friends""."

I had hoped that it would replicate the frenzy and explosive insanity of ""Scorched Earth"" from 1991 and for the most part it does.Being unable to progress your ""character"" in strictly offline matches against the AI means that you are unable to experience the full range of customization and weapon options. There have been multiple requests for this feature since the game was in early access. This and the lack of local co-op when similar reboots of old franchises (such as Road Redemption) have included it suggests to me that the developers are more interested in unit sales than the experience.It's not bad by any means, but I am not going to give it my recommendation either.<edit> : According to the Store page, the original length of time that SSL was planned to be in early access was 3-4 months. Writing this 12 months after the initial release, with development on SSL2 seemingly well underway, would suggest that this game also be placed in the growing list of cash farming perpetual early access cash cows.

Cool. But you probably want to know more.In case you did not know, Shellshock Live (SSL) is a steam adaptation to 2 free-to-play browser games, reasonably titled Shellshock Live 1, and Shellshock Live 2. Shellshock Live 2 is the newer and more active browser game, but the steam version (the newest adaptation) of this franchise has many differences than SSL2.Q: if those browser games are free, why buy this game for $7?A: It's based off what you want. All the weapons are found in both games, but here's the kicker: for $7, you get ALL the weapons. With Shellshock Live 2, lots of those weapons (and other things, but weapons are the main point imo) are locked behind paywalls (you can get 8 weapons for >$7. There are 8 of these weapon packs, and 2 retro weapon packs (from SSL1) that are twice the size and cost more). However, with Shellshock live Steam, it takes lots of GRIINNDDDIINNNGGGGG to get these weapons and upgrade certain weapons. (Im level 58/100 as of this review and i still dont have big shot) Thus, it's if you want to pay, or grind.If you pick SSL2, you chose pay. If you pick SSLS, you chose grind.Now that that's out of the way, here are pros and cons for this game compared to SSL2.PROS:-No IAP (In-game-purchases)-8 Player Battles (if you can get one going)-Graphics! Graphics! Graphics!-Early Access game...new features are being added more often.-Clans-Single Player mode (80 missions useful for newbies)-NO IAP!!!!!@#$*!@*#%!@#*$%^&!#$TRQ@#111111 (sry)CONS:-Active people pale in comparison to SSL2-The game isn't gaining many players currently-S00 grindy-Has weapon balancing issues (may be fixed, but we must wait.....)All in all, this game is arguably in improvement on the flash version.I, myself, am really against In-game-purchases and find this to be a MUCH better value. However, it is much harder to create games than SSL2 due to the lack of people playing this game.For the price tag of $7, though, i find it to be well worth it. Plus, you're helping the community grow, right? :)"

This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for this game's lack of a matchmaking system. When playing this game online, games lobbies are determined by whoever is hosting servers at the time, similar to Gmod. Because of this, games often alienate new players in that, not only are they at an experience disadvantage (having played the game less), they are also at a severe firepower disadvantage that is often the deciding factor of the match, which can end in a single turn with the right weapons. Playing the game longer than your opponent should only give you an experience advantage (and cosmetics), meaning that it is a level playing field in which the better player wins.It is for this reason that, unless you are playing with friends who's arsenel improves as your does, I cannot reccomend this game."

,Recommended,326460,22360285,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,CulDoes,"At first glance ShellShock just looks like a Worms remake, which is completely wrong but I will be comparing the game to Worms as I feel most people understand the concept. Firstly you control your tank instead of thinking about your moves for multiple annoying worms, which means more enjoyable combat. I was amazed to see the range of artillery which you unlock over the course of playing the game, from ""Shot"" to ""Portal Gun"" it's insane, plus the fact your usage of the artillary levels it up, increasing the damage or effect it has. The game also Includes many, many maps in which I've only unlocked a couple. There is very nice leveling system in which each level you progress a new artillery is unlocked, I also like the simplistic map design where it's more focused on the fact of hitting your target than the overloaded image pasted over any new Worms map. The menu's and general aesthetic of the game is really nice to look at, with its simplistic background with really nice animations for level ups and unlocks, I can't think of any note worthy faults. Overall this is an amazing game especially for the price, If you enjoy 2D shooters, tank games or even Worms, this game is perfect."

The damage scoring in this game makes no sense and is probably one of the weirdest i have seen in a while. What I have put together is that it subtracts the amount of damage you do with the amount of damage you took (dmg dealt - dmg taken = total dmg). Also i think it factors in team damage which is reasonable. But when the rest of my team dies and im left to 1 v 3 and I end up with 67 damage dealt at the end of the game is a bit annoying. I understand that this game is still in beta so it has some kinks to wirk out, but my only request is that the ""damage dealt"" thing at the end of the game gives you your actual damage and not what I talked about earlier. But with all that aside I think that this game is one of the best arcade games to play with friends."

It's a fun game because of it's amount of strategy involved, as well as learning how all the weapons work takes time.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

Very fun.Wide variety of upgrades and weapons and the like.Multiplayer actually works and isn't terrible.Cons:Who designed this game to have such an incredibly, excruciatingly long progression system? I'm not quite sure whoever implemented it understood the values of some numbers. 1,000,000 xp is the requirement for a specific achievment, when the maximum you can get a match is 40, slightly more if you have multipliers from game settings. 5000 games played is a requirement for another. I've heard people go on about how it took them several hundred hours just to get to rank 100 from rank 99. That's just bad design. If you're going to have a progression system, make it fair.Mildly toxic community, but that doesn't quite fall under gameplay.Altogether, I'd like to give this game a recommendation, and believe me, I'll still be playing it, but I'd be careful if you don't want to spend dozens of hours grinding just to unlock a wider variety of weapons."

,Recommended,326460,21958045,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Silver Lining,"At a play-time of almost 2 hours (level 11 I believe), I've barely scratched the surface of this game, but one thing is for sure: I CAN'T stop thinking about the damn thing. The thrill of battle, the satisfaction of the progression, and the god-like feeling of landing a perfect snipe is addictive and so ♥♥♥♥ing worth it.  This is the definition of BANG for your buck.In all seriousness:This game consists of a single player with a set of 80+ missions that act as a tutorial and challenges, and a multiplayer mode against AI (but no xp gain) and human players. While the singleplayer is a nice way to hone your skill, the meat of the game is clearly in multiplayer.There are quite a few multiplayer modes, but the most popular seems to be deathmatch, though I feel like the Assassination mode could be interesting as well. Players vary in skill level, which affects how many types of guns are available to them, and might affect their passive tank bonus. If you want to steer clear of the disadvantage of playing against high level players, you can either host your own lobby with a low rank difference, or seek out lobbies with similarly ranked players. You gain xp and level up regardless pf whether you win or lose (though more xp goes to the winner of course). I haven't had any problems with the multiplayer so far.The game has a very satisfying sound and aesthetic. Guns appear in your roster with a flashy animation, and the presentation is very sleek overall. The only problem I have with the UI is the inability to click through the level-up or xp animations. These just take way too long, and I often have to click Ready while within the animation. This isn't hard, guys. Come on.CONCLUSION:Costs as much as a sub. Provides endless hours of entertainment. Grab it now if you're a Worms fan, grab it anyway even if you're not."

But my real issues are 1. Random shields that just pop up. They can basically wall you off from being able to shoot at all, putting you at a random disadvantage for no reason other than the game feels like screwing you over. 2. Super l33t weapons like a shot that always automatically hits. Yeah. I thought this game was based on skill??Don't waste your money. Once (not if) it goes FTP, maybe give it a shot. But please, the limited gameplay common to this genre, coupled with its BS RNG and badly OP weapons (that are also randomly granted, whee) makes this game a definite do-not-buy."

There 2 Types of online players: Those who kick you out because you're a stranger, and those  who kick you out because your level is lower then theirs. I played about 20 rounds with my friends and tried to play a couple rounds online; I got kicked out about 10 times till I gave up and played the singleplayer.The singleplayer is ok, but there're no level for under level 10 players which makes newcommers who want to try the singleplayer frustraded.So my final decission is to give this game a not recommented.

76561197987995615,Not Recommended,326460,30732890,Posted: 25 March,all,Blergh,"It took long enough for someone to create a spiritual successor to Tank Wars and Scorched Earth, but there's something truly wrong when even the lowest-hanging fruit on the developer tree can churn out something as average as Shellshock Live and still be successful.The entire game is about grinding. First you have to grind your tank up levels to get new and better weapons, and then you have to grind the weapons to get upgraded versions of them. As with all grinding, this quickly gets tedious and really kills the enjoyment of the game, and is REQUIRED to get on a level playing field with most of the playerbase.Then we have the weapons. In-game stats for them are not available, and they're horribly unbalanced...yet the game the dev thinks it's perfectly fine to randomize what weapons every player gets. An option to allow players to pick their weapons before a battle would be a nice choice to have.The UI is beginner-quality bad. Oversized buttons, useful in-game information only appearing for a handful of moments and a complete lack of server options once the game has started besides quitting the game. Is it so hard to code in a votekick option? And then there's the bizarre concept of having a large targeting circle surround the tank. It took 10 seconds for players to realize the 100/86 rule and make it more of a crutch than a useful UI asset.There are plenty of game modes to pick from, but some of them are outright ruined by basic game elements. Assassin involves targeting another specific player exclusively. There's nothing to stop the other player from just constantly running away from you to deny you victory, and doubly so if the ""Move First -> Shoot First"" mechanic is enabled.The mere fact that this game can still be a blast to play in multiplayer shows how entertaining a Tank Wars clone game really is, but this is the worst such clone I've played in 25 years.Not recommended until the developer overhauls the entire game from scratch - but considering the game is close to leaving Early Access, I highly doubt he's even gonna bother with that. Spend your money elsewhere."

There are a huge variety of weapons to choose from, and you can upgrade them. P2W was never a thing in the game. But that's about all the good things.The community is salty, especially when you hit lv 80 and above. This is when you unlock the Nuke, and everyone starts ganking up on you in fear that you'll nuke them, without whatsoever knowledge that you have other non-nuke weapons. It's frustrating when people say it's a strategic move. It may be strategic, but it's not fun. I try to play fair, I don't focus on one at a time, because I don't want to discourage people by eliminating them first. I play solo, and mostly without a team. Players will also gank up on you, based on your skill rating. Double standards everywhere.I can't recommend the game mainly because of its mechanics. Shouldn't we get better starting weapons the higher our level are, since we have access to more weapons? Apparently not so, every round 50% of my weapons contains any weapon a level 1 can have. And crits. I have max crit in my build, but the rate I've been getting crits are similar to not spending any points into the crits section. To put it simply, RNG in this game is a nightmare."

Instead of creating millions and millions of unneccessary weapons and upgrades etc.,there should be a modi which keeps it simple and stupid(like in the original inspired game ""cannonhill""). Give me five weapons or so and let the local multiplayer action begin!This game should focus much more on the principle ""easy to learn, hard to master"". At least it should be possible to select/deselect certain weapons which are allowed in a battle. Cause when I want to play this game with my friends in a local multiplayer on one screen (which this game is predestined for!!!), I dont' want to explain everey single weapon, I just want to enjoy a trumendous fight!I really hope that my thoughts will be taken into consideration!!!"

First of all if you move your mouse even a little you mess your whole aim up making it way too difficult without a aimbot ruler. And also the other players have played this way too much making you have to sit there fighting ai enemies for about a month just to get close to the person's level. So if you love bad aim, and people with aimbot rulers who have to cheat just to win then go ahead and buy this game, if not then don't. (Also forgot to add how more then 80% of the time you enter a room, the person just kicks you for no reason.)"

Whether it’s the nameless NPCs you always meet in RPGs or the hundreds of mooks you mow down with gunfire in games like Uncharted, Undertale brilliantly demystifies these conventions and questions why games are still codified this way. But even outside of its ambitious themes, it proves to be a compact, perfectly paced RPG experience with hilarious, tense writing and endearing characters. That it succeeds so completely in its thematic approach on top of all that is what makes Undertale a truly essential experience."

You also unlock new weapons as you level up, making you do more damage than your friends if you are higher level.You earn XP from winning games with your friends. Yes, you read that correctly. This means you caneasilyboost with friends to level yourself up by telling them to purposely let you win. You might think ""Hey, that means the level differences you said earlier don't matter then if you can just boost!"" And to that, I say, Ishouldn't have togrind XP by exploiting the system in order to have a fair and balanced game. I don't want the XP to be the decider of who won or lost before the game even starts. That's, well,unfair.Lastly, ""bumpers"" spawn randomly and asymmetrically at the start of each turn. This means your shot could be completely blocked off by a random obstacle at any time. Sometimes, they even spawn around you, ensuring you damage yourself no matter how you place the shot.All in all, a very unbalanced game reliant on XP and grinding."

I am extremely upset I wasted my time and money on a game where it seems no one in charge gives a crap about the experience of any of their players unless they are white, straight males who have no code of ethics.I understand this is not the majority opinion.

The first shellshock game was super fun. My buddy and I played together frequently and obliterated the competition. We were an unstoppable force. We levelled quickly and had a blast. Fast forward to eight years later. Today. The only reason I thought about this honestly was because I saw an update queued and thought ""why the gravy do I still have this installed?"" Are you prepared to grind for good weps? Are you prepared forrulers?Granted, playing with wind is the simple way of weeding out the cheaters from the people who are actually good. Both exist, but when the ruler concept got introduced, I stopped playing much of normal mode and moved to rebound. Rulers don't exist there and there's an exp bonus.But even the exp bonus isn't enough to keep me going anymore. The slog through levels is horrendous, and as many reviews have stated already, the community is toxic. I can't really take it anymore. 100 hours of this and years of my high school career... don't do it. Just don't. It's evolved into a monster. A really scary, grindy, monster."

,Recommended,326460,30611034,Posted: 19 March,all,Bamboy,"Just came back to playing this game after a good 6 month break. Decided to make a review.TL;DR Summary: Fun game but progression is super unbalanced, almost as if the devs intended for a pay-to-progress type system then never did.Pros:Too many weapons to list, and they all have at least one upgraded version.Cons:There are a lot of these, because I like the game enough to see where there could be improvements. I hope the developer(s) will spend the time to read and consider them.Progression is fun but flawed. People make lobbies for farming XP but even that takes a long time to level up and is really boring. (Currently writing this while farming)There are some (But not all!) weapons that are inherently stronger than others, and you can only get access to them by leveling up or buying them.A gear has a chance to drop when someone takes damage. You don't automatically get said gear however. You have to hover over it with your mouse. These gears are effected by explosion forces and can go offscreen before you can collect them. They also fade away after a few seconds. If you're like me and are doing other things in between turns, all it does is make you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥ In my opinion this really does not fit the turn based gameplay.Everything that is purchasable costs at minimum 70 gears, with most things worth buying cost around 200. Things cost too damn much! I've only ever bought two items with my ~24hrs gameplay.You do not gain gears/xp from a game if you leave. Even if you are dead!This is one of the most frustrating things possible about progression.I can understand if you leave a game prematurely, but if you are dead there is no coming back. Zero reason to force you to wait.Annoyances:Little things that would be very easy for the developer to fix.When trying to find a game to join, you frequently get errors joining because the list of lobbies doesn't update unless you tell it to.Having chat open blocks your ability to use arrow keys to aim. This does not close after sending a message."

However, if you are a new player, not a lot of people are going to like you and you will most likely be kicked from the majority of servers you join.Recommendation- Wait until a day where a lot of people would buy this game (sometime like Christmas) so you can level up with people who are also new. Until then you can play a game called shellshock live (hmmm, now where have I heard that name before...)onarmorgames.comand it is basically the same exact thing as this but it is more simple, there are less weapons and less players (come to think about it idk if people are still playing it over there)"

I have yet to encounter almost any bugs at all, and gameplay is very smooth and fun. The huge array of weapons are all fun and exciting to use, and gaining access to ones you normally don't have makes every game feel different and unique. The UI is quite nice and bright. Your tank can be upgraded, both visually and power-wise, and the weapon and level progression makes me want to keep coming back to play.Honestly I would highly recommended this game even at its normal sale price. Not getting this game on sale is honestly insanity.Can't wait for even more updates to make the game even better."

Many years later and this will provide that competitive, fun that's lacks in games these days which this game excels in.The amount of weapons is mind boggling that you have at your disposal, to the point that your thinking ""this is too much"" but then in these type of games, more is certainly better and just adds to the fun you'll get from it especially if you play with friends.I've only played 30min - 1 hour at the time of writing this review but you instantly know if a game is excellent and something you'll go back to (think Rocket league) it's one of those addictive games that will give you hours of gameplay and enjoyment.

I don't think $6-8 is too expensive of a price for something as nice as this (and there is absolutely zero microtransactions as well). Everything in the game is earned through playing, literally tons of unique weapons that can be upgraded and your tank can be upgraded as well.There have been recent popular reviews about people cheating IRL but its not like you have to play with them on the rare occasion you do bump into them, you can just kick them out of the lobby or turn on wind conditions to mess up their accuracy. (Personally I haven't run into enough ""Cheaters"" to say that its much of a problem, and I suspect that some of the supposed ""cheaters"" people have run into are actually just good at the game).

,Recommended,326460,24364542,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Strykers,"Excellent strategic shooting game that harkens back to DOS Shareware classics Desert Tank Wars and Scorched Earth.  With colorful graphics and an impossible number of weapons to unlock, this game is never boring.  It's simple and straightforward, easy to pick up, and just plain fun.Really, my only complaint could very well be an impossible one to address, and that is the curious case of humanity.  In my 48 hours with the game, you either see constructive encouragement in the in-game chat or some of the most abusive, immature comments I've ever read in a chat.  You miss and you're a noob who should have been aborted, or you make a shot and are accused of cheating.  Racism is rampant.  Insults fly easily.  Now, I'm not new to this, but I've honestly never seen such flat hatred and overreactions from players over such a fun and simple game, and it makes me not want to play with other people.  I suppose a filter for the chat could make it more tolerable, but that just makes people more creative in how they insult.  Alternately, I suppose their parents could have hugged them more as children, but I don't think that feature can be added to the game.My only other complaints are somewhat minor, but I'm often wary about developer-centric achievements, especially when linked to unlocks (with all my time in-game, I've not run across Kchamp once).  Just the same, though the game has been addictively fun, I don't think I have the patience nor tolerance to stick around for 10,000 games to gain access to some of the unlockables.  Even at 48 hours of gameplay, I've only played around 200 games.  If I were to even try to play that many games, I'd have to play for around 2,400 hours, and that's just not going to happen.So, despite the sometimes infuriating nature of some players and some frankly unachieveable achievements, I highly recommend this game and just hope that it continues to improve."

ShellShock Live has great graphics, roughly 100 main weapons that each can be leveled/upgraded to have 3 or 4 variants/modes to it. You can level up and spend your skill points into a skill tree of sorts, which upgrades your critical damage, movement speed and ability to go up steep hills, luck so that weapon/item crates have better/more stuff in them, and have better/more armor.ShellShock Live does have a Campaign mode with some basic missions/challenges, and it also has a skirmish mode so that you can set up fights the way you want it.ShellShock Live's Multiplayer is also nice and active, having the expected game modes."

You may (most likely will) end up needing to hope that the ai are not to accurate and end up damaging themselves.The multiplayer is actually quite fun and the community is very friendly (most of the time). Also people don't like ruler users so stay clear of that. other than that, I would reccomend getting a four pack of this game and sharing with your friends or get it if you know people who has/getting this, if you think you'd enjoy what you can see in the trailers."

Those games were some of my childhood favorites I'd play at school, and with this game you can experience that nostalgia again, while also playing with the new and improved physics, new/tweaked weapons, and simple yet challenging maps.As you level up, you gain access to more weapons, upgrades for those weapons, maps, tank customization, tank upgrades (Critical Chance, Mobility, Armor, and Luck Chance), etc. The amount of customization and upgrading really hooked me. In Pocket Tanks, while fun, there was not much more than ""shoot tank, win/lose, rematch"". In this, I feel like I need to unlock every weapon and cosmetic possible, which I enjoy and I'm sure many others will as well.The Devs are constantly updating the game, making sure things are balanced and fixing any bugs which is always a good sight to see.Overall, I give this game a 9/10."

It features hackers and broken skill levels and lobby's that you create or join. This game is also a 1-time transaction featuring no in-game purchases. The game plays very smoothly, but waiting for other players to do the thing where they shoot the things is very boring and takes a lot of time in larger lobbies. Otherwise the game features satisfying sound effects and unlockables that actually change the game. The single player mode is satisfying in a dark souls way.

76561198046351285,Recommended,326460,21238773,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Tye Dye Guy,"This type of game has existed for a very long time now, and many variations of it have come up on every platform.  I've enjoyed every single one thus far, but did eventually get bored of them.This game, however, seems to perfect the long line.  This game has very nice and clean graphics while still being able to run on pretty much every system, it has enough weapon variations to keep one entertained, a sytem to keep players coming, and excellent customization in every area of the game.The game customization and level system are what surprised me the most.  When a player sets up a game, they are able to choose the amount of players, map, game mode (which there are a surprising amount of), health, and other various items.  Then, as one plays the game, they see that they get experience.  Players level up as they play, which not only unlocks new weapons and maps, but allso allows allows the player to upgrade and customize their tank.  A player's tank can be customized to their liking, specializing in four different categories which boost different areas of their vehicle.  This feature pleasantly surprised me the most, and is exactly what keeps players coming back.  Even the weapons a players use upgrade as they use them.  The progression system adds so much to the game, and is a key feature.The in-game chat system is excellent as well, with text bubbles of what a player says appearing above a tank, which can make for some funny conversations.When I first saw the video before I bought the 4-pack I was worried that there would be a weapon or destruction overload.  It appearned that the game would be over in two or three turns with such destructive power, but it turns out that is not the case.  The weapons do get strong, but not game breaking especially due to the option to raise the amount of health that the players can have, which goes up to six times the standard.Overall, this game is much more than I expected, with a good price tag, and lots of content to keep one entertained.  Playing with friends is an absolute must, and even when one can't play with them they can go single player or campaign.  The game feels almost complete and is still developing, and would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have friends to lpay with and/or they enjoyed the Worms series."

Throughout the entirety of the time that I played, the majority of it was spent getting kicked from lobbys and waiting for others to ready up. But the time I truly spent playing the game? Priceless.For a very small fee you can pick up a game with a kind community. Challenging and fun gameplay. And a huge variety of weapons that can be used to your own benefit.FeaturesAfter every level that you grow you recieve a token that can be used to upgrade your tank in 4 main branches.Luck, armor, movement, and damage.If you feel unhappy with your current path you can reset your upgrades once per week and recieve all your tokens that you have spent and build a new path.During the game there are gears that drop from doing damage or opening crates. You can click the gears to collect them which you may then spend in the shop in order to unlock maps, colors, songs, and other customizations.Overall RatingFor this Game I would have to rate it an 7/10 due to the time it takes to save up for items in the shop and the time it takes to get into a game. It can sometimes take 5-10 minutes to get into a game. Especially if you aren't playing with other people you know.Final ThoughtsFor a cheap game it was a good idea and is worth picking up. It however is not a good choice for someone who has limited time to play due to time restraints such as work, school, chores, or appointments.This was the first formal review I have composed."

Bought the 4 pack knowing most of the 3 friends wouldn't play often but having grown up with Worms I enjoy these types of games and Shellshock Live doesn't disappoint.It's sad to see so many XP Farm games created because unlocking weapons takes too much of a grind.Play the single player as much as you can to get leveled up fast and play casually and ignore the weapon grind.

It'll be very familiar to fans of similar 2D strategy games (like Worms) but has enough going for it to make it stand out as its own thing. The campaign is good for those starting out to both learn the game and level up a bit and the online community is really good currently. It also will probably run on any computer and is very affordable at the moment.The only downside is the lack of any kind of handicapping option. It's a bit unfair joining a game filled with player many levels above you who has both better weapons and stronger tanks than yourself, but hopefully the devs will fix this soon enough."

But unfortunately there comes a point where the campaign is based on nothing but pure luck and many of the levels are complete and utter bull****. It comes down to if the AIs move themeselves the right away or accidentally do a lot of damage to eachother. And the last level is completely impossible. By the time I get the final tank down to 3/4 health I'm dead. Its just ridiculously unbalanced. So they need a serious rebalance of the campaign. Very very serious rebalance, however despite that the game is still a lot of fun, especially multiplayer. It takes me back to the days of playing ""Tanks"" online growing up."

Scrolling down a list with no filter trying to find what game is right for you takes way too long and the quick search just doesn't work at all.

While I can see some fun to be had here, the major issue is the ridiculously long ""loading"" times between matches in single player. When you have maybe a 5 second match and 10 seconds to get back into the match you have a problem! Skip the logo and the little tank driving summary between single player matches and I think it would be a more enjoyable experience.The graphics are rough, but adequate. The sound is also adequate for this type of game. There are piles of upgrades and such - like a lot.

,Recommended,326460,25610365,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,Watplr,"So, I got this game because I saw it on the store, and it looked amazing. And a bit of selling things on the Community Market and a few days crying because for a while I was 8 cents away from having the cash to get this (made worse by the fact that I don't even have a job) later, I got it. But is it as good as I was hoping, or was it complete trash (just like me)?Well, spoiler alert, this game is amazing.This game has a huge variety of weapons and weapon upgrades. And they are all useful (except the Shot)! However, some of them might be a bit too good (like the exploding Bounce Shot, which is nearly a direct upgrade to the normal Bounce Shot). Also, some of the weapons are references to other games (like Mad Birds), or are just hillarious (like a Cactus Airstrike or Chicken Fling), and those things are always nice.The gameplay is simple, just move a bit, aim, and fire in either turn based combat or turn based combat where everybody goes at the same time. However, it works really well, even if I suck at aiming.The campaign can be fun, however it is extremely challenging, and can sometimes feel unfair.The game looks amazing, even on low graphics (which is what I use)Overall, this game is amazing, and I would recommend it to anybody who thinks it looks interesting and/or has 7 dollars to spare."

I don't know if it's my internet, if it's where I live (Australia) or if it is just the servers but my connection drops out every few minutes and I cant even be in a multiplayer lobby for longer than 1 minute. I am strongly guessing it is my internet or because I live in australia because the youtubers I watch are mainly based all around America and they seem to have no problems ever. I do highly recommend getting this game whether you have your own friends to play with or not, it has some challenging single player missions and everyones quite friendly as well as competitive when you actually get to play them online. I just wouldn't recommend getting it right now unless you want to disconnect every few minutes like myself. I won't be asking for a refund and I won't just throw this game away I am determined to play it and have fun!!!!!!!! As for now I will just have to wait it out.8/10 (would be a 10/10 but just the connection issues are bugging me atm)"

Leveling up gives a great objective to actually playing, but some people are a very high level and have very advanced weapons making it harder to actually win the battles. Also people are finding ways to cheat using a ""ruler""One thing I like a lot about the game is upgrading the tank and weapons. You can upgrade your tank with leveling points, which you get from leveling up. You can also upgrade your weapons just by using them a lot. But with these ways of upgrading a lot of people are cheating making games that give the most possible xp, but require the least amount of skill to actually play.Overall good game."

Also, as my friend pointed out to me, this is literally just Pocket Tanks. Another thing is as many have mentioned, Multiplayer IS unbalanced as hell, trust me. Now an arguement to that would be that ""You can always play the Campaign!"" The campaign is dreadfully boring, in-fact I decided to do the boss of the first misssions provided and I beat it easily by simply MOVING, since he only shot in one area. My final problems with it are the fact that getting anything with ""Gold Gears"" would take forever, and the fact that this game is not at all like it advertised to be, all those trailer weapons that look amazing? Better level to 40.TLDR: Good game for people who don't mind grinding, but not a fun experience for new players."
,Recommended,326460,21627052,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Liammagoo,"Oh look, I did a review.This is a game that's only worth it if you actually bother to spend the time to learn and improve in it. You know, like most games. You would not beat this in a day, or a month, or probably a year if you don't play THAT often. The road to level 100 is a long and winding road, even if the xp requirements were reduced.Pros:A reasonable amount of players to keep the game flowing.Missions that WILL boost you up past the first 30+ levels if you complete them all before the main game, allowing you to get a head start.No IAP, everything's free if you take the effort to make it that way.The graphics are beautiful to look at, even on low quality.Cons:The grind!Extreme learning curve at the beginning, especially with working out what each weapon does and how to use them.Rather imbalanced community, if you don't work on those said missions to boost your level, you're not gonna find many low levelled people.Overall, it's a great game. Definitely get it if you enjoyed the worms series, and if you're unsure, go try the free online versions before you give this a shot."

The only things ShellShock live does better is a much larger arsenal and higher-end graphics/music.You will, perhaps, be more than a bit upset that you can't set up matches with friends AND bots.You also cannot select what weapons you want to bring with you. As of the last time I played, every gamemode randomizes your arsenal selection for each match, only making it more difficult to level up your favorites.You also cannot change your Tank color. It's all red or green, and the variety of tank styles is lacking, currently.Perhaps most heartbreaking of all, you can't play around with physics such as wind, dirt suspension, and most importantly: wall types. The inability to set my games to wrap-around or bouncing walls forever haunts me...Still, there's fun to be had on the utterly mad variety of available weapons. My favorites by far are the Snake and Sinkhole shots, followed by diggers, builders, and dead weight!The firing range is the best game mode."
,Not Recommended,326460,28748626,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,TotallyNotTobbe,"Just like the game you played when you were younger, except there's a crapton of weapons to choose from now. The weapons are really fun (those I had access to at least) and it was fun to get and try out new weapons.But I can't recommend ShellShock Live because of the problems with matchmaking, and the arsenal of the bots to some degree. The problem with matchmaking is that there is no matchmaking. You can try and quick join a server, but then most of the time you will get an issue like ""Lobby is full"", ""Game is already in progress"", or you simply get kicked out. There are also plenty of gamemodes to choose from, but you have to actively search for a lobby with that gamemode. I can't recommend this until there is proper matchmaking.The reason I say the arsenal of the bots is a problem is because of apparent power of their arsenal. I loaded up a tutorial level of some kind where I'm fighting two bots. I miss my shot, which was a pretty standard shot, and then the bots shower me with a hailstorm of grenades, including a grenade bigger than my tank. Of course, I died. I played on after that (for a while), but others would be frustrated that they get killed instantly on the first few levels of the game."

Its good to see the game grow with its community, I can find the game type I want almost any time I look for. Weapons, progress and shop system all are great with a wide range, you can spend a lot building things for your tank. The visuals are sweet, every shot a tank fires will look cool especially when the battlefield is large with many tanks. The soudtracks are cool too. There's a good range of track and also victory tunes you can set among other things. Another thing I like is there is no micro-transactions anymore (like there was in the browser version). I recommend it to anyone looking for a casual action game that is unique."

However all missions can be completed with ease if you are level 80+.Note--This game is full of little children-This game is like CSGO. However there are Germans instead or Russians-To get get good items you need to gamble (Just like CSGO)-If you hit a shot perfectly you get called a hacker (Just like CSGO)So basically its CSGO but you are a 2D tank.10/10

The game offers multiple mods & settings to customize each of your games depending on your (and your friends) skill level, as well as giving extra Rewards for hard settings (which I absolutely love).The design is perfect, however, the grind for exp & gears is real, and it will take you a looong time till you reach one of the higher levels, even if you use the settings that awards the most Exp.Cons: The max you can go for 1v1 games is only x3.64 exp.

This is an improvement upon my first experience with 2d tank shooter games, ishoot on the iphone. It has upgrades for your tank and weapons for anyone tht likes that kind of stuff. Instead of matchmaking it has servers (which can be a pain) but the host has control. A large variety of upgradable weapons and special items along with multiple gamemodes and bumpers that affect one's shot. These are all the great aspects. I haven't played much, but it's pretty cool."

The game is a load of fun with friends, there are countless weapons, quite a few different game modes to choose from and the best part? It's cheap and doesn't take much to run it, therefore i say it's well worth the price.If you want a game that is relaxed yet competitive to play while taking a break from other games, then you should buy this game the first chance you get.

I remember playing Tank on the web browser with my friends but this game adds so many different aspects compared to the free original.PROS-There is so much to explore and do in this game. You have a nice levelling up system where you level up your weapons to get a higher powered version of the weapon and every time you level up you have an upgrade tree where you can upgrade your Speed, Health/armour, damage and luck.-There are many game modes and maps to play on with friends or without either way is fun and can be challenging-Has a store where you can buy things from and when I say things I don't even know since I haven't been there yet. lol.-There are SO MANY different types of weapons on the game that have their own unique ability and you can potentially get overpowered weapons from getting supply boxes that drop from the sky. Weapons range from peer point accuracy to a ♥♥♥♥ed up barrage and radius to rapid firing machine guns and to strategic weapons as the building or digger to make a mountain or plunge your enemy into a sink hold so you can shoot at them in the hole with pin point accuracy or as I like to do it call an air strike or chuck a grenade in the hole. There are weapons that bounce everywhere and so on. There are just too many.-Has some sort of customisation with tanks-Great classic game mechanics combined with modern day ones to keep you entertained for a long time.-Has ACTUALLY GOOD MATCHMAKING IF YOU WANT. You can make a game where only a certain ranged of levels can join you or if you want to get ♥♥♥♥ed you're allowed to join higher levelled ones.-You can have 8382 ping and play this game fine as it's turn based-many different game customisation just like adding more health and changing how l Ng the turns last for.-hecktic battles with explosions bullets and death flying everywhere if you have a big battle 3v3 and up-quite a lot of replay value-community is goodCONS-Honestly this could be considered game breaking. The spawns. The spawns almost decide who is going to win the game on not and can be extremely annoying as you can have the hill or height advantage as some weapons tend to bounce away from the target and go down hill.-Has customisation but not a great one. You just get to change the look of the base and head of the tank pretty much. There should be colours, strips and accessories involved or even having 2 turrets kind of like that tank.Io game but if so it's got to have a lot of consideration and thinking into it has it could break the game for tanks being op.-The aiming can be pretty off point as in you can only aim in certain directions if you catch my drift. Just think of it has a clock, it ticks to the next second every time but the clock doesn't stop in between the second. So you might not be able to hit an enemy like it has happened to me a few times.Overall good game 8/10"

Can be fun solo I would imagine, but the experience is amplified x10 when playing with friends. It's a turn-based strategic tank arena game. Really simple concept for a seemingly simple game. Once you play your first rounds though, you'll realize just how complex it can become. With new ""shots"" (think of them as abilities) comes different requirements on your power/trajectory, which impact how accurately your attack will hit an opponent. Up to 4v4 on matchmaking, has dedicated servers. Decent soundtrack as well if you're into that kind of thing. Seriously, don't skip out on this. I know it isn't a blockbuster title, but if you're looking for a bargain-bin game to play for your friends, this game is a must-buy. I normally sleep on arcade style games such as this, but boy am I glad that I didn't with this one. Give this one a go if you're considering it."

I'm really happy to see that they have brought it back and made it more modern. With tons of new weapons, maps, modes, and challenges to complete, this game certainly does keep me entertained when I play it.However...* I would like to point out that this game maybe really grindy for you. To level up a weapon, you are forced to go to multiplayer when you have gotten as far as you can on singleplayer. Really don't like the fact that they had to force you to go to multiplayer when you can't complete anymore singleplayer campaigns.* Another thing about the single player campaigns is that they will be irritating. You will come across some campaigns that  might seem impossible. They are impossible, UNLESS you head over to the multiplayer and level up more to get better gear and loadouts to complete the campaigns.This game is great. I'll say that multiple times because it looks and feels great to play. I just hope that the problems above could be addressed to some people before purchasing the game. All cons aside, I definitly would have paid this game myself because I do support the company that is developing this game."

There are many weapons you can use against your enemies and levels all the way up to 100. You can have up to 8 players in a lobby and play tornys too. In all, This game was worth the $5.00."

,Not Recommended,326460,29952098,Posted: 15 February,all,WAKHAKA,"I enjoy ShellShock Live, I find grinding for achievements, and XP for upgrading weapons fun (most of the time), but there is one problem that is specifically with the players in-game. Whenever I play high amounts of games consecutively, I usually encounter players who are very rude, and who have a tendency to lash out at you. One such example is when you use the Shield item, they always insult you by calling you vulgar names for doing stuff they find unfair. Then there are the players who kick you from the server for multiple reasons, either you beat them too many times, or you commit suicide on top of them [server host]. Another issue I have with players inside the game is that they have a tendency to be verbally vulgar in general, even with the profanity filter enabled, for me at least I can read what they have written despite the word[s] being censored. My final issue with the players in-game is that there are ways to bypass the profanity filter (by combining their swearing into non existent words (e.g. dumbf***). I do still enjoy playing the game, for reasons I will explain.I have fun playing ShellShock Live for a couple of reasons. The bigger reason is that the game is a grinding session, which is what I enjoy doing. Grinding for achievements and Weapon XP to upgrade them takes up the large amount of spare time I have, and using this spare time to improve my arsenal, and aim is fun and takes me out of the boring life I have which is fine with me even though I could probably do more productive things, that might also be fun. I do still have a problem with the players I encounter but I will now give you my conclusion.I do not recommend this game if you are tolerant to rude people, as well as vulgar messages you’ll see. If you aren’t able to read these messages and not lash out at the person who is being this way then I recommend it."

I downloading this game as my first game on steam and i still enjoy it now. Please do not be discouraged by my time spent on this as I have to go to school so i don'y play it every waking hour i have. To start off it is really fun and it gets progressively harder as you go on. At the time of writing this i am level 58 and love this game. You can play with your friends or random people. If you are playing online and your internet freezes, then you can just play the campaign, it is really fun and challenging at the same time, for example, i beat an AI with 300 health and it was level 60 when i had 200 health and level 52, i am quite far ahead in the caimpaign and it is worth trying because for every chapter you complete, you get a new weapon. There are alot of different challenges to complete whick also award you with weapons. You can upgrade them in XP farms ro through normal gameplay. Join other peoples XP lobbies called 'XP farm' or 'every1 go mid' or something along the line of this. go to the middle of the map and shott staight up so as to maximise the speed that your weapons level up at. The shop is also very vastwith differnt weapons, maps,customizations and theme colours for sale. Every time you level up you get a tank upgrade token You can spend these in 4 different ways. I have spent all the tokens possible on tracks and luck and i win alot of games, so i highly recommend that. There are alot of different ways you can customize your tank aswell. I discovered shellshock live through YouTube. The YouTuber i watched was called ASFJerome, some other people he plays shelshock with are:Tewtiy,AlexirCraft(Alex),Ben-FrizzleNPop,MiniiDear(Deisha) and Bladehell(Blade), i highly recommend you check them out."

The community's slightly toxic, but you're on Steam, so that shouldn't come as any surprise, but it certainly hits you from the get-go since there's a public chat room on the main menu and the profanity filter is off by default.There IS a single player campaign, but you have to be online to get to it anyway, so it seems to be more the thing that people do for the unlockables rather than the gameplay, which seems kind of silly as a design choice.The mechanics are simple and intuitive, the weapons are too (for the most part), there's plenty of unlockables.There's also a level up system that I cannot for the life of me figure out why it's here but to stagger weapon unlocks, which I suppose is an okay way of doing things, but there's a huge achievement list that also gets used to unlock weapons and maps, and it really just makes me wonder why that wasn't expanded instead of trying to have it both ways.All in all, decent game."

Its hard to get myself to play it but when I do, I always have a blast (Get it?) running around and blowing all these tanks up! And the leveling system is nice and balanced, it truly is a great game! I have a friend who I thought would really like this game. I told them about it and now they play it all the time. Great game. 10/10 jk maybe not that much but... 10/10."

76561198350497987,Recommended,326460,31383819,Posted: 26 April,all,ArchangelElementum,"It is a fantastic game with a lot to do (unlocking weapons getting to max level all the trophies ect ect)  and if you have friends who play this game then you will have a blast and some hilarious derp moments, plus the music is great :P. This game does have flaws though, first the grinding can get rather tedious and the best way is to spend 25 minutes in a game of rebound which gets tedious, second is no balancing but this is fixed cause you are told your opponets are of a much higher level than you, and finally, leveling up weapons gets annoying. However it doesn't stop me from having a fantastic time with friends and if you want a game with tanks and over the top weapons, try this game."
