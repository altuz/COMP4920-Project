However it has many errors where no matter what you choose you end up in the same place. If you kill someone it plays out as if you just knock them out. It forces you down a singular path and some of the romances are impossible to get. no matter what you do some of the romances end very... badly and no matter what you do or how many times you run through it choosing different options it turns out the same. Honestly it promises more than it actually offers. I mean the game will actually crash if you choose the ""wrong"" answer. In other words it's not really worth the money. Sorry."

I counted at least five typos in the game text, near the end I got a ren'py error screen, and I got good-ending-with-utsuro instead of good-ending-with-hikari like I should have.It's a bit too obvious to me what the 'correct' choices at various points are. The art and music, while not BAD, is not spectacular. The game is rather short, and I didn't like it enough to go try for more than one route.The whole thing smells half-baked. I noticed in the community stream that the devs pushed forward the release date significantly. Perhaps they should have taken the time to FINISH and TEST it first?That said, the overall atmosphere is good. Assassin of justice infiltrating a high school? It just sounds cool.I would unbuy it if I could, or at least unbuy it until some of these typos and errors are gone, but if you like this style of VN's (otome) this might still be for you."

Kudos it's a amazing song and overall the game has some really good music that fit the situations nicely.Tilley is pretty much a standard jackass to fans of his ""games"". While I feel like Sword of Asumi could have been great if someone else made it from Tilley's personality and obvious lack of care it will never ever be.Due to his shady tactics and lies I would recommend passing this up and supporting other indie VN's that seem to actually really try because Tilley basicially grabs the money and runs and puts so little effort forth. I don't feel the worth of giving this game a deep review like I have other VN's because A.J. Tilley didn't care enough when making it and it's shows it really does some of the endings just happen seriously it's like he forgot to keep writing and just decided to end it you get a total of two sentnces for each ending. The relationships also feel mostly hollow and shortlived. .I recommend the soundtrack though as it was really good and some of the art was pleasing to the eyes and I feel kind of bad (only because other people put work in) for not recommmending this despite the work of other people involved but Tilley just so obviously doesn't put the effort into anything but everyone else did. A.J. Tilley obviously took pointers from Mighty No.9's starting multiple kickstarters for sequels and other projects before finishing and releasing any games and guess what happens. He gets the goal or near goal he asks and bam! the game is cancelled."

76561198032329425,Not Recommended,326950,13982611,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,hidenscryptorium,"Right. I am probably approaching this game from the wrong angle, but I was lured into my expectations.First of all the preview and the intro lead me to believe it is going to be terrorist-hunting, secret plot-uncovering, ""Tinker, tailor..."" kind of a story. Well, it's not. In fairness there is a terrorist, but our ""Strong, Deadly, Female Protagonist"" spends very little time looking for hir. Instead she is visiting pools, cosplays and blushes when anyone talks to her. She kills people for living, for heaven's sake, how can she be that shy? Long story short: it's a date sim with teeny-bit of a murder built in. The game does not even give us an opportunity NOT to try to start any relationship at the end.Speaking of short stories: this one is extremely abrupt. It does feel fast-paced, especially if you consider the number of characters it introduces. The steadier development of a plot would have allowed the intrigue to unveil, but no, we have to deal two-week deadline and hence, the” brilliant” conclusions like “Orochi would choose to attend fighting classes, so this non-fighting chap is definitely innocent”. Are you willing to bet the Edo citizen’s lives on this, Asumi? How old are you?!By the way… how old is she exactly? All kinds of frisky lingerie she is wearing would rather suit a woman than a schoolgirl, and yet our heroin blends in the Academy perfectly, age-wise.Granted, I might be harsh here, due to being caught off-guard. My limited experience of this genre consisted of “Long Live the Queen” and “Analogue: hate story”, both of which were brutal, dark and involving. So this wacky nonsense didn’t live up to the expectations.All in all: if you are looking for an interesting plot, character’s development and a food for thoughts do keep looking somewhere else. If you are in for a teen romcom… still choose something different, because “Sword of Asumi” does not deliver on this field either.P. S.To be just: the soundtrack is really worthy of being sold separately. This song is magnificent."

,Not Recommended,326950,17550701,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,ZachTheGuy,"I should've written this review a loooong time ago....Product: Sword of AsumiReview Date: 8-15-2015Reccomendation: NoIntroduction: Sword of Asumi is a ten dollar visual novel that is barely worth 4 dollars, it's characters are stale the writing is lifeless, cleshe, and lazy and the pandoring is at the level as to which I am annoyed by it. Though that's not enough to save you your ten dollars is it? You still want to buy it right now.... well let me get more in depth with you this is the introduction after all.Gameplay: Sword of Asumi plays like your regular visual novel you read and occasionally make decisions that will effect you're outcome of the story. It's the same old same old with no other gameplay mechanic. Now yes the decisions do effect your outcome and if you make some ""bad"" decisions the game will play out it a different way. However in Sword of Asumi's case the game never really plays out too differently overall. There is a BIT of replay value but nothing spectacular. Now my BIG problem with Sword of Asumi's gameplay is it is SHORT! This game was originally what, like 15 dollars? The game doesn't really last longer than an hour or two. It's a bit ridiculous honestly. Though I can't really complain about the decisions too much the amount of gameplay you will be getting is kind of pathetic.Story: Well ok, the story begins as you, Asumi, a member of an order of warriors named the Justicars and you infiltrate an estate to assasinate the owner. You get a quick peak at some decisions as you go through with your mission regardless. Then after that Kami, a fellow Justicar, aproaches you and congratulates you on a mission success while also briefing you on a new one. A rebel group called ""Orochi"" deadset on overthrowing the government has been tracked by Kami, and the rest of the higher up Justicars for some time, and Kami has now found a new lead on one of their members codenamed ""Raven"" who is residing at the prestigious school ""Battle Academy"" so as a test of sorts to see if Asumi will be let into the higher ranks of the justicars, Kami sends Asumi into the school disguised as a first year student to stop Raven by killing them. (Why would you risk a lead this big on someone who isn't even an expert in your order, I know she's young enough for the role but there HAS to be SOMEBODY else!) So you then go to the school, meet the love interests and then set about on your mission. The story isn't horrible it's just very cliche and to be honest with not a lot of surprises. It's pretty bland to me. Along with that it's very rushed in it's delivery before you know it you're at the end of the line, as such you can't be as invested as you should be because suddenly the game is just over. However I'll give it this Asumi is always trying to accomplish her goal it's not like it's a bunch of filler with an occasional spout of progress. Though still, the story is very short, cliche, and rushed in it's delivery it's not very well thought out. The dialogue feels non-emotional and rushed as well it feels like they have a big checklist in front of them all the time checking off everything they need to make a quick buck.Characters: THEY ARE ALL BLAND AND CLICHE! Nothing much more to say, other than they all have fanservice dedicated to them in several sections. You have the pretty shopping lightheaded-esque girl who is also bisexual, you have the smart one who likes to read and loves poetry etc. etc. you can tell that none of these characters took any thought into creating. The main villain was incredibly obvious, at least for me, and they're just not that interesting. You can tell the guy who made this literally spent the shortest ammount of time he could on these characters.Romance: It's very quick and really isn't too believable for me. It just happens a little too fast and well it's just very bland and uncreative the situations you are put in don't really have that much creativity put into them they're just not very well written romances.Setting: The game takes place in ""Battle Academy"" a big school, yada yada yada. While I have seen school settings done SOOO many times before this one is still an ok setting I suppose but they don't show you enough of the school for you to truly appreciate that, part of that DEFINITELY has to do with the story's sense of rapid fire pacing.Art: The art is ok, nothing really ugly about it...... EXCEPT THERE IS A♥♥♥♥♥♥TON OF FANSERVICE!!! The amount of times Asumi undresses is astonishing to me because it happens so often, not only does it get repetitive and its something they could've replace with scenes to make the story longer, but it's awkward and idiotic to see them pandor like this. On top of that it's not even just Asumi, the girls are drawn like they have a bunch of breast implants and the guys are ♥♥♥♥ing muscular as all hell. This is pandoring at it's near worst. On top of that no one receives character art besides the love interests and villains. The only exceptions to this are Kami and some twins. WHY YOU HAD SO MUCH MONEY WHY DID YOU NOT JUST DRAW MORE CHARACTERS UP!Summary: Sword of Asumi had a kickstarter that raised them MORE than enough money to make a visual novel with decent length, unique/interesting characters and a lot of good art. They did not use that potential. Instead they made a boring, unsurprising, uncreative, pandoring, rushed, cheap, immination of what visual novels should be. It's sort of a scandal really. The people who made this game, AJTilley has a habbit of this, Beach Bounce was TERRIBLE and their other visual novels have the same syndrome. THEY ARE ALL RUSHED WITH NO CREATIVITY WITH FORCED DIALOGUE AND ROMANCE! DO NOT buy this game save your money. If you REALLY want a visual novel, well to be honest I reccomend Everlasting Summer, it's free and has more substance than this quick waste of your money and time."
,Recommended,326950,14954899,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,nin,"It's decent but I would recommend getting it on a sale, along with the accompying graphic novel.Story:The basic story line is interesting if barebones. Still, being an assassin is fun, even if there is a lot of socializing and SOL action between the assassin antics. The story itself does not change much no matter who you decide to romance, which diminishes replay value; in fact, the canonical ending has you romance no one. In addition, it's pretty much the set up for the graphic novel with the much more interesting story, which is why I recommended to buy that specifically with this VN.Characters:The romancable characters are all surprisingly moe, even the guys (no homo). In particular, Hikari radiates moe from every pore of his body (no homo, totally). In any case, I enjoyed the interactions between Asumi and the romantic interests; seeing how Asumi interacts with them makes the game replayable even if almost all of the overarching plot remains the same no matter what. A shame that none of the romanceable characters appear in the graphic novel story at all.Art:The sprite art is pretty good, and the CG art isn't necessarily bad, but there is a jarring inconsistency between the CG art and sprite art. Personally, that bothers me more than consistently bad art.In conclusion, if you're bored and this is on a sale, this will alleviate your boredom a bit. It's not spectacular, but it's somewhat enjoyable."

Asumi is made fun of for being lacking in certain assets (flat chested) but even she has easily c cup.

You are on a mission as an assassin and have multiple options as romance and others are concerned. The game makes you go into a scene of stealth, trickery, and school. You got your new mission and along the way take classes in order to find out more about Orochi.This game was good in my opinion. Not Voiced Acted but the music was nice. The story had some nice portrayals of character. The fun minigame and choices of what to take, with there also being the romance options of both girl and boy. You end up taking the routes and you can lose if you didn't choose some in a right order. The Cg is decent and I love how the creator has her changing clothes each day and the usual hitting part. The school seems like more of a college experience to be honest but it has great use of appeal.If you are to wanting to know if to get the game. I recommend it. It fills the time, make you think and is enjoyable. Also the backdrop of history does appeal in the minigames. Nonetheless I believe there should be more routes. However this game was in it's own very well done. 8.8/10. Reason? Well although there was a decent story, there was not a long build up, not a lot of ""scenario builds"" between some. However the setting seems like it could have gone for more and in with that had a little more. However it is a good game nonetheless. There could have been more CG scenes of appeal though. I digress but the game has it's finer moments. I did enjoy it and recommend it."

On the plus side, it does have a catchy opening theme, decent illusion of choice and four romantic options that are not completely parallel to one another(!). It advertises a multitude of endings but a couple of the achievements are quite unlikely unless you go out of your way to be stupid.Compared to the competition, it has quite a limited CG gallery as most of the eye candy comes from the character sprites, with romance option Kaori being a cosplay otaku and protagonist Asumi in particular being quite the lingerie fiend. However, there isn't much fanservice to be had from the character-featuring CGs found in the gallery.At this price, I'd say wait for a sale but don't overlook it if you're into VNs.If you do get this game, incidentally, you are offered DLC for the soundtrack, a graphic novel and a ""character creator"". The Character Creator is a flat out no - not only is it unpolished (underwear appearing over pants) but it lacks the best lingerie offered in the game itself which is, arguably, the entire point. The soundtrack is purchaseable if you want to support them on the basis of the opening theme alone, as none of the other tracks are worth writing home about. The graphic novel is a reasonable production for the price and could be worth considering if you want to see glimpses of Asumi, Lingerie Fiend of Edo's adventures in her world, but their artist for it lacks experience with action scenes, non-chibi expressions and poses, which pretty much tanks the whole book."

BUT I have to say that the Character Creator is meaningless, cause you can't use your own creation ingame, just watch and hide from your imaginary wife or whatever.The idea behind the game is very interesting, but the realization too simple. People say that the gameplay isn't the best. There is hardly any kind of character development and some decisions you have to make appear unrealistic. The last three points are sh t. Some claim this.

Asumi is sent to Battle Academy in a mission to find a dangerous terrorist named Raven while disguised as a normal student.The game has everything to be a great game. But sadly, the second Asumi steps onto campus, the terrorism plotline is shoved into the background and instead you'll start playing a date sim game where most of your choices won't matter until near the end of the game.Most of the characters also lack a good background story, being like empty shells. That being said, even though the game is kind of mediocre, you can still have a bit of fun with it. There're a plenty of endings, options (although most of them won't influence the ending you'll get) and romanceable characters. It can be a fun game if you aren't very picky with Visual Novels.

To start with, it posits that the Shogunate continued into the modern era, thus the Meiji reforms never happened, and Japan did not open itself to the west... and somehow managed not to be made a colony of one of the European powers. In the 21st century a reform was put into place opening the ranks of the Justicars to the Black Clan, a family of samurai who were taught... less than honorable means of combat (in other words, ninjutsu).Asumi is a Black Clan-trained warrior who has been inducted into the Justicars and is in a place she is unsure of: the open. Worse there is a conspiracy afoot by a group called the Orochi, who wish to return the Emperor to prominence. And one of the cells seems to be based at this very academy.In the game, there are many paths. Several end badly, with your death, or the death of someone innocent (perhaps both). But choose correctly and you can end up falling in love and continuing onwards with them at your side. (The two relationships with women would likely be overlooked as not dangerous, and as for the ones with men... well, you become a hero, so any children would be blessed, right?)"

,Recommended,326950,23562858,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,ArtemisHunt,"Alright, so I've been badge collecting and with most badges, I seem to get a discount coupon (If you pronounce it Q-pon I may have to stab you) upon completion. I bought this game off of one of those. It came out to like $2 and I figured, why not. So let's talk about the game.You play (surprisingly) Asumi. A young female assassin with big dreams of enforcing peace... by force. You start the game with an assassination and after completion you are tasked with another one to stop a terrorist threat. The codename of this individual is Raven. But your boss doesn't know the identity of Raven, but they do know Raven is at this school. So you are tasked with infiltrating the school, discovering Raven, and killing them.As you progress through your classes, go to parties, hang out with friends, you pick up intel on the identity of Raven. You can opt to find love along the way, and I like that your character Asumi can be straight or gay. It's kind of refreshing to be able to court both men and women in these sorts of games. I feel like it allows the creator to be more open about the paths that the story can take, and create better characters. Not to say that the characters in this game are great. They're cookie-cutter. But I think they can be more endearing since best friend girl can be more than best friend girl and socially awkward guy can be more than socially awkward guy. I dunno, maybe it's getting to have your cake and eat it too. Oh, and while we're here, I should mention that there are no explicit pictures. (Sorry-not-Sorry)The visual novel plays out the way most visual novels do. You're presented with choices along the way, pick an option, hope you don't die. So let's talk about the story. You may have noticed that at the outset, I mentioned that it was about an assassin. Perhaps that was premature. The story is supposed to be about Asumi undergoing espionage activities to discover Raven. What it turns into is a series of classes and dates, and only... I think 3? actual scenes that I would consider espionage related. Oh, sure, the dating and stuff is 'intelligence gathering' but I was looking for a more harrowing tale. The characters fit their moulds too nicely, and very rarely stray from them. They're still likable, but they're not terribly interesting. I feel like only one character other than Asumi was designed with a story in mind, and their story is rather lame too. But I feel like I might like theirs more... I wonder if the creators have a novel for them. (Doot-dadoo-dadoot) No, they don't. Probably wasn't terribly interesting anyway.The novel is a quick read and easy to retrace. I didn't bother to get all of the endings because I believe there are only two or three ""legitimate"" endings, and the others are just romance endings. Legitimate endings with a different love interest. Not terribly interested in all of that. It gets a pass though. I liked it enough to finish it. Probably because it's so short and because of its theme. So I'm not sure if that's a point in the game's favor or not. It's not terribly fulfilling to me as an individual and I don't think that's because I'm bereft of emotions. To the Moon (Yes, I will keep harping on this game like an angel with Parkinson's) was an emotional tale and it got me to cry. In fact, it might be because this game isn't terribly fulfilling with emotions. Everything seems to happen so fast. Maybe if the game took its time and focused on two character love interests it might have gotten a better shake at things. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Thank you for reading."

That and ability to kill in the intro basically grabbed my attention and didn't let go untill my first good ending #5 arrived :)Bottom line - very enjoyable visual novel, sadly doesn't look like sequel will be a thing :( Which is sad, because it would not be connected to any school setting and be a big story with vigilante and actual assassinations.

That being said, there's a nitpick that I feel I have to complain about in spoiler tags; not deal breaking, but enough to cause me some annoyance. I'll try to be vauge about it since this is technically a mystery game in a way, but there will inevitably be clues leaking out, so if you like a good mystery, keep that in mind.Did they seriously not expect me to know who the villain was? The game must assume this person has an airtight alibi or something and gave me a bad end for clearly not thinking through my choice enough. The culprit asks me, ""How did you even arrive at that conclusion? XXXXX was being set up as the suspicious one."" Yet I barely even met that person in my entire run! There was maybe one hint in the entire game implicating them. Meanwhile, the true culprit had horrible responses to my questions, was the only one who didn't happen to make any side comment providing them with a plausible excuse, and never showed up in any of the ""choose your favorite character to hang out with"" choices. I realize that last statement is metagaming on my part, but if all of this doesn't make you suspect the correct person, then I don't know what will. Not to mention that if you really were suspicious of the scapegoat due to ending up making the game choices that don't give you many clues, there's a choice near the end that let's you pry them for more information a few scenes before you have to choose who to kill. If you choose this person, they will provide an incredibly damning statement that makes it nearly impossible to mistake who the true culprit is. So I guess in order to not die horribly, Asumi has to have a stroke at the end of the game and forget about the obvious culprit and take out the scapegoat first."

Also, the way physics are entirely ignored when it comes to boobs. Everything the girls wear clings to them like plastic wrap, not stretching across the chest like shirts tend to do. Also, Asumi tends to only own FULL ON LINGERIE. THAT WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN SHE PUTS ON REGULAR CLOTHES? like, I'm sorry but I've never known super ruffly bras to just lie flat under a school uniform, or for garters to meld into the skin when also donning said uniform. Perhaps that is just the wonder of the plastic wrap clothing, however.I would like the game to be longer in order for the characters to stand out to me more, as well. You get to know Asumi, even through her sometimes bungling ways, but the other characters come and go so quickly that I was often mixing them up, or not remembering their name. Also, at one point there were so many characters talking that Hikari was not shown, even when he was talking, which again, threw me off.I was not a huge fan of the true ending, because it all seemed a little thrown together for no actual reason. (Not trying to spoil anything, but it kind of all fell into and out of place to make their visual novel DLC work)Speaking of their DLC, I did also purchase that, and it is much of the same cliche's times two, so if you had fun laughing as you played this, I suggest it, but if it made you frustrated steer clear. That also suffers from a bloated cast who get very little screen time so you don't actually grow very attached to them. other than Asumi and Kami who travel over from the game.On another note, my game isn't fully functioning correctly either, but I tried not to let that cover my review. I unlocked the true ending acheivement by playing through the Mineko true love ending ... so I cannot get that acheivement. I even played through the true ending end again but I receive the same ending. If you are someone who likes to get all the acheivements, this does not seem to be happening to anyone else.

However, while it\'s nearly-always clear that there\'s a story in there worth telling, the writing falls really really flat every so often, and it\'s not uncommon for the proofreading to fail in ways both painful and hilarious.The one big disappointment, though, was that I was actually punished for being right at the end, rather than going for what I\'m sure was supposed to be the obvious choice. But then again, I think I went for the \""obvious\"" route LAST, and that one actually leads you by the nose through the ending.
