Graphics is gorgeous, weapons are well-balanced, controls are perfect like they were in good old times. Crafting system was also a good idea. My only sorrow is that you can't set a ""Shopping Mode"" scheme, in which you start with no weapons and unlimited jetpack, and you have to collect all weapons yourself. (Crate drops are limited, in Clan Wars/Battlegrounds there could be three per round, now it's only one.)"

The new tanks, turrets, choppers, and mechs (oh my!) add an amazing new aspect to this beloved classic. Multiplayer is great with new 1v1 ranked matchmaking. The current DLC (and more to come) really adds to the fun. It truly might be the perfect Worms game, taking all of the great aspects from the old games and adding new features that really are icing on the cake.Now for my story...I was raised on Worms, I've played since the Dreamcast days back in '99 (Armageddon) and honestly it is one of my favorite videogame franchises of all time. Worms has always had the amazing ability to satisfy the hardcore and casual gamers alike. I can't count the number of times I've introduced it to people (who have suprisingly never played) and their first impression is always ""This is weird"". But after the first match they are hooked! This feeling for me never gets old, spreading the magic and wonder of Worms and after all these years the lil' guys still got it!Thanks Team17 for all the memories and for staying true to your roots. I can't wait to see what more is in store for W.M.D.EDIT: Currently pretty buggy (terrain not loading fully, weapons glitching, lots of crashing on multiplayer, etc) at least for me. Also, multiplayer quickmatch lobby is a little messy- everytime a player enters or leaves it 'unreadies' you so you are constantly hitting the READY button (which is almost a like a game in itself!)All easily fixable stuff in an otherwise great new installment in the wonderful World of Worms!

It will be much shorter because I only want to let you know that this is BY FAR the best Worms game released since the 2001. Thats 15 ♥♥♥♥ing years !!I've played a few dozen hours, and I've seen enough to justify a review. I'm a Worms veteran, I've played every single worms game ever released on PC, starting with the very first one. The best Worms game ever created was Worms World Party in my personal opinion because it was Worms Armageddon enhanced (though Worms Armageddon was nearly identical in terms of quality).Well, after playing Worms W.M.D for a few dozen hours I'm pretty sure it might be the best Worms game I've ever played !!It's incredible in every single thinkable aspect, exept the amount of content (and maybe the price). The graphics, the soundtrack and mixing is incredible. The game is full of tiny details nearly everywhere. Everything else around the superb gameplay is amazing and especially the gameplay is true perfection.Within the last 15 years the devs produced only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games. Lets face it, even the best Worms game was total♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to WWP/WA.Worms W.M.D completely changed that. The devs took the physics engine from WA (yeah the original one so that the game feels like WA) and build a new shinny game around that. Best decision ever from Team17 :)Gameplaywise Worms W.M.D feels and plays perfect !!! Just as great as WWP/WA felt and played back then.The only downside is that the game slightely lacks content as in it doesn't have as much customization as other (horrible to medicore) Worms games from recent years. But its pretty clear that the devs focused this game on making it as close as possible to WWP/WA and they succeeded completely in this regard. Furthermore the price is pretty high considering the amount of content, BUT in my personal opinion you are paying this price for gameplay perfection and hopefully a great post-release support with free dlc's.Btw. All those blinded Worms Armageddon fanboys will obviously rate this game down because well, because its NOT WA. Don't trust them, they will never rate another worms game up unless its WA remastered... -.-This Worms game here is as good as it gets !! Everyone who is even remotely interested in Worms should appreciate that instead of ♥♥♥♥♥ing around about tiny inconsistencies ;)I would rate Worms W.M.D. at around88-89%"
,Recommended,327030,25178940,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,rgk,"If you have never been near a Worms before, all you need to know is that it is a single and multi-player (local + online) turn-based strategy game in which teams of funny little Worms try to murder each other with a vast arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons, and the destructible background reflects the violence taking place on its surface while adding new layers of possibilities. And failure can be hilarious.I have fond memories of the Worms series since 1995. There has been a peak in 1999 with Worms Armageddon, and since then it has been a bumpy road that timidly tried new things here and there but never a solid offering with all the features that are expected to be present.  The potential of the series was diluted by entries that thought they were trying some new things while constantly dropping the good stuff from the previous episodes. Strangely, overall no real progress was made and more was lost than gained.Worms W.M.D still has some of these issues. The map specificities (fog, earthquake, gravity) from a few of the previous entries (mostly Worms Open Warfare 2) are lost. The dynamic water weapons from the 2.5D entries are missing too. The funny videos are long lost since Worms 1 and 2. The ability to draw maps did not come back (however, it is now possible to import pictures again). And finally, some details such as deeper customisation and some rope features (length) will not please die-hard Worms Armageddon fans.Apart from those nit-picks, however, Worms W.M.D is the strongest entry in the series since Worms Armageddon. Most features are there, from the local multiplayer to classic commando missions. The 2D graphics are gorgeous, the Worms re-design is great and the overall feel is more military than goofy. It runs well (apart for the somewhat slow AI), binding new key inputs is possible, and so on. Overall, it is solid. But that’s not enough to set itself apart. So here come the novelties.Buildings that can be entered. Good hiding places and protection, while putting tunnels back to the heart of the series. Mounted weapons that add a layer of danger. And most excitingly, vehicles! Tanks and mechas, both can jump and are easy to handle. Then helicopters, which end up being a very useful taxi for those players that dominate you and fly back to safety without burning jetpack fuel or having to master the rope. Mmmf, I have mixed feelings about that. Whatever I think of the helicopter, all those additions completely re-write the dynamic of the game. It feels a lot less static for us that are not masters of the ninja rope, and also I think the basic movements, albeit slow, are much smoother than usual since the Worms don’t get stuck just because of a small slope hindering their slimy way. And finally, crafting. I hate crafting, but thankfully it is not obnoxious here. Can be a life-saver to get a new jetpack, or eventually craft a concrete donkey if you have enough parts. Why would you craft anything else? It’s the most reliable.To conclude, Worms W.M.D is not the perfect game. I will always miss the explosive violence of Worms 1, with its maps and bridges full of mines for chaotic chain reactions. The die-hard Worms Armageddon fans will not have every single feature that they are used to and expect to find. But then Worms W.M.D is better than everything else that the series has recently brought us, with its own novelties that are enough to justify its existence. Good, solid entry, that I hope will be expanded upon rather than dropped in favour of a quick new episode that forgets the good things once again. If it’s your first Worms or if you casually like the Worms series, or if you need to find something new to play with your friends, this new Worms is an easy recommendation, albeit a bit expensive for now.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752818947"

Now (after patches) - I can`t say any good words about this game. Its my first negative review about TEAM 17 games. All other reviews was positive.About me: I am old worm`s 2d player. I am not best player but I am a better than medium skilled player, especially at the ranked Clan Wars. At the classic version of the WWP I spent over 1000 hours. I prefer Clan Wars for the best Worm`s game.I am so sad writing this review. Why TEAM 17 decided to kill successful game? I can`t to understand it. Haters or unskilled noobs manipulated TEAM 17, who do not want to get used to the new abilities? Likely ...Game dignityNow you can enjoy only at the single player content. It is made very high quality. Good job.Game shortcomingsCurrent ranked multiplayer is a big fail. It looks like very boring as hell gameplay with poor inventory and without ANY new abilities. That why a lot players stopped playing this game:http://steamcharts.com/app/327030Only 8 players on the Community Cup #5 Europe ESL says it all:http://play.eslgaming.com/new-games/pc/worms-wmd/open/community-cup-5/rankings/First version of this game was better than all other next. My mark for the v1.0 - 10 of 10. My mark for the current version - 3 of 10 (I giving 3 mark only for awesome single player content).What`s bad now at the ranked ?✘ No vehicles at the beginning of the game.✘ Vehicles will spawn randomly during game. Likely during enemy's step and near him. Only 1 vehicle can respawn at somewhere. Very low chance for the respawn of 2 vehicles.✘ Craft near disabled. Very high prices for crafting and crates drop officially disabled. You can get only 1-2 health packs during all game with +25 hp in each. You can create only 1 medium item like black shrapnel grenade during all game.✘ Absolute no new weapons at the standard set. You have not enough resources for creating total new weapon. You can create only improved versions of the standard weapons like bazooka and grenades.✘ Only 1 mountain gun will spawn. Not 2-3 as was at the first version.✘ Generator of maps. Can get a big sized map and very big sized map. Prepare itself to the ""Sudden death"". That why ""pro scheme"" from WWP or W:A will not work here. Size of map is too big. Gameplay will be very boring without a plurality of tactical decisions.✘ Rank system is not shows your skill. It shows only how much time you are played. Beat noob and beat hard player - here same things, you will get the same points.✘ Developers as always, totally ignored people and no answers are given about ranked scheme. ""Team17 & Boggy need your help with feedback"" - where are answers?http://steamcommunity.com/app/327030/discussions/0/343787920141221480/At totalHere nothing new. Its unsuccessful attempt to copy of old Worm`s game. But it will not work here, size of maps and buildings will be an obstacle to this.So ask yourself:- you want to spend so much money for getting boring copy of old Worm`s game which already dead?! Here you can`t get fun from the ranked. Especially if you are new player.- they created new awesome abilities that after 1 month to turn them off completely?!Do not buy this game. Price is too high for empty failed game. Buy WWP Remastered - it is cheaper but the same style. Or play Armageddon. For this game to play multiplayer - Steam version not needed, I have heard."

Instead we are back to 2D but with beautiful enviroments - exactly what was needed to make this feel like a classic worms game. They've been done so well it's hard to tell they are generated landscapes. There's also steam workshop for multiplayer maps - a much more modern way to find them.The new crafting system is a great addition, and with the ability to disable it for your multiplayer schemes it can't really be a focus of complaints.New weapons bring amusing new mechanics, plenty of old favourites too.Vehicles have also worked out well despite my concerns - they don't feel too overpowered.Buildings offer a new strategic element, a much better implementation of worm hiding than the invisibility item of the past.It's great to have an easy to use online multiplayer system - for both ranked and lobbies.Overall it's the best new Worms title in a while, and hopefully it will be improved with more cosmetic content!"

It's just a niche community when it's a game that deserves much more than that.If you're reading this review I don't need to describe the gameplay. Scorched Earth for you old timers, and for you youngin's, just think of Angry Birds but multiplayer (probably not the greatest analogy but close enough).This franchise has had ups and downs. Some really god awful downs. This time around, it's probably a peak for the series imo. It combines all that's welcomed in the series and introduces a few new mechanics to keep things interesting.""Indoor"" areas are a fantastic new mechanic, allowing you to essentially hide from other players views when entering a building. Maps are randomly generated just as they used to be, so are the placement of these indoor areas.Crafting is really cool but overall I think people tend to shy away from it in more competitive play.Vehicles are a fun new concept but nothing that significant.Overall, it keeps the ""feel"" of the classic worms gameplay alive. It has global multiplayer chat, so you hop in the game, and you're immediately connected to the community that's currently playing. A really important feature imo to keep the community alive, but unfortunately, it came a bit late. Should've been part of release so it could bring more people together.I've played nearly every game in this franchise at some point. I'm no expert at this game but I'm not that bad either.Bottom line - If you enjoy, even slightly, this sort of gameplay...then you will love this game. Truly Team17's best work to date.A++"

,Recommended,327030,33892617,Posted: 29 July,all,damn_vegetables,"Hmm, what to make of Worms WMD. When a new Worms game is released I think ""why should I buy it? I already have several Worms games"". Well, a glowing review from Ben plus the fact it was pretty cheap on special caused me to give it a go. I really wasn't losing out that much buying it, really.I enjoy it. I pretty much only play single player stuff (campaigns and matches against computer enemies) so my thoughts are obviously regarding that particular aspect of the game. The overall 'feel' of the game is great, the physics and control are spot on, unlike Reloaded, which just felt... off in some indescribable way. The fundamentals the game gets right, and that's a good start.Having a new Worms game means a wnole new set of single player missions, which as I mentioned above, appeals to me. Giving secondary objectives gives some incentive to replay missions to try to chase full completion of missions, which is something that I'd like to do when I've gotten through them all. There are plenty to get through, so it will certainly keep me busy.Having access to community maps is a great addition, I've downloaded a heap of maps to play random matches on, and I've enjoyed a lot of them, especially the ones that are recreations of Lemmings maps. They seem to bring out some fun games. For some reason user created speech banks aren't an option, which is very disappointing- it was one thing that was great about Armageddon. I loved my Zapp Brannigan speech bank!I have at best mixed feelings about crafting. I get where they are coming from, but it injects luck as a factor too much into the game. I wish that the weapons that are available thorugh crafting were available in non-crafting game setups, but sadly that's not the case. It gives me something to do while the other teams are takig their turns (and I think the computer teams were programmed  to faff around on purpose to allow time for crafting) but overall I'm pretty meh about it.I like the addition of vehicles, them plus the turrets you can use add some variety to the gameplay. Their propensity to explode after not a huge amount of damage is done to them is always a factor, just as planning how barrels and mines will behave needs to be planned for when making your move.I can't speak for online play, as I haven't tried it."

The controls are very responsive, the physics feel good and are very consistent, customization is extensive, the game is surprisingly atmospheric, and it sure as hell is fun! It has some massive improvements over other titles in the series, such as 8 worm teams, larger maps and (at last) a good launch. The vehicles are (to my surprise) balanced, as is everything else, including the pre-order content, and it runs flawlessly. The game is gorgeous, the sound is excellent, (it honestly has some of the best mixing I've ever heard) and the slightly more 'gritty' feel this game has compared to the previous Worms titles makes this entry into the series stand out from the crappy consolised Worms games of the past decade.And as for a comparison with Worms: Armageddon? The game's different enough that it justifies a purchase of both.My only complaints really are that some of the hats and soundbanks are locked behind a level system, and the slight indroduction of luck-based gameplay within the crafting system. Other than that, this is easily the best Worms game since Worms World Party, and I honestly think with a bit of support from Team17, which they have shown they are willing to give, this could be the best Worms game yet.Good job Team17!

The vehicles and crafting are fun to play with and fairly balanced. The art style is clean and fresh.There is however some downsides that keep me hanging on to WA, but hopefully will be added in updates.1.Scheme customizability:- Can't play mole shopper, theres no mole bomb in this game.- Can't play hysteria, you can't set turn time to 1 second.- Can not set mine fuses to random.- Can't set power of weapons like you can in WA, nor can you let worms spawn with the new craftable weapons if they are an upgraded version. Eg: a worm cant have a ""Cluster Bomb mkII"" at the start of the round because it MUST be crafted.Overall the scheme customizer and map editor still feels incomplete, but i have hope that T17 will update them.2.Rope knocking physics: It takes too much force to knock a worm compared to WA in my opinion.3.MAP EDITOR: Please make a WA map to WMD map converter.. enough said. The current map maker program is not fun to use and has to be run when WMD itself is closed. It would be nice if it were integrated into the game with more features.4.HP Bars: They disappear... WHY!? sometimes we need to see who the leader is in shopper schemes while we are moving around...Overall I have had a lot of fun playing basic schemes like intermediate, classic mode and ranked. but for more complex schemes I go back to WA."

Crafting allows for less wait time between turns and make the crates more crucial.Even the UI feels really close, with the wind display, health bars, fonts...And finally, singleplayer features feel a lot like Armageddon: training (Super Sheep training \o/), missions as a campaign, the team editor with its iconic voices.

""Full Controller Support"" is a blatant lie and the QA department did not test this out very much, if at all.  Input issues have been prevalent since launch, and many PC review outlets have documented this.  I personally can't use the keyboard; it simply won't work, so I have to use a controller.  My friend can't use any controllers (360, Xbox One, or keyboard/mouse), and Team17's support basically told him that he should revert back to Windows 7 because they're able to enjoy the game from their own rigs.  The developers delete posts on Steam from consumers (like me and my friend) that complain about the lack of updates on input issues that have persisted through patches.To me, that says all one needs to know about the state of this game.  It was rushed and has game-breaking bugs that are currently either being ignored by the developers, or they don't know how to fix them so they're just deleting flame posts to cover their products' reputation.

,Recommended,327030,31688686,Posted: 11 May,all,Lemmy [FHoH],"Great fresh look to the roots of the Worms franchise. The new weapons and the crafting system adds something fresh to the game and makes the game somewhat more suitable for online multiplayer. Rather than a hot seat game of ""beat your friends in the game or beat them with your fists afterwards"" style that would prevail some 15 years ago. But such thing is still possible with the game.The game mechanics are very similar to those of Worms: Armageddon. Both in terms of gameplay and a variety of scheme settings. The best new thing are buildings which are fun to use and add can play vital part in a match. The vehicles are also interesting to see in the game although a lucky vehicle spawn can quickly turn tables in a match.As someone who fell in love with Worms games at first sight, which was sometime around 2001 or 2002, I'm glad that this game came out and has a dedicated dev team to take care of the game and keep adding new themes and weapons.

Most of the new additions are nice, but some (such as vehicles and buildings) really take some getting used to. However these features can be easily switched off if you'd rather stick to the classic formula.My one big complaint is that the game advertises Linux support but it is extremely buggy.

Item customization - You can customize your favorite items & build a custom arsenal.2.) The onscreen tanks, helicopters, race cars, mounted weapons, etc. that you can use aside from your own array of weapons is a welcome upgrade that gamers will definitely love.3.) Explosive impact - weapons in WMD feel powerful & the explosive impact & special effects of the weapons are noticeable.4.) Worms customization is easier & allows an 8-worm team.5.) Detailed structures & fortification - Worms can now go inside of buildings & abstracts for protection (or to engage in battle inside the building itself).6.) Traps - Enemy worms aren't the only thing that threaten you anymore.7.) Terrain customization is easier, giving you a more comprehensive set of tools to craft terrains that suit your interests (they can improve this, but its a good start).8.) Great OST - The soundtrack is great work & shows how much effort was put into the game.9.) Frustrating challenges we all love to hate - Yep, they are back. Its nothing new, but its worth mentioning.But there are a few setbacks to consider as well.1.) While local play would make for a great time with your friends & family, The online community is small, which can impact your experience if you're heavily reliant on finding online gamers to play with.2.) Armageddon enthusiasts may be disappointed with the current selection of available items to use & may feel that the franchise is *too* familiar to Armageddon, which may not justify the current price tag if you're debating whether or not to make the jump to WMD.3.) Minor glitches. There are occasional times when you lose gamepad functionality (e.g. sometimes during the Worm Select tool during your turn - which may annoy you).Another small issue is menu size. The menu is tiny, making it more difficult for new players or players with custom screens to use it. I wish there was at least a large popup which displays the name of the weapon/item you are highlighting for a 60"" 4K TV.The game is still very new & being worked on - so who knows what surprises the developer has in store for you. If you're new to the franchise and are looking for a casual game you can enjoy with your friends, this is definitely a great choice for silly fun."

I really liked the water physics and the roping system in those games. I enjoyed how i could play around turrets by flying fast or making them role down hills. I also liked worms customisations that made an inpact on how you played the game (i'm talking about the classes)Me and my friends played this game with strategy - always thinking about where to put worms just so would not be knocked out, we found out a lot of ways to play around turrets and avoid being washed off of a cliff.All of these things have sadly not been added to this game. This game is by no means bad - it's fun and enjoyable but i feel like the depth and some of the tactical skill needed to play has been removed.Also it costs 30 euros... that's a bit steep for a Worms game.In conclusion:I would recomend this game for anyone who enjoyed the old classic worms titles. It's a fun party game that most people would enjoy.I would not recomend this game for people who enjoyed the mechanics and depth that Revolution offered because most of those have been removed.

I think I missed out on World Party and Forts, and honestly who played worms 3d?It's worms. That's basically what you need to know. It's Worms. What do you expect from worms? A turn basedGORILLA.BAS/ScorchedEarth type game but with odd looking worm characters that are mobile and can employ all sorts of weird and wonderful tools weapons and devices, all decked out in silly outfits and silly voices with silly death animations and silly victory dances.New to this game are building interiors and a weapon crafting system, which lets you collect crafting materials from crates (or dismantling weapons and tools you don't want and are unlikely to use, which can be done during an enemy turn too, same as crafting), and use them to stock up on normal weapons or create enhanced and powered up versions of the default weapons. Whilst the weapon loadout might seem small at first, if you take into account that almost every weapon has about 3 other variants, that really increases the loadout available, and also neatly avoids high-level weapon spam early on, or never seeing high-level weapons because RNGesus is not with you when you collect weapon crates.A feature I somewhat miss from Worms 2 (which admittedly was kind of broken as hell) is being able to tweak every weapon's stats and behaviour, but honestly I'm none too fussed about that as being able to vapourise half the landscape with a super super powered minigun is hilarious but not condusive to proper gameplay.There are full multiplayer capabilities here including local and online, both ranked and otherwise for online gameplay, and a nicely sized single player campaign with optional mission objectives to unlock more customisation abilities. I prefer this way of doing it honestly, as opposed to having to spend in game coins to unlock them or something. It was something of a surprise to learn I unlocked more customisation.This game does appear to lack a level editor, but honestly I feel that no level editor is ever going to quite match up to the flexibility and pure creative freedom that the original Worms 1 allowed. Dynamic water is missing from this game (seen in Worms: Revolution) but it didn't add much honestly, but they've added in vehicles like mechs and tanks, and static gun emplacements, which really add a great new dimension and challenge to gameplay.Just like before, RNGesus can utterly screw you by seeming to favour the enemy team over yours with the placement of drops, but you're always able to choose the nuclear option and destroy the crates to deny them the chance to get them, and also maybe hurt them a bit in the process too. Your safety cannot be guaranteed if you choose that path however. Some people.... take exception....Just like the previous Worms games you may find yourself dying as a result of your own weapons when a previously unseen tiny pixel of ground remains right in front of you, that just so happens to be juuuust the right size to block your otherwise perfectly aimed bazooka shot. which WOULD have killed four of your enemy's worms in one, but instead just embarasses you and wastes your turn... oh and allows them to chain reaction kill you and the rest of your team. :DOther than that though, same old, but still really good fun! Tried one multiplayer match, got an opponent straight away, gave them a good fight and ultimately lost due to pixels of earth repeatedly smacking me in the face :) Good fun all around!"

All other changes to the game don't necessarily make it a bad game.The AI didn't just make bad mistakes while playing, it made insanely stupid mistakes. It routinely tried to shoot bazookas and grenades through the environment, it faling to get over basic objects and being confused by its own jumps and it quite often just didn't do anything in its turns. For example, a worm tried to teleport into a building, the place it tried to teleport contained a wall and thus it was not a valid placement. Instead of moving slightly to try and find an adequate place to teleport near the area, it just froze until the timer ran out. Many times worms would also cause themselves to die for no reason, such as placing a mine and staying still thus killing the worm.If the AI improves I'll probably pick this game up again in the future but if it doesn't I don't see any reason to not play revolution or any of the other many worms games with far less issues.The only thing this game seems to do better is allow for more worms, but it's not worth it at this cost.TL;DR: Bad/stupid AI worst offender of any worms game, though many other issues plague this release."

Some may require you to kill all enemies in X way and the AI may blow itself up 20 minutes into the game failing the objective.Some fetures are just totally hidden. Unless you dig through the controls you would never know 'page down' opens a chat box or that there is even a chat system at all.Unlocks are kinda small petty. For hours of grinding through the campaign you just unlock a new dance or toumbstoneThere are very few single player game settings that would provide re-play valueSome game mechanics are heavily nerfed to the point they have very little effect on the game such as fall damage and windI would strongly recommend getting this for hot-seat or group playI would not really suggest getting this for the single-player aspectIts worth the money in its current state and will probably improve with time given the promises of modding support and added fetures."

The vehicles just add either maneuverability (heli) or firepower (tank), but not in a way that breaks the game.Crafting is awesome. You can use some resources and combine it with an existing weapon you have and make something better. I turned an Air Strike into a Demon Strike late game, which is pretty much a napalm/air strike.

There's a lot  of potential in Worms W.M.D., the graphics are very cool and the physics are solid.But it's still several step backwards the older games allowed you to do; The schemes are more limited, the lobby and chat functions are less reponsive and inviting (by being more hidden), the weapon hotkeys have fundamentally changed for the worse (weapons are almost randomly grouped together, rocket projectiles and grenades on the same slot), the tactical viability of well placed explosives is less revelant because you have less control over the height of the angle the worm will travel (your limited to sending a worm between 20 degrees and below the ground level where as in older games you could send them between 75 degrees and ground level.)But to my first point, the biggest issue is that the controls just don't respond all the time which makes for a very frustrating experience where you have to learn the ingame context in which it will completely disregard the player input and adjust your playstyle around it.

,Recommended,327030,25959398,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,Akruzhael,"What can I say? It is like the good ol' classic 2D worms games! With some new features, including vehicles and crafting! I've personally only golded all tutorials and am finishing the two of the campaign missions off completely, so I can only review the single player aspect, which is like most other worm games. You get different levels with different worms and voices. Some of the worms and voices will reoccur on other stages, however.Most of the campaign is fun and a good challenge. Each time feels like a different match as the outcome keeps changing. Which is neat. Though it does suck when your perfectly executed mission ends up failing or ruining an extra objective due to a mistake and then you can never repeat it perfectly, but hey, that's life and keeps the missions fresh! There are a few missions and objectives which are very annoying though, mainly ones that rely on the NPC/AI to not kill themselves which ruins the extra objective. Another thing that can be annoying is when going for the extra objectives, it can be A LOT of restarting to get the perfect beginning which can be all the difference in completing some of these objectives, so it can get a bit tiring, espeically if you have a low tolerance for patience. But that's totally dependant on your skill level too, I'm sure a pro player probably executes everything perfectly or mostly perfectly, but I'm not too sure there haha. But as a casual worms player who plays to just enjoy himself and have some fun, it can get a bit tiring after a bunch of resetting with no action, however, once it gets to that point where you are sick of it, I just stop for the day and play it on another day!My biggest letdown is how you cannot customize each worm. When I saw the trailers and every worm with a different helmet, I got really excited. I pre-ordered for the Yooka-Laylee heads but when I found out my team could only share the same head, I thought this really sucked. Especially when the videos looked as if each worm was customizable. So the lack of different hats on each worm is probably my only big letdown and I hope one day they make an update to change this. As I want each worm to look different. Plus, it's not hard to tell who your worms are, even if the opponent had the exact same, since you have coloured team names plus usually the worms are named uniquely as well. But even if you had the same exact different worms and names, you could still tell your worms from the colour. So I think they should add in the ability to have each worm on a team have a different hat. I really want my Yooka-Laylee team!But overall, if you love worms, especially the 2D games, then I think this will fit your pallete! Even if you are just a casual dude, I'm sure you can get some good fun out of it. Probably more if you play with friends or even just online!"

The quality in the soundbanks ranges from some what unique sounding to generic high pitched voice. Sadly the generic voices cover more than half of the soundbanks. This problem could be avoided if Team17 let the community create custom soundbanks for them. Thankfully Team17 isn't quite done with W.M.D just yet.

I was excited that we finally had cross-platform Worms and online multiplayer.  I was excited to see a game ready to take the mantle of Best Worms from Armageddon.  Unfortunately, it's just not ready for prime time.First, cross-platform multiplayer is not possible.  You can't play with your friends on Linux from a Windows machine, for example.Second, because the Steam overlay is broken for Worms in Linux, you can't invite someone to multiplayer games in Linux, making multiplayer lobbies with your friends on Linux an impossibility at this point.  I expect they'll fix this bug soon, but when I buy a game I expect to be able to play it with my friends today, not at some nebulous point in the future when the bug is fixed.Finally, and this is a minor detail, you can't have bots in online multiplayer matches.  So, if you wanted to play multiplayer with a friend online to teach them to play, you're going to have to do it without bots for a punching bag.Worms is a game that's all about multiplayer.  Nobody buys it for campaign.  Without cross-platform multiplayer, your community is split in three.  Without bots in online friends lobbies, you can't introduce new people to the game as easily.  Taken together, this makes it hard to grow the community.  With that in mind, I can't recommend Worms WMD.  It's a niche game to begin with, and without a single, consistent multiplayer experience and a way to introduce new players to Worms, I expect it's going to stay niche for the foreseeable future."

,Recommended,327030,25625210,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,Kolba,"This is a worthy successor to the best Worms title, Worms: Armageddon.The problem with saying something like that is that Armageddon has a thousand little features and it's impossible for all of them to make it over to a new game, short of Team 17 literally just re-releasing Armageddon under a new name. So there will always be complaints and negative reviews from certain Armageddon fans because it was their favourite feature that was cut. There will be opposing voices who will say 'This is like Armageddon' and 'This is not like Armageddon'. Instead of listening to and trusting either of them, you have to scrutinise exactly what it was from Armageddon that you loved and found wanting from the series ever since. For me it was the following:1. Fluid 60 FPS animation, with no jankiness, slowdown, or pauses before explosions. In short, performance.2. Crisp, clean 2D artwork, without noisy and distracting backgrounds, but full of personality.3. The clean, easily navigated weapons menu from Worms2/WA instead of the confusing unorganised mess introduced with Worms 2: Armageddon.4. Tight movement and jumping physics, with various keys for different types of jumps5. Fun 'rigid' rope physics6. Support for lots of worms per mapAll of this returns to the series with Worms: WMD. If this is what you have found lacking in recent Worms titles, you might find WMD something of a homecoming. I did.But of course, this is not just about how like or unlike Armageddon this is. WMD also has its own identity, and introduces new mechanics:1. Buildings are a fantastic tactical addition which add a minimum amount of cover from the start, kind of like a ready-made miniture base.2. Crafting, in my eyes, replaces the old Armageddon system of each team choosing their personal superweapon. Instead, crafting lets you dismantle and create weapons on the fly according to the situation, so everyone will end up with a unique arsenal based on their creativity and playstyle. This is not overpowered: you can't, for example, dismantle lots of lesser weapons and create a more powerful one than what you started with.3. Vehicles are probably the biggest change to the Worms formula. They work well, are fun and require skill to use, though on launch they played too prominent a role in the outcome of matches, and after listening to the community Team 17 has reduced their spawn rate.And this segues into perhaps one of the most important positives to WMD, which cannot be overstated: this game is getting ongoing support from Team 17, who have committed to work with and listen to the community to make this the definitive Worms multiplayer experience. And this is already evidenced after the complaints of vehicles being too prominent, and the rapid changes introduced subsequently. What you're buying is a fully supported online multiplayer game, with ranked and unranked modes, which will be guided by the community and supported by the developers. Who knows, if there's a much-loved feature from Armageddon which is sorely missed - weapons, or customisation options - enough demand might see it happen later. To get such a deal for a game which in its present form is already so faithful to Worms: Armageddon, and yet with a modern touch, personality and innovations of its own, makes it a no-brainer of a purchase."

Stationary turrets, vehicles, new ways of destruction.- Inside buildings for cover. For years have Worms introduced a ""make your own map"" idea and then you spent hours trying to make your map with crawl spaces that resembled buildings for more interesting map interaction.- Multiplayer is great, adds a series of ranking systems to the game including the training or specialist missions for those who want to prove they are in the top flight of Worms die hards.- Finally has 8 player Worms teams. No longer are the days when the company gets lazy and imports the console version onto PC with 4 Worms per team.- Familiarity with weapons and movement makes it easy to get into. A good game for a quick no nonsense mess around.- Male and Female voice packs available in national languages. Nice to have a little diversity to your worm ensemble.- Able to craft items during a game and after. These items can be ""Super jump rope"" or advanced versions of existing known Worms weapons to make it so you can explore other destructive means through playing.- Jump rope chain linking is possible.- Magnets, auto turrets, barrels, crates, all things you remember from previous games are there.Cons:- Very limited speech packs. I remember other Worms games such as Worms World Party and Worms Armageddon had many more voice packs.- Current level of unlocks for voice packs is small (5-6 extra). Some of the voices available aren't that different to each other.- I feel as if the customisation of Worms teams is far less in this edition than previous versions. No doubt they will release more eventually.- No map maker built in. There is a map generator with limited options you can randomly roll into. You are allowed to see the final product of the creation through their brief window before playing it.This has the Worms feeling around and those who are fans of the franchise will enjoy it a lot. The individual unlocks, progression on level and crafting system give an option of more replayability than previous games. Previously you had the missions, the specialist trials/missions and multiplayer and that was it.It's a great game for someone who just wants to sit down with a friend or two and have a laugh blowing up something. If you're reading reviews for it then you're already interested in the Worms game genre. You WILL enjoy this game and it has just about all the things you remember from previous iterations and then more ontop.Die Hard Fans:- Check the keyboard settings as you start the game and change as needed, some things aren't where they used to be.- Don't expect a hilarious falling on the floor wetting yourself voice pack for your team. They are entertaining but not AWESOME.- They changed classic Worms English voice. They CHANGED it.... Infact, they changed the way Angry Scots sound too. Even their words are different.

This game was a step in the right direction but a few key changes just leave me bored very quickly and wonder what the Devs were thinking on the new systems that were added.GRIPE : The options to create interesting game modes is the most lacking from any Worms entry. It is very basic with just a few toggles of what weapons to have on and such. I really enjoyed the SHOPPER game type in Armageddon and it is not possible to accurately create.GRIPE : They have added buildings interiors and it breaks the game for me. You cannot see any worms in these building interiors unless you have a worm in them yourself. So you never really know what’s going on during a online match. You might think it’s down to 1v1 and your playing your heart out to beat this guy, you beat him down with you only a inch away from death…. And then you realize he had another worm that never moved the whole game that was just hiding in a building interior….and you lose. Dumb, just a very very very dumb addition to the series.PRO : The art style, gameplay, and performance of this Worms game is the best it has been in about a decade.GRIPE : The crafting system added is another failed implementation. You can deconstruct and build things once every turn… no not just YOUR turn, EVERY TURN OF THE GAME. This leads to a online match of 6 people who are more focused on doing their crafting panel in hopes to build a Armageddon, then actually focusing on the epic grenade toss you just did. I finished entire matches online where I was zero invested because I was just trying to figure out what crap I could craft and deconstruct instead of focusing on the game.GRIPE : Vehicles… I don’t even feel like going into it but no, no they are not fun and yes, they will get you killed faster than if you just avoid them all together.PRO : Roping finally feels right again and you can pull off some sweet moves with it. Also the sheep on a rope is an awesome new weapon.FINAL:  Just save your money, this is not the Worms from your nostalgic memory. You will realize around hour 3 that you have no desire to play anymore and then will be bummed that you just crossed the steam refund threshold and are now stuck with this game.6/10"

,Not Recommended,327030,25464554,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Mr-_-Pieman,"I've always been a fan of the original worms games, seeing a new ""Very Positive"" worms game available I thought this game might actually be decent.The game itself is good and is fun to play, the vehicles, turrets, buildings, crafting, and turrets are a nice interesting addition to the game.My main problem is the fact vehicles are overpowered, using a helicopter you can fly all the way across the map, shoot the enemy team and fly back again.The mechs are similar and provide the user the ability to hover and jump across most/all of the map.This is very evident when you play ranked matches and the first person to spawn their worms chooses the helicopter instantly.The game in its current state takes out a lot of the skill, you can just craft mega bunker busters, for instance, doing 60 damage a pop or even save up for a concrete donkey, armageddon or OMG Strike.The ranked play as it currently stands takes out all the skill that should be in the game, every ranked game I have played consisted of spawning on/near the helicopter and attempting to control the helicopter the remainder of the game.When you play online with friends the game itself is much better -providing you both are on the same operating system or you can't play together- as you can turn off a lot of the settings that break the game in its current status.However, you cannot spawn AI while making your own public/private games, there is no way to set a player limit, E.G. 2-6 players max and when people do join you can't change the game to a private game resulting in you kicking people repeatedly if you don't want a 6 player game.There are no game modes like Forts anymore and you are stuck just doing the standard team death match each game online.I can't knock the story mode or training missions aside from the AI being a bit too easy.To summarise, if you like single player games or you want to play online with a friend you can do this in the game, the game is missing a lot of customisation that was implemented in original worms games e.g. Armageddon, and you cannot play with AI and a friend at the same time.So, I wouldn't recommend the game in its current state, Team17, you have some work to do."
,Not Recommended,327030,25233432,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,emej,"This seems to be easily the best Worms game since Worms World Party, but that is not saying very much or make me sing praises. This is getting positive reviews because it's better than the last dozen weak Worms games and because there isn't any competition in the genre. It's an alright game for casual gamers and kids, but the 30 euro price tag??? If this was 10-20 euros, I could've given a positive review. For more hardcore wormers Worms Armageddon is still the only choice.I didn't have that much time to play the game myself, but I've watched several hours of gameplay videos. This is what I gathered:Top 3 Pros:+ Map textures are pretty cool looking and there's no noisy disruptive background.+ UI and menus are better and more PC friendly than in the previous games, also better optimization, plays much smoother than Rev/CW for example.+ Physics gone to the right direction as well?Top 3 Cons:- UI still really consoley, the PC version really should have slicker look and handling.- Team17 created this purely for casual players and kids only. You won't find that much skill-based weapons or scheme customization. A lot of the weapons and utilities have been dumbed down to oblivion, for example Parachute.- Crafting! Such crappy idea. If it was completely optional, but no: you can't include craftable weapon variations in scheme editor, which is the dumbest thing I've seen in a game in a while. The vehicles are boringly implemented as well and unbalanced.(- I must mention the exclusive pre-order bonuses?!? What were they thinking? If the bonuses were purely cosmetic, it would've been fine, but this is not the case...)They took a step into the right direction with this one, but it's not enough for me, I will refund. Lastly I want to bring up a couple of big problems the Worms series has had for years:1. If Team17 created the perfect Worms game, they couldn't keep making a new ones every other year. They need to make money, so they consciously leave stuff out (for example deep customization, which would bring a lot of replayability). The solution could be f2p, but it's hard to do well. Or maybe they should just make more games that are not Worms?2. Team17 wants to make casual games for kids, but there is a big group of old school WA wormers who want a new competitive and skill-based Worms type game with modern ELO ranking ladders etc. Who will bring them that? Obviously not T17, they clearly don't care about that or still even understand what WA is all about."

I DID NOT receive this game for free or before release date, therefore you can actually TRUST my review. I am very said. VERY very said. This game is very dissappointing compared to Worms Armaggedon. I have no idea what the hell they are thinking, but it seems that everytime a new worms game comes out, it just gets more dumbed down or it just looses quality. There are less and less settings than ever before, the multiplayer is NOT PLAYABLE. It does not work. Everytime I try to launch a mutliplayer game, the game either disconnects during game or all the ""ready"" green lights don't all line up correctly because there is something wrong with the connection. I love the art style and I love how sleek the game feels on the PC aside from the online, but the music is the worst and so are the worm's dialogue. Wow man.. I mean I remember when Worms Armageddon was all about those hard campaign levels, epic music ( including guitar song at the very last level of the game), and the funny as hell speech banks we got for the worms. Now, all the worms literally sound the same and they each have like 3 or 4 lines of dialogue that is no where near as funny or as original as the well.. original. There is almost no thought being put into the voices. They repeat the same things over and over and over. The music is so dissappointingly bland and unmotivating. When I want to kill the worms, I want to listen to some awsome rock'nroll baby! Like the old times ya know? But, no. That won't happen ever again. Not in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ generation. I can't believe I'm still a gamer after all these years of seeing all these amazing games turn ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I miss the old days when games had more OPTIONS, more CUSTOMIZABLE, more EFFORT, more HEART, and a WORKING online multiplayer mode. I'm severely dissappointed in you guys. I'm sorry if it's rude or harsh, but I really wish you guys the best when you make the next worms game. Even if you just made worms armaggedon with a facelift (better graphics and updated sound) I would be happy with just even that, but in this case, I think the worms games a lost cause. I'm sorry, but in it's current state of little to no content, poor music and speech, I cannot recommend this game. This is not a good worms game. Not from what I remember in Worms Armageddon. You kids or adults who want a worms game should probably go play Worms Armageddon instead. I cannot recommend... can. Not. I'm so said and sorry to say it."

I do like the inclusion of them relating things to other games and the things like vehicles, however I feel at this point it starts to lose what made the original games so brilliant it starts to become too much of a gimmic and takes the focus of the game play.One of the biggest issues I found playing this was the controls there are some of the other games that don't stick to the same controls, but for the most part there are reoccouring themes just in terms of they are controlled, I felt like te original set up was quite confusing especially coming from the other games and even when you switch the keyboard, there isn't as much fluidity as the original games had.

I haven't played a game that did that to me until now, and quite frankly, it made me very upset. Its an okay game. The new look and voice bank is kinda weak, seems like there was alot of focus on hats and crafting rather than the other elements that made the other games fun. I understand that the creators were going in a new direction with it, but it falls flat just a bit. :/ To be honest, looking at the numerous hats, it just seems like the attitude was; ""just paste these pictures of random head based objects on there, who cares if the heavy head looks ♥♥♥♥ed."" To me it feels like all the mashed steam icons and hats are just make up to cover up a rather bland face. There's no relevance to it other than; ""OH WOW LOOK. Its from that game I like."" I didn't even find any hats I wanted and just left my worms bald. Just saying, compared to worms armageddon, there were a bit more creativity options, options which were sacrificed just to make way for the crafting mechanism and the bland hats... The crafting mechanism's a bit neat... I can't lie, I like it. I like the game itself only because its a worms game, and it harkens back to Armageddon just a little bit..? But otherwise, the whole resolution dilema totally killed it. That was just♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't like that at all. I can't recommend it to someone else knowing that THAT problem is in there.

It has plenty of good reviews so I was excited to see if it held up well with the old worms games.PROS:Love that the old weapons are back and there's huge variation with the weapons crafting menu.Customization options are plentiful, varied and quite cool.Graphics are well done.Sounds/Voices are awesome.CONS:AI is dumb as bricks. They walk around, aim, swap weapons, stare at the wall for 10 seconds, swap weapons, aim, move, aim and then shoots a wall. Every bloody turn.There is no option AFAIK to speed through AI turns, and they take forever.The vehicles are cool at first, but they're fairly gimmicky and not strategically designed. You can hop in a mech fly around a littleCommands and UX are poorly designed. You can change the key bindings, but at the first get-go, the aiming, shooting and jumping commands are clunky and unintuitive.There's a bit of a learning curve to understand how the weapons/gadgets work (range, aiming, whether it ends your turn or not), which is weird because for a simple game, there shouldn't be anything but a shallow learning curve.Maps are kind of cool but a little bland. Some ""walls"" are actually in the background which can throw you off. You'd be better off using the jetpack to move around the map, rather than the not-so-useful-anymore grappling hook, which can't get you around anywhere (which defeats the purpose).RATING5/10I loved the game at first, but it has quite a few usability problems."

They have delivered the spirit and feel of W:A into a much prettier package in Worms W.M.D., while also creating new and interesting systems that we can enjoy.Things I really like:Crafting is a welcome addition and increases strategy, as well as being a lot of fun. My personal favorite item to craft is the carpet bomb, which I remember as a kid in Worms Armageddon decimating my brother's fort.The ninja rope feels extremely similar to W:A. Explosions are very satisfying. High worm count, 8 per team. Many of the old weapons are back, including super banana bomb and other new enjoyable weapons, like the super flatulence sheep. An important key to a good Worms experience is a wide breadth of weapons, and Worms W.M.D. executes in that regard. It has over 80 weapons. The collectables, like hats and speechbanks are fun and offer customization to really craft your teams to your liking (and AI opponents to fight.) Gorgeous environments as well!Vehicles offer new tactical choices, most often with helicopters, which offer a lot of mobility.Things I would like to see:1) More themes2) More weapons (would love to see Homing Pigeon)It's Worms.

For now, we are pretty close - closer than ever in over 15 years.So why I don't recommend the game then? I really like the game but I cannot recommend it in its current state (release build) since compared to WA there is simply too much stuff missing. There are also many fundamental design problems in the game, here are some of them:- Steam/GOG/PC/Mac users cannot play online against each other. These kind of crossplatform issues simply should not happen in 2016 and should be fixed ASAP.- Crafting. I think there are fundamental design problems in the crafting system since it allows you to dismantle a weapon which you have an infinite amount. This leads to a situation in which you should do crafting after every single TURN to get the maximum output. It is also difficult to disable crafting since craftable weapons do not appear in normal weapon crates, meaning that you lose 2/3 of all weapons if you happen to dislike crafting.- Kamikaze is a preorder only weapon?

It was damn hard but the feeling of accomplishment is all the more enjoyable.This is by far the best Worms game they've ever made. I've been a huge fan since Worms 1 and there's been quite a few missteps in the series' lifetime. But this one, oh boy, this one is a return to form!I love the design of the Worms themselves. Gone is the over-cutesy look that took over in Worms 2. I never really liked that look. Worms are supposed to be cute, sure, but the cuteness comes from the worms believing they are tough but then you realize that they are just cute because, you know, they are friggin' worms!Weapons and crafting are top-notch. Ninja rope is exactly as it should be. So many insane weapons to choose from.Vehicles and mounted guns adds to the strategic possibilites which makes it unique among Worm games. So this is not just another remake of the Worms formula. This is taking it to the next level.Grahpics and animations are simply superb. And with a level editor tool accompanying the game, that makes for some nice customization possibilites.I can only come up with a single complaint. I want more editors! Speech bank editors, hat editors, tomb stone editors. This would really add to the personality. And then implement auto-download when playing in multiplayer. You should of course be able to turn that off so it just uses a standard speech bank if they can't be downloaded.But yeah, I remember fondly making speech banks for Worms 1, and it hasn't really been possible since...

Instead, Worms W.M.D. starts with the adorable 2D visuals and ubiquitous combat mechanics then builds upon it with the addition of vehicles, buildings, and a crafting system. While the game feels to be lacking in overall content and a motivating progression system, especially compared to some previous entries, there is a lot of fun to be had.

It does a few new things, but nothing particularly outlandish or game-breaking. It's just a solid game of Worms... finally.Fans of the series will want to note:- Ninja ropes feel nearly the same as they did in W:A, with one ""upgraded"" version that seems catered toward the gravity-defying rope techniques that were popular back then.- The 30 FPS animation thing is gone. The animations are now as smooth as the rest of the game and it runs at a constant 144 FPS for me. (If you don't know what the 30 FPS thing is from earlier games, don't worry about it! It can't be unseen!)- The single player is much more like W:A than recent entries. There is no silly ""Story mode"" with a narrator that tries to put context into a game about worms shooting bazookas...- Perhaps most importantly, the baseball bat once again plays music when you hit a worm off the map.So, good job, Team 17.

And if you don't think so you could host servers without much of it or alter things the way you like it.-Cons-Can start with bugs i've encountered at launch first but they will probably be fixed soon.

One thing I find annoying is that the game wastes so much time on silly animations and pauses. It would be much more fun if it were fasst. I don't need to see silly worm grins or drawn-out death animations. I wanna line up my next shot with the bazooka! Oh and by the way they nerfed cluster bombs, which is downright ridiculous."

Currently the only option is for hot seat, where you pass around a single controller.Edit: after 4 months of waiting and dozens of posts about it, the developer has still done nothing. What a disappointment the controller situation in this game has been. I would recommend spending a fraction of what this costs on a previous iteration of Worms which includes this functionality, unless you are not interested in local multiplayer at all."

I could say that I actually loved this game, and still in love with this game.WMD is more like a modern Worms, and there are new types of weapons and vehicles available. The gameplay itself does not differ much from the previous Worms i could say. The new weapons and vehicle bring new experience to the gameplay and you could even disable 'em if you do not like it.Albeit the player base is not much, you can still find people online! So far i have been playing the unranked match since I am still learning the new mechanics of this game.If the player base is your concern of making decision whether or not to buy this game, buy it! I get like 5-8 matches with different people in a night."

You may feel challenging for the missions or online game, but still you have lots of fun for playing with friends or even single player game.Pros- great graphic, and great worm- overall weapons balance- amazing crafting system- really fun for playing with friends- challenging missions. If you want to challenge yourself, they should be great- simple online systemCons- some important weapons deleted from the last series. It makes it's a little bit too strong if you neat underground- no earthquakes....... ah...... it's the saddest thing- fort..... ah... I don't like it anyway.

My problems didn't occured on any other laptop graphic card i tested.Also Team17 finally managed to fix several other Linux bugs for which we had workarounds for quite some time (related to exporting environment variables), but now we do not need to do anything else than install and play game.Lobby seems to be fixed, Linux players can play with Windows players. But there isn't many players anymore.I think i'll give thumbs up for that. Just don't buy this game on Linux if you have Intel 4400."

This is for me the best version that's ever been made. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is delightful and the distruction is joyous. It's also the least buggy of the Worms releases.Some of the weapons have been tweaked and changed, and the only little bit of sadness I have is that the Donkey only bounces up and down. It's much more predictable, and it was the unpredictability that was so much fun! However overall this is a superb version of Worms, that I can only recommend."

In addition to an arsenal of old and new weapons and the ability to construct new ones (by collecting parts in crates), you can drive certain vehicles randomly placed on the maps.Currently, the game lacks enough map backgrounds; only about 8 or 9. However, through Steam Workshop you can get your hands on so many different maps and custom goodies.Joining an online multiplayer game could be a bit hard as well. I tried for a couple of minutes to join a random game online but had to give up as it was taking too long.I got the game on 55% discount, and I'd say it is worth the price I paid. The full price is a bit steep."
