,Not Recommended,327060,17232487,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,rgk,"Feist is a physics platformer starring little critters in a forest, with a visual style of black silhouettes against a colored background, as in Badlands for example. Or a bit like Limbo since so many people refer to Limbo and say it is a rip-off, but the games have nothing in common. Limbo is monochrome, and beyond that there is no fighting in Limbo as it is a puzzle platformer.The aim of Feist is to take down several beasty creatures (the biggest ones on the screenshots) to recover the main character's significant other. In order to do so, the player will travel through a forest and a mine, and fight all the wildlife in the way while avoiding a few traps here and there. To compensate for its weak stature and lack of direct combat abilities, the main creature can pick up twigs or rocks to fight.A specific enemy, the fly, can be caught and used as a way to throw darts at enemies. This is really great. Also, the fights against the main beasts are very challenging and provide a lot of tension. Very dangerous boss fights.However, the rest of the enemies, especially the worms that come out of the ground to throw darts, are not so interesting to deal with. They lack some form of interactivity (in contrast to the flies), and end up being a hassle and repetitive. Especially in the sections where the platforming bits are really not fun as well. Too many platforms that need to swing to an exaggerate extent, unlike the more interesting puzzles of Trine. Having to pick up items to fight is original, but after a while it feels too limited since the twigs break all the time while the enemies keep sending projectiles. More enemy types and big scary creatures (that cannot be beaten?) would be welcome as well.For a game centered around wildlife, I thought that the ecosystem would be more complex, with the possibility to observe some of their life independent from the player, and creatures fighting each other. Actually I imagined that this would be a game mechanic, to distract the creatures by triggering some infighting. I believed that this would be the case because the boss beasts are able to squish the other creatures in their way. Sadly, every single creature just aims at the player and it feels too much like a set piece rather than an organic world. Additionally, I would say that the fights could be visually a bit more brutal to reflect the struggle for life among creatures.The irony is that my negative criticism of the game comes from what the game does right, like the beast fights, the flies, the traps, and the overall atmosphere (music and visuals) that put the basic bricks of a great world to play in. Sadly, the bricks are not expanded upon and not used together to build a house. The game doesn't capitalize on its strong points, and despite being short (2-4h) it seems very full of filler and not enough substance. In other words, it doesn't live up to its potential.On a technical standpoint, the game can run well above 60 FPS, however I had some occasionaly heavy framerate drops (that resolve themselves pretty quickly) and rare crashes or visual glitches. Nothing really bad.My negative recommendation is not to say that this is a bad game. Just that it could have been much better, and I suggest waiting for a sale if you want to experience it for its original features that set it apart from the other platformers."

Which is absolutely ridiculous. Not because the game isn't difficult, it is, but that's exactly the point of it. It's supposed to be a challenge and make you more observant.Now that I've cleared up that little rant, here we go...FEIST is a visually and audibly stunning game. From the screenshots and trailer, that goes without needing to be said while the soundtrack I wouldn't think twice about recommedning to purchase as well. Often I hear the that people generally think this game is similar to LIMBO which couldn't be further from the case. LIMBO is much more puzzle-driven while FEIST has a more survival-driven direction.The entire feel of this game is very primal in order to make you feel like you are actually an animal combatting other animals. You use your surroundings, enviornment, and even your own enemies to defeat your other enemies. As previously stated, the game is challenging and doesn't give you a set healthbar and instead you see your current health based on how tattered your creature looks--the more clean your fur is, the more health you have, the more ratty you are, well, you get the idea. And there are constant checkpoints throughout the game, but if you need those defined out for you that's just being lazy. At its core FEIST is a platformer, but at its heart FEIST is a game about survival. So why would you take that away by making everything so simple? You wouldn't.The AI in this game is well designed, particularly the larger boss creatures. They aim not only at you, but at where you are possibly heading. If a creature of a different type is nearby, they will attack it. A key thing to remember is that everything damages everyone. Dodging and having your enemies kill each other off is primitive.If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding game with need for a high combat skill cap, FEIST is a must grab. But if you're more of a casual gamer and want something easier to play, pick this up anyway and learn to play. :^} Or at least buy it for the soundtrack so you can chill."
,Not Recommended,327060,25357149,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,fungusdude4,"A game can have a great art style, atmosphere, and soundtrack. A game can have a fantastic concept and challenging AI. These things don't guarantee that a game will be good. I really want to love FEIST for its brutal, beautiful world, but its the glaring mechanical flaws I can't overlook.Aesthetically, FEIST is quite good. The art is dark and moody and the soundtrack is suitably melancholic. The animations are also very fluid and organic. Yes, you could say it looks like Limbo, but FEIST seems to employ the use of silhouetted 3D models, which makes it appear 2D. The unforgiving desolate world is also reminiscent, but both take the concept in different directions. Whereas LIMBO is more concerned with giving you puzzles to figure out, FEIST is more concerned that you just survive and kill when you need to.FEIST's enemies are surprisingly formidable. Flies and worms shoot deadly accurate needles, spiders are jumpy and unpredictable, and the ""bosses"" are persistent and ruthless. Everything is trying to kill you and everything is pretty adept at doing so. This creates a lot of trouble because your character is woefully ill-equipped to deal with these threats. You can run, jump, push things, and pick up and throw things. That's it. This wouldn't be a problem if the game provided you with better ways to utilize the sticks, pinecones, and rocks you find along the way. Each projectile has a fixed arc and the stick always has the same hitbox. Because of the game's tricky AI, it can become extremely difficult to even land a hit on an enemy. Even when you pick up a fly and hijack its stinger, hitting your target is frustratingly finicky. The game just feels unfair when you're expected to have pixel-perfect movement with floaty jumps and attacks that can come out of nowhere. Your ability to maneuver around hazards is severely limited by your movement physics. If you were given the ability to aim your attacks or quickly dodge in the air, the game would feel far better to play and the challenges could even be ramped up without feeling unfair. FEIST should have been a dynamic survival experience brimming with emergent gameplay possibilities, but it just doesn't deliver.The level design itself is a mixed bag. There are long stretches of running through samey forests and marshes. Even the blue-green color palette stays the same. Environmental variation is very limited. I don't have a problem with the game being limited to one geographical area, but everything just looks the same and it quickly gets boring. These long stretches also contain basic repeated combat encounters or environmental puzzles. That's not to say that these puzzles are unwelcome. There are a few puzzles scattered throughout that are legitimately clever, but the lackluster ones are those that make up the bulk of the non-combat gameplay. There are moments throughout the game where something unexpected happens due to the interaction of different mechanical systems and the game comes alive, but they often get buried by the tedium of seeing the same challenges and dying repeatedly in the same situations where it was practically unavoidable. The journey through FEIST is one of frustration with glints of promise occasionally.In closing, I want to acknowledge that I may be completely wrong about FEIST. Maybe I'm just playing it wrong, but that's another topic entirely. Maybe I was predisposed to disliking it. Maybe I wasn't patient enough. I'd still recommend it if you want to see an interesting concept and explore the consequences of fundamental design decisions. I still can't say it's a great game...yet. I'm going to try it one more time to see if there's something more to this. If it doesn't show me something better, I guess I'll just have to wait for Rain World."

Probably even exeeds it sometimes. This water and how every creature is made from pine needles, I really like it.Gameplay is not anything like Limbo. Yes, there are some traps but they are pretty obvious, and there is a lot of foes. In most cases you don't have to fight, just get away from them. There is 10 levels and 5 bosses which are on the tradng cards (yes you have to fight most of them).Is price tag a little high for ~3 hours? You're to judge, but there is nothing actually to choose from if you want more of the Limbo-feeling forest adventure with so much attention to details."

Negatives: the challenge mostly comes from fighting the floaty controls and poor level design. You frequently have to die at least once to figure out how things work. Despite a lot of repitition on the tougher segments, it came in at a grand total of 3 hours. Far too short for the full price. I'd recommend it at half price or lower."

If you find yourself unable to scale some high terrain, find some things hanging from trees which resemble giant, hairy testes, and hurl them at the side of said cliff-face (they're sticky) to help you traverse said terrain.  And whatever you do, DON'T anger the gigantic, furry porcupine men...'cause gigantic, furry porcupine men will ♥♥♥♥ YOU UP.Some even more surprising things which I've learned playing Feist thus far:  It is entirely possible for someone to make a game which superficially ""looks"" a bit like Limbo, and somehow make that game very nearly as GOOD as Limbo without replicating its gameplay too slavishly.  You can, for example, add quite a bit of ""combat"" to said game, whilst still replicating the highly believable physics and logical puzzle-solving of a game like Limbo.  Even more amazingly, you can make this new game seem oddly FRESH, in spite of the fact that it owes so much to not only Limbo, but indeed many a 2D, side-scrolling puzzle-platformer before it.  And all that's required to pull off this amazing feat is an extraordinary level of talent and an all-too-obvious ""labour of love"" work ethic evidenced only by the most dedicated of ""artists"".SO WHY IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ON STEAM NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THIS?!?Well, that's a question I simply cannot answer.  But by supporting game developers as talented and hard-working as this, maybe we can turn that trend around.  My only regret is that I didn't buy the soundtrack at the same time as the game, 'cause it sounds like JOHN ♥♥♥♥ING CARPENTER...oh man, me and my first-world problems...Verdict: 9.5/10."

It can be fun while running and dodging enemies, and throwing items works well for the most part. The puzzles aren't too challenging and are usually self explanatory. The problem is when many enemies are on the screen. They are faster than you, can grab you, have perfect aim, and you have to hit them a ton of times. Also a single hit with the sticks breaks them, which can be quite annoying. The game is super short, and looks like a ripoff of limbo. The character is cute, although there isn't much of a story. Many places require constant repetition and the camera can be screwy. The combat and platforming in certain parts can be finnicky and inconsistent. Even witht the negatives, while they can detract from the overall game, they are more frustrating than anything else. But they do not ruin the experience. Still it's decent.7/10"

There are far too many times where you die not because you don't know what to do, but because the camera is so far behind you that you can't jump to the right place without doing it over and over again until you have a part of the stage pretty much memorized.  In other words, it is hard, but a frustrating type of hard instead of a fun, mario-brothers type difficult.  Instead of buying this game, just play Limbo again, you'll have a better time."

,Not Recommended,327060,29835644,Posted: 10 February,all,AdamTwelve,"I've been playing a lot of video games lately. In the last week or so, in addition to Feist, I completed both Out There Somewhere and No Time To Explain. Feist and both those titles don't have a ton in common, but one thing they do share is in bringing you plenty of frustration through trial & error gameplay. It's in that trial and error where Feist falls short of being noteworthy.When I got past a difficult moment in either Out There Somewhere or No Time To Explain, I felt a true sense of accomplishment. Haha, game. I got the best of you! When I got through a rough spot in Feist, half the time I felt like I'd gotten lucky, and when I completed the game, I felt like I had stumbled across the finish line. Even though I consider both Out There Somewhere and No Time To Explain to be far more difficult than Feist, I gracefully glided across their finish lines thanks to being smartly taught how to compete. Feist was just a snoozefest for the first 15-20%, and then BAM the difficulty just smacks the s*** out of you. No natural progression. A huge difficulty spike followed mostly by somewhat clumsy, try-your-luck gameplay. I can't think of a truly great video game that does any of that.A few pros:Feist ran perfectly fine. No problems whatsoever on my Windows 10 machine w/ GTX 1060 6gb + i5-4460.It's controls are responsive.The music is very nice, though ultimately forgettable. I wasn't humming it later on, as is usually the case.It's nice to look at, but the view does get a little repetitive after a while. I also enjoyed the creature designs.Even with all my complaints, I cared enough to actually finish the game."

The art style is striking (even if the silhouette style is a bit overdone now) and the animation is fantastic. FEIST is an atmospheric physics based puzzle-platformer that draws you in with clever puzzles, avoiding traps, and pitting forest creatures against one another....and then about halfway through all of that goes out the window and it's replaced with frustration, cheap deaths, and fiddly physics puzzles. I get what FEIST was going for but for such a short game (which speedrunners will probably love) too much of it feels like it's down to chance and I just plain hated a good deal of the later puzzles and levels. The final boss is sort of fun but overall FEIST left me with a sour taste in my mouth.Pick it up if you like games akin to Limbo and Inside and have a tolerance for difficulty with a tinge of unfairness. Skip it if you can't deal with frustration or you want a deep or long experience."

The replay value is in the fact that there's a lot of achievements for the game... if you like doing those, you could probably get quite a lot of gameplay out of it. The game's really not for me, I felt that the game forced you into combat situations too often for it to establish any sort of eerie mood. Protip: If there's an enemy in your path, kill it. Personally, I liked the first level best, before the game got overly irritating.Pros: Gameplay is fluid, you never feel like you're fighting the controls.The graphics are rather well done.Lots of achievements.You can beat the game in two hours.Cons: The music felt like it was on a constant loop rather than actually having different songs. It's not on a loop, of course, but none of the songs sound different enough to make much of a difference.It's very annoying and tries your patience rather often.Soils the mood by forcing you into combat too often.Not much enemy variety. There are a total of, I think, five actual enemies in the game excluding the big guys, which come in a few types but... that's not really variety, in my opinion. They're sort of like bosses, they kind of need to have variety.Not much replay value outside of achievements.You can beat the game in two hours.What the game does it does well, which is the presentation and the controls. If you're the kind who like to show off through speed-running, this is the kind of game for you. If I had beaten the game without dying, it probably would have only taken an hour, maybe less. So, if you like fairly fast-paced platformer games I'd say check it out. Not really for me, just based on the fact that I've beaten it in under two hours and there's no replayability, because I don't care about achievements, but hey, this game certainly isn't bad."

,Recommended,327060,17335498,"Posted: 1 August, 2015",all,dreddmane,"So Feist is a good game in my opinion. Everyone compares it to limbo but honestly i find this better than Limbo. This doesnt require as much thought processing and more action and skill. The physics are amazingly realistic even though its a 3d platformer. Its about a small creature that got trapped by some beasts that are adventuring on. The aim is to kill all the beasts and save your friend and has a fun journey going through caves and forests and such, slowly picking the beasts off one by one. All the beasts have different abilities and are each unique and fun to killThough Feist does have its pros and cons so i will list them down and what to expect from the game.Pros- Incredible Physics- Less thinking- Amazing design- A pretty game- Good enemies- Smooth- Can fight back- Small game sizeThe physics despite being a 3d platformer are realistic. The way rocks and sticks fall are actually fun and it was a big reason why i got the game. The game doesnt really require a smart brain and more skills like timing your hits and when to jump and stuff like that. The design of the game is nothing like Limbo, its in a forest and mainly nature and feels alot more peaceful, rather in Limbo it was alot of man made structures and figuring out puzzles. The enemies all are different and all have different ways of maneuvering past them. The game has a nice smooth feeling when you are jumping and you dont lose momentum of when you are running, jumping from branch to branch journeying through the forests and caves to kill the beasts. You can actually fight back unlike Limbo and pick up sticks, rocks, logs and push boulders to kill the creatures that try to stop your journey. You can also use the environment to kill creatures too. And the game size is like 300 mbCons- Far Checkpoints- Small max health- Overpowered Enemys- Small selection of weapons- Overload of enemies- Repetitive deathsSo first off the checkpoints in Feist are pretty far for the things you die loads from. You would have gone so far but then have to do it all over again because of how far the checkpoints are. Your max health doesnt help with that either. Its about 4 - 5 hits from anything to kill you. And the fact that any creature can do that and some of them are pretty overpowered with all those are pretty unfair. Also the selection of a couple items to use against creatures are pretty limited. Mostly its just a stick, log and rock. logs are like lighter versions of rocks and sticks only last one hit. Rocks slow you down and lower how high you jump. Sometimes theres times when there is far too many creatures attacking you at once. Fighting off all of those creatures can get pretty hard. Then with the overload of creatures constantly relentlessly attacking you, you have to worry about progression aswel. Killing enemies mainly helps you for most things. Not worrying about creatures is like doing homework early and not worrying about it.Very likely a typo slipped my mind. There are plenty of more Pros that i couldnt think of at the time. Overall i suggest you get this if you like little adventures."

Unlike LIMBO, FEIST delivers a faster pace action feel, allowing your fuzzy little savage (unlike the star eyed hero in LIMBO) to deal with most of his threats.However also unlike LIMBO, the puzzle aspect is lacking in creativity.  Most can be figured out by careful platforming or placing one thing on top of another or using an enemy to do it for you.  That's fine with me because that is not what I was hoping for in this game.  The music and character design is original and seems to push more towards a primitive aspect where problem solving can be solved with basic cleverness, aggression, or flight.  Unfortunately the game is just as long as LIMBO and you can fly through it in about an hour or two.  Double that if you are achievement hunting.  Wait for the price to drop to be more worth your while.  A quick fun little ride that reminds me of the Last of the Dashkin."

This game is for people who enjoy unique art style, love nature, and who enjoy a good, challenging puzzle! The only thing that makes this game not worth $15 is the lack of content. Right now, there are only 10 levels and 6 unique animal species. There are the flies, flying things, spiders, caterpillars, inchworms, and the mole things. I would love if there were more updates, or even dlcs! There could be a freedom mode, where you try to survive in the environment by hunting and drinking, all the meanwhile watching out for harmful wildlife! There should be more wildlife added, and some more ecosystem implemented. Another thing that would be interesting is the ability to play as the beasts, like being the teleporting one, the raider, miner, sorcerer, conjuror, or scout!

And the physics are actually pretty good. Sometimes you have to swing a hanging box or move around to make a branch sway in a certain way so that you'll be able to reach a ledge. Or sometimes, you need to roll a rock to a ledge to be able to get up. It's actually a pretty cool idea.But it's not so cool when enemies are crawling all over you while you're trying to do a bunch of complex sh*t just to get where you need to go. I died so many times just trying to get a rock near a ledge to jump up because I got four or five flies shooting their little butt-knives at me.And don't even get me started on the jumping spider things. I hate them so much. I don't think I even need to say anything about the big goblin-looking guys. Fighting one of them is no more difficult than fighting a swarm of anything else, really. If you're lucky, you can get them stuck in a corner, and just continuously throw logs and rocks at them until they die.And due to the brutal difficulty, it's kinda hard to feel satisfied with getting past an area when you know the game's just gonna throw more bullsh*t at you. I can't even remember how many fits of rage I've had in this game.

At first glance, Feist looks like a lot like Limbo, however the focus here is not on puzzle solving but on combat and platforming. The levels are well designed so that running them is smooth bar the occasional obstacle or nasty beastie. Combat feels good, throwing a rock into a troll's face has weight behind it and squishing a bug with a boulder is very satisfying. The soundtrack is also brilliant, setting the mood for each encounter and environment.Feist is a well balanced, fun and atmospheric platformer that only took me a couple of hours to complete.

It's clear in the trailer that you're not playing a puzzle-centric sort of game like Limbo, but more of an action game with a similar dark and ominous mood.The subtle sounds might lull you into a false sense of security because every creature seems determined to kill the furry little hero.  It's definitely a big fish, little fish scenario.  You can consume some of the small bugs flying around if you've taken damage and the other larger monsters waste no time trying to put you down.  You are clearly the underdog in this world.  The big bad bosses are more than twice your size and surprisingly fast.  It's often a tough choice to fight or evade and run.  The flying critters remind of that taunting sun in some of the desert levels of Mario 3, harrassing you from a distance and difficult to outrun.Pieces of the environment and some enemies can be used as weapons, but don't get too attached because they can break or be easily dropped.I'm not sure where the game is going with my brief playtime, but every so often you catch a glimpse of what appears to be your destination.  You look to be chasing a large group of large monsters who appear to have kidnapped a friend.

After playing it, I can say that being more like LIMBO might have helped make it better. As it stands, LIMBO was a puzzle game, whereas I don't even know what FEIST is. FEIST doesn't so much provide puzzles, as screw the player about in between bouts of combat. What you could describe as puzzles if you've never encountered a puzzle are little areas where you try to figure out where the developer has hidden the door or stack up enough items to reach the door. These sections are pretty asinine and aren't the least bit fun, so let's get on to the combat.The combat is the only other thing the game does and is infinitely more enjoyable than what pass for puzzles. You run around, shrieking and flinging your poo, slaughtering friend and foe alike, until the pcp wears off and you decide to play FEIST to cool off while you're coming down. In such a case, you could choose worse games for a chill session, because once you've died a few times, combat starts to feel fairly routine and boring. It takes a few minutes for that to happen, though. Once you get the hang of it, but before it gets boring/frustrating, the combat is good, hectic fun. You're a tiny, unrelatable furry monster thing that has to rescue another one of your kind that's important some poorly explained reason, so you set out to murder countless other less relatable organisms with sticks and rocks and projectiles. So yeah, it is a lot like a pcp trip, not that I would know.The combat can feel quite natural and flowing, but that's only if you keep moving forward, backward being your only other optional direction. Every weapon is essentially single-use: sticks break after bashing one enemy and rocks can only be thrown, making them a hassle to go and pick up again. This makes combat feel sticky (no pun intended) and awkward as you either scabble about looking for weapons or just make a mad dash for the other side of the level, which is often your only viable option while taking on big baddies.I've heard people refer to this game as difficult. I disagree for that most part with that. FEIST is trial and error. I've heard it compared to LIMBO. Aside from art style and a title consisting of five capitol letters, I don't see the resemblance in gameplay. In action, this game seems a lot more like Hotline Miami: intense, slightly dodgey trial-and-error combat with a suggestive theme of drug abuse. Unlike FEIST, however, Hotline Miami knew to keep up a fast pace (until one of the later levels, that is) by making respawns instantaneous and every character go down with one hit. It also had an original aesthetic and didn't ape LIMBO. Yes, I'm calling it. Intentionally or not, the developers are ripping of LIMBO. Unfortunately, they didn't take enough things from LIMBO, like being good."

Generally, movement feels smooth and responsive. There are moments where the character doesn't respond correctly to your inputs.  The camera does a poor job of following the action, as well.  Oftentimes the only reason you'll fall into a trap is that the camera is lagging behind your character and thus doesn't reveal the danger until it's too late.The sound and graphics are decent - nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.The level design is uninspired.  The same sort of puzzles and jumping challenges reoccur too frequently for the gameplay to be exciting and new beyond the first hour. Even worse, the game rewards the use of using trial-and-error, rather than pattern recognition or planning.One gripe I have is the length of time it takes to respawn after dying. Every time I die, I feel impatient waiting during the black screen.  This isn't a hardware issue - it's just how the game is programmed. The game tries to force players to proceed at a slow pace. This isn't bad in and of itself, but because of the game's failure to stimulate the player in other ways (in its visuals, its challenges, or innate charm), I can't help losing interest."

The enemies are ruthless, visceral and highly intelligent. Not only the bosses but other fearsome creatures possess an incredibly aggressive AI, the most annoying of these are the so called spider ticks whose attacks are so vicious to the point the game can become quite frustrating.I repeated some of the chapters multiple times due to merciless nature of the enemy foes. Prepare to die a lot in this game, this isn't a walk in the park, even for an experienced gamer like myself, you'll die and you'll die a lot, but with the death comes vengeance, you'll get better with each death, memorizing each step carefully and you'll eventually become victorious.The game itself has a a simple storyline, but this game isn't about the story, it's strongest part is the ferocious gameplay and I have to say for nearly 14 euro Iam satisfied, it took me over 3 hours and 20 minutes to beat the game, I'll probably be playing through the game once again to earn some of the achievements I missed on my first playhhrough.

The only reason why I have 1.8 hours on record are repeated and unnecessary deaths (mostly in the last 3 levels).But what is Feist? Is it a Limbo clone like so many users compare it to? No, not at all. Where Limbo was a monochromatic puzzler, this is a ""run and gun"" platformer with 10 levels, each taking only a few minutes if you're good at the game and each as replaceable as the last one (visually). You're a little black furball trying to save his loved one (apparently, since the game has neither voice nor text nor anything at all). To do so, you must (for some reason) kill all her (or his) captors. Occasionally one (or more) await you at the end of a level.The levels themselves have a haunting atmosphere, but get stale pretty quickly, since there is little variation. The only 2 settings are a forest and a cave system for like 2 or 3 levels. The gameplay also is absolutely the same for every level: run as fast as you can to the exit without taking damage or dying preferably. If you do die, the game restarts at a checkpoint, however, you have no idea when the game deigns to grant you said checkpoints, nor do you know how much damage you can take or how many hits a boss enemy requires. That would have been fine would there be a visual represention beyond a character being covered in red pixels (that supposedly represent blood) after taking 1 hit....To damage enemies you have to use twigs, rocks or even an enemy itself (the fly). Twigs break after 1 use, rocks make you slow, the fly is by far the most inriguing part of the gameplay and it only appears on 3 or 4 levels. The rest of the enemies are either just avoidable or need to be disposed, sometimes in a ""creative"" way to progress (e.g. there is a part in a cave level in which you have to first run away from enemies to have them killed in a choke point by other enemies before you can return and climb a crate...). Apart from enemies you have to avoid traps in the form of flying spears that can be triggered by yourself or an enemy or even the environment. Especially the last levels emphasize platforming and traps and are a bit different than the rest of the game. But they are also highly frustrating. Climbing and jumping while being pursued by homing missiles and jumpy spiders you can't kill, because there aren't any weapons around (or your weapon breaks after the first of 6 enemies) is highly irritating and has caused much dismay and many restarts.I got this game at 67% of for about 3 euros and I still feel ripped off. Not, because of the money I paid for it, but because of the almost 2 hours I wasted on it. Technically I could refund it? No idea, but it just doesn't seem worth it. It will act as a reminder of steam purchases gone bad in my library. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art project with obnoxious game mechanics and floaty controls. No matter what you tell me: There is no replayability, levels and gameplay are stale and the difficulty can't be adjusted. And it's over in under 2 hours, maybe even under 1 hour if you ""beat"" all the level times. 2/10 perhaps.PS: Great soundtrack. That's about the only great thing to find here. Unfortunately can't be bought on its own."

This game was pretty great.That is, if you enjoy a challenge. It did have some bugs and glitcheswith the graphics, like the background would glitch after a death, orthe screen would go black forcing the player to close the game. Butoverall, it was a great game, since the only issues can be fixed witha patch.Just make sure you are really up for a challenge though, because thisgame is hard. And that is what makes it most enjoyable. Thesatisfaction of beating a level after dying 20+ times is absolutelyinvigorating.The story wasn't immediately obvious, but it turned out fairly cute atthe end. So it could have given better hints at what exactly it was youwere trying to accomplish. But the introduction of new bosses in thecut scenes was a nice touch. Other enemies will appear in a newlevel and murder you to death.The weapons felt fair given the situation you are in. They make youfeel like you have a little power, but not a great deal. And often timesyou may find that leaving them behind is a better choice. Shootingprojectiles was a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of ityou can take out any one to three hit enemy with ease.The only thing I disliked about this game was how short it was. Itfelt like it ended too abruptly. But for some, this might be a goodthing. Especially if they felt like they were grinding through the gamewith no end in sight. They might lose interest. As for me, I wouldhave liked another level or ten.Finally, I would like to say that even though this game is verysimilar to others, Limbo and the likes, it is its own game. It playsdifferently and has a slightly differing atmosphere that is createdwith the amazing soundtrack the developer decided to slap on.So again, great game. Hard game. 10/10 would recommend."

,Not Recommended,327060,17206873,"Posted: 24 July, 2015",all,Phoenix,"Feist is annoyingly hard to play. Trying to beat next checkpoint for ten or more times is a usual situation. Opponents appear ouf of nowhere. They fast, or tough, or attack in mass. And usually they are ridiculously precise in shooting.On the opposite, for you, world's low gravity creates so much of a challenge itself that throwing or shooting becomes a frustrating experience. Consider the fact that you need to catch a fly of your own size and hold it to be able to shoot its stings. Just to discover that it can shoot only at most useless angle. And the fact that to catch the damn thing, you shoot beat it half to death first.  Spending a whole damn minute trying to jump and hit it with a stick. Dodging those very damn stings like crazy. And the fact that if you release the fly, which easily happens when you're hit, or have accidentally thrown it away yourself (due to struggle with controls, but as an adult you pretend that you did it intentionally), it shakes off and joins enemies surrounding you to take its revenge.So, it makes close combat the best option. Which means running around with a stick. Which you need to find (strangely, beating it before taking is not required). There's only one little inconvenience with a stick. It breaks down after a single hit.  And nearest supply of sticks is left a couple screens ago. And is pretty limited (of course it is! hey, what did you expect? we're in a forest! what, do you think sticks will just lay around under you feet?). And, running back there usually rewarded with an immediate couple of spears in your sorry back (who would think that caterpillars are so impressive in throwing?).Considering that your hero can take only around 3-5 hits, it makes combat a mix of chaotic running and jumping, counting much more on lucky circumstances rather than skill. The fighting takes around 95% of play time, and there's almost no other things to do. So, after first 1.5 hours of gameplay, I'm rather irritated than having fun.For me, apart from bizarre visual style, there are no reasons to prefer Feist over a ton of other games, unless you're Dark Souls fan or dying over and over again is an integral part of your pleasure."

If you continue to play you'll get to the point where you'll need it and not having it. Die repeatedely till you go back and start the entire level over.

To do so, it has to fight a way through beautiful yet dangerous environments against different types of enemies.I personally find the levels are well designed although it is challenging and you can get stucked quite easily. I personally think it's just about right and is beatable after some practice. Using the environment is an important concept in this game. You can even catch an enemy and use it against other enemies (but if you release it, it will continue attacking you).

The artwork and animation is every bit as beautiful as Limbo, if not even better, and the ambient background music and minimalist SFX accompany your journey through the world of FEIST perfectly.I started the first half of my playthrough at about 2am when I was drunk and completed it the following day with a moderately bad hangover, so I got to play it from two very different perspectives and have two fairly different experiences. In both cases, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down for the 5 or so hours of combined playthrough time.It's a challenging game and you'll die a lot, but it's really fun and rewarding to figure out how to get past each section, and there are usually multiple solutions. For the most part, you'll feel like you're in control of your fate, with only a few trial and error sections of the game where death is pretty much inevitable on your first playthrough. These were mitigated by smart checkpointing, though, and no loading screens or waiting times to get back into the action.In short, I'd recommend FEIST to anyone who enjoyed Limbo or Inside, or who likes 2D action platformers.

The harder parts were perfect for me; challenging so that I could not slack off but easy enough that I could start experimenting.Feist very rarely explains what you have to do but introduces you to all mechanics in a gradual and fun but you will have to find out how to use them effecive yourself. It feels very rewarding when you do find out how something works!It never got boring. That sounds like a simple thing but most games I played got boring and repetative qutie fast. Feist always pushed me forward by introducing a beautiful new location, a new mechanic to experiment with or unexpected enemies.If you are a platformer veteran it will probably be way too easy. If you expect to spend days or weeks in the world of Feist you might also be disappointed that it's not long enogh for that,  but it's easy to pick up, enojoy and complete in a satisfying way. I have not finished most of the games I play but Feist was both a pleasure to experience and I got the satisfaction of actually finishing it.I would recommend playing Feist on a relaxing evening when you've had enough stress for the day and want to end it on a high note."

The game starts as an atmospehric platfomer, but when those wild beasts start hunting you down the gamplay becomes very dyanmic and intense. The level design is also very organic and the world feels much more like a real enviroment than a simple game level."

Not a massively long game, but if you strive for achievements or to perfect your gameplay you could sink many hours into it.You must navigate a hostile environment, dodging traps and enemy attacks and occasionally solving a physics/block puzzle. Gameplay is very skill based, requiring you to predict and/or react to enemy movement. There's some minor resource management thrown in, as while you can often cause enemies to hit each other with clever timing, the only way to attack is to use bits and pieces scattered around the environment.The checkpoint system is quite forgiving; you never have to replay the same section for too long. It feels like there's not much penalty for dying, although part of the game's charm is its emergent gameplay and when you do get stuck it's a chance to try different strategies and see what happens. The levels included a couple of really awesome moments to highlight the physics based collision/damage system."

There are moments that you get scared, feeling that the forest is a perilous place to be. Beautiful graphics, really forgiving for low end pcs like mine.Long story made short, I waited for a long time to own this game and I really loved it. Sometimes it get really hard because of the various monters on the way, but that makes the game challenging."

It has pretty graphics, a comforting soundtrack, an evolving difficulty, and properly tough challenges. I wouldn't say it's a must play, but if you enjoy side-scrolling puzzles (limbo, Inside) this isn't too far off."

There is combat, but you have no health bar so you never know how far you can push yourself. The set-pieces involve many unpredictable and unreadable instakills. In Limbo you could read the presence of traps from the environment. Not so in this game. You will die often, and have to memorize the levels. This game really does not feel good at all. The game is also very short. I beat it in 3.4 hours and came here to give it a resounding thumbs down."
,Recommended,327060,34473962,Posted: 24 August,all,quasiotter,"The strongest part of this game, for me, was feeling so insignificant in the scope of nature. The world here just felt so uncaring about what happened in its realm, and all creatures want you dead. It was rightfully difficult, because that's how your life would be if you were stuck in this ecosystem.The only disappointment was the camera at a couple of the running-away sequences. Not being able to see much in front of the character seemed like a needless obstacle, whether or not that was intended.Of course, the visuals were incredible, but I was truly impressed by the soundtrack. I absolutely loved the physics, the sound effects, and the general tone of the entire game. I highly recommend this game, as it was quite an intense experience."
