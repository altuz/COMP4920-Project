As a painter software, Tilt Brush does not only provide relaxation, but also available for other area like costume designing and room designing. A really useful software.Composing freely in an private 3D space, you can create whatever you like with the paintbrush on your hand, if you want to change a draw, look, the menu is on your right hand! A variety of fancy draws are provide for you to create your masterpiece, you can even draw sparking flame and colorful rainbow!You can choose where you want to compose, on plain with chains of mountains in sight, deep in the vast universe or you just want a plain color background. Other items like Mannequins are also available for you.Press the step button in the menu when you compose, you can blink everywhere in the virtual space until you fill every nook and corner with your color. Then I rather lie down, and take a good look of my dreamlike world.Wonderful!To talk, play and share your ideas about virtual reality, please join us:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viriver"
,Recommended,327140,26724352,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,zxyra,"This is by far one of the most mind-blowing VR experiences, and Tilt Brush is actually what motivated me to make the not-so-small  jump from to the Vive from the Samsung Gear.Painting around you, in 3D space, is surreal. The controls are super intuitive and easy to use. Being able to load other people's drawings from the internet showcase is really helpful for getting ideas on techniques and seeing what can be done with the tools available. The ability to shrink and expand the scene is super cool for creating things in scale - cover vast distances rapidly while zoomed out and then zoom it in to be able to walk around your suddenly huge creation and add smaller detail. The animated brushes are super fun and stunning to use. The in-game video camera and gif maker is really cool too, for sharing online.I am really hoping they develop it further, as it does have a few shortcomings- lack of 3D brushes (just wire and disco) is a bit disappointing for painting in a 3D space, as you are restricted to trying to paint 3D things with 2D brushes. The colors of paint in different environments are completely off in some of them which is frustrating; adjusting the source of lighting would be helpful as well. Lack of transparency adjustment on the colors and no dark color shading equivalent of the highlighter is a bummer; it would be nice to be able to paint things with smooth gradients. There doesn't seem to be a color picker tool either, which makes it hard to resume painting and match properly. Copy & paste would be a very welcome addition as well. More brushes and environments, or the option of allowing user-created content for that, would be awesome. Being able to load textures into brushes would be great.I can see this having a lot of utility for design applications once there is more functionality... fingers crossed that they continue going in that direction.I absolutely love Tilt Brush - it is a must-have for your VR collection and one of the first titles you should buy. Worth every penny."

,Recommended,327140,34838710,Posted: 9 September,all,IVCutsmanVI,"This is definitly one of the best uses for VR to date. It isnt a game, and there isnt any skill involved (although there is a pictionary style game you can play with friends). It is purely an outlet for creativity. The brushes and effects are perfect and allow you to create anything you can imagine. The learning curve for the controls takes all of 30 minutes, with most of that spent going through all the different brush options. The ability to instantly scale a sculpture (scene?) will often leave you speechless as your small sculpture becomes an environment around you. There are soo many nuances that the developers put in that make this one of the most (if not THE most) polished experiences available for VR.  Put on a good album and find the perfect way to unwind as it is guaranteed to lower your heartrate and make you smile.  10/10"

Letting you bind shortcuts onto other buttons of the remote, (maybe put the redo and undo commands on the bumpers of the remote you're painting with).

That right there makes it well worth the price!The UI is so easy to get used to - with a learning curve of  about 10 mins.Some of the things people are doing in the showcase section are absolutely mind-blowing!I now have the technology to create and walk through anything I can imagine. No limitations other than you!Thank you for this - I would have paid much more. God knows I have to Adobe...

,Recommended,327140,33080946,Posted: 1 July,all,Raldman,"As an artist and animator, this was the app that pushed me to get VR sooner, and it was mostly worth it. The only thing I would like to see is a way to paint on top of what you have instead of having to add another layer of geo. Otherwise, the controls are intuitive, the UI is pleasant, the experiance is polished, and the navigation is easy. This is an easy application to recommend, and a must-own for artists.(Used application with HTC Vive. Only occasional stuttering likely caused by underpowered processor)"

You start off drawing like you would in normal life until you take a step an realize the canvas is everything around you...then wow.

Great for anyone, gamers and non-gamers, kids to grandparents. I spent hours lost in my (terrible) art work. Even if you can't paint/draw you can create impressive art on Tilt Brush. This is the first thing I get guests to try. The possiblities are endless here, limitless replay value. A must have! A++"

Everyone I have demonstrated VR are amazed and shocked by this tool.  The effects and ability to draw in 3-D environment is amazing.   I bought my VR to try out, not really expecting much from it.  This is one of the programs that blew me away with what all VR has to offer and is one of the many reasons I decided to keep my system and support the community.  It is easy to use and and quickly be learned by any audience.  Highly recommend!!!!"

I always thought, ""whats fun about drawing stuff in VR?"", but this game is pretty fun. The first time I played it I spent 3-4 hours straight. I guess the main thing I like about it is how your own music works it. Its like a music visualizer. Its just so relaxing creating your own art / drawing while listening to some music. Anyways, this game is highly recommended!"

Wouldn't call it exactly a 'natural' experience... but certainly fun to learn how to work with the brushes & create work in all three dimensions. (The mirror tool is virtually the most essential thing to use for creating symmetric objects)

,Recommended,327140,35248104,Posted: 27 September,all,UNCLibraryVR,"Tilt Brush is a fun game with simple controls for first-time players, but it’s far more complex than it first appears. Players can draw 3D images using a variety of tools and colors, and they can then export those images. Although it would be helpful if the game had a tutorial that explained the controls more clearly, first time players are able to pick up and play the game with little difficulty. Highly recommended by staff and students. Go Tarheels! @House Undergraduate Library"
