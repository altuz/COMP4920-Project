While it's gameplay is what you'd want out of the genre and does a great job in really being in that sweet spot of not being too easy, but not being too painfully frustrating, it's the story telling and characters that carry it in a way that hasn't been done in the genre for a while. There's not a lot of humor and the visuals lack compared to some of their prior work in Deponia, but its clear that they wanted to make a heart-warming story more then anything else, and great voice acting and writing makes you want to see what happens next. It's a game that I'll be completing for the story alone, and that's what you need out of a game in this genre. Definitely worth a pick up for narrative focused fans or Point and Click lovers.Gameplay Footage and Video First Impressions:http://youtu.be/CNSkY5ITB7sLists:+:Perfect balance of gameplay in terms of difficulty. Not too easy, but not with old PnC adventure game logic that makes you want to pull your hair out.The story is superb and in particular, the empathy aspect of the game really shines through. Be prepared to have your heartstrings tugged on.Voice acting is great. In particular, Anna is played perfectly and the characters in question come to life thanks to their voice actors. Not over the top, but just right.Enough red herrings added in terms of gameplay without it being annoying for exploration.Have I mentioned the charm?Pacing is handled rather well.-:The visuals seem like a step back from Deponia.Could have added some puzzles/minigames to add a little of variety to gameplay."
,Recommended,327220,16871630,"Posted: 3 July, 2015",all,Shamdec,I enjoyed the fact that the game was narrated because it truly felt more involved that way and a way to connect to the characters especially all the silly things that were said when you interacted with certain things.I love puzzle games so the fact that this was point and click game where you had to connect the pieces to figure things out in order to progress was something I found fun to say the least.If you like figuring out small puzzles and story like games than this is a game for you.The ending of the game is what really got to me. It is a bit confusing if you don't pay attention to the story throughout the game and connect all the pieces but if you do it makes it all worth it.

I'm probably one of the largest fans of Daedalic.Puzzle difficulty: 4/10 (10 being the most difficult)The puzzles overall were not difficult. I only had difficulty with one of them, the rest were obvious. This isn't really a bad thing, unless the developers were trying to make them difficult.Character depth: 7/10I am not sure how I would feel about the characters if I weren't comparing it to the other Daedalic titles, but for me a lot of the meaning in this game comes from those comparisons. Otherwise, the main characters is extremely simplistic.Bugs: 9/10I only encountered one noteable bug, which is an incredible improvement to some of the other games by Daedalic. I'm very pleased by this, considering Edna and Harvey had some literally game-blocking bugs.Story: 8/10Less deep than their other games, but still entertaining. The plot 'twists' were obvious, but of course that is the point. But, like the other Daedalic games, I'm left with questions! So I hope there will be a sequel, or a prequel.Overall, a very enjoyable game. I would have loved it to be longer, but that is always the case with a good story. I strongly recommend the game. In my opinion, this game means more when you have played the others that I mentioned, ESPECIALLY Edna and Harvey, due to the comparison between each of the three young girl characters."

Her innocent cute antics are ok first few minutes but after a while you just skip over her lines to avoid headache.  And you stack with her for the major part of the game. It really kills the joy as adventures are mostly about good mix of puzzles and story/dialogs.  It was much more fun to play a part of  antagonist's childhood instead of main hero quest line. The situation is worsened as Anna's side-kick  - bear-boy is as docile as she is.2. The story is rushed and abrupt, it feels unjust and ending is done in ""lets just wrap it up quickly"" way. I think it was one of the worst endings I've ever read.3. Puzzles are not polished enough and sometimes unable communicate properly what you are supposed to do. But mostly they are fine, though I don't like when you are not allowed to take items until some events happens. It really throws off your awareness about what you can use and what is just decoration items.Overall game is not bad, first part is quite meh, second part is interesting as story start to shape up but than sudden ending without much explanation kills everything good in it.On positive side I must note that controls are good, no long runs, no long animations to wait for, solid stuff."

The story is uninspired, the voice acting and dialog are frustrating and there is no dark fairytale to be found.This review is spoiler-free!I have played through the game and in the end even found some enjoyment in it.Even though, I can't recommend it, the negatives weigh too strong for me. After completing the game I rewatched the trailer because I wanted to know why I was interested in this game in the first place and found the trailer to be rather misleading. Don't buy this game for it's trailer!The goodThe game has very good pacing and the puzzles are logical for the most part. I think there are not many points people will get stuck at.The so-soThe story is very average and at least as predictable. No surprising turns, no exciting moments, just a linear sequence of story boards. Don't expect the few sidetracks to be ever concluded. The puzzles weren't very demanding or overly creative either, but I didn't play this game for a challenge, so that's fine. The music was ok, too - not really memorable and at times a bit repetitive. This game has Daedalic written all over it, which includes the clunky engine with half-gasped words, the untimely cuts in dialogs and the seeming inability to show more than one animation at once (not that there is a lot of animation at all). It always amazes me with how little animation Daedalic get through their games.The badCharacters. Or more specifically, the way they are portrayed through dialog and voice acting. Over the course of the first two chapters I debated whether I wanted to go on playing this game for this reason alone. The whiny way Anna is voiced was a constant source of frustration and aggression (mind you, what she actually said was bearable). If they wanted to make their audience constantly feel like everything is a chore than they met their goal 1000%!The first few characters introduced are all the same (except for the evil one of course): whiny, insecure, hesitant und unbelievably long-winded. One of them inserted so many pauses into his sentences that I actually buried my face in my hands because I wanted to smack him so badly. Chapter 2 introduces some a bit more likeable characters, but the ones which actually matter mostly stay this way throughout the game. Starting with chapter 4 Anna also has some strong moments, but this development came quite late for me (there are 6 chapters in total).The storytelling and dialog itself felt at times very unnatural. There is no witty dialog (like, none at all!) and Anna seems to have an urge to either state the obvious or explain in excruciating detail what she is/will be doing and why. Show, don't tell!Also, as mentioned above, the trailer is misleading. There is no dark fairytale to be found and the few scenes shown from the game are the most ""action-packed"" ones (actually, there's rarely that much animation to see). The (actually very enjoyable) narrator used in the trailer isn't the main narrator either."
,Recommended,327220,34222747,Posted: 13 August,all,tarp,"This game started off a bit easy and a bit cutesy, but I stuck it out and am glad I did. It is consitent with quality visuals, and sound. It has witty and cute humor, that seems appropriate for all ages, with some 'wink' jokes for the older crowd. The best aspect is probably the story, especially the side characters and story elements which are reimaginings of classic fairy tales. The puzzles are mostly reasonable, not too challenging, a bit on the easy side with a couple head scratchers. I would say it is of medium length for an adventure game, maybe 10-15 hours, or faster if you follow a guide. I can't place it high on my list, but it is a solid entry in the point and click genre, and worth a play to any fan. I additionally recomend it as a game to play with your child. However, be prepared to do some explaining and console them at the ending. The final act and ending is a major positive to the game, and also in a way the major negative of the game. It reveals a dramatic twist to the story which I won't tell you, which is quite insteresting (perhaps a bit cliched, but it comes together quite nicely), however it disrupts the flow of the game due to the major contrast so late in the game and the length of the segment. In addition *SPOILER* the game sort of hints at it leading up to a disney esque fairy tale ending, and then it abruptly ends with the brothers grimm version *SPOILER* All in all, I give it a B+"

Don't be put off by the cutesy graphics and fairytale setup - the story is well-told and has the characters grow and show surprising depth. This is one of the very few games i've played that features a child protagonist who is not only not annoying, but actually sympathetic. A young and innocent Anna takes off on a quest to save her grandfather and gets caught up in a wonderful fantasy world that blends German fairytale classics with some very light science fiction and solid heroic melodrama. This is a top-notch Daedelic title - great voice acting, beautiful cartoon art, tons of dialog, intuitive puzzles and super slick interface. The only thing i was a little surprised about was that there is no German voice dub, but the English is just fine here. If you're into Daedelic games or modern adventures in general it's a must-buy."

I have a number of the Daedalic games, ever since I purchased the Deponia series during a Steam sale.This game is very very good.  It is cute, funny, and entertaining.  Even though Anna is a young girl, her character is believably strong and brave.The puzzles are not incredibly difficult and the few mini games that do exist are relatively simple.  The story is not unique but it is delivered in a heartwarming way.What I would recommend is picking up the game before too many walkthroughs are released.  This game is well worth the playthrough, and I plan on playing through again to hopefully 100% the achievements.My only gripe is the bonus prologue playable game.  It is great from a storytelling point of view but it is hardly interactive beyond holding the left and right arrow keys.  Watch it for the back story but don't expect anything more than a few minutes of ""play""."

She goes through no character development, and her voice actor is a little irritating.Oddly enough, in the 11th hour, the villain of this story gets a lot of character development. She ends up as the most fleshed-out character in the entire game, and they basically do that in the span of one chapter. The developers did a good job with that, and so it's a shame they didn't spend some of that skill on the first five chapters' worth of storytelling."
,Recommended,327220,33554523,Posted: 15 July,all,rAzZy gOLLy,"Straight to the PROS and CONSPros____1) Instant-likable protagonist (Unlike Deponia's Rufus)2) Cheesy and hilarious text and voice acting (Needle in the haystack was on point)3) Most of the time, the puzzles are straight to the point. (Only tough ones are the bear cages and piano keys)4) Nice voice acting and soundtrack and AFK animationsCons____1) Some of the challenges are just impossible to get through unless you randomly got it or go through the walkthrough (eg : Swan Prince and Bear Cage)2) Sometime in the story, Anna can be a little funny.. Naive as she may be. She doesn't seem to be yor average Jean Gray. Her telekinesis can be useless in many parts where it seem possible to do so.The cons can be easily ignored as they dont really break the game, just that it can improve on those points. Also, I see many complaining about the game, giving it negative reviews because of the Grandpop's attitude and overprotective'ness.. Christ sake, the outside world took Anna's dad and mom.. Play the prologue before ya';ll review.i'd give a solid 9.5/10 as this is one of the rarer nice point and click straight to the point games. will play it again to get perfect achievements. Still, I dont think its worth $20. get it at half price maybe..  Daedalic games constantly get discounts"

There are plenty of puzzles that will make you head to the discussion forums to get another hint or two and several that have rather silly answers that you'll kick yourself for not realizing eariler. The plot is basic, you can skip thorugh a bit of dialogue without really missing the major story arc but you will be able to understand all the nuace if you don't. My only complaint is actually with a few specific puzzles. With out getting all spoiler alert on it, a few times you have to do things that previously, and from that point forward, the protagonist is flat out un-willing to do. Makes figuring out those particular puzzles that much more difficult and also detracts from the character herself. Her moral compass is established early and then for the sake of a couple puzzles it is negated only to come back in full force."

I couldn't put this down and played it in one go.The story centers around young Anna who has lived sheltered with her grandfather on their family farm. One day, her grandfather falls ill and Anna sets out on a quest to find a cure. And this is one amazing quest. Every single character in this game is interesting, likeable, and feels very developed even though they might only be in it for a few minutes or so. And the arty style is just. so. gorgeous.Annas special ability makes her very unique and interesting, and it feels really nice to have a main character who is just so incredibly nice! It feels refreshing; like one of those Humongus Entertainment games we played when we were younger, except this is a lot harder and has a way more adult story... you get my drift.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games, especially the other Daedelic ones.Oh, and did I mention the art style is gorgeous?

,Recommended,327220,28173520,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,LS-Kun,"So, one game that I had been interested in trying out for a while was this game, Anna's Quest. I didn't know a lot about it, but just the trailer and images I saw got me interested to see what it was about. Now, I've finally tried it, and I must say that it is an interesting and rather unique story like a classic fairytale. But first, let's talk about the game itself.PlotYou play as a young girl named Anna who lives on a little farm in the west with her grandfather. He frequently tells her to never go into the woods, but after her grandfather gets gravely ill she does exactly this, hoping to find a way to cure him of his ills. She gets kidnapped by an evil witch and, during her captivity, learns that she has telekinetic abilities, using them to escape and continue on her journey to save her grandfather's life. But what will happen to her on her journey, and why does this witch want her?ProsThe atmosphere of this world is strange, yet familiar, dark, yet inviting, and all helped along by its characters, especially our main character, Anna. She is, though often scared, apologetic, and nervous, a brave and kind heroine that uses both her telekinetic powers and her ingenuity to do what she needs to, from escaping an evil, child eating witch to opening a puzzle locked door. And despite sometimes stumbling and finding herself in doubt of how capable or good hearted she is, she is constantly willing to do whatever she can to help others in need. The other characters also help shape the world even more, from talking rooster musician, Roostwig, and cowardly teddy bear, Ben, to the soothingly dangerous Weisse Frauen and even the Devil himself, creating a world of wonder and silliness while also having darker and sadder moments sprinkled in.Also, the game is relatively easy to understand and play, being a point and click adventure, though will undoubtedly require a little thinking on the part of the players to get through the game. To put it simply, a large chunk of the game is walking from one place to another, grabbing stuff from the environment that will be either used to do something or combined with something else to do something new. While this may end up requiring a lot of backtracking and wandering around to figure out what must be done, the environments are detailed and the music is charming, ensuring you won't get annoyed or bored.And finally, the story is definitely a little cliche and simple in some ways, but in that way it really does seem like a modern fairytale. The story involves witchcraft, talking animals, dragons, and spirits of all shapes and sizes, but it also includes more modern ideas, like science, telekinesis, and, worst of all, BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE! D: However, as you explore the story, you end up finding a lot more complex than just a simple tale of good vs. evil. You'll have to play to learn more, but just know it can be a little sad.ConsHonestly, the worst that I can say about this game is that it feels rather short. There can also be a few bugs where I feel like I don't get a certain achievement despite doing what needed to be done, but truly the worst complaint is, again, its length. While in some ways, it almost seems appropriate for a fairytale-like game to have a fairytale-like length, at the same time it leaves me wanting more. Hopefully, the makers, Daedalic Entertainment, will make a new game later, but for now I am interested in seeing if there will be another Quest to come. Also, I will admit at times it felt like the voice acting was a little flat. Not nearly as awful as, say, ""The Christmas Tree"" or Tommy Wiseau in ""The Room"", but parts where Anna is supposed to be scared don't quite have her sounding scared.OverallDespite my complaints at the short length, I feel that the game is still one I don't regret playing and would happily try a sequel to if/when one comes out. Being able to dip back into Anna's world would be fun and intriguing, and definitely helps it stand as my favorite game of Daedalics I've played so far (though admittedly my experience is limited to this and Deponia). I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in point and click adventures and fairytales."

Anna's Quest gets our vote as the better game by a slight margin. The game feels very polished, the graphics and animations are very good, the story is well written with an interesting world of colorful characters, and the puzzles are often of the sort you can figure out - although there were occasions where we used a walkthrough rather than resorting to lengthy trial and error. The hotspot indicator (indicates what can be interacted with) helps. Overall a great family friendly (7+) adventure game, recommended for any fans of the genre.PROS:Great graphics/animations.Well written story and characters.Suitable for ages seven and up.Lengthy playtime, 10-12 hours or more.Good voice acting.CONS:Some lenghty dialogue and a few too obscure puzzles (as is common with most point and click adventures)."

A delightful throwback that captures the spirit of more traditional point and click games, but with modern controls and graphics, and far less frustration.What's great about the game+ Beautiful art style - cartoon-like, well animated graphics. A lot better than you usually get in a point and click (with some exceptions, of course). And as mentioned before - full of adorable things. Skip the kitten videos for a day and instead play with the baby dragon in this game.+ Decent story. Nothing particularly original, but a well told mash up of fairy tales with a telekenesis spin. The writing and art style gel together superbly.+ Voice acting is decent enough (not stellar but does the job!)+ Great length which makes it pretty good value for money (I left my game running when I wasn't playing it so ignore the run time, but I'm guessing at least 15 of those were active play)+ Good mix of exactly the kind of puzzles you'd expect for a point and click - nothing that'll have you tearing your hair out, either+ Very satisfying ending. Nothing surprising, but it wrapped up all the loose ends and felt fitting with the story.+ Slick controls/UI. No complaints there at all, and I'm usually pretty fussy about these things.What's not so greatVery little I can think of to be honest. The main character does some pretty dumb things at times but that's completely congruous with her trusting character (and she is a child, after all).OverallThis game is bursting with charm and joy and put a smile on my face so many times as I played it. I loved it so much I delayed finishing it because then I wouldn't have it to play any more. Incredibly endearing, and absolutely worth your time. I'm only sad there's nothing else in my backlog that I think would be as delightful to play as this.

,Recommended,327220,24327859,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,The_Last_Starfighter,"Often in adventure games, the protagnist is called upon to bend the rules: stealing, tricking, and exploiting their way to victory,  and this is usually hand-waved as a case of the ends justifying the means for the sake of gameplay. Anna's Quest is the first adventure game I've played which explores this concept as a core theme of the narrative in a very clever way, making full use of the adventure genre as one of the best for ludonarrative harmony.Anna's quest asks the question: ""if those who fight monsters must take care not to themselves become a monster, HOW careful must they be?"" but it does so in a way that doesn't come across as preachy. The game begins with a seemingly fairly simple story and then adds world building at a well paced disgestable rate. The world itself is a fun mixture between a classic fairytale setting, with the occasional addition of contempory technology, in the style of the Monkey Island series, of which it's clear the game has taken inspiration from.The puzzles are mainly based around interacting with inventory items, which is a style I personally enjoy. Some items make themselves useful a number of times, which I like firstly, because it keeps you guessing, and secondly, because it helps with the illusion that the items don't simply exist to solve puzzles, although most inventory items are expended by the time each act is over - it would have been nice to hold on to a few items for longer and have to remember them at some crucial time much later, or have an item be useful many times throughout the entire span of the game.Still, the puzzles that the game has are all pretty creative. There wasn't much that I felt was contrived, and for the majority of the time, I felt like I was being given enough hints for a fair challenge, without having my hand held. Most sections of the game have multiple tasks for the player to accomplish, allowing challenges to be approached non-linearly, again, in the style of the Monkey Island series. For pepole who haven't played many point and clicks before: that's good, because means if you get stuck on one puzzle, you can switch your attention to another puzzle for a while.Although the puzzles aren't all inventory based: there are a few skippable mini-games which provide some variety, but not so many that it makes the game feel as though it's apologizing for being in the adventure genre. There's also a smart puzzle that all takes place during some dialogue, though saying much more would give it away.The art style has a nice whimisical look to it, the most notible ones being the shopkeeper, who you can tell is going to be a grouch from the moment you see him, the town guard, and the Swan Prince, whose cocky expressions made me laugh out loud at some points, probably making him my pick for funniest character of the game. Although I'd probably say my least favorite character design is probably Anna herself. I think it would have been better if she'd been more expressive.With all that said, I was sad to see this game end, not only because (without revealing too much) of the bittersweet finale, but because I really enjoyed it and was left wanting more. I'd be very excited for an Anna's Quest 2."

Artstyle reminds me AdventureTime which is good but overall this game is not very relevant to adults when it comes to humor .My initial impression of this game was negative because it felt generic . I played many point-click games that start you inside locked room so it was very overused concept. However I think this game gets more interesting toward the second half . There are some creative puzzles,characters and enviroments that eventually won me over . Overall this is a solid puzzle game with fluid controls and interesting artstyle .Puzzles themselves were just hard enough to make you think but not burn your brain . I have encounterd only 2 that had wird solutions which is actually good compared to some other games I played . You can also hold a button to see the items that you can interact with which makes it a lot easier . Text in game was well designed to give hints for solutions that are not self-explanatory ( short,fun and to the point)It should take you around 10 hours to beat it at casual rate . For a point-click game it is a good length . I got it on sale and was very pleased with the ammount of content .Voice acting was very top quality which I assume is a common thing with this developer (very consistent and not over the top ) Just the fact that there are so many characters and each had uniqe personality makes it awesome . Also I found myself laughing a lot because of inside jokes targeting people who play point-click games. Developer of this game clearly knows the audience .Score 9/10Anna's Quest is by the book point&click adventure so it plays exactly like a game in this genre should .

I know it might be cheaper to use the voiceactors for more than one role, but at least try to make their voices a little diffrent from character to character then! Jakob, Hans and Ben all had the same voiceactor, and it was way too noticeable, since you hear their voices a much as you do throughout the game.The last thing that bugged me, was how boring the main charcater was. If I have to follow the same bland character though out the whole game, at least make her a little interesting, give her some funny quirks. She's just too dry. The best part of the game was when you played as Winnie because she has a little more depth and a more interesting personality.Despite this it's still enjoyable, and don't get me wrong I liked the game very much, I just expected more from Daedalic Entertainment since they have made far beter games before!I would rather recommend Edna and Harvey than this game, but if you don't like adult humour or are a child, this game is super fun!"

Anna's Quest is a fun click-and-point RPG game which i have really enjoyed playing through these last few days. The puzzles you face are very unique, and sometimes annoying. The gameplay has easy controls, a good feel to it, and a good backstory. I feel as though the flashback level should not have been the last level though only because this game's main character is Anna and not Winfriede. Also, after hearing what Ben said at the very end about Anna makes me think that they're might be a sequel. I feel that they should make a sequel to this game because of the ending AND because of the fact that we still don't know what happened to Anna's parents thanks to the prologue.

The developers weren't exactly breaking new ground.Rather than having magical talent, the main character has a Telekinesis ability that is used to help solve puzzles in the game almost as frequently as her inability to properly pronounce the word. The one thing that will immediately strike most is that the game is geared for a very young audience, and at best could be rated PG for the occasional harsh language. It is the sort of game a parent could be comfortable letting their kids play through.The story itself is classic Germanic Grimm's fairy tales, and it is very well told, but again, no major suprises. If you're used to watching kids shows ala Dora the Explored etc. etc... you can see that the dialogue is pretty straight forward and is pretty bland.One of my sticking points is that the voice-acting is pretty sub-par, and I found Anna's shrill, monotone, I'm-an-innocent-little-girl voice to be pretty grating. Sadly, there are a few instances where some of the other, younger female characters voice acting is so much better, I was left wishing that they had been chosen for the main protagonist instead.Overall, the game is really good, and the puzzles in the later part of the game really require a lot of thinking and are not blatantly obvious to solve, and if you'r a fan of this style of style of game, you'll not be disappointed."
,Recommended,327220,17688330,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,IUserious,"Anna's Quest is by far my favourite point and click game! It's about a little girl with telekensis who sets out on an adventure to find a cure for her sick grandpa. Her level of innocence, empathy, and resourcefulness makes Anna a great character to play as.Much to her detriment, though, she is very naive and trusts everyone too easily. And I guess that has been the best part of her character arc having reached Chapter VI so far. Learning who to trust and not to trust has become a fundamental aspect to the story, and it's great to see her keep pressing onward despite of the betrayals and disappointments she's confronted with.The puzzles in this game are very logical, fun, and very rewarding to figure out. Point and click games are known to have some cryptic puzzles that you'd either need a guide for or several hours staring blankly at the screen, frustrated and scratching your head.You won't have that problem with Anna's Quest, as the puzzles are easy enough to respect your lateral thinking, but not so hard that you sigh or groan is resignation from trying. There were only a couple of times where I needed a guide, but I know that if I spent a little more time to think or exhaust one more possibility, I would've figured them out on my own.My gripe with this game along with anything by Daedalic, though, is the lip sync. Like, is it really that hard to program the lip sync to go with the vast amount of dialogue in this game? What I would also like to see from this company is some close up shots on the characters while they talk, kinda like in Broken Age, and maybe more physical gestures from the characters as they speak.There's also the problem of dialogue strings starting off as if the first syllable or so gets cut off and it's a bit jarring when you're so invested in the dialogue exchange.Lastly, what I do love about this game is the amount of maps there are in it to traverse through per chapter. The point and click games I've played so far have had the tendancy to recycle maybe the same 5 or so locations for most of the game, and that gets a bit boring.Also:I am enjoying a certain part of the game where you get to play as the villain and see their childhood history. That really helps make them more than just an evil and dastardly villain, you see her as just another person with their own feelings and motivations, but who had ultimately made the wrong choices to land them where they are now.All in all, Anna's Quest is a solid game. I got it full price and don't regret it, but if you ever see it on sale, do not hesitate to get it! If you get it for even 50% off, it will out live its value."

There you wish you had the final highscore or the most best ever epic gear there is, until the next expansion shatters your little dream....And there are adventure games like Anna's Quest that have a definite ending to their story.The big difference between them is that in this game you don't want it to end with all the memorable characters, the cute yet simple graphics, the great voice over and the quirky twisting and highly unexpected storytelling.

When  anna knows she is in danger or sees something creepy, you can't hear fear in her voice. the other weakness is the dialogue is long, wordy, which makes it painful when you have to talk to npc to know what to do next.It's unfortunate  because despite of its sweet design, the game is creepy.  there was this man whose wife got kidnapped in plain daylight when she was going to a market.

This dark fairy tale requires you to listen, observe, and solve problems. Each level includes a variety of elements and tools you must use to solve the puzzles placed before you, but the answers aren't always as easy as you may think and require clever choices. For example, in one area you must get a key from a rat, and your options to do so are limited. The answer involves tricking the rat into giving up the key, but how you do it is up to you. Many of the solutions are tricky and can take some time to figure out, so younger players may become frustrated.The game has ghosts, witches, kidnapping, and other dark themes the animation is beautiful and drew me in quickly while the story unfolds like a movie as Anna proves she has the power to overcome evil to return to her grandfather."

,Recommended,327220,31977379,Posted: 26 May,all,rawdogmeat4,"Sheesh. Where did those 9 hours go? I didn't honestly expect the game to last that long. *Nnn-nnh!*Anna's Quest is a point-and-click adventure of an innocent little girl bestowed with the gift of telekinesis. Hard times force her to go on a journey to make things right, and to encounter the evils of the world within. On her journey, she will meet allies, enemies, and characters of all sorts, but who is truly trying to help her, and who is trying to merely use her? This is the story of Anna's Quest, and in it you will learn that being a little girl in the big bad world means nothing if you're brave enough to carry on with your purpose. Innocence shouldn't be taken lightly, for Anna is full of wit.In all honesty though, this isn't a point-and-click adventure as they say: It's a click on everything to solve the insolvable puzzle nightmare. I really don't like looking up tutorials on games because I like to finish them myself, but boy did this game test my wit like no other. It's not so much a bad thing on how the game's setup; it's just that not all puzzles have an obvious answer. My advice to you is: Look at every little detail.I'd like to point out how well-written the characters are. They're not all predictable and one-dimensional as some characters in stories are written. The dialogue is cleverly written with references to real-life situations and sarcastic humor throughout, and each character itself is unique with their own personality, style of acting, and agenda of their role in Anna's Quest. As I said before, some characters do a fantastic job of playing the part of your friend, but betraying you could be their end game.The difficulty of the game is where it stands apart from other point-and-click adventures. It's not a simple method of clicking on an item, getting a brief description, and triggering a cutscene like most. Ohhh, no! You have to put on your tinkerers cap and start combining various knick knacks to continue your quest, and there is always only one answer to the puzzle, but it's not at all obvious, so I advise searching each scene carefully because it's extremely easy to miss it.Replayablity: I'd say I'll come back to the game after I've forgotten some of the story in order to get the rest of the achievements, but it's kinda like going to see a movie at the theater. Do you really wanna go back to the theater to watch it again? Granted, I know you can just buy the movie, but I'm using the theater as an example. The experience is great, and I'll gladly recommend the game to anyone that wants their wit tested that enjoys point-and-click adventures, but you pretty much play through it once, and you get your fill of what you want. Not saying that's a bad thing though. 9 hours for the little I spent on it was more than worth it considering I was surprised how long it took me to complete. (I only looked up a couple tutorial videos for when a couple puzzles became impossible to solve, and the solution was deceitfully obvious)For $20, I can't say if the game is truly worth that much. I mean, I'd rather get 20 hours out of it to pay that much, but I bought the bundle it came in for $28, so I got 14 games for a little over the base price of this game. Give the demo a try, see if you like it. I enjoyed what I played and I'll recommend it to all who I think would also enjoy it.I have seen the Devil... and truly is he hideous!"

Anna's Quest is a nice little Point&Click game about a girl with telekinesis.  The problem is the clunky interface and there is almost no intuition to solving any the puzzles. You end up random using items together and on the background hoping for something to happen. For example there is a rat holding a key, you can't do anything to it when you first see it, and later you can't interact it with it - so what do you do?You combine mold found hidden under the carpet with paint to make ""cheese"" then exchange that with the rat (the rat doesn't talk btw). Most of the puzzles are like this and it's annoying. It doesn't help that there are many background objects that can be interacted with but do nothing [except confuse and/or waste time]It's a shame Anna's Quest is loaded with so much unfun because the art is nice and the story is not bad.

You leave you farm to find a cure for your ill grandfather and are immediately captured.The puzzles in this game are your standard look for this item to make this object to get to this location. The majority of time you will see what you are going to need to do, however there are going to be a few puzzles that will throw you for a loop as they have different outcomes changing what you thought should happen next. There is no dying in this game so you can take all the time you want to figure what you want to do.This game is not going to win any awards as the best looking game. It was designed to look like a children's storybook. The graphics are clean and well detailed but not complex to detract from the story.The voice acting is great. The majority of characters are spot on in with timing and emotions. There are few that seem to be rushed because they wanted to say more but have little time. The dialog is very hit or miss. Some of the stuff that Anna says is quite hilarious while other characters are downright bad. Overall, there is nothing here to detract from the story.The story is really where this game shines. You start off simply trying to escape so you can find a cure for your grandfather. It seems like a simple whimsical challenge with strange characters and items & people who have no reason to even being there. By the time you get to the end of the game however, everything you have seen and done starts to make sense. Everything has a rational reason for happening. A bit of warning, the story will get kind of depressing.If you are looking for a simple game that has a great storyline and a lot of imagination. This is the game for you."

,Recommended,327220,26495508,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,James20,"Excellent well written, well drawn point and click adventure that suffers only from a slow start and weaker voice acting. Characters are somewhat unremarkable until the final chapter that endears the villain, but none are critically flaw and all are simple in a way that reinforces the children storybook style. Overall, fans of point and click won’t be dissatisfied.Let me start out by saying the art is excellent, level design takes into consideration the faster point and click player, and animations are well done and fluid both in game and pre-rendered clips.The story is fairly simple, a girl must find a cure for her grandfather by embarking on an adventure that reveals she has greater destiny than she ever imagined. In telling this tale, the story incorporates classic children’s fairy tale characters. Nothing is done to intricately, not on the scope of “Into the woods” or Shrek, but enough to appreciate the care that went into writing.As I said before characters are unremarkable.  They are simple to a fault, but it does make the story feel more like a children’s fairy tale.  At no point during the story is there any character growth.  Every character essentially has the same resolve and motivations from introduction to conclusion.  Anna’s is the closest to growing when her resolve is shaken by moral complexities, but she arrives at the conclusion doing what she had been is fine. This might seem like a flaw in the story but revelations in last chapter suggests this was fully the intention.Voice acting is the biggest issue with Anna’s Quest. I don’t want to disparage the actor’s efforts but the acting is weak, delivery is dulled, and Anna’s voice in particular is just sounds off.  That said, I wouldn’t say it so bad that you should consider not buying it.The pacing of the story is skewed heavily towards the end.  The start delivers so little plot that it feels like you are playing an escape the room game instead of an adventure game. The middle only just trickles in world building. It’s only at the last 2 chapters that you get any real character background and true story relevant events. However, the ending does tie up all details covered in the beginning and middle.The ending, like other say, can be somewhat disappointing. There’s no big final puzzle, you dive into villain’s motivation and play a chapter similar to previous chapter. Then a video plays and the game ends. The moral of the story probably leaves a bigger impact than anything else. Essentially destiny is inescapable and morality cannot be taught. It’s not exactly “hero triumphs against all odds”, but it does reinforce themes presented throughout the story.All that said those are my heaviest criticism against the game and none would keep me from recommending it. I encountered 1 glitch that required Ctrl+Shift+Esc, but it was easily reproduced and avoidable and the game gracefully restarted from where a left off. While Anna’s Quest may not be a memorable classic on par “Day of the Tentacle”, it stands well on its own as a point and click and a well developed story."

But then I started reading into things, like the post-credits dialogue, the difference between being pure of heart and being clever, the contrast of fatalism and free will. I'm not going to spoil it, but I realized something. The theme of this game and the way that it's executed through the story just might be genius.Edit: Just had to run back here to say that it also has one of the best depictions of the devil that I've ever seen."

How good are the plot, setting and characters?  And how well do the two connect?The puzzle side of Anna's Quest is okay.  While I did have to look up a few solutions, in all but one case I felt that I should have been able to solve the puzzle, and I gave up too early.  Items are reused and there are several challenges that go beyond 'find the thing to put on the thing'.The puzzles also do a reasonable job furthering the plot.  This is most obvious with Anna's growing in-game powers representing her own development as an individual.However, the greatest strength in this game lies on the story-side.  Anna herself manages to be a believable young girl without being annoying.  The setting has some incongruous elements, and the timeline seems a bit wonky, but by drawing on various elements of Germanic folklore the world seems to breathe.  The humour usually hits the mark without overshadowing the drama.But it is the game's last chapter that  really stands out.  Obviously, I can't spoil exactly what happens, but everything comes together to give a new perspective, and grant the story much greater depth.If you do not like point-and-click games in general, Anna's Quest is probably not the game that will change your mind.  But if you are open to this genre, you'll find this one worth your time."
