,Not Recommended,327260,15063134,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,James Rossi,This game claims to be about following a single character through a number of console systems. You would think that emulating the game and art styles would be important then. While superficially and at a single glance the art styles change they do not actually conform to limitations present by each system. Instead every console plays exactly the same other than a new coat of paint. If you are attracted to the idea of playing games through the ages this is not for you. If you want a bog standard platformer that doesn't seem to actually understand the appeal of its own themes then go nuts.

Play Life of Pixel!This game faithfully recreates the aesthetic of the good old consoles and gaming computers. Each stage is thematic (Atari, NES, Amiga, Master System, Commodore 64, and so on) and starts with curiosities and technical information about these machines.Nostalgia is very strong here. You really feel you're playing a classic from the past (and there's a lot of homages, like Pitfall, Mario and Mega Man levels). The chiptune soundtrack is made using the original sound-chips for each machine Even some graphical glitches very common on 8-bit systems are recreated.The game itself is challenging, but it isn't frustrating in any way. Your goal is to collect gems to pass levels, special gems to unlock more levels and fruits/candy to unlock even more levels and some achievements.Life of Pixel is recommended to every gamer that has passion for this hobby. It's a joy to play!"
,Recommended,327260,12604818,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>,"Initial impressions, revised:This is another in a long line of feel-good, reverent throwbacks to my gaming childhood: a 2D platformer designed in the aesthetic of several 80s-90s-era, 8 and 16-bit video game consoles, including personal computers of the era.You play a green pixel, appropriately named Pixel, who's fed up with being one in millions on the screens of the latest and greatest AAA titles. Pixel wants to harken back to a simpler time, when pixels really meant something other than a spec on a monitor/TV size chart and a speck on the screen. As a result, Pixel ventures back into the past when games and pixels were married to each other, an age when compressing graphical fidelity into a system required deftly manipulating the limitations of the console with every game.Inside each console (there's quite a few) you can find a short but varied series of platforming levels, all of which are designed in such a way as to emulate the look and feel of many retro consoles and computers including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 2600, NES, etc. Needless to say, the visual design is wonderful, simple and effective at provoking nostalgic flashbacks and is easily one of my favorite features.In the latest update, certain nostalgic rendering effects have been put in as well, allowing you to emulate a distorted CRT television, the likes of which were often used as personal computer monitors back in the 80s, among other display types with various color palettes.The game also takes the time and care to ape the SOUND of the emulated consoles, as well. Choosing one of them on the levels screen, each console cheerfully plays a startup chirp/noise uniquely identifiable as coming from the original thing. This console-specific treatment also extends to the levels' musical tracks, all of which are extremely reminiscent of the original soundchips.Each console's levels and their start screens even go into specific detail on the release date, clock speed and onboard memory of the console among other things, making the game itself more and more like an easy-to-understand encyclopedia on each console's defining characteristics.The gamepad controls in the initial release of the game were not perfect, but I'm proud to say the latest patch Xbox 360 controller support has been very improved with custom keybinding support among other things. This took out my main complaint about the game and I applaud the developer for improving it so quickly after launch.I have, unfortunately, not played the game long enough to encounter one of the many purported hidden easter eggs in the game, but I imagine them to be just as authentic as the rest of the game's retro aesthetic and will update this review accordingly when I bump into one.The difficulty of each of the levels are, I feel, exactly what you'd expect from games from that era: shallow learning curve, exponentially steeper difficulty curve. Expect to make multiple attempts at beating each level in one life and in the shortest time possible, although this is not necessary to complete levels and your mileage may vary in terms of how difficult the game is for you. I imagine it is necessary to unlock hidden consoles and other secrets, however.Final verdict:Exactly what I expected in a nostalgia title. Retrogaming buffs will probably find a lot to enjoy from this game, and I feel it's well worth the price."

The game spans 13 consoles, beginning with the ZX81 and Atari 2600, and ending with the NES, SNES, Sega Master System, and Sega Genesis.You are a square with a face named Pixel who has befriended an elderly, bespectacled, mustachioed, professorial pixel with a face who often shows up to give hints. Your friendship is based on your interest in the evolution of game systems over time and his knowledge of each, conveniently and informatively passed on to the player when selecting a stage from the appropriate system. Each system has 8 stages, and to progress to the next stage a number of collectables have to be collected, and the exit reached. Additionally gems and special food items can be collected on many stages, which unlock additional systems.The main joy of the game is getting to play a game with 13 different graphical styles, 13 different bit appropriate musical selections, and some numerous design decisions/flaws/necessities of the past, experiencing the evolution of the artform and the graphical changes in Pixel, the environment and the various enemies in the game. The lower end systems serve as a simple gameplay introduction, being easy, more abstract graphically with low quality music, but this is part of the experience, and each new system seems refreshing for its recognizable advancements and differences. In addition there are a slew of referneces to classic games from the past, as well as some winks and nods to the platforming genre and classic game design, delivered with the classically dry English charm.The controls are fluid and simple, with a clean double jump and a button for basic item gathering and use. There are also a handful of vehicles ranging from bubbles to skateboards that are used for a number of levels. At no point did I experience any frustration with the controls or jumps. The difficulty scaling is gradual, and the game overall is not designed to be challenging, nor is it ever significantly challenging with most stages completed after a few attempts. Though each stage is small, there are over 100 total stages, meaning that this game has a significant amount of content that can easily satisfy for long enough to justify its price. The stage designs themselves are often rather inspired, and finding secrets is of an appropriate difficulty to neither be frustrating nor overly trivial.All in all, the game is a delightful experience to play, that is elegantly and thoughtfully presented with evolving audio, visuals, and game design coinciding with the actual development of the systems represented.This review was produced using fair-trade pixels sourced ethically from local producers. Pixels have been in production since the early 60's, and though numbers vary experts predict there are between 2 and 20 quadrillion pixels alive today.

Its literally a trip through gamings golden (and not so golden) eras.  You play as a pixel who wants to see what he's all about, so he traverses through levels going from as early as the atari 2600 & zx spectrum up to the mid nineties with mega drive and snes.  What impresses me most is the care he put into making the graphics (and the music) sync up with the systems they represent.  Before I knew what soundfonts were I would wonder why SNES games sounded different from Genesis.  Or notice that SNES had 256 colors while Genesis had 64.  He captures all that, and it is impressive all the way to the beginning.  Great job!  The detail you put into your work did not go unnoticed.  Oh yeah, did I mention it's fun to play?

,Recommended,327260,12909717,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,Imban,"A fun romp through old computer and console nostalgia that still holds up even if you haven't played all of the things it references, Life of Pixel is a solid platformer with responsive controls.It's a fairly challenging game, with its 104 levels ranging from 30 seconds to 3 minutes in length, with no mid-level checkpoints and most things killing you in one hit and the rest in two. This can get frustrating with some of the longer levels, but none are so long that it felt unfair - Burning Down the House was about the worst it got. There's some glitchy behavior with instant-death water that's level with the ground (where sometimes you ""fall in"" and die despite being still visually on the ground), as well as the potions (which let you kill enemies by jumping on them, but sometimes you just die anyway), but none of it's game-breaking because the potions are never required and water that's level with the ground is rare.Life of Pixel is pretty amazing in terms of recreating the visual and audio styles of 13 different consoles and computers from the 80s and 90s. Whereas some other games (like Syder Arcade, for instance) had different classic visual styles as something of a gimmick, in Life of Pixel it's not just a gimmick where you can make the game look worse if you want, it's actually the game, and it generally stays fairly good looking even on the more limited systems.While you're likely to most fully enjoy the game if you've played at least some of the systems and games it attempts to evoke nostalgia for, Life of Pixel is pretty fun even if you just want to see a bit of what games looked like back before you started playing as well, and gets a solid recommendation from me."

Life of Pixel is remniscent of the days when console games didn't have battery backup for saved game profiles, it uses the elements of game design to teach the player how to play the game, and even mirrors some of the graphical glitches present in old consoles. For someone like myself who started with an Intellivision, and played various Apple ][, DOS, NES, SNES, Atari, Colecovision, etc., I felt right at home with this game right out of the box. Literally everything about this game was well engineered to mimic the feel of retro gaming, and for that it serves it's purpose extremely well, better than most games that attempt to be ""retro"". I highly recommend this game for anyone who has played lots of old platformers, but I do not recommend it for those who have only played modern games and expect a pat on the back."

,Not Recommended,327260,15639357,"Posted: 1 May, 2015",all,raidenradio,"While I would certainly give this game a 10/10 on concept, the execution of this concept leaves a lot to be desired. I got about 1/3 through the game before I realized that there wasn't really any significant progression other than the graphical presentation. It would have been nice if your character actually developed as the graphics had, but just being a pixel really exacerbated the lack of development.The concept basically masks that the game isn't progressing in any meaningful way as you play. Most of the enemies don't really do anything other than walk back and forth, even if they have completely different appearances. The game is over-reliant on spikes/pits/water in that they make up 99% of the challenge.I think this would make a really good game if a little more thought went into elements besides the concept, or at least incorporated that concept into the game itself. Maybe a story about bumbling fool protagonist in a town whose citizens get turned into blocks? With everyone looking like blocks the main character is mistaken for the town's hero and they send him out to save the town. The player has to visit the towns of Atariville, NESburg, who have met similar fates and free them. As the player goes through the game he begins to look more like his former self, before reaching the end where he battles the town's ""hero"" who was the villain. He returns to town looking just as he did at the start, and they learn that they have underestimated him."

,Recommended,327260,19324057,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,FreezingInferno,"Well, this is an interesting little thing, I'll give it that much. What we've got here is a simple retro-themed jumpy game with the gimmick of going through different ""eras"" of video game consoles and home computers. Credit has to be given to the selection here; rather than just a simple Nintendo-centric view of old video games like a lot of this genre boils down to, they have a wide variety of consoles on display here, each with their own quirks. Consoles like Atari 2600 and Sega Master System are here, as well as 80's computers like the Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum. The aesthetic for each platform is represented well enough, and there's plenty of variety; although there's only one track for each console's set of 8 levels. You'll be hearing that one track a lot.This game's tough, and not an entirely fair tough. It's a masocore-esque jump game with lots of instant death hazards, and surprise spikes are in abundance here. If that kind of thing puts you off, this isn't for you. Hell, I like my games hard and it still soured me because there are also no checkpoints. Fine and dandy when you have single screen affairs, but the issues compound when the consoles get more advanced. By the time you hit the NES and SNES eras, the levels have become two to three-minute long sprawling stages where one missed jump or failure to know a trap was ahead in advance leaves you to redo the whole thing over. Some might call that being faithful to old video games and their high difficulty level, but I disagree; even the hardest NES games hadcheckpoints, for goodness's sakes. The shorter levels end up being tolerable, but those longer ones really drove me up the wall with this.Though the graphics and sound evolve over time as you advance console generations, the gameplay almost never changes. What few new wrinkles they add in are either minor gimmicks or rarely used. There are some powerups, but they're so few and far between and minor that they only alter things for a handful of stages. The majority of the game is just you and a double jump against enemies that walk back and forth, flying enemies guarding jumps that annoy more than challenge, and a bunch of instant death. If nothing else, the control is almost without fault; the only issue being the awkward momentum when jumping from moving platforms.All in all, it's mediocre. I paid 2 bucks for it and got 5 hours out of it. It's worth that, I guess, and I'm giving it a ""recommended"" since I don't outright despise it. It's not terribly offensive or anything. It's just kind of there. An admirable attempt at emulating a variety of old console aesthetics, but the actual game part isn't really all that hot, I'm afraid. If you see it on sale and you like old video games and don't mind the ""new"" retro style of instant kill spikes everywhere, you'll probably dig it. Otherwise, it might not be your thing."

It really needs a bit more attention to detail to nail the feeling of the old systems that are being imitated. My biggest complaint is the ""analoguey"", smooth movements and animations, particularly of the player. Making the graphics blocky with limited palettes is only going to get you so far, as the illusion is totally shattered when you can move in fractions of what is supposed to be a pixel. The weird particle effects are even moreso out of place.It ends up just looking and feeling like a modern 2d platformer with a ""retro"" skin than a true retro experience. Which would be fine if retro wasn't obviously what the game was trying to go for.More thought should also have been given to the music. Apparently to the developer(s), ""chiptune"" is enough description to qualify for a retro game. The tunes match neither the levels nor the system. The sound limitations were often just as interesting and characteristic of a system as the graphics, and to truly replicate the experience of a particular system the sounds are just as important as the visuals.Then there's the gameplay. It's not bad, but very uninspired and basic. Elegant simplicity is one thing, but this is just meh.TL;DR:This game seems like it was made to look retro just for screenshots.If you want a real retro experience that truly replicates the hardware limitations of a system, try ""You Have To Win The Game"" or ""Super Win The Game""."

I absolutely love the idea behind it, but the execution is so flawed it is not worth playing.As I am sure youhave figured out from the trailer, life of pixel is an old school platformer that takes you through various generations of games.  The game starts out in black and white, one room levels with very simple graphics.  As you progress through more and more levels you open up new systems which open up better graphics and more complex levels.The problem is the levels are incredibly poorly designed.  The later levels are broken down into rooms and there is some exploration involved.  There is no way to look up/down/left or right, which in turn leads to an enormous amount of leaps of faith.  For example in one level you are on top of a cliff in a cave, you cannot see anything below you but the only way to go is down.  So you go down and are on another level of the cave, again you see an opening in the floor, and the assumption is to go down again, but this time it leads you to a pit with instant death.  The game is littered with moments like this where you blindly leap onto the next screen only to instantly die and have to redo the level, and there are no checkpoints so you always have to redo the level from the beginning.This game desparately needs  a feature that allows you to look around the levels so you are not blindly running into things that you had no idea were around.  If the developers added that I would give the game another go, but as it stands the game is too much blind jumping to recommend, especially given how many other vastly superior platformers exist on steam."

But otherwise it is a very fair game with bits that are just a little bit evil. Mostly in the beginning stages where the levels dont scroll with the player but screen after screen, those can be tricky.

Most enemies act similar, but has the two most anonying elements to have: Following and randon patterns. Sometimes you can be locked because of bad placement and insistceny of a eneny on a place. There's inscontancies about game rules (sometimes, crytals fall, sometimes don't, sometimes no floor means bottonless, sometimes doesn't)Level design is another poor thing, it many times doesn't know what it's doing it certaing platforms, but in special it doesn't know sometimes where to place the player, putting you in places where you need to go forward and back, making you go zig zag. Almost every level has the same challange (something related with spikes). The game boasts about having secrets and collectables, while some are well made, others are really blalant and makes me think that they were added for display only... But the top goes to the delay bonus you can have to jump off platforns you don't are on, necessary for two levels and the guide dang it! Some levels lack old-school good sense, as not having enemies go thru scenes if you are making a game with locked cameras, or having visual references for bigger than one screen jumps.The game is very buggy, I found random grapical lag, the game drawing stuff off-screen (you can see extra stuff up and down, problems with getting off of the airship, pressing anemies with pushables, You following the platform acceleration you jumped off (visible on the first amiga level, probably a feature, but makes jumps a lot harder), and bugs about tile collision on the first console (you will sink on water even if you are more than half sit on a solid tile).In the museum aspect the games mess-up badly (and this is main motive for a negative review). To start, we have a widescreen resolution when you are playing consoles of ""square"" resolutions (the resolutions are even display in the info charts...). We have a mario sound effect play on every console who has a time switch (including Sega ones... really?), grapics quality that suspicily overpasses the original systens..., lacking caracterization for 16-bit console graphics. Thinking that showing that you will die a lot is retro... And only tecnical information about the systens, almost ignoring historical placement of the consoles... (where is the console wars between Sega and Nintendo?, main inovations between platforms?) even more salty because of all the useless apearences of the professor in the levels.I feel sorry about pixel, he went out thinking that he discovered his past, but he doesn't really know why it was awesome.A better option for you, player, is to do a is a gamesutra + wikipedia + emulators combo, it can be indigest to start but you will be better served in all aspects."

Sometimes the enemies get stuck inside platforms or walls, especially the flying ones appear to sometimes take paths they weren't supposed to make but the first solves itself if you wait for a short while and the second is not a problem and actually makes for ""a little bit more realistic air enemies"".HOWEVER: I am a completionist by heart and while I enjoyed grinding for all the achievements (especially the additional hardcore ones) there is one particular level that is needed for the latter that is not only extremely frustrating but also sort of ""unfair"" and I am going to explain why (I am not going to be too precise but it is a level you unlock pretty early in the game).In order to get the final achievement you need to collect everything there is to get in all levels which feature extra collectibles and finish them in one go - meaning that if you die you have to collect everything in the level from scratch.This level incorporates a secret dungeon of sorts that is fairly long and features quite a few rooms compared to the size of pretty much all the other levels/secret areas in the game. I am just going to jump to the area that was bugging me.After you got the special pickup you have to press a switch to get out of a dungeon of sorts, but the path is of course plastered with spikes and enemies, nothing unusual for a game like this if it wasn't for a final ""tunnel area"" with robots walking left to right. They are blocking your way and it is too narrow to evade them by jumping, forcing you to either play it smart and wait until they leave the tunnel so you can pass them or just rush through and sacrifice one of your two health points in the process.In order to reach the exit in time the only option is number two. Of course this whole feat is by no means impossible as I got the achievement eventually but in my book this sort of breaks a rule in video games. A level can be hard as hell but still has to leave you with the possibility of finishing it ungrazed, which is not possible in this case (at least for me).Sorry about my whining, apart from that the game was fun to play and enriches the genre."

You need to collect various gems to unlock the exit and progress to the next level, while avoiding traps and enemies.  There is not much mechanically to do.  You can jump and double jump; that's it.  The control is spot on and the game relishes in its simplicity.Graphically, Life of Pixel is quite good.  If anything, the various renderings of older technology look better than I remember.  Fortunately, there is an option to apply various filters to recreate the feeling of playing old games on a washed out CRT monitor, scan-lines and all.The best for me, though, is the audio.  The game recreates the old-school chiptunes style soundtracks of games of old.  Just listening to the music for the various levels is the best part of this nostalgia trip for me.Overall, if you grew up through the 8 bit and 16 bit eras of games and want a dose of nostalgia, this is a worthy game to get.

PLEASE...) And there's not much innovation as the levels go on (and what little abilities DO Get introduced are rarely used throughout the game) which makes the gameplay stale after a while...Perhaps my biggest complaint is how punishing it is when you die. If you spent like 2-Minutes going around collecting Diamond things and get killed (and there are A LOT of insta-kill obstacles, as if only having 2 HP and only One Health Pick-Up IN THE ENTIRE GAME wasn't bad enough...) Anyway, if you die, you have to start ALL THE WAY BACK at the beginning of the level as all of the collectibles mandatory for finishing the Level Respawn. If Pac-Man respawned all of the Pellets you have to collect after Dying JUST ONE TIME, I'm pretty sure that game wouldn't be fun for too long either...My recommendation for fixing this error would be the ability to continue your progress in a level. Say for example: Give a player 3-5 Lives, and if they lose all of them before completing the level, THEN Respawn all of the Diamonds and Stuffs!Honestly, I'd like to see a possible sequel to this game, as there is SOME level of talent and competence in the people who made it and there's a lot of potential with this kind of material (despite my frustration with this game, I'd still be interested in seeing levels for the Neo Geo, Turbografx-16/PC Engine, Game Boy Advance, Possibly even 5th Generation Consoles, or...

Anyways you take control of pixel, who is a square pixel-looking object. Your main goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gems hidden around each level, there is also a secret gem every level, but that ne isn't required. It can be really tedious in each level because sometimes the levels could be huge and the gems could be anywhere, also with only 2 health you can die very easily, and when you die there is no saving all the gems you collected. Fortunately there is no Gamover, but it does track your death total for each level and it also tracks your time aswell. Some of the enemies can be really tedious to avoid because their A.I. seems to be RnG based. And with no way to kill your enemies in the game, getting around them proves to be a challenge and you can end up waiting minutes for them to move into the perfect spot just so you can bypass them. there is a double jump feature within the game, but if you don't use it quick enough the gravity will outweigh your jump and you'll be left to fall. However even though this game ca be tedious at times there is an abundance of refrense content to the consoles and how they played out, also the graphic style changes each console and even soem of the enemies.

The enemies themselves are annoying. In particuar they are the flying ones and the ones that just move left to right on a platform. The reason they're crap is that they have no sense of direction or pattern. They might just hover on top of a vital spot you need to go to or maybe you're behind them just shifting along trying to get that one little diamond they seem to cover but then all of a sudden at complete random they might turn around without any notice. They did not reach the end of their platform, they just turned around. It get's really frustrating. On another note if you're one to hate bats or one hit kill spikes then STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. This game is the king of spikes. I will update this if I am ever to find a leginimate game with more spikes than Life of Pixel. Maybe this game is supposed to be unfair considering one of the levels is literally called ""Leaps of Faith"" for crying out loud!I was going in hoping that this might replace my lost love that is Pix'n Love Rush. I sort of knew it wouldn't but this game just eventually breaks you down and make you go numb. This is probably the most I've ever said ""Oh F*CK"" in a game ever. The idea is cute but the level design is crap, it offers either loads of one hit kill spikes, a tonne on bad enemy placements or just dozens of goddanm diamonds to collect. If you're still interested in it go ahead. Maybe there is something that I cannot see that you find appealing but I didn't like it. I'd say try and get Pix'n Love Rush instead on PSP if you can. It's also on Android and iOS but I didn't like the controls.Life of Pixel gets a 4/10 It looks nice but the level design can be horrid with lots of one hit kills and long slogging platforming along with horrid enemy placement, leaps of faith and first time traps. Oh and spikes. Never ever ever forget about the spikes..."

Constant bugs that require Task Manager in Windows 7 to turn off the client and restart.  Graphics modes that require you to activate then try the next mode as opposed to a selection.  No apparent choice of sound and music volume.  Some graphics modes that make menu selection nearly impossible.  It is just not ready for prime time.  Play control with my joystick is overall decent though a few times it will give me the audio of having made a jump yet I am still counted as dying to spikes anyhow.  Some graphic tearing as well and no real information what the menu options actually DO.  And some informational text is seemingly inaccessible.  If you can scroll down or whatever to read I am unaware of it.  As it stands it is more or less a Dollar purchase until these bugs and irritations are taken care of.  I don't feel ripped off at the 3.50 I paid for it on sale but I am seriously annoyed at the complete lack of polish."

As a piece of nostalgy and the feeling that the right kind of musical and visual style give this is something I do recommend (even though the visuals are partially better than they would have been on the actual old machines). But as a game I'm disappointed with it and wouldn't recommend it.In my view the level design is the biggest flaw in the game. Sometimes the levels are boring collectathons, sometimes it seems that they weren't designed for the double jump mechanic in mind which means you get through them in a way that just doesn't seem right for the level. In general the levels feel uninventive or include a mechanic that doesn't feel like it belongs to a level (like having to bomb a wall).Regarding level design, it's not that the levels would be too hard, it's just that they challenge you in the wrong way. One of the most annoying things is that the emerging spikes are used as a recurring thing throughout the systems. They often kill you for two very wrong reasons. For one the player maybe didn't wait to check where the spikes are. Well, waiting is boring (which by the way applies also to levels where you have to wait a long time for enemies to go out of the way too). The second one: the player didn't know how far inside the ground the spike needs to be in order to not be killed. Not really fun discovering this rule. And well, as an extra reason: I found a bug that the spikes are active even when you pause the game.Verdict:As there is no neutral option, I'll give this a thumbs up, as the price isn't that high and you get a nice feeling of the old systems with even some trivia. But if you're looking for a good game, interpret this as a thumbs down."

The game may seem easy but the levels get so long SOMETHING is going to f*ck you over. In the honeycomb level i missed 2 gems and i couldn't get them because the falling platforms don't come back and my play glitched into the wall so that wasn't an option. I uninstalled in spite of the developer.

It was a nice trip down memory lane, being able to see some of our favorite old time consoles getting a bit of love, and I enjoyed looking back on how graphics and audio progressed. But I don't feel it does enough, and the nostalgia quickly wore off within the first few hours.There's a boatload of consoles to play through, each with  a set of 8 levels, going from the early ZX81, through the Atari, Apple, Commodore 64, NES, and SNES phases, while including some other lesser known computers as well. Some are locked until you hit certain achievements.Having gone through an entire set of 8 consoles (a total of 64 levels), plus a few extra levels on some of the various other computer stages, it was time to call it quits. I may revisit some of the other stages later on, but the biggest gripe I have is that it focuses too much on the graphics and audio of each passing console world, but hardly any of the mechanics that separated them from each other."
