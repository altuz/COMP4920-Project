The steam version is 100% correct to the old version based on what I have seen.  If you are able to get past the old graphics, this is a Sid Meier's game with a lot of fun to be had.  I tried running this game on a Vista and a Windows 8 PC, both ran well.You play the part of a explorer who has been given free reign by your King/Queen.  You build colonies to gather trade goods to ship to the mother land for cash. There are also Three other Computer players competing with you. While building your Colony network, you slowly receive higher and higher taxes.  After much work, you can build up the Rebels in your country and try to fight for your Independence!Based on the game age, this is a Nine out of Ten!!"

This just wraps DOSBox (which is free anyway) around the 20 year old DOS binary. With the difference that when using a normal DOSbox you can at least properly configure it. This messes up my screen resolutions, and I have to manually reset them afterwards. Also unlike playing the old game in normal DOSbox, there is no option for windowed mode, despite this game only needing 320x240 resolution.I was hoping for an upgrade from the sometime flaky experience of playing the original game inside DOSbox, but this is worse.That this isn't mentioned anywhere on the game description is borderline fraud."

76561197988610037,Recommended,327400,12438848,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,Greywander,"This is the classic game you all remember, unchanged in any way as far as I can tell.  For those new to Colonization, you'll find this to be a solid Sid Meier strategy game that deviates from the strict formula of the Civilization series.  If retro games aren't your thing, this game was also remade using the Civ 4 engine.The gameplay focuses on building up an economic empire in the New World, with your primary source of income coming from shipping valuable goods back to Europe to sell.  Your eventual goal is to create a self-sufficient nation and declare independence from from your parent country back in Europe.  Along the way, you'll have to compete with other European powers settling the New World, as well as increasingly troublesome (but wealthy!) natives.Starting off, the game is quite forgiving.  The other European powers are generally more focused on building their own empires than on wiping you out, but can andwillcause you trouble later.  Similarly, the Native Americans all start off friendly toward you and even give you free stuff, but their attitude will gradually sour toward you, even if you just leave them alone.  This will sound cold and heartless, but in the end, genocide is the best solution, as theywillharass you without end otherwise.  The huge amounts of treasure you'll get from looting Indian villages is just a bonus.As I said above, the gameplay deviates quite a bit from the standard Civ fomula.  There are a lot more resources, for one thing: 16 material goods, as well as a few immaterial resources, like liberty bells (increases rebel sentiment, which gives bonuses to production, and attracts Founding Fathers) and crosses (attracts immigrants).  Of the material goods, most are meant solely for selling, but the rest are vital for running your colonies.  I'll explain this a bit more indepth further down.Another difference between this and Civ is that Population = Units.  Aside from ships, wagons, and artillery, all your units are colonists that can be given different equipment to create different units.  Each colonist can be trained in one profession, giving them a bonus to performing that job (usually, increasing resource yields).  When asigning a colonist to work a tile around your colony, they can only gather one resource at a time, but you won't usually need more than one of any type of gatherer except for farmers.  You can also asign colonists to work the buildings inside your colony.  For example, the weaver's house converts cotton into cloth.Colonists are also your units.  Give them tools to turn them into a Pioneer so they can build roads, clear forests, and plow fields.  Give them horses to turn them into a Scout, which moves faster, sees farther, can interact with native villages, and gets better results from lost cities.  Give them muskets to turn them into Soldiers, your most basic and most common military unit, or equip a Soldier with horses to make them a stronger and faster Dragoon.  Also of note is thatany colonist can found a colony; there's no ""settler"" type unit like in Civ.As far as ships go, most of them are used for hauling loot and trading.  Of special mention, though, is the Privateer.  A Privateer's ownership is invisible except to the player that owns it.  This means that Privateers can attack other players even when you are at peace with them, but at the same time your Privateers are also fair game to any Frigates in the area.  Hurray for piracy!Another difference from Civ is that there is no research or tech tree.  The closest analogue would be the Founding Fathers, which confer various bonuses, including things like unlocking buildings, and are earned with liberty bells.  Since liberty bells also increase the desire for independence among your colonists (which will eventually net you bonuses to resource production), you'll want lots of them anyway.If you want a strong and self-suficient colony, there are a few things you absolutely need:OCEAN ACCESS:  Since a large part of the game revolves around trade, you absolutely need a way to load a ship up with goods.  Landlocked colonies aren't impossible, as you can use wagons to transport goods to a colony with a port, but I'd reccomend beginners stick with seaside colonies at first.FOOD:  Your colonists need to eat.  Shipping food to a perpetually starving colony is no fun and better avoided altogether.  Fortunately, food is pretty easy to get as long as you're not settling in the arctic.  Food can also be converted into horses, which is important for a strong military.  You need at least 2 horses in a colony and then they'll breed automatically.LUMBER:  Lumber is converted into hammers by a carpenter.  This is how you build buildings in your colonies.  You can buy buildings with gold, but that quickly gets expensive.  You can also ship lumber in from another colony, but this can be a pain.  Just make sure to keep one forest tile next to your colony, as you shouldn't need more than one lumberjack.ORE:  Ore is converted into tools, which are used by Pioneers for terraforming.  20 tools are consumed for every terraforming job.  Also, all but the most basic buildings will also require tools to build.  As such, you'll need to have a steady supply of tools.  And once you're done terraforming and building buildings, tools can be turned into muskets.Aside from the above, everything else is optional.  You don't need sugar, or furs, or cotton, or tobacco.  These will help you make some cash, but they're largely interchangeable with one another.Some last tips:  Remember, the natives are not your friends!  Or, at least, they won't be for very long.  Whatever you do, DO NOT give them horses or muskets.  You can make alotof quick cash by trading with the natives early on, but they'll quickly wise up that you're scamming them.  You can prevent tax hikes by reenacting the Boston Tea Party, which will increase rebel sentiment in that colony, but also makes you unable to trade that resource in Europe anymore.  Lastly, make sure you're ready for a war of apocalyptic proportions before declaring independence.  I'm not kidding.This game was perhaps my favorite growing up, and while it's aged a bit (really missing edge-scrolling and right-click-to-move), it's still a very solid game, and I'd heartily reccomend it to anyone interested in the genre."

76561197996089544,Not Recommended,327400,31751547,Posted: 14 May,all,Nailes,"I am a fan of the original game. I got it back in 1994 and if a Steam counter existed back then I'd have at least five thousand hours on it. When I saw it available on Steam I bought it and immediatly started playing.The base game seemed like the original, building my first colonies and manufacturing goods. I enjoyed myself until I decided to get rid of my French neighbours.I prepared a little army, with several veterans and some artillery. The initial combat went my way.The combat in this game is basicly a diceroll you can influence by using better units or by using advantageous terrain like mountains or forest. By doing so I was able to first defeat a few French dragoons, turning them into militia(infantry) and then defeated them again and captured them as unarmed colonists. Then I decided to move against his colony and the forces he set up to defend it. I hit his first dragoons, lost the diceroll and my veteran dragoons were destroyed. Uhm, excuse me? I played this game often enough to remember that any defeated unit gets demoted to the next lower level, instead I just lost a veteran, dissapeared, destroyed, not even an unarmed colonist left. I fought a bit more to see what was going on and, in the same fashion, lost several more veteran dragoons. Effectively setting me back to some garrisoned militia and artillery, incapable of offensive actions. what a letdown.Oddly enough, a unit defending a colony demotes as per the original. For a little while there I thought it was me but nope, I actually got a copy of the original game from somewhere else, this is not how the original works.If you are a fan of the original game, then I'm sorry to say this isnt a copy of that. If you do not mind that bug or another attempt at a 'better' remake(those were always a step back), then you may enjoy it. I found it horrible, cant recommend."

DOS is one word I didn't see at all on the store page.  I was sincerely hoping for the later version as the music was perfect for the game, and the graphics were still better than DOS pixelation I haven't seen since playing Krozi on my old x386.  Alright, yes I exagerate, but its the same shock factor of getting not the Classic I knew.Fantastic game, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was a DOS version.

,Recommended,327400,13352197,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,NOOB,"I used to play this game soon after its first release which was 20 years ago, so seeing it now around here took me on quite a trip down memory lane.The reviewers complaining around here about the game being lazily slapped into DosBox are quite right. As long as the publishers decided to revive and redistribute this awesome classic, they could've cared more about the packaging and the distribution methods. Back in the days there was a Windows 95 version of the game with a higher resolution (640x480 instead of 320x200), but the older, inferior DOS version is the one chosen to be included in this package. Furthermore, I was lucky enough to have the game remaining in Window mode after Alt-tabbing once, but I heard others weren't that lucky with this DosBox version.As some other reviewer said, if you already had the game in other form, it makes little to no sense to get it here on Steam too. They could've added some Steam achievements or trading cards or whatnot to it... but... did I mentioned laziness above?As for the game itself, well, Sid Meier's Colonization was amazing 20 years ago and it still feels good even today. It's just as addictive as I remember it. I also had a good laugh when, to close it, I had to chose ""Exit to DOS"". I was running it on DOS those many years ago on a computer that was 20 times less powerful than my current smartphone. Nevertheless, Colonization aged so nicely.I was quite surprised to see that this 20-year old game is still smarter and more complex than many of nowadays' games. The way it drives you towards the unavoidable climax of having to declare Independence and fight the colonial troops is really impressive as it's discrete and gradual. You know it's gonna happen yet you can rarely feel properly prepared. It's that challenging nature of the 90's games, when games were truly hard and satisfying to win, not just feeding you false rewards.And it's complex, just like it's expected from a turn-based strategy game created by Sid Meier and based on Civilisation to be. You have to take into account the natives, the other nations, the available resources, the ""King's demands"", religions, trades, politics, and so on. Briefly, Colonization is impressively comprehensive especially when you think how old it is.The graphics are decent for a DOS game. Blue is for sea, green is for land, you get the point. :) No one plays this game because of the graphics anyway.I conclusion, I highly recommend the game itself, but also condemn the packaging/the way they decided to just add in on Steam, without caring as much as they've should."

If that's all you need to know, don't read on, buy it and i'll focus the rest of the review on what could have been.A turn based strategy offering, Colonization is a timeless classic that has immense replay value and an excellent soundtrack to boot. If a turn based strategy game is your thing, you cannot be disappointed, it's impossible.However, if you did already own it in another form, whether DOS, Amiga or other, what reasons are there to buy here, other than to have it in your library? I cannot honestly see any other reason.The files and structure are identical to those that have been freely available (rightly or wrongly, it's always a point of debate) as 'Abandonware' for many years now. To run those files, you would have needed DOSBox which has handily been included as part of this package. That may in fact be a positive, Colonization in your Steam library, with one click access to DOSBox and no need to mount a path or create a config file. Some mention of DOSBox on the store page would have been helpful though, given other reviews now appearing about the release.But it could have been so much more, more than what is offered which is essentially old files bundled together by someone that has bought the rights and is selling them at a price, albeit very reasonable. It's just a case of doing very little work and putting it for release on Steam.What about achievements? Imagine 'Achievement Unlocked: Armed Natives & Subsequently Beheaded'. What about visually improving the look of the game itself? Of course, there is a certain romance about playing an older game and the way it looked all of those years ago but it can work, look at Leisure Suit Larry & Secret Of Monkey Island, there is a place for a visually enhanced version of an older title. Such a missed opportunity in my opinion, Colonization: Special Edition* could have been something to take an even bigger pride of place in the collection.*And no, 'Civilization IV: Colonization' isn't it......And apparently if I update this review I receive some sort of silly badge....."

It starts in 1492; your sovereign grants you a few colonists, some tools and muskets and a ship to head into the vast unknown. It is up to you to turn that humble beginning into a vast colonial empire - and then rebel against the ever more oppressive rule from across the seas.It is a game that is fairly simple to get into, but the more finnicky bits of growth and economy can take a while to get the hang of. Do you start a vast agricultural colony, raising new colonials through food, or do you start with cash crops and their refined versions to scrape together enough gold for new recruits from the old world? Perhaps you instead focus on spreading the good word of your faith to lure lost souls across the Atlantic, or use your military might and missionaries to subdue the local natives as converts? Perhaps all of the above, all the while bickering with your fellow European colonies and treading carefully around the sovereign's steady requests for higher taxes, your day only brightened as founding fathers flock to your banner to aid you.Being an early Civ style game, the four different factions (England, France, Spain and the Netherlands) start at the same time (1492) and with a fairly similar footing. England is the baseline faction. France has a trained pioneer, Spain has a trained soldier, and the Netherlands has a better ship - on top of their unique nation bonuses.This particular version of the game is the DOS version, wrapped in a quite functional DOS-box. This does mean that you'll get the limitations of that version - namely, there is a unit cap for how many units you can have on the map at a given time. Unless you're really building up your empire for population score, you aren't likely to encounter that issue all that often, though. There is also a cap on the number of colonies, but again, it is fairly high. Barring those inherited problems, I've had no issues with this version of the game - short of lacking the time to play it as much as I'd have liked to.All in all, a game that still feels as great as rose-tainted memories suggested. That cannot be said or all games one feels nostalgic about. Definitely a worthy purchase, even now."

I just want to write a quick review to say that although it's true that this release is simply the game wrapped inside DOSBox, it's not quite the slapdash job other reviewers may want you to think it is. Out-of-the-box, this is better configured than the GOG release, which had mouse sensitivity that was way too high. I'll concede that the ""default"" settings produced graphical errors on my Linux machine (the resolution appeared ""oversized"" for my screen, and I couldn't see everything -- I think this Is a very simple fix), but running it in DOSBox Daum, which is an out-of-the-box option, worked perfectly. I don't mind fiddling with config files, especially in Linux, but I've got to give them points for providing an ""out-of-the-box"" option that works!Like the GOG release, the map editor is included (which is AWESOME), and this release even does GOG one better: it includes the original configuration utility. There's not really any reason for the average user to use it, but it's neat to have. Finally, buying the game on Steam gives a healthy $6.99 to Night Dive Studios, who in my mind are the premier retro-remaster studio working today, having done excellent, quality work with Strife, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and soon a complete remake of System Shock. I don't mind giving such an excellent studio a few extra bucks, but if the price seems a little too steep, I've seen it on sale for $1.49, at which price I'd say it's definitely worth it. This is a quality release."

Some options make the can not even load.- The AI is stupid and cocky and has this stupid strategy where they surround all your cities with units and just make them sit there and do nothing.- The graphics and sound quality are bad. (it is after all from the 1990s)- theres's only four nations to choose from.- Spain's bonus is that you get extra strength when invading indian cities/camps. However the more indian camps/cities that you destroy the less score you get at the end.**score is how the game measures how good you did. They have no effect on if you win or not.** just so you know the game is run through a DOS emulator.

For example, the unit cap, lacking combat system, inability to check market prices during a trade, inconsistencies with using a mouse, inability to forward through the sailing intro, sound unable to be completely muted (church noises and national anthems still play), and trade routes not loading/unloading correctly. There was a newer version released as part of Civ IV, but it lacked a functional customs house, and fell short of the original IMO.Bottom line, great game and well worth the <$10 to purchase.

It's from around 1995, before internet was a household concept.  The game's graphics were not intended to be glorious.  Now, then...I didn't think I see this one again - An early create-a-nation strategy game, one of many with Sid Meier's name stamped on it.  Very few names stay relevant in the industry as his, over 20 years after the first Civilization game, and now there's Civilization: Beyond Earth.Anyway, the concept begins simply.  It's 1492 - a new world has been found.  This new world can be historical the Americas, a random new world, or one you create.  4 nations, each with an advantage that reflect its history, want to colonize it - England, Spain, France, or the Netherlands.You are placed in charge of colonizing this land.  Explore, find a good place to settle, build, and use the land to create your fortune.Of course, natives already live here - interact with them.  They offer gifts, and teach you how to plant abundant cash crops.  They like to  trade, paying gold for cheap ""Trade Goods.""  But, your colonies grow, alarming the Indians of takeover, and you'll likely end up at war.  Keep this in mind before selling them horses or guns.  You can try to keep the peace (trading helps), or be the Spanish that just burn villages and take treasure.Deal with other European colonies strictly as rivals to exploit.  My strategy is be peaceful at first, let them develop their own colonies, then grab muskets and take it!  I do this because that's THEIR plan too.  These rivals claim they want peace - but if you have colonies on the same continent, their soldiers always like to camp just outside your Fort.When your settlers are not busy turning Ore into Tools into Muskets, there's the matter of money.  Main solution - grow sugar, tobacco, and cotton.  Then turn them into Rum, Cigars, and Cloth.  Load em onto ships bound for Europe.  Remember, prices are based on supply and demand.  Your rivals are also trading, and if everyone is selling Cigars, the price will drop.  It's why Silver always gets lower over time, while muskets and horses go up.Why do all this?  Because you're creating a nation - strong and independent.  Your King doesn't understand this, thinking he can liberally tax you because ""reasons.""  So, your settlers create ""Liberty Bells"", culture points of a sort.  These grow rebel sentiment in your colonies, making them more productive and free-thinking.  They also attract Founding Fathers that offer fantastic advantages to your growing nation.Eventually, boycotting taxes aren't enough.  The time for to declare independence will arrive.   Then comes the true test - the King's denial prompts him to send a GIANT force of Warships, artillery, and  ""Redcoats.""You win by kicking the Lobsterbacks back across the Atlantic, if they're lucky."

I still own my original Windows 3.1 disc and instruction manual from the release in '94, but the 3.1 version has been sketchy at best ever since Windows 95 was released with frequent and random crashes that has gotten progressively worse with each Windows release.  The DOS version and 3.1 play exactly the same as each other, the only real difference I noticed are the unit sprites are designed a little different on a couple units (veteran soldiers and fisherman were the most obvious to me), and this version I was able to play straight through without any crashing.It's still a deceptively simple, but challenging game.  If you don't start on a good continent with plenty of wood and ore immediately available on your first turn, you might as well just start your game over, because it has always been pretty unforgiving if you're a turn or two behind the other European powers.

Limited units makes this a true strategy game over a tech race.Runs great on linux Ubuntu/Minthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeZkrH8uEEw&index=1&list=PLuNkx65-i47Rm6tkTtSWzYcaZmRl_iZWA"

I only have two complaints, 1.) it's a little on the high end for a game that is 23 years old. 2.) This is the dos version, not the windows version.Other than that, felt exactly like it did every time I've played it over the years."
