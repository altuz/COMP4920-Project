,Not Recommended,327440,12703713,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,NeonAbomination,"I gotta say, I'm dissapointed. It's my own fault really, but I'm dissapointed. Looking at the screenshots, the game looks fairly good. Heck, it looks fantastic. I miss when games had such nice colours in them, and such visually enjoyable environments. Nowerdays, everything seems so dull in an effort to be more realistic.  Watching the trailer and seeing that you could pick up coins and stuff made it seem like this game would take some classic elements of videogames and that it could be a lot of fun. Sadly, even though I've only played through one full mission, I'm not seeing it.A bunch of people are probably already going to hit the thumbs down button on this review because it's negative, and they are fans of Avenged Sevenfold or something and can't accept the fact that they could be accociated with a bad product, but I am a fan of them as well. I'm not a hardcore fan of pretty much anything, but I enjoy their music, at least some of it. But you need to understand, I don't want to give this game a bad review, it's clear that effort went into this, as for how much though... I'm not sure.The biggest problem, like it is most of the time, is just the gameplay. It's... well... there's nothing to it. Nothing to it at all. Do you like clicking the mouse button? Does that one thing alone make a game fun to you? Then I guess you might like this. But that's really all there is. There's no complex mechanics here for fighting. It's literally just pressing the left mouse button to swing your sword over and over, or the right mouse button to fire a quick magic spell. You can't even aim in this game, your mouse is used for clicking the buttons, and pressing ""next"" on the text boxes in the game. You do not, you CANNOT, actually aim with it. The mouse cursor is on the screen at all times as well, but that's not a big deal really.What is a big deal, is the fact that to actually hit an enemy, you need to walk towards it first.This doesn't sound that bad, but when the only possible way to dodge attacks is to walk AWAY from enemies, this makes it practically impossible to avoid damage a lot of the time, unless you play the game as though you were a manual balloon pump, taking a single swing, moving backwards, and then moving in again to take another single swing, for however long it takes to kill a single enemy, which judging by the enemies in the first level, is about 5 seconds per enemy. With quite a decent number of enemies, combat becomes very boring, very quickly. If it was fun to kill enemies, this wouldn't be a problem. But it's not fun. There's hardly any feedback to your blows, and it just doesn't feel good smacking things around with your sword.Why is it like this? Why is this game so utterly mind numbingly simple? Well, probably because this is a mobile port.Yeah, a mobile port. Hopefully this made some of you turn away already, because you know how badly this usually ends up. Mobile ports of games don't really change the gameplay, and since they were made for mobile devices, they are generally VERY simplistic in terms of gameplay. Oh, and it used to have microtransactions, though those are not in here any more. Take that as you will.So, what exactly does this game offer? It has fantastic visuals, that I can't deny, it has pretty good music from what I can tell, though not all of it really sounds like what Avenged Sevenfold would make. And the voice acting is... non existant. Punishment for death is pretty much non existant as well, as every time you die, you just respawn at a frequent checkpoint with no consequence. Seriously, not even more effort, as enemies do not respawn. Except for the bossses of course. And with no way to dodge attacks other then just... moving slowly... bosses can be somewhat annoying to a degree. As like I said before, you need to move towards an enemy to attack them, and cannot attack while dodging in pretty much any way.The incredibly simple and obvious mobile port type gameplay is not something that can be overlooked, and leaves this as a very boring and occasionally frusterating game. It's a shame really. I did not have high hopes for this, but it looked good from the screenshots. It ends up being more of a chore than a fun game. If only it was a bit more complex, or at least made it fun to kill things, this could have been good... but alas, it is not.Want to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

I was about to grant my hope its REQUIEM when suddenly, A LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN shone at me and I saw it in the Steam store, leaving me with NOTHING TO SAY; a mere SCREAM of excitement was UNBOUND from my lips. I let it download as I went to work, but as I was COMING HOME all I could think of was playing this awesome game UNTIL THE END. So far, the game has met my expectations, despite trading cards being MIA (not for long, thankfully). I look forward to playing it until 4 AM."

The areas are fun to explore, it's fun to scramble after coins showering out of chests, and fun to run through the spikey logs and acid spewing statues.The repeatable bonus stages seem to be where you make most of the money so make sure to find the 3 bats in each area to open them up.Edit: I finished it on normal in about 5.8 hours. Nightmare mode looks interesting enough to replay it and find the few collectibles I missed."
,Not Recommended,327440,12707196,"Posted: 31 October, 2014",all,Xevon,"For those who've played the mobile version and are wanting to know what to expect from the Steam version, the answer is nothing more, nothing less. It's the exact same game in every way. There are no graphical options, the resolution defaults to your desktop resolution. The UI is still decidedly touch oriented, and gamepad support is lackluster requiring you to reach for the mouse every time a menu or pop-up box appears. You won't be playing this on your couch undisturbed. But it is a fairly smooth port that looks and runs about the same as its mobile counterpart. You won't be impressed, nor will you be disappointed.For those who have yet to play it and want to know what the fuss is all about, the answer is not much. Hail to the King: Deathbat claims to draw inspiration from games like Diablo and Legend of Zelda, yet it sheds some of the most enjoyable elements of those games. All that awaits you here is a linear hack and slash with one button to slash, one button to shoot magic and movement keys. That's it. Equipment is limited to a weapon and items are limited to barely more than health and magic potions. Most of the levels share a similar design, typically a dark gothic appearance and consist of decent textures slapped on low-poly models and maps. The games story is decidedly lackluster and the only time the games music gets good are when an instrumental version of Unholy Confessions plays during the boss battles. Outside of that, it's Psuedo-Retro sounding tunes with Arin occasionally bashing his drums over the top. Hardly a terrible soundtrack, but a waste of what could have been a memorable one.A rebuttal to the common prasing of the games difficulty: The game gives you five lifes and makes you restart the level should you lose them all. Aside from that, there's no other real consequence. The game isn't hard by any stretch of imagination and offers but a gentle slap of the wrist for repeated failures.All things considered, the games price reflects the game itself. It's only a few bucks. Feel free to dive in if you're curious, but be forewarned: there's nothing to call home about."

This game is a nice port from mobile devices (iOS and Android), run smoothly without a problem on my crappy laptop.The gameplay itself is simple, move with WASD and clicking your mouse to attack and casting spell. The soundtrack is a bit funny, never thought they would make such song. xD Story is ""good"", not ""epic"". Anyway, never press esc button, otherwise the game will close instantly. The graphic is.. err.. whatever, it doesn't bother me so much.If you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, and want to support your favorite band, buying this game is a must.

A music group creating a video game out of the blue? Sounds a bit off... After playing the game for the first time here on steam, I'd have to say that it's not half bad. Besides the few things that I noted down as my cons:-Esc key closes the game.-(Youtube) When I try and record the game and commentate over it, the volume is set pretty loud, even though I turn it down in the mixer.-No graphical or audio settings.-gameplay is a bit stale, clicking and turning is the only tactic.-boss battles are repetitive.Overall, it's a good game if I was going to play it on my iPad or something, good graphics, fun looting, a few unlockables.If I had to rate this out of 10...6.5/10"

Looking at the screen caps, I thought it was going to be a simple game that you run through and try not to get hit, like it an ad for the band's music. But this game takes some serious skill. Skill I have not used in a long time. You can tell it's made by a gamer for gamers. You need to be smart about how you attack and how you figure bosses out. Every level is different and a different game plan is needed, which only makes it harder. It's def not a normal FPS PC game.

Which means this game was just a lazy PC port. (The game shuts down when you press ESC. That's usually not a good sign. This usually means the developers or the port teams know not much about PC gaming.)Also, that thing you can do on your handheld counterpart of this game where you can choose to play as A7X member character is all but gone on this PC port.

The characters' quality is also on the low side, but this could be improved with an update.The playable characters look kinda lame, ( I expected something that would reflect them like their live performance) Matt  looks by far the most amazing of the six playable characters.I would rate this a solid9 out of 10"
,Recommended,327440,12733817,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,SlayJay,"This game is definitely NOT the ""sell-out"" to gamers that many people accuse it of being. Avenged Sevenfold, a fantastic Heavy Metal band composed of longtime gamers, decided that they wanted to write a love letter to the classic dungeon crawler RPG games they grew up playing. This is whatHail To The King: Deathbatis.The game was made to play and feel like the classic dungeon crawlers, likeZelda, Diablo,etc. The graphics resemble those of the original Playstation, so some people may be disenchanted by the lack of graphical fidelity that today's gamers are used to. It's important to keep in mind that this look was done on purpose, and that it helps cement that fantastic retro feel. If you keep the right mindset, you might just be overwhelmed with nostalgia.Every enemy requires a slightly different approach to defeat, the bosses especially. Beating this game isnoteasy and will require the player to get a good grasp of the game mechanics and enemy patterns. This is one of the reasons that this game is such a great homage to the golden age of RPGs; no hand-holding. This game will kick your butt unless you really commit to playing it well.The controls are simple: wasd to move, left click for melee, and right click for your ranged magic attack, which can be charged for a large special attack that varies with the weapon one uses. The controls may seem button-mashy at first- and they kinda are- but this is not as unpleasant as one might think, because it gives all the more reason to really work at mastering the gameplay.The soundtrack is superb, and you'll have to play the game to appreciate it; not much I can say to do justice to an awesome band writing a video game soundtrack that melds 8-bit music with modern instruments perfectly. With every boss battle, a hit from the band's catalog will play in an instrumental version, accenting the change in dynamic and upping the energy for the intense showdowns.All said, you don't have to be an Avenged Sevenfold fan to love this game. Try it. It's made for hardcore gamers and was created with the utmost love for the classics. Try it yourself, don't diss it because cynics like to say that a band can't make games too."

The movement and sword attacks feel a lot smoother than they do on mobile and you don't have your own fingers covering half the screen in this version. One of my only complaints is that the magic attack is almost impossible to aim in the PC version.The cut scenes look pretty bad and dated on PC, but I suppose that's acceptable seeing as it is a mobile port (and a pretty cheap one at that).Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this game.

,Recommended,327440,12718447,"Posted: 31 October, 2014",all,Quick Thinker,"Disclaimer: yes i am an Avenged Sevenfold fan so this might be a little bit bias toward the game due to that. other than that.Hail to the king deathbat is a simple hack and slash zelda/diablo dungeon run. It features as guessed A7X's songs in and some of their own 8-bit songs that can be hit and miss (my favorite is the level Wicked End song. Just damn) That being said you would think they would use the full library of their songs to its potentional and since this is the main selling point I will focus on it first.It misses out using many of the bands tracks and during mini bosses you will keep hearing the same song (Unholy Confessions). I really wish they would have used their songs to the max. The songs are in no particular order: Nightmare, Wicked End, Beast and the Harlot, Little Piece of Heaven, Unholy Confessions, Bat Country, and Fiction. No Hail to the King, MIA, Sidewinder, Shepard of Fire, Carry on, Welcome to the family. Now while the song choices match the levels (each level is named after the song used in the boss fight, excludeing afterlife) they are just instrumental version of the song with vocals removed. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE nightmare, but I would have been blown away if they did all their songs in 8-bit format. seems like a missed opportunity to me. Regardless the soundtrack is a blast if your a fan and the actual level songs can be darn good (Bat Country and Wicked End are pretty good). Now onto the meat of the game, the gameplay.The gameplay in all honestly is lack luster.  W A S D to move, P to pause, and mouse 1 to hit and 2 for magic. The big burden that seems to hold this game down is it being a mobile port. Due to this it is rather simplistic. While simplistic might work on mobile easily, here it just feels boring. theres no real stratigy or tactics to the combat other than hit and weave away repeat till it dies. Theres no sprint, Stamina meter, dodge move, run, nothing. It just feels barebones and at times boring as you hack and weave an enemy to death. They do try to mix it up with giving your magic a secondary attack that changes with your weapon, but that just makes it easy to find the best weapon and never switch tactics.The level design is standard with some varity of hidden goodies to find. The issue with some of the levels is most look very similar and ocassionaly on Unholy Confession i found myself lost for a little bit. If they added map of some kind as in the pause menu or an item pick up that would be helpful.The secrets to find can range from easy to find to nearly impossible (how do i get to that damned chest in Afterlife?). The ""secrets"" themselves are some of the bands artwork such as City of evil cover and the bands logo.The bosses range from interesting to frustrating. Certain bosses you just have to tank until either you or they die. *cough* Harlot *cough* other bosses can't be beat by the standard stab, stab, stab way and require some cunning moves to defeat which spiced up gameplay and made each boss fun on it's own merits. The final boss is not too tough unless you ran out of health items like me and tried to kill him on 25 HP.the Graphics are not half bad for a mobile port. the art style works with the style the band has set up and stays consistant (one of my favorite map visually is Little Piece of Heaven)Overall for a band that decided hey we play games a whole ton lets make a sweet game and make it have some of our music they did damn good. They didn't stick to any of the bad mobile games trend and made a fairly difficult but fun hack n slash gothic 3rd person game. Good job A7X, but please next time you make a game have it be on PC and for the love of god add the full track list and maybe some 8-bit versions of the songs.8/10 not bad for a 5 hr game for around 4$ (currently)"

Of course though the game isn't really that hard so its not that rewarding when you beat it. But i really like the games artstyle and pretty much everything else. I started listening to Avenged Sevenfold when i was four and listened to them pretty much 24/7 so almost 10 years later they release a video game and a good one too! The only thing i dislike is Nightmare Mode isn't really different other then that the enemies and lava look different and the enemies have more health and are harder to kill. Other then that this game is really good."

This game is kinda hard to play at the beginning when you don't have so much money but later on it gets easier. When you have alot of money you can buy almost every item from the witch and you are pretty much unstoppable and then the game isn't so challenging but then again it's not so easy. Also, I think that it was too easy to get the Rev sword (but it was a nice idea how to get it) beacause the sword is overpowered and beating the nightmare mode with that sword was easier than beating the normal mode with a normal sword.  Awesome thing about this game is finding all the secrets hidden around the world and easter eggs. Also finding the final boss's weaknes on each level but mostly every mini boss has the same weaknes. Playing as band members ♥♥♥♥ing rules and using their special powers but again it's too easy to get the band members. This game is supposed to be a mobile game which is crazy because the levels in this game and the whole game together is so huge. IF YOU THINK THIS GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE DIABLO THEN YOU ARE WRONG. I see the similarity but both games are very diffrent.Pros: - A7X references- Secrets and easter eggs- Bonus levels- Playing as band members- Awesome music playing in the backgroundCons: - Pressing ""Esc"" exits the game without a warning- Too easy to earn the Rev sword and band characters- Cutscenes don't apply the changes you've made ( changing your sword or a character)OVERALL I RATE THIS GAME 9/10It's super fun to play it.

,Recommended,327440,13572464,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,KenMicMarKey,"In Avenged Sevenfold's (well, really just M. Shadows) break into the gaming medium, we are given Hail to the King: Deathbat.In HttK: Deathbat you play as a fallen king, Andronikos, hellbent on returning to his throne after the god of evil killed and replaced him with an evil twin.The story, while laden with dark fantasy tropes and cliche's, is interesting enough, and while I never became bored with it, I don't feel that it is all that memorable.The main character is supposed to come off as a cool and care-free badass, with cheesy one-liners included, which almost directly conflicts with the story, and makes him completely one-dimensional.Combat is simple as you only have two attacks; melee and magic, and your magic is based off of whatever your melee weapon happens to be at the time. Melee will be your main form of attack, but each weapon uses the same animations, no matter what style weapon it may be. The animation is fine for a sword, but it looks silly with anything that isn't a sword. It just looks weird when Andronikos is bashing the enemies with the handle side of the scythe. Magic, on the other hand, is ranged and very powerful, especially with some of the later weapons. You can charge the magic to do a more powerful attack, each charge attack is different, and the effects accompanying them are nice. While your magic meter runs out somewhat quickly if you spam the attack, your mana is easily recovered by simply standing near a mana fountain. However, the combat is too simple; each enemy is either affected by hitstun, knockback, or must pause for a moment to line up their attacks, and almost every fight plays out the exact same, no matter what enemy you're fighting: poke the enemy with a melee attack, run a circle, poke, run, poke. This strategy works on most of the bosses as well.Controls are responsive and simple; they could easily be translated to an NES controller, as you only ever move around and have two buttons to worry about, melee and magic. On that note, you'll want to play with a joystick; I used a 3rd party (Rockcandy by PDP) Xbox 360 controller, as I found mouse and keyboard controls to be clunky, because all movement is assigned to WASD. There is the option to change the movement to different keys, but a point and click option similar to Diablo (which this game tries model itself after) would be nice. However, with a joystick, you have no menu control. You can pause the game, but you're still required to use a mouse to navigate the menus or use your equipped potion or item. I played on a touch screen monitor, so this wasn't as big of an issue for me, but it's still annoying and wasteful to drop one hand off the controller to do anything. You can switch melee weapons mid-fight, but you need to click on the icon with a mouse to do so, as there is no way to map these options to a joystick. It would be nice to have this option assigned to a face button, or even SELECT/BACK. But you won't want to use a keyboard as the game plays so much smoother with a joystick. It's an annoying and detrimental Catch 22.The art style and graphics are well-done, but the Avenged Sevenfold logo of the Deathbat is EVERYWHERE. I know this is their game and all, but it's just too much. However, each level design is different, unique, and very well paced. All the levels with the exception of the starting area and world hub are based off of a song, and that song has been remixed to fit a neo-classical Castlevania style. More on that in a bit. There's plenty to find and do in each level, and while veteran adventure gamers won't find any of this to be completely new, I always wanted to explore every bit of it to find the games many different collectibles. But there are some parts where your path is obscured because of the environment, and these areas are very frustrating if there happens to be an enemy hiding where you can see. I hardly felt like my deaths were unfair or cheap while fighting an enemy, but a few of the many traps and obstacles contained within each level did. (I'm looking at you, falling rocks and rolling spike barrels.)The soundtrack is very solid, but those who aren't a fan of Avenged Sevenfold's music probably won't find much to enjoy. Every level theme is a remix of one of A7x's songs, many to the point that it's almost a new song entirely. As I mentioned earlier, the songs are redone to fit a game, and they're done very well. They never become annoying or repetitive, and are almost nostalgic for those who enjoyed Castlevania. That being said, the music for the level bosses is whatever song the level is themed after, minus the vocals. The level bosses always have a little introduction with The Wicked End's interlude and bridge, followed by the level's theme for the fight. The mini-bosses are where I ran into a problem. The music behind every miniboss fight is always Unholy Confessions, and while I enjoy the song on its own, it quickly became repetitive the more I played, as every level has at least two mini-bosses.Enemies and bosses are plentiful, and there are unique mobs for every level, which make for a good variety of things to fight. Each enemy and each level lasts just long enough to enjoy, without ever feeling like they've overstayed their welcome. While the strategy to fight them never varies much, they're still enjoyable thanks to the different way each of them attacks. Once you learn the pattern though, each fight plays out the same way I mentioned above: poke, run, poke, and run. I didn't notice much variety to the mini-bosses, as it seems there are only two varieties: One that summons a bunch of adds and attacks directly, or one that puts up a shield, summons a bunch of adds you must defeat to lower the shield, and then attacks directly. You'll know when you find a mini-boss area, too. It's always in a large, empyty clearing that you can't walk out of once you enter, thanks to a barrier that erects behind you as you enter. Fortunately, each level boss is challenging and very unique, and each one must be fought in a new way.I hardly encountered any glitches or hiccups, except for one almost game-breaking glitch during the level, Babylon. I exited the game mid-fight against the first mini boss to return to The Crypt to buy some health potions, and upon my return found that the barrier that erects for each mini-boss fight had not disappered. I could not re-enter the arena to fight the mini-boss, therefore could not complete the level. I tried exiting and re-entering the game multiple times, and eventually had to lose all of the lives I had so the level would reset, and I could continue.All in all, for a game ported from a mobile platform to play on PC, Hail to the King: Deathbat is a decent first game from Avenged Sevenfold. Avenged sevenfold fans will enjoy the soundtrack and art, and adventure fans will enjoy the gameplay. I can honestly say I'd buy a sequel if they were to ever make one. It gets a solid 6.5-7/10, and if the above issues with the controls, environment, and combat were addressed, the game would easily be an 8/10. Being a fan of Avenged Sevenfold will make or break the experince, but if you're indifferent about the band behind it, this could be a good budget adventure game for you."

It's all about atmosphere, there are several references to the band that a seasoned fan understands, and even though the game play is linear its still easy to understand and the over all vibe makes up for it. It was on sale when I got it for for a buck ninety-seven, so very worth it.As a casual gamer, there several things wrong with the game; the gameplay is linear and the combat gets repetitive, there could be much more variety for the ""RPG"" it's passed off as, and the story is decent but pretty generic.Aside from combat being repetitive, it is often very difficult too. I've heard several interviews, and have the understanding that the game is supposed to be as hard as a classic dungeon crawlers, and it is, but the combat is fundementally broken. The magic, for example, has no reticle and I hardly hit anything. There are a couple good weapons to start with but there's no heavy RPG elements, like armour or character customization that make the game dynamic and replayable.On the good side, I love the games atmosphere, it's everything I could ever want in a fantasy game. If you are a fan of Divine mythology type stuff, it's perfect. I also spent a lot of time on the mobile version, and I can safely say that this version is miles better, because of things like the character weapons being purchasable without real money, and dynamics of using a PC. So if you're not an A7X fan, but you like a dark, divine type of fantasy dungeon crawler, AND it's on sale for dirt cheap, buy it."

This simple thing plagues ranged attacks, which you have little hope of landing as is, as well as melee, where any sort of kiting strategy falls short.Now, the game is also just hard. Not quite my thing, but I do enjoy them now and again, so I think I'm being fair in saying my judgements are not due to the game being hard. If the above issue was fixed, I would be more than willing to change my review, and reinstall the game. As is though, no chance."

I won't bother going into the story of how this game was made, but it draws inspiration from such games as Legend of Zelda and Diablo. If you enjoyed those games, you will like this one. If you are a casual gamer, there's not much here for you besides the music. But I'll get to that.The story has been called ""generic"" in reviews I have read, and I can see where those complaints come from, yet I did enjoy it myself.The gameplay is not amazing for a PC game, but it was initially a mobile game, and from my experience I have no idea how anyone would play this on a mobile device. It requires too much precision that would be difficult to get on a small or even medium device. But, gameplay is smooth on its PC port, and it's easy to control.The port itself is not what most people look for in a good port, but it did surprise me in some ways. First, it has no graphics options menu. In my opinion, though, I don't think it needs one. I could most likely play it smoothly on my old Windows XP with little incident. It does not try to be hi-def or realistic. You play as ♥♥♥♥ing deathbat, it's not going to be realistic. But it has the graphical style of some of the games it draws inspiration from, which is actually really well done. Second, it runs well. It does not feel like they rushed the port to make a deadline, because it is well optimized. Third, the options menu it does have is extremely extensive...for one thing. Controls. You can fully rebind the entire set, to anything you like, and you can bind a set of controls for a gamepad. All included. Granted, there aren't many controls for the game on its own, so this may not come as a surprise to many, but I was impressed by it.Now, more about gameplay. The map allows the travelling to several different areas (All named after A7X songs, which is awesome) that include different visuals and music, as well as music related to the theme of the area. Each level includes several boss fights, and each boss has a different fighting style and attack patterns that you will need to get used to in order to kill. It's obvious much time was put into this, although not enough to make it a triple-A title.The Rev also makes several appearances, which are amazing.Okay, so if you want my final opinion, this game is amazing. The music is amazing. Everything about it is great. I have some small problems with some areas, like how some boss patterns are hard to avoid and some are hard to find out how to kill, but these all add to the overall difficulty of the game, and that tends to be a good thing. I haven't found any glitches or bugs that break the game, and I enjoy seeing that for once as well. In the end, I'd buy it again.Just not for a phone. Don't do that."

,Not Recommended,327440,17370176,"Posted: 3 August, 2015",all,Satanic Hispanic,I am a fan of avenged so im not bias against this game. This game broke for me more then once and and the some of the fights are just impossible without the magic bubble (ingame item) and upgraded wepons. There is a dier need for an update to add blocking or a dodge roll ability and to fix a game braking bug where you just cant move. There is no way to fix it if i happens to you. The musics good so theres a plus but its taken away from the terrible grafics. In the end A7x put to much on there plate and came up with a bad game that forever will be rememberd as bad

It's yet another Phone App, ported onto steam, and as a result...Well, Just look at it! There's better PS1 games with better graphics. Hell, SNES games with better graphics. Atari Jaguar looks better.But, Digressing, you explore through what looks like the wet dream of any given A7X fan as the 'Deathbat', through some pretty jagged combat. Even loving A7X as much as i do, The control's are too horrible for me to reccomend it. Atleast you can go through and Play 'Spot the A7X referance', But even that doesnt help, considering how few referances there are to begin with."

Great game sound track and the game is reminisent (I know i probably biffed that spelling) of older games.  Graphics aren't bad and gameplay is pretty fun.

,Not Recommended,327440,13112602,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Tony,"Okay, I only played the first 2-3 missions - maybe I'm going to finish that game some day - but the invested time so far was definitely enough to get an opinion. The N64-like graphics were definitely nice to see in the beginning, but after some minutes into the first mission, the game didn't even try to be good at all. Let's get this clear - I DO enjoy listening to Avenged Sevenfold and the music in the game is definitely a huge PRO for the game itself, but other than that, it's really poorly designed, in terms of everything. The story is not simple, it's close to absurd. The battle system doesn't feel good at all. The first bossfights made me smile, because - A simple way to kill them is to just run in circles around them and attack them, meaning pressing one button. You don't even need magic, though it's powerful. It's not declared to be an RPG but still it lacks some kind of character progression or anything similar to that. I mean, you collect coins and some other collectables to unlock pictures and such, but the only progression in this game seems to be purchasing new weapons. You can correct me if this changes at some point in the game. I don't mean to spread hate in any way or to just mindlessly bash this game - But even as a fan of their music (which at first made me ignore some of the game's weaknesses), I couldn't get into this game at all.+ Soundtrack is definitely worth listening+ N64 and PSX era fans might enjoy the graphics / design- No feeling of progress- Game mechanics (Battle System) are very poorly designed- Dull story- Inconsistent difficulty level (even during the first missions)- Gamepad compatibility doesn't work for all actionsIf you like the game, I'm fine with that. This is just my opinion. Not everyone might agree with this, but please only comment on this if you are not trying to convince me that this game is good. It might be - in your opinion."

Was more excited about the avenged sevenfold sountrack. You have no idea how disappointed I was when I played this and found the gameplay was worse than I ever could of hoped for and they ran the soundtrack through a Sega Genesis to give it that 80's video game feel. I paid less than $5 dollars for it would like to be compensated $100 for pain and suffering.

76561198288458604,Recommended,327440,30707571,Posted: 24 March,all,^6 Purple,I thought the game was pretty cool and a lot of fun but the port isn't the greatest but I can understand a mobile game being ported to pc isn't going to be amazing. The gameplay is really fun and is like a Zelda/Dark souls like game. I would like to note down some complaints though-Escape closes the game instantly and you cant rebind it to pause-Magic can be hard to aim but I found using a controller helped a little bit-The biggest complaint to me is that there is no volume slider to adjust the in-game volume so when im talking to my friends in discord and playing the game at the same time I find my ears hurting a lot.But in conclusion the game is a cool pick up for a fan or for someone who wants to experience another kind of zelda or darksouls game. So aside from the few minor issues with the game I think its a good pickup.
