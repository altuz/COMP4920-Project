Try the demo as they have suggested.I'll start with the basic con: As a starter pack, it is a bit basic at the moment, so I can't wait to see how they expand. All the maps are flat, with no mountains or folliage supplied to you, with basic scripts. The more you know how to modeling, makeing images/textures, music, sounds, and can script, the more you will get from this.That said...I have been messing with a small game with a few simple maps and unit types with positive results. I've been able to import some random meshes I found on the web to see how it works, and have imported my own music and images into it. The price now for ""as is"" might be a little high, so I'm looking forward to updates.If you really are second gussing, go to their forums and read it. It's not complex, but it's not exactly plug and play. But aren't any systems like this that way? You have to be willing to put in effort into it yourself to learn the ins-and-outs."

If you wish to build RTS then this just works, few hangups in running in initial usage, but other than that we look forward to learning this system. Cryengine Unity Unreal Havok... etc you can build anything at a cost of time, configuration and many other things to consider (asset pipeline, coding LUA C++, blueprint, flowgraph all that stuff if you are familiar with the engines mentioned). We see Blender support at the current time for the models here and I think terrain creation tools are being looked at improving, other than that.... I think this is a great tool for the community and we support indie devs in every way!!  Great job RTS Creator..."

People who put effort into what they do.3. People who like RTS games and want to try their hand at their own."

Although I only have 9.8 hours on score for the engine as of the time of this post, I will be using this very often.The Engine:Its a simple engine that has alot of potential. Not only is it easy to use, it allows for complex technology trees, as well as many other features. Want to do a RD game, a simple RTS, or the next big RTS? This is that engine. The devs are constantly working to improve this engine from what Ive read. They have alot planned that they will put into the engine.Link(http://www.rtscreator.net/index.php?/topic/24-future-features/)The AI:The AI is an interesting point. In the demo you get a good feel for the AI, while getting a small taste for other things. I have not played to much with AI yet but from what Ive already gotten done its a simple If/Then tree with general or specific points in there.Ex: ""If: attacked by: enemy who: anyAttack: Enemy Who: Any With: T1 Tanks""Thats a basic idea of the current AI system in game. It may seem confusing but after you understand what to click to get what type of reaction than youre set for AI.Map/Level:The map design is a fun aspect of it the game, you can currently make a map at a max of 2000x2000 which is bigger than it sounds, but the developers plan to increase that from what Ive read. The map also features an in game map editor that allows you to create hills/mesas and put vegitation in the map.Importing assets:The asset importing is amazingly simple, you can import all your work in a very small amount of time, although the engine only uses prefered file types like .ogv, .ogg, .b3d, ect. ~IF~ you import a video, it must be .ogv but the sound must also be .ogg I found out. If you dont youll♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself when you play the video and hear static and such.Menu deisgn:A very easy feature which you can have as many menus as you want for any type you want. Theres a drop down selection that allows you to assign buttons for various things, name buttons as you want, import images to the background and all the fun stuff. The only down side right now (4/12/2015) is that there is no ability to put audio into your menus to my knowledge, but again the developers are going to put that feature in the engine as they go.Overall from a 1 being horrid and 10 being godsent, I would rate this engine an 8.5 as it stands now. Once all the other features are put into the engine I would up it to a 9.5 or 10.(http://www.rtscreator.net/index.php?/page/rts_creator.html)"

It's easy to navigate around, aren't for the most part I'm not lost on what to do. Updates come every few months, always adding new features to make a better and better RTS. One complaint I have is there's not enough tutorial videos and the such, but that'snot too big of an issue if you mess around with the program yourself enough. 8/10, would buy again."

The software has a lot of potential but in all realism with no updates since October 2015 this is not worth the price. Its quite broken and missing a lot of features. Difficult to use as its a memory hog and when many units are on the screen all at once it slows right down to about 2 - 5 FPS. As far as the UI goes its simple to use but I have encountered a large number of game crashes. There is a forum site attached to this and some basic tutroials on youtube, but they stop way to early. The only good completed game I have seen from this engine is a tower defence game (avaliable on the website) but it begins to get very slow after about 5 minutes of game play suffering large FPS drops.I attempted to recreate Dune 2 and Warcraft1 with this engine. It failed teribly to say to least as this engine had a lot of potential. No codeing is the best point as everything is set up via a GUI.Wrapping up the review. If the Dev's pick it back up I would jump on it during a sale as it is easy to understand but there is just too much missing at the moment to justify the funds spent."

There is little more than what you see in the video, the documentation is non-existent and the dev cycle is extremely slow...plus the regular price is ridiculous for what you are getting.

R〛Emperor,"Please note I do no longer think about the engine this way, I currently think this is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥You can see why below.I have used this engine for 60 (including time spended with demo) hours now, and after this time I can say, that it had potential and still has. I bought this engine for 10 euros which is about 12 dollars I think it is way worth it. Let me begin with some pros and cons,Pros:-Easy to use-Scripting support-some nice free to use models-Particle creator-Lots of customizationCons:-Performance is not great (I can handle about 65-100 units and then the framerate lowers.-Main menu does not support music.-crashes often.-No multiplayer-Developers have abandoned the project.I consider the saddest thing that it is so great, but unfinished. There is a whole list of features to be added on the website. But I dont think they are actually working on that. I think the worst thing is performance issues and no multiplayer which is very very sad. The scripting language is LUA which is okay. Importing models works fine.BUT: This engine is truly good but just misses some key features. However, since it has been lowered in price for 40 dollars to 10 dollars I think it is a fair price for what you get, if you spend some time with it I am sure you can make a nice game!This is why I vote it up, because I cannot vote it down.Engine features: 7/10So I was thinking more about this all, and their are just too many bugs and crashes. It is getting very annoying, you shouldnt buy this unless you want to waste countless hours on fixing bugs and crashes. It is still a great engine dont get me wrong, but not for 10 dollars.Engine performance 4/10. Poor...So I have been continueing working with this software, its a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just pure garbage, the engine itself works i guess, and it has some great models and assets. But you just get sick of all the crashes and errors, the actual game you made will function horribly after building the game. Tons of crashes, its fun for personal use, but definitely not if you want to make a serious game. THIS IS GARBAGE!Devs have abandoned the software, ridiculous, this engine is not even worth 3 dollars. Functions horribly"
,Recommended,327490,34521127,Posted: 26 August,all,ShizzyZzZzZz,"И так начнем по порядку.1.    Первое открытие программы произошло удачно. Самое первое о чем задумался, как я могу добавить в этот конструктор свои модели, текстуры к ним и прочий контент. Пока что никак.2.    Так как нет никаких мануалов по работе с форматами файлов конструктора. Как я понял модели хранятся в формате .b3dx, но не конвертеров не экстракторов я так и не нашел. У вас есть движок, контент, но у вас отсутствует возможность взаимодействия с ним. Я работаю в Blender, создал целый пак моделей для своей стратегии.3.    Нет никаких мануалов по их настройке под особенности движка, а именно нужны ли им объекты с коллизией, или же бокс-коллизии добавляются автоматически исходя из габаритов модели уже  в самом движке. Как необходимо именовать модели, текстуры, скелет, что бы движок их понимал.4.    Для работы с этим вам необходимо сделать открытый Проект-Пример, к примеру базовый юнит ""Танк"". Открыв который в любом 3D Редакторе можно увидеть из чего он состоит(Модели и их имена, необходимые текстуры и их имена, хит-боксы и их имена, скелет(арматура) и его наименование). Что бы под него можно было подогнать собственные модели. Опять же возвращаемся к началу.5.    Нет конвертеров для импорта/экспорта моделей в 3D Редактор, нет подключаемых аддонов-расширений с рабочим форматом. Нет ничего. Вы слишком поспешили выкатив данный проект в виде ""готового продукта"", так как сделан он ровно на 50%, что означает проект в данном виде может лишь считаться бета версией, так как работы предстоит сделать еще много.И так подведем краткий вывод:1. Есть продукт с контентом, но нет возможности взаимодействия с ним(пока что есть лишь возможность изменять существующие текстуры.) Нет возможности добавления своего контента в конструктор.2. Нет сопутствующего ПО для 3D Редакторов, для импорта/экспорта моделей и прочих объектов.3. Нет мануалов по настройке параметров моделей, текстур, арматур(имена, необходимый размер, параметры объектов)4. Нет мануалов по подключению своего контента к конструктору.5. Негативные отзывы пользователей вполне заслужены, так как проект не завершен.Добавлю от себя пару моментов.Идея игрового конструктора без программирования уже очень стара, но реализована именно так, как необходимо только здесь, что радует. Так же радует тот факт, что нет необходимости в покупке кучи лицензий на использование, как вошло в моду у остальных подобных компаний. Для того что бы персонаж прыгнул купите этот пакет, для того чтобы ходил купите этот и так далее. Но проект не доведен до ума. Если вы учтете все те ошибки, которые я расписал выше, то будь стоимость вашего конструктора даже более 3-х или 4-х тысяч рублей, я бы его однозначно купил. Удачи вам работе на проектом, не забрасывайте его.English version(Google Translate).And so let's start in order.1. The first opening of the program was successful. The very first thing I thought about, how can I add my models, textures, and other content to this constructor. So far, nothing at all.2. There are no manuals for working with the formats of the constructor files. As I understand the models are stored in the .b3dx format, but I did not find any converters, extractors for work with it. You have an engine, content, but you do not have the ability to interact with it. I work in Blender, I created a whole pack of models for my strategy.3. But there are no manuals for tuning it for game engine features, namely whether they need objects with collisions? Or are box-collisions will be added automatically based on the dimensions of the model already in the game engine itself? As it is necessary to name models, textures, skeleton, what would the game engine understand them.4. To work with models you need to make an open Project-Example, for example, the base unit ""Tank"". Having opened it in any 3D Editor you can see what it consists of (Models and their names, necessary textures and their names, hit boxes and their names, skeleton (armature) and its name). That under it it would be possible to adjust own models. Again, we return to the beginning.5. There are no converters for importing / exporting models into the 3D Editor, there are no plug-in add-on extensions with a working format. There is nothing. You too hastened to roll out the given project in the form of a ""finished product"", since it is completed only at 50%, which means the project in this form can only be considered a beta version. As there is still much work to do.And so let's summarize:1. There is a product with content, but there is no possibility of interaction with it (so far there is only an opportunity to change existing textures.) There is no possibility of adding my content to the constructor.2. There is no necessary software for 3D Editors, for import / export of models and other objects.3. There are no manuals for configuring the parameters of models, textures, armatures (names, required size, object parameters)4. There are no manuals for connecting my content to the constructor.5. Negative feedback from users is well deserved, as the project is not completed.I will add a few words from myself.The idea of ​​a game constructor without programming is already very old, but it is implemented exactly as it is necessary only here, which pleases. Also, the fact that there is no need to buy a heap of licenses for use. As other similar companies have do it. In order for the character to jump you need to buy this package, in order to go buy this package and so on. But this the project is not completed. If you consider all the errors that I described above, and fix it, then even if the cost of your constructor is will be more than 3000 or 4000 thousand rubles, I would definitely buy it. Good luck with your work on the project, do not throw it."

But unless the developer returns with more updates which looks unlikely it simply isn't worth the money in this current state of development. If you are keen to make professional looking RTS games with 3d assets, my advice would be to stay away from this and become good at developing in a different engine like Unity."
