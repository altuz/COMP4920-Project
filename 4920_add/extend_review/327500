This game takes my new preferred twin stick blaster even above other highly regarded games like Super Stardust and Geometry Wars!  This little game is better!Its a ton of fun and very, very addictive.   It offers local high scores and online high scores to compete against.It is very fluid, responsive, and requires your full attention to avoid death and losing one of your lives.The level progession offers bonus rounds and different waves and always seems to throw something new at you to keep you on your feet.  This makes the game very fun, very exciting, and the music flows well with the game as well.But here is where I think this game takes the biggest step and puts itself above other great highly regarded twin stick shooters.  This game offers an open world almost rogue-style mode where you get to move and explore a big open world while blaasting away all the baddies and collecting power ups, battling bosses etc.  In this mode, you can even go to ""stores"" and use your score as money to purchase all kinds of different power ups etc.  Awesome, awesome fun, and makes this game stand above the rest.  I've never seen another twin-stick arcade shooter like this do anything like that!Brilliant game design, and for all the reasons above.. Zenzizenzic is my favorite Steam game of 2015 so far!My score.. 93% (out of 100)  Pretty impressive score and game especially considering its still in 'early access'.  Oh... how we wish all early access games on Steam were this good don't we?Easily worth your money, ..It's a shame I'm giving this game it's first review 4 days after its Steam launch.  ..If you are a fan of Geometry Wars or Super Stardust or even a rogue-like RPG fan, you're missing out on a quiet little Indie gem if you pass this game by!"

The artstyle lends itself well to indentifying everything easily and the difference in playstyles between the two modes makes for interesting gameplay changes. Lots of variety, lots of fun, lots of bullets."
,Recommended,327500,17638941,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,High Impact Hexual Violence,"This is such a good shooter. Really worth the buy.- The art style is so simple, and yet, it's so satisfying to the eyes. I personally saw most shooters as carbon copies of others, mainly because they're all revolved around space, high tech warfare gadgets, and monsters, but this is a chainbreaker. I mean, it's just squares, but dude, it's these squares man, these squares are amazing.- The music has really good beats, really good electronic-styled music. I don't know the exact genre to call it, but I'm sure you might know what I'm talking about. The tracks go along great with the stages, so it won't distract you, in fact, it helps focus.- The gameplay, oh the gameplay. You have the basic ""hold _ to shoot"", but you also have the ability to select two out of six special abilities, such as lazers, a swarm of heat seeking missiles, and even a black hole generator. When you defeat an enemy, it'll drop pellets to fill energy, and when you stop shooting, you'll send out a shockwave that vacuums 'em up to use right away. Oh, and you better memorize what key buys a life back, you'll most likely press that at least a few times....Now, there are some cons that'll hopefully be patched up. First off, there is a bug in regular mode's level 3. If you were to buy a life back right as you're exiting the bonus stage, you might end up unable to see what's going on, as your screen would just show up blank.Another thing that struck me as odd was something about the macro mode. Not sure if this was intended or not, but there isn't a way to save progress. Judging by the time limit before boss fights, this might be intended to be unable to save. Oh well, Macro is still great.Dude, why are you still reading this? If you've got the dough for this game, go ahead and snag it already."

Each stage you play is pretty much a pixel perfect dodge or die dare with a kicking soundtrack. If you're up for a epic challange give this a go. Otherwise, if you dont think you can take the heat stay the hell away!"
,Recommended,327500,34333517,Posted: 18 August,all,TheFantaPanda,"Twin-stick bullet-hell with an artistic twist.Starts off fairly easily, allowing you to adjust to the hypnotic geometric art style  whilst simultaneously getting pumped to the tight soundtrack. Reminds me of 'Every Extend Extra' (on the PSP), which shares similar traits despite being excuted quite differently.There is a faily tough difficulty curve after the 1st two levels. Phew ... things get tough. However, 'getting better' never feels like it is out of reach.The macro mode is also pretty good. Fleshes out the overall game a bit more, giving you a more rounded experience instead of just vertical-scrolling shooting.It's simple; fun to play and watch; and overall atmosphere is pretty unique for this often over-saturated genre."

It has variation in superweapons, but no real variation in basic shots, excluding leveling them up and down. From what I saw from the roguelike mode, it didn't add what depth I was hoping for.If you reaaaaally like shoot'em'ups, bullet hells, and score attacking, you might like this game more, but I don't really recommend it."

You can choose Normal, Hard, or Very Hard difficulty. You equip 2 special weapons from a selection of about 6, with each one offering different strategies. These include missile barrages, black holes, teleportation, huge laser beams, and high-power charge shots. Then you jump straight into the bullet hell, and you will find yourself obliterating waves of enemies, dodging bullets, getting hit by bullets, dying, and saying ""Again!""You can also train against the 5 bosses, practise the bonus levels (in which you have to dodge your way through various obstacle courses), or challenge yourself by playing Gauntlet mode, where you play through all 5 levels in a single run. The individual levels only take a few minutes to complete, so if you just want to open the game and blast through (or die in) a couple of levels, you can do that.'Macro' is an interesting open-world roguelike mode, with shops, upgrades, useable items, and huge bosses. This can also be played on Normal, Hard and Very Hard. It's a very fun mode that offers a different style of gameplay to the Classic mode, as well as a lot of replayability like every good roguelike.You can also play co-op, which I haven't tried, but it seems like it would work well.There's a lot here to keep you interested if you like bullet hell and twin stick shooters. I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for challenges, highscores, or just a load of fun."

The gameplay is very solid, the replay value is huge, the visuals are great, and the music is great. The different modes will keep you occupied for quite a while, and highscore chasers will definitely have a good time. Really deserves more attention."

There are a lot of tough patterns, and it's very easy to get in the zone.Where the game really shines is Macro mode, which brings ARPG elements to the basic shooter gameplay. It really feels like an adventure through a bizarre, abstract world. The bosses are enormous, too big to fit on the screen, which makes them feel very dramatic and very fun to battle."

Backgrounds, enemies, bullets, everything just looks so awesome. The gameplay's great too, takes the basics of bullet hell + twin stick madness and adds much more to it with its mezmorizing patterns, strategic powerups, and daunting roguelike mode, all while listening to a kick-*ss soundtrack by bignic. Woah. If you're into Touhou, Geometry Wars, or anything remotely similar to Zenzizenzic, go and give it a try."

Fly around and shoot enemies without being shot. Seems simple enough, right? This game's boss battles and lively electronic soundtrack reminded me very much of tachyon project, another such game. So, what set's this one apart is that, unlike Tachyon Project, which is ""story driven"", ZC had a so-called Macro mode, which is essentially a rogue-like procedureally generated mode, where you advance and kill enemies and bosses. I actually enjoyed this mode way more than the campaign mode, which was frankly very difficult for me. No points off there, though maybe a controller would make for better gameplay (I have only a mouse and keyboard). There may be other games like it, but if it's cheap, I would totally recommend this game, if only because visually it looks so pleasing, and the overall concept is so simple. Overall Score: 8.7/10"

I got the game for $1 and until the game is fixed, I can't recommend the game.I did use the controller to move and the mouse to shoot, that works.

It's an open-world with a countdown timer for boss spawns.  The point is to collect upgrades to be able to take down the boss before it spawns.  everything in the game feels smooth, runs great.  the movement without a controller is a bit clunky, which is not fun in a BH, but overall a great game."
