,Not Recommended,327520,30384460,Posted: 7 March,all,ZeroConsequence,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. But the short version is, everything about it was disappointing.To me, this game's cardinal sin was that it was too short. Not as in ""I PAID $XX FOR THIS SO IT SHOULD BE THIS LONG!"" or as in ""Man it ended but I just wanted to keep playing!"" I mean that for this game, the story they were telling and the mechanics they were trying to develop, there was simply not enough game time to flesh it all out decently. You're strung from one plot point to the next, never really being given a chance to process or even care about what's happening in the story. Mechanics introduced early in the game are never given adequate time to be developed, and your existing mechanics never feel like they grow or transform over the course of the game. With a few additional missions in the middle, the game wouldn't seem like it was so rushed.The second big disappointment was the mechanics in the game. Very early on you're given a ""gravity glove"" which allows you to interact with the environment. This glove is used almost entirely to stack boxes and throw things. There are only 2, maybe 3 instances in which a player character with moderate strength wouldn't be able to get by without the glove at all. I feel like there was a real opportunity to find innovative uses for this tool which was completely missed. Plus there are a variety of other mechanics introduced early on which are rarely ever seen - there are maybe 6 flip plates in the entire game, and 2 barrels to hide in.A huge third disappointment was the story itself. You take one look at the head of the corporation and think ""okay he's totally evil"". Then ""misfortunes"" happen related to him and you think ""yeah, evil."" I kept waiting and waiting for the twist, for the moment when the game said ""no, he's just bad at not looking evil,"" but I think you can all guess where that's going. The tiniest bit of subtlety could have really been a positive here.So at the end of my playthough, the only thing really going through my mind was, ""wait, that's it?"" It was an experience in waiting for a breakthrough, in story or mechanics, that never came."

The game offers an eclectic mix of intelligent puzzles that forces you to think outside the box while having a blast with your gravity glove.As you progress throughout the game you find funny and rather crazy objects that offers the possibilities to goof around, and it will undoubtedly make you crack up and smile like the kid you are.Traverser is to me a great game that offers a lot of fun combined with the right amount of intelligence. I strongly recommend this game, 10/10 and would love to see a sequel!Strongly Recommended!"

The artstyle the voice acting the design, everything feels right and i have had 0 complaints. Every puzzle was good the boss was challenging but worth it and overall i rate it a solid 10/10.A Must buy if you like indie games."

Gatling Goats’ Traverser isn’t being shy with its steampunk aesthetic. But it’s also doing more with the genre than adopting a pastiche of visual tropes, diving into its thematic waters to attempt to tap into something more resonate than copper spider robots.Steampunk, insofar as it can be succinctly generalized, effectively serves to allow its audience to have their cake and eat it too. It recognizes the impracticality of early 20th-century industrial optimism, while simultaneously reveling in that same dream of a finite, knowable universe, at which center humanity resides and dictates. Steampunk is perhaps among the most self-indulgent of genres, but at its core, it seeks to display the ignorance and danger of unregulated industry and nostalgic refusals to modernize. With Traverser, Gatling Goats have attempted to inverse steampunk’s tradition of romanticized empire within an Orwellian dystopia, while also weaving in elements of environmentalism and socialist sentiment.Within this melting pot of political disorder, Traverser emerges only half formed. The foundation is built, pieces are put in motion, but with nothing to hold them together Traverser is left to scramble from one plot point to the next, as if exposition for exposition’s sake is enough to guide the game toward a state of cohesion.Traverser’s world is one constructed in the aftermath of a global freeze. The sun has died, chilling the earth’s outer layer and forcing humanity to take refuge underground. With the surface now inhospitable, clean air becomes the most valuable currency in the city of Brimstone, humanity’s last bastion of civilization. Controlling the city’s air supply, and by extension, the city itself, is the Raven Corporation, a comically evil industrial empire whose spy birds and art deco propaganda posters do little to hide its nefarious intent. Entering into the center of an underground civil war, largely by happenstance, is Valerie Bennett, a recently appointed traverser who, on account of her position, is able to travel to both the upper and lower city in order to “keep the peace” between the two socioeconomically dissonant locals.World building is among the few areas that Traverser handles quite well. The concept of a dualistic city personified by both their inverse political and physical positions is a rather blunt analogy to the contemporary gap between the upper and lower class, but it functions as a clever hook that serves both narrative and mechanical goals. Theoretically.While Traverser displays confidence in crafting its setup, like much of steampunk, it doesn’t know where to take it after the introduction. One of steampunk’s most persistent issues is in fixating on the setting to a degree that partially, if not entirely overshadows the actual happenings of the place that has been so meticulously created. To its credit, Traverser goes to great lengths to flesh out the narrative threads utilized to craft its environments and characters, but it remains so married to what has become an almost fetishistic obsession with steampunk’s look that it is unable to carry them through to completion.The best it can do is to borrow Bioshock’s now ubiquitous form of environmental storytelling, but even then, the stories left behind by the residents of Brimstone are but disorderly snapshots of a world which feels constructed out of cardboard and glue; a city which appears vibrant and sprawling until you catch a glimpse of the empty stage immediately behind its unconvincing front. Traverser’s narrative is quickly bogged down by more characters and goals than it can support, leaving it to introduce plot points only when they are immediately needed, before immediately transporting you to the next.It is easy to characterize Raven Corp. as evil, in fact, contemporary sentiment on capitalism effectively does the work for you, but explaining how they view themselves and why they operate as they do (both of which Traverser attempts) in a way that extends beyond cartoonish villainy is a lot harder. So is creating a rebellion movement with a more nuanced plan than giving air equally to everyone, as if the only stopping block in the path to true economic equality is corporate greed. Nevermind detailing why the rebellion is also convinced the surface has become habitable again, and how they have determined that it is worth risking the whole of humanity to see for themselves if it’s true. Traverser may be altruistic in its fictional worldview, but it tries more than its narrative can hope to adequately address, and the game as a whole suffers for it.Filling the gaps between Traverser’s verbose voiceovers, are, predominately, a lot of rocks (and enough boxes to spare). Traverser plays as something halfway between a physics puzzler, and a 3D platformer. After becoming a traverser Valerie is equipped with a gravity glove, allowing her to move objects far too heavy to lift by hand in order to progress through increasingly cluttered environments. Naturally, in a world full of retro-futuristic technology, this entails a lot of heavy objects being put on presser plates, opening doors to more objects to be placed on more pressure plates. These puzzles are relatively inoffensive, but they’re also tremendously dull, requiring less in the way of logical thinking than they do patience on account of Traverser’s many obtrusive design decisions.Most disruptive of these is having the camera locked at an isometric perspective. 3D platformers already have a history of camera related struggles, and all of them – environmental clipping, obscured platforms, inexplicable control anomalies – become exaggerated when the player is forced to view everything from a fixed angle. The lack of gamepad support also causes the platforming to be finicky, due to the lack of analog control, and the tradeoff of using the mouse to control objects with the gravity glove is minimal at best. Objects frequently misbehave and move at speeds and angles which are difficult to gauge, and even harder to control. This isn’t hugely problematic, as Traverser rarely presents you with puzzles requiring a great amount of precision, but during boss fights, every control issue becomes a monumental hurdle to overcome. The troublesome checkpoint system is just melted icing on the half-baked cake.Traverser tries to differentiate itself from the swathes of steampunk media being released, but ultimately its problems lie mostly in an inability to do so. Gatling Goats built a world I was ready to get lost in, but as the through-line began to bloat and exposition-laden characters continued to be introduced, the Brimstone’s layers of intrigue fell away, leaving its streets filled with nothing but familiar box puzzles and Victorian fashion trends in its wake.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

Game can be finished in three hours, even if you take your time and search for secrets. Sure, you can replay it, but there's not much reason to.-Too easy. No enemy in the game is very threatening - guards can be stunned from a distance and are terrible at pathing around obstacles.-Boss fights are outrageously simple. Wait for specific timing, pick up projectile, hurl at boss, repeat. Only time I died was when I fell into a pit after a fight had ended, and that was because of wonky platform hitboxing.-Puzzles aren't difficult or complex or even interesting - hope you like the ol' switch-puzzle sewer-pipe-puzzle light-mirror-puzzle cliches, because that's all you'll get.-The physics-manipulation-mechanic is a gimmick. I wish I'd just been given a stun gun and the ability to pick items up and carry them above my head, because they'd have the same utility - and be a lot easier to use.-Story is cliched and uninteresting. Try to guess what's going to happen next in the plot, and ninety percent of the time you'll be right. ""No, vaguely-threatening mustached-man, I'm VERY convinced that that was an accident and you're distraught about my near-death.""-Voice acting ranges from ok to awful. And somebody's always yammering in your ear.All in all, this might be worth it if it were on sale for $5. At $15 it just isn't, unless you really are so starved for interesting graphics that you can muddle through the mediocrity of... everything else."

You interact with the environment using a ""gravity glove"", which is similar to the gravity gun from Half-life. This mechanic works very well and it is surprisingly fun to fling random objects at your enemies.Overall great game, 10/10 would buy again"

What manner of sorcery is this? The gravity glove mechanic, which could so easily have been clunky and infuriating, works great. You can feel the weight of everything you pick up and it soon becomes second nature to twist and throw objects.The class war backstory is light but engrossing, the charming world of gravity-defying steampunk bizarrchitecture is beautifully made, the mechanics are always entertaining, the puzzles are only occassionally challenging but make varied use of the physics, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a while. The only real disappointment is that the writing doesn't rise to the rest of the games strengths. Characters aren't particularly memorable and, while the gameplay and world itself is amusing, the attempts at humour in the dialogue sometimes fall flat.8/10"

Even harder to jump from platform to platform. Perhaps it would be easier with a controller as jumping in certain directions using wasd is way difficult."

I had it on my wishlist for a year waiting for it to go on sale and when I finally got it, I cleared it in one sitting >.< :P it has a very unique and intereting world. I love that its got some puzzling with minor combat more so than actually going around killing everything.You play as a kid who is trying to find her father, and end up learning so much more about the world in your adventures. I did beat it in about 6.5hrs and with the way it ended I am REALLY REALLY hoping for a Sequel! <3 PLEASE let their be a sequel lol.

The savepoints were also too spread out so I had to restart a whole scene which can be tedious. The drawbacks were tolerable though and would totally get the sequel if it was ever made."
