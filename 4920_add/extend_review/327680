In under 10 minutes you have have explored the entire game; there is only 3 enemies and 2 stages. The game feels like a beta; there are enemies that spawn in areas you can not walk, and the 2 quests that are repeatable in the game are exploitable for unlimited gold/xp.The first quest that rewards $300 if you return 5 potions. However, you can just purchase each potion for $10 from same npc (total $50) and repeat, making a profit of $250 every 10 seconds. Once enough money has been made, you visit the second npc which rewards 400 XP for 12 potions. So you can literally earn free gold and buy levels, making the entire game pointless.Worst game I have ever paid for."

I meant how to discredit all independent developers who actually make games and sell them on Steam by playing around with Unity for a couple of hours, getting bored, and releasing your ""game"" on Steam for gamers to ""enjoy"" as a finished product.This is NOT a game.  This isn't even one completed level of a game!  This was someone's concept for making a game in Unity and either they found it too difficult to complete, or got bored and gave up after figuring out how to do only few basic gameplay elements.  There are items, but no stats or differences between items.  You can sort of buy and sell these items but it doesn't do anything but make your money go up and down.  I would do a more indepth review of this piece (notice how I didn't use the word game here) but I got bored thinking of all the ways it doesn't constitute a game and couldn't be bothered to finish my review. . ."

Why?  Well, you got a simple town with a save/load point, a point to buy swords and basic armor, and another point to buy a few potions.  When I say ""point"", that's what I mean.. there isn't even any NPC's yet.My ""First Play on Launch Day"" Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJB0s1GD1RsFor mobs, you have three different ones.  Small cute wolves.  Medium half way cute wolves, and a big bad wolf with 9,999 hp that I suppose you need to level up killing all the smaller wolves to fight and eventually win...That's it!  ...Or it sure looks like it anyhow.  And I'm not patient enough to fight 1,000 wolves to kill the big bad wolf just to see if some new area suddenly ""pops"" in. I tried to explore the map, but all that's in the world is the small starter town with the two shopping ""points"" and a field of wolves.  No dungeons, no caves, no other mobs, no spells, no trainers, no loot besides wolf teeth, no fun for more then about 5 or 10 minutes right now, sorry folks!Even if there are more ""grind zones"" that you progress through, I have no desire to fight 1000 wolves in this simple town and field to suddenly appear in a similar little town with a single little area that spawns 1000 spiders or bears or whatever.  Zzzzzz.  This game needs more then that.  Way more.I encourage the developer(s) to please keep working on this game and get more content in because is it stands this game only offers maybe 5% of what I was hoping to see.  Yes, I'd like to see a 20x bigger map, at least 20 different types of mobs, I'd like to see lots more vendors, npcs, and quests, etc as well as at least a couple of dungeons.I know the asking price is small, but what you offer right now is even smaller.  Finish the game, ask more money, I'm game for that.  Or at least get the game half way done... something more then this please.On Early Access Launch day.. My score is killed by lack of fun and value..Value: 5 out of 40.  Fun: 5 out of 20.  Controls and Bugs: 15 out of 20 (add WASD and clickable hot bar, etc).  Graphics & Sound: 7 out of 10...My Early Access Launch Day Score = 32%  ..What's there now isn't bad at all.  Just need to be more.. a LOT more to make it even worth playing, much less paying any amount of money for!"

The areas can also be broken out of easily and you can wonder off into the distant mountains. I would like to reccomend this because it's okay for it's price, especially when on sale, but in this current state of no actual ending and the only acomplishment you get is by killing a bunch of enemies and collecting potions, quests given to you by people, which over time just repeat but in larger amounts, I cannot reccomend this.

You kill zombies, it get easier while you play because you get stronger and the zombies don't. Then you have a room with 3 zombies and 1 bigger zombie.

Gold pick-up sound is from Diablo, music is from free sources, slash sound is from a sound-pack from Unity Store, etc.* Texts were written by an unintelligent kindergartener. ""Boardsword"", ""Touchlight"" and plenty of other errors, mistakes and misspellings.* Game is so full of bugs that I don't even know where to begin. You can fall off the map. You can see random dead monsters bodies flying around (physics!). You can die for no reason (no monsters or traps around you). Overall, this game's just infuriating.* Gameplay is, surprisingly, exactly what the game's name says: this game is a grind zone. You spawn, you grind-kill monsters, you level-up, you find or buy gold and new loot... But it's so boring, and not intuitive, and lazily made, that I didn't want to be in this game more than I needed to farm the cards from it.Verdict: farm the cards and remove this game from your library."

Ok now that I got the obvious out of the way let´s get to why it´s such an abomination. First of all the graphics are actually really nice and the starter cutscene makes you think that this game actually has some story into it.NOPE! So as you start the game you get pumped up. You just bought a really cool looking rpg for few euros or dollars if you´re from that wierd country called America. Those will be your first impresions of the game so you start and create your character. You can choose either a Swordsmen, a Barbarian and a Sorcerer. Alright I may have screwed their names a bit but trust me after 5 minutes in the game they are all the completely same. The amount of items in the game is just outright awful I mean only 3 weapons 2 shields and 1 piece of armor? What is that you may think to yourself, maybe there will be more in the future. NOPE that´s really all there is. You fight the same looking zombie enemies for about 5 minutes if you take your time to complete the quests that are all completely the same and the only real difference between them is the number. At this point I´m dissapointed, but I keep playing in hope of it getting better. NOPE! It get´s even worse when you get to the second location that has a huge fps drops and doesn´t even let you through. That was the time I lost myself and just went screw this piece of garbage, unistalling and never playing again.

But the game's name gives itself, grinding. And small maps are good for grinding. Especially if you are playing it for the achievements. The game is incomplete though.Pros:+Easy Achievements+Easy Level Up and Slash system+Steam Cards+You can use bugs to wander around the outside of the map I dont know why but outside of the map is 10 times bigger than the inside.

Go with ""sword man"" and put all your stats into strenght and agility. Because when you give points to int only your max mana is going up. Not your mana regen.

From the start the game had good promise with 3 character classes, a level system and a somewhat basic yet nicely cell shaded aesthetic. Just 10 minutes later however, you realise how limited this game is. The entire game consists of 2 missions, 2 zones (one being small enough to fit into the field of view in the game) and a handful of items all of which can be purchased right from the start very easily – each class have the same weapons to buy and use the same skills leaving it as a pointless system and summing up how poorly put together this game is.2/10Pros/Cons+ Easy achievements attainable within 1.5 hours of grinding through the game.+ The cell shaded art style is enjoyable but let down by character models.- Incredibly limited gameplay due to the small map, 2 repeatable quests and just a few items.- The easy grind achievements are just as poorly thought out as the game itself.- Different classes don’t hold any merit as they share items, skills and stats.- Even the ‘boss’ zombie at the end of the map holds no quest or unique reward."

76561198056343990,Not Recommended,327680,33870993,Posted: 28 July,all,TheNorwayPlayer,"I believe that this game could've had potential, or still has if the developer is willing to expand upon it, though it doesn't seem like that will be happening anytime soon.But if the game updates with more content I'll be sure to update my review.At it's current state it reminds me more of a demo than a fully fledged game, as it only has two levels. The secound one being even shorter than the last.The graphics isn't bad, and is just about the only part of the game that could be considered somewhat ""finished"".The combat is kinda repetetive, besides the basic attack there are only two special abilites to use, which I found to be quite useless as I reached higher levels with my character, something that leads me into my next complaint.There isn't much challenge to find in the game. By just doing the few quests there were along the way, I easily beat the game in around thirty minutes. Could've probably done it faster if I wanted. The only time I was remotely close to death (besides the houndred deaths I had to grind for one of the acheivements) was when I faced what I believe to be the final boss, and that was only because I was careless due to the lack of challenge elsewhere in the game.The quests there were to do were few, and there were only two kinds of quests to accomplish just with increasing quantity. The NPCs were basically the same, just one of them had a slightly different name. And the shop stocks were the same at all the vendors. You probably could get all the things the shops sold within the first few minutes of gameplay. Another contributing factor to the lack of challenge in the game.The game does atleast have Steam trading cards and acheivements, though the acheivements were tedious to obtain due to the lack of incentive to continue, as there were no more unlockables or content to explore. Out of the 93 minutes I spent in this game, I think 60 of them were a boring grind for acheivements after finishing the game itself.Not to mention the trading cards seemingly only being images of mediocre quality in-game screenshots, kind of dissapointing to be honest. Although the badges and emoticons are kinda good looking, I found the backgrounds to be unsatisfying. Thought I'd include this since it's apparently one of the game's major selling points.In addition to all of this there were some other minor details that bothered me, such as the pause menu not actually pausing the game itself, despite it proclaiming to be a pause menu. Also the fact that the ragdoll bodies of the enemies might glitch out sometimes and go crazy, sometimes even knocking the potion the enemy dropped to oblivion, something which is slightly annoying when hunting for the collect 200 potions achievement.So, in the end, I was left to grind for the acheivements more than the actual in-game content.Not exactly getting me into my zone.If you really want to try this, I recommend getting it at a sale. Got my copy for like 36 cents or something, so I'm content."

When we are fighting the enemy we must make sure we are in the right direction to the enemy so our character can attack and cause damage. And that makes me so hard to deal with enemy. I think it would be very good with auto lock so we just click the mouse without aiming to enemy first.in short,-add another variant of quest not just collecting and killing-fix the battle system-and the story, make the game longer to finish."

First aa hit left side and secound aa hit right side of character. In first scenario (forest) u can easly hit 20 lvl only by droping 5 potions and using them for quest (1 NPC, cash reward) and buying other potions (same NPC). This way you can make fortune that will be used for potions. This time you can use them for potion quest (suprised ? i guess ure not) when u meet 2nd NPC (which looks like 1st NPC). Each 12 potions gives you 300 EXP. Its not grinding its just pointless quest that can be done on 1st lvl. After that action repeated multiple times u can reach 20lvl, add all points to strengh and kill all moster with maximum 3 hits with fire sword. Then u're like immortal. Game have only 2 locations (fortress and forest), 5 NPC (all looks same and have 2 quests: kill zombies 5-20 amount, potions 5-12? im not sure about maximum amount).Adding points to skills (max lvl of skill is 3rd, axeman and mage have same spells that deal low dmg)Jump (if u try to jump multiple times you can easly jump over textures and go to the map border then fall from map)Auto wear (if u pick weapon from the ground ure automatically wear it)Toolbar (if you put all 2 skills in it with less than 30 secs u should get achievement-its archaic)No checkpoint, because it have ""save"" button in esc menuI cant find turn down music and sfx button or zipperOne of the worst games i have ever played"

,Not Recommended,327680,32877895,Posted: 27 June,all,DawPapa,Hello everybody my name is Jeff and I just want to say that this is an incredible game that deserves to die in hell.The developers of this game wear so thoughtful that they put a quest in the first 5 meters of the spawn that you can totally exploit and just become a millionaire in 1 minute.They also added a fantastic feature which allows you to get out of the map from the spawn and go to the and of the first level.It should also be mentioned that the game has only 2 levels the first one is the size of a table and the second one which is just a boss fight is this size of a plate.The plot of the game is also very simple...it goes like this[GOOD LAND-ZOMBIE COME-ZOMBIE DIE-GET MONEY-FΑCK ΒITCHES].Overall me and my friend had a blast laughing at how stupidly broken this game is.Don't even think of ever buying this how stupidly broken this game is.It's a waste of your time and money I found it in steam summer sales and bought it with CS GO money.THATS IT.BB. XD. LOL. LMAO.

I expected more levels and more weapons and things u can buy. there is a key you can buy from a marchant but I still don't know where i'd use it for. For now I don't recomend the game due its low content but if the game gets updates and new content such as more boss fights and like dungeons I would like to try it out."

If you want money do the five potion one's if you want to get stronger do the twelve potion one's,and badabing badaboom you are the most overpowerd thing in the universe. And now the rest firstly the music sucks,secondly you can get outside the map and to any npc in the game or outside the map by jumping on trees,And finally the fact that as soon as you get to the fortress the game's over and there is nothing more to do.And now the my final note's the keys are a waste of money because they do nothing,the save bubble comes up way to rarely so I ended up getting to a high level just to lose everything and then I saw it.Now my final point... there is nothing that tells you how to talk to an npc (NOTHING) I found out by accident.Now remember that this is my opinion and experience someone probably likes this game but I don't"
