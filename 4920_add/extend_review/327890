,Recommended,327890,15941186,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,OreOS,"My opinion about the game overall:If you were expecting a funny/punny review then you came to the wrong review. I decided to make an actual helpful/serious review for the game. Let me start off saying this is a really great game and is a real and serious game despite looking like a joke, back when I saw this game in Greenlight I laughed and gave it a vote expecting it to be a game that wouldn't even get to a full release, when it first came out my friend bought it so I went to his place and played it for a few hours, after playing it a few times I decided to buy i. Aas it got more and more updates it got better. A lot of people say the game is hard to play with a keyboard but I disagree, back when I first played the game I didn't have a controller so I played it with a keyboard, after a while, I got a controller, and the only thing that was hard about playing with a controller was that sometimes I got confused with the buttons' names, overall it's better with a controller. Awesome game, they really put a lot of work to it and listened to the community throughout the making of the game.Cons and pros:+Remappable keyboard controls+Changable sensitivity+Graphic options also pretty customizable+Great graphics+Great support from the devlopers of the game in issues you might run into+Achievements-Controls can take time to get used to-New players can sometimes be annoyed by the game's challenge but that's pretty subjectiveGamemodes:Story mode: At the beginning of each level you are presented with some sort of letter about an insane guy who's also the house owner, you finish reading it or skip it and you then spawn as a  piece of bread at the start of the level, at some levels you have extras you can add to yourself like jam and butter which have some side effects. You travel through the level possibly using various objects on the way to eventually get to the toaster or pan or whatever else you want to fry yourself on, in most levels there is more than one way to toast yourself. You get a grade based on your edibility, tastiness and possibly your time but I'm not sure about that, grades are from A++ from F(you only get f if you didn't finish the level). Story mode is overall challenging and my personal favorite. There are 8 levels in the story mode game mode.Bagel Race: In this gamemode you spawn as a bagel in a different spawn than your spawn points at Story Mode, you need to run through the map using 3 and 4 keys(by default assuming you're using the keyboard) and the mouse and pass through checkpoints on the way to the end, you get a grade based on how fast you completed the race. There are 8 levels in the bagel race game mode. You have no edibility in this game mode.Rampage: In this game mode you play as a baguette. In this mode your goal is to cause as much damage as possible to various objects around the level, the more damage you cause the better grade you are gonna get. You have multiplier for everytime you smash a few things at once. You have no edibility in this game mode. Rampage has 8 levels. You have a time limit at this game mode.Cheese hunt: In this game mode you play as a crackbread. In this game mode you spawn as crackbread and start wandering around to find cheese and touch it so it sticks to you, as far as I know there are 5 pieces of cheese in each level. you lose ediblity by falling and/or hitting something too hard. You have no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Cheese Hunt.Zero G(ravity): In this game mode you play as a slice of bread. This game mode is pretty much the same as the regular gamemode only there isn't gravity and you need to fly around with jets attached to you. I cannot explain the controls to this game mode as they are very complicated to explain, the main difference from the main game mode is that your grade is also based off the amount of fuel you've used up(You have infinite fuel, you use up fuel when you use your jets). You have edibility in this game mode, you lose ediblity when you touch the floor as far as I know. There is no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Zero G(ravity).I'll edit this to explain about the gamemodes left soon."

I won’t. But I could.******************Due to popular demand Ive decided to add a more ‘wholemeal’ first look review for people who like that sort of thing.The game is essential qwop combined with the floor is lava. You navigate your slice of bread around various obstacles on a quest to get yourself nicely toasted (insert your own joke there).  Encountering dirty items reduces your edibility and therefore your overall score, whilst getting smothered in tasty tasty jam boosts it.The game controls exactly how you would imagine it does. Each corner is assigned a different button which when pressed holds that edge in place apparently regardless of the surface/physics. The mouse or thumb stick flicks the bread around of can be used to nudge it around for precise movements. Practiced or naturally skilled will surely be able to cartwheel their way onto the leaderboards quickly whilst people starting out will ultimately spend more time flailing around like a dying Magicarp. Your main opponent is your own frustration.If the play style is sounding very familiar that’s because it is. Anyone who has already played Surgeon Simulator or Octodad will immediately recognise the pattern of destruction and failure. This means that behind its freshly baked exterior the game is likely to become stale fairly quickly. Like its sister games there is a big potential for fun workshop content but ultimately you cannot judge a game on what could possibly be made by fans later on.It is worth pointing out that it is an early access game, meaning that it is essentially unfinished, although this game does feel a lot more complete than most. It is very much playable with the exception of a few minor bugs. Enabling the gif record mode makes the game basically unplayable and the music always seems to be coming out of a random corner of the room.I think overall most people will have already made a decision about this game, and whatever your thoughts they are probably correct. It’s ultimately a casual iPad-destined meme-maker but it clean fun and will give most people a few laughs for less than the price of an average cinema ticket. If flinging a slice of bread around for a few hours is the sort of thing that will brighten your day, then this is probably for you."

The goal is to get to the toaster on the other side of the room, and to toast yourself. It's definitely not as simple as it sounds, though!It's a fantastic game for its price. :>EDIT 12/04/14: I didn't expect this review to get so much attention, geez. x3A lot of people seem to be under the impression that it's free-play, and that there's no real goal or penalities, etc. I'll clear that up for you.There's no sandbox mode yet. The only real limitation you have, is not touching the floor. If you do so, it'll drain your 'health bar'.There are a couple of different levels. Even if you manage to complete them all, the replay value is high, as there's multiple ways to complete each level!Despite being early access, this game feels perfectly complete! It's fun to play in 'bursts'. :>*some li'l genuis was complaining about everyones' playtime on it. It literally just came out yesterday (12/13), dork."

No, I was the second slice in. I emerged from my loaf in glorious fashion, spreading my crumbs all over as I flew from what I once called home. This was the start of my journey.I emerged in to a world of culinary decadence. To my left was Mt. Butter, and to my right was Jelly Valley. There were so many places to see, so many things to do. Life had finally begun.I began my voyage to Toaster Kingdom by first heading for Mt. Butter. It was always a dream of mine to stand-atop the hills on Mt. Butter, and I did just that. I paraded to the top in mere seconds, only to slide down Mt. Butter and splash right in to Jelly Valley.It was like a slip-n-slide of deliciousness.I emerged from Jelly Valley covered from bread to toe, only to come to the edge of the world. I could see it all from here; the vast landscapes of Breadland, the hills of Crumbilina, but most of all, I could see Toaster Kingdom, and I knew my journey was far from over.In a moment of serenity, I took a giant leap of faith, and I floated through space and time, in an absolute moment of glory. I didn't know what was waiting for me below, but I knew this was what had to be done.Falling for what seemed an eternity, I thought this to be the end. Just then, something emerges below me, and I land softly on to a giant looking board with wheels. My savior.I thanked it for saving me, and we bonded very quickly. It turns out, we are both heading to the same destination, and he agrees to let me travel on him. I hold on tight, and off we go. We travel through canyons, wastelands, hell, we even traveled through large ravines.We're almost there.We arrive at the Counter-Top Haven. The final stop before Toaster Kingdom. Just when we are in-reach of the Toaster Kingdom, my new friend informs me that he can go no further, for he is not capable of climbing. He entrusts me with a gift for King Toaster, a serum of sorts. He called it Maple Syrup. I am clueless what it would be used for, after-all the King is french. I don't understand what he would possibly do with such a thing. Nevertheless, I say thank you for everything, as a tear of jelly starts rolling down my face, and I start my ascent to reach the top of Counter-Top Haven.It's a rough climb. It takes me about a minute or two, as I seem to be slipping and sliding all over the cliffs and peaks of this place. Maybe it's the jelly, maybe it's the butter, but all's I know is that I must persevere. I must make it to Toaster Kingdom.I finally reach the top of Counter-Top Haven, and Toaster Kingdom and the Toaster King are in my line of sight. I flop towards them as fast as my nimble body can take me, battered and buttered and bruised. I reach the entrance to Toaster Kingdom. I can feel it now. I'm almost there. I only have to climb once more and I will have completed my first voyage.With all the strength I can muster, I grip tightly on to the walls of Toaster Kingdom. I manage to hoist myself a-top this beautiful landscape. I'm here. I made it. The Toaster King is in sight. I just have to decend to the throne room, and I will have fulfilled my purpose in life.Just as I am readying myself to decend towards the king, a gust of wind blows me off of the top of the kingdom. Down I fly, past Counter-Top Haven. Below I go, to the ends of the earth. No one to save me this time. I fall. I fall.I land in the dirt.Ruined.I wither and die.10 / 10. Would play again."

Playing with a controller as well though, I imagine the keyboard and mouse method is even more irritating.*Edit*I made it to day 3 and no longer only get F's. The amount of creativity the second level requires is enough to be worth $10. This isn't an A  to B type puzzle game. You not only have to figure out what's going to be your toaster, but how you're going to get there and make it capable of toasting.I've only gotten to try day 3 once so far but the fact the walls are dirty and I once again have no idea what is going to toast my bread adds a whole nother level of puzzle solving I was not expecting from such an outlandish game.Even after passing day 1 multiple times and day 2 once I still haven't managed to make my toast ""tastey"" though.

You have to have a good controller though to really be able to play the game- keyboard and mouse isn't really playable. It's a platformer at it's core and you have to toast yourself to beat each level avoiding dirty food, walls, and floors. There are glitches and other bugs in the game but remeber- this review was made during open beta. I'm sure they will iron out all the glitches and add more content so I would recommend this game. 9/10 can be a bit difficult at times."

That will kill the edibility of the bread.However trying to steer this bread or moving it it's extremly tedious... i HATE the controll sceme (I tried both Keyboard and Gamepad (xbox controller)  It's very hard and takes tons of time to get used with the controls.I spend over 18-25 minutes on the first level... trying to get this bread toasted.  it's very hard but managedable with a bit of cursing with tears in my eyes. the second level is even worse and i don't even want think about the rest.Then again i see how no other control sceme would work for this game.What i like:* Grapichs and physics* Fun to break stuff and climb onto things.What i hate:* How you control the bread...* How there was NOT any free roam/free play from the start where you can just mess around without having to worry about the floor.So there you have it.If they where kind enough to add a free roam to the game from the start where you could have a little fun i would be very pleased and give it a YES.But it seems you have to spend hours on trying to get toased and move on the next day, no idea if they will reward you with a free roam function.This is an early review of the game and i might change it later.For now, i do not recommend this game. to tedious.EDIT:I am not a hater of the game, as many comments below state.I know these type of games and i'm very femiliar with the Surgon simulator which is also very hard on the controlls.The idea is brilliant and the concept is fun and adoring, and i'm a working male who plays video games in my spare time and i'm quite the good player on most games, and i'm not ""bad"" just because i can't get passed day two.  It's early access and they want to listens to people's good and bad reports of it.I'm just saying the game show no remorse for a simple mistake. You fall, you die. Restart and spend another 25-30 minutes getting through the level.Don't take my word for it, read other people's negative reviews, they will state the same.People who says ""I'm a bread, got jelly on me and fell face down. 12/10"" is a part of this new ""funny steam review"" trend and don't take the game all to seriosly.Thanks to people who actually cared for my review!"

Don't trust the user rating.Seems like it's just another ""zany"" game now that the goat simulator hype has died down.People who enjoy ""teh randumbs"" will probably enjoy this game, but I didn't personally enjoy this title after going through the first level.The game is quite simple. You try to guide a piece of bread across the room to a toaster and toast yourself inside of it. while trying to keep your ""freshness"" as high as possible without touching things like trails of ants or the floor..However, in my opinion, the physics are just awful. I would much rather the bread have QWOP's physics system than the system it has now. A problem I constantly run into is the bread not turning the right way, not properly turning, or just not turning at all.All in all, it may seem like a good purchase just because of how out there the game is, but you'll probably regret it after putting it down about 10 minutes later."

,Not Recommended,327890,13233654,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,Soupcan,"tl;dr - Use the money you'd spend on this game to buy an actual loaf of bread -- you'll have more fun with that._____I'd like to preface this review by saying that, truly, I was actually looking forward to this game.  It seemed quirky, sandbox-y, and hopefully enjoyable, and the reviews seemed to be overall positive.  It couldn't all have been just people rating it highly, just because you're playing as bread, right?  This had to be actually fun!  However, having now given this game a try, I can say that it doesn't live up to the hype at all.First, I should state, from the trailers, it would seem like the game takes place in a sandbox-type game style.  Run around, cover yourself in crud, do stupid stuff, etc.  Tons of fun, right?  Well, if you're looking for that kind of gameplay, you've come to the wrong place, currently.  Perhaps when the game is more developed, there will be a free-play mode, but currently, there is only an objective mode, wherein you must make it from one side of the kitchen to the other, and toast yourself.  Still sounds fun, right?  Now, I imagine you may be sitting there going, ""At least you can cover yourself in all sorts of stuff!""  Except, you can't, or your edibility bar hits zero and you get a game-over.  ""Well, I can still climb all over the place, and swing from shelf to shelf like some gluten-based Tarzan, right?""  Well, bad news, you've only got a limited grip gauge that very quickly depletes, and you need to let it recharge again before you can grab anything, once it runs out.  Anddd when you hit the floor, your edibility quickly drops, as well.  I'm sure that, as it's early access, some of these issues will probably be addressed, but at this point, the trailers look much better than the game is.Still, you know what?  That could still be a fun, challenging game.  Could be.  That is, if not for what me be perhaps the worst problem with this game: the contols are just awful.  And no, I don't mean like Surgeon Simulator's ""haha this is hilarious"" awful, I mean ""why is the mouse suddenly inverted?  It didn't move like this before.  Why is it not responding to my movements?!"" awful.  Seemingly at random, the game decides that you're now pulling back when you're pushing forward, swinging left when pulling right, etc., and then, at the drop of a hat, decides to go back to normal again.  Usually while you're climbing the walls with your quickly depleting grip gauge, or trying to finagle your way into the toaster slot, resulting in you either falling to the floor (at which point, the process repeats until yourhealthedibility bar hits zero) or you flinging the toaster down to the floor, where toasting is not really an option (again, inevitably resulting in the edibility gauge hitting zero, but even more heartbreaking is victory is wrested from your fingers.  Er... Crust?).  If these controls didn't decide at random not to work, perhaps I could have had fun.  Perhaps this could have been a worthwhile game.  However, as it stands, the game is not challenging, it is just downright frustrating, and it is NOT worth your money.  Wait for them to improve the handling (if they ever do)."

There's no tutorial and no on-screen hints to guide your progress, but a little bit of exploration will make the control scheme clear - you can grab with any combination of corners at once, and nudge, flip or fling yourself toward furniture or objects scattered about the room.Sometimes the physics of interactive objects gets a little wonky; grabbing onto an object as it topples may sometimes hurl you in an unexpected direction, but the simulation is pretty solid otherwise. Hazardous elements of the environment are left for the player to discover; surfaces or objects that decrease the bread's ""ediblility"", hurting your score and eventually causing you to fail the level.Succeeding at becoming toast unlocks a new room and a little more of the backstory, hinting at a larger meaning beyond finding a way to brown oneself. The novelty of the concept and the control scheme make a simple game very enjoyable and eminently replayable."

It's a lovely novel concept, the story (yes, there is one) is pretty good, and the level design ranges from open and flexible to linear and ♥♥♥♥ WHOEVER MADE THIS. Mercifully, there is a Super Guide equivalent to let you get through any level at the expense of a forced E rank, although even with that in place you can still be hard pressed to figure out how to toast yourself.I realize that the game is fumblecore at its heart, but it often seems to demand just a bit too much for what you can feasibly do with its unique blend of A) the controls, B) the physics, and C) the camera. The controls in and of themselves are generally manageable, but when attempting to swing like Bread Tarzan across a string of 6 or so sunflowers and the goddamn cocking things are just flailing about as though in a typhoon because of arbitrary WACKY physics, the game just starts to fall apart. If you manage to smash open a jam jar to coat yourself, you can spend a full couple of minutes wrestling with all of the broken glass trying to actually make contact with the jam -- and once coated it can actually make movement much more challenging, to the point that you'll be unable to detach from a surface until you've swiveled the camera to an angle where the controls feel like cooperating, assuming the camera also cooperates and doesn't get stuck inside a wall pointing at the ceiling. When levels last upwards of 10 minutes and have no checkpoints, getting dicked to death by the camera and/or how it interacts with the controls is not a fun experience. The epilogue took me 5 tries alone; once because it was my fault, three times in a row because the physics made my bread clip into the car and spaz out, the third time ending with me launching into space at infinite velocity.There's only a handful of levels in total but a few different modes to play them in and a standing possibility of more post-release content for free and/or as DLC. All in all I enjoyed it, but the physics and camera still definitely need work, and due to the prolonged format of the levels as compared to Surgeon Simulator, it's just a much more frustrating experience as a whole.As a final caveat, none of the achievements seem to work yet either."

,Not Recommended,327890,13219358,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Rex,"To summarise my opinion on this game, the learning curve is like trying to climb an overhanging cliff, both literally and metaphorically.There isn't much really to say about it, the controls are almost unusable;, they worked in Surgeon Simulator where you where the camera was always the same, however in this the camera has a variable orientation, and so relying on the direction of the bread which isn't easily distinguishable when you're stuck on something of the horribly balanced first level or fell onto the floor because you don't want to move the camera around to see if the gap between the fridge and the cubbard is too big to gap (protip: the cubbard receeds so far in you cannot scale it whatsoever, avoid at all costs) and while you can get used to the controls, you do so in the manner someone who recently was disabled learns to use the toilet while in a wheelchair. I'd reccomend changing it so that the arrow keys move in relation to where the camera is facing, and WASD are fixatedly assigned to a corner, and overlap each other the further away they are from the camera.Also, the camera has the sensetivity of my rib cage being perforrated by the fingers of someone with anorexia. Even the slightest movement will cause it to jerk 180, and if you were grabbing onto something good luck getting where you were planning on going before you fall to the floor with the (at least what I interpreted) message ""♥♥♥♥ you thats what you get for trying to rotate the camera"".Also, the trailer is very misleading. While it advertises a simple game that tells the tale of a slice of bread on its quest to become toasted, when you get in game you get a happy upbeat song to the tune of a level whose traversability resembles that of a poorly made game with graphics that don't match the lacking quality of the level. The Jenga blocks are evil and you will get stuck on them because you're a loaf of bread with a big area and those jenga blocks don't leave much room on either side for you to pass.You are virtually immobile when not grabbing onto something, and I think that is just stupid. Grabbing should be a method to assist you to get from A to B, not be the only way to do it. Just have the bread flip and timble according to what edges/surfaces are touching what and in what direction the bread is travelling.Finally, make getting past the fridge easier. If you try to go up it you'll run out of grip before you realise there is no space at the top to climb over, and if you try to go in front of it you'll realise that the cubbard handles protrude so much that the stale bread you represent cannot bend the majority of its body mass around the corner of a fridge ever so slightly to grip the recessed area of the cubbard, which if you didn't know is basically everything except the handles.I said it once and I will say it again, stay away from the cubbard because it will ♥♥♥♥ you up.First level needs some SERIOUS rebalancing, music is too upbeat, camera is on steroine and the controls are aparaplegic.Those problems need to be fixed fast, because thats not how you add challenge to a game, thats how you make it unplayable, a hugely unappealing game, and a waste of €8."

It's often difficult to tell what pressing forward will cause the bread to do; sometimes flopping one way or the other. The degree of motion is also somewhat confusing. Throwing the stick in a direction  can send the bread in a flying leap or have it just limply flop over. This sounds minor, until you factor in rediculous time limits and surfaces that can rapidly drain your health from a momentary touch.The physics engine can't behave itself (check the community page, it's like 60% gifs of the physics bugging out). Which again, is cute to see happen, but when you've spent 5 minutes making your way across a level, only to be thrown across the room by a bug, it quickly turns from cute to controller snapping frustrating.If you can pick it up for a couple of bucks the wackiness is certainly charming and distracting, but ultimatly the frustrating lack of agency in the game play will probably have you giving up long before you've explored most of the content."

It seems to me that I am watching honey bear take supper with a family of badgers and a pair of rather snobish french ducklings. I see a butterfly flutter past, and my eyes follow it only to see it stop to perch on a Loaf of Bread.......could it be?surely my eyes must still be decieving me! but alas, as I peruse my surroundings for a second time I see nothing but a filthy kitchen with half empty bottles laying at random across the room. The counter top appeared to be overrun by a hoard of disgusting ants, and the table upon which I was laying seemed to have a Loaf of Bread sitting right in the middle, OF WHICH I WAS NOT A PART OF!I gasped in horrorIT WASN'T TRUE!it couldn't be!I? Seperated from my Loaf?I retreated within my self TRYING to regain the calm sense of quiet colaboration from which I was so violently torn!sure enough, I could no longer regain contact with my brethren.My soul despaired.but I am not one to sit and loaf about in a bad situation. I gripped the surface of the table with all of my might and flung myself headlong toward the edge. I peered over, shuddering to my self at the sight of the pathogen sullied floor a few feet below. I gazed across the gap at my destination, Took a moment to steele myself for the gravity defying leap, dug my corners into the table and pushed against it with such a force that it sent me careening into the air! There was a fleeting moment of despair as I realized that I would miss my intentended target, but I quickly regained my concentration to find a solution to my predicament. As I soared past the chair between the table and countertop, I managed to just grab the top with my left corner. For a moment I thought I was safe, but as I clung to the chair, it began to tip. Slowly at first, but then faster, and FASTER! I feared it would fall to the floor and crush me beneath its weight, but in mid fall the top of the chair hit the edge of the counter top... and stayed there! This was brilliant! I hoisted myself up from my precarius perch and up to the counter top just as the last of my grip strength ran out. I lay there gasping for breath as I let my tired corners rest. But it was no more than a minute or two's respite before I was compelled to flee from the newest danger of my harrowing journey. The ants. They ran on to me climbing up my white and fluffy sides as I tried hopelessly to shake them off. I could feel my precious edibility dropping as the ants crawled up and down my quivering body. I threw myself recklessly across the counter and began to climb the huge white expanse that was the refridgerator.

With a controller, the game is pretty manageable. It's also a very fun and entertaining game, without a doubt. It's like Goat Simulator, but with bread. BREAD.If you like little quirky, fun, somewhat challenging, and bizzare games, this definately is well worth it. Now, I got it on sale for $8.49, and I believe $10 may be a bit much. For a game that's early access and is still somewhat buggy at times, I believe it's worth around $7.50. None the less, I reccomend this game if you like something you can♥♥♥♥♥♥around in.Once again, this game is almost made as a joke. Not implying that it's bad, but it's one of those jokes that in the past people would make fun of. ""HAH! Who'd want to play a game where you're a slice of bread?"" Apparently alot of people.KEEP IN MIND that the goal in this game is to become toast. By any means necessary. Be it Toaster or Radiator, your goal is to become toast.---Now i'll note why I believe the keyboard / mouse controlls are wonky.To grip onto things, you have 1,2,3, and 4. To grab things, you have Q,W,E, and R. To look around, you use Right Click, and to move around, you use Left Click. I believe this control scheme could have been improved in some fassion. Such as look around being locked onto the cursor.So ways I think they could improve the mouse & keyboard controlls;1. Make the camera snap to the cursor, so you look around by moving the mouse.2. Use a control layout that's a little bit more natural, for instance;---When I place my left hand on my keyboard, my fingers naturally will rest on (From left to right); Left Shift, A, W, D and the Space Bar.---A Good Idea would be to change it from 1234 to LShift, A, D, and Space Bar, using W for push away from camera and S for being pull towards the camera (Or the direction that the camera is facing).---Another way to change the control scheme, is to do what's listed above, but change the camera look from mouse to arrow keys. This would make gameplay better on laptops, and users who prefer playing with a keyboard.The game is in early access, so again, things will change over time. Hopefully the controlls for keyboard/mouse will become more naturall over time.Aside from that, I do reccomend this fun quirky little game."

This is a trial and error sort of game, the trouble being every trial can last about 15 minutes or longer.  the first hour of the game is spent trying to get used to the controls. Then you blunder along trying not to touch the floor or other various things through each room. Apparently the controls are better with a controller, but after trying it with my steam controller, they were even worse. I am using a keyboard and mouse, and while I got the controls down pretty good finally, some things are just random and uncontrollable.When you are not figthing the controls, you are fighting the camera and it is very hard to navigate up a wall with limited grip time while having to adjust the camera as well and trying to squish yourself up between two tight spaces.It took me like 20 minutes just to fit inside a toaster thanks to flaily bread controls.Anyway, the gameplay itself is unique and clever, but not very fun. It is just repeating the same thing over again until you figure something out to get you further along in your helpless search for a heat source.When you miraculously reach a heat source, good luck trying to find the place where it actually would heat you up. I am not sure if there are certain spots only that are hot, or if the game just isn't working correctly. For example, I was climbing all over a space heater, but only one tiny spot on the whole thing heated me up. As you scramble around the heat source trying to get toasted, you will likely fall off and die. Not very fun.If you are a more patient human being than I and enjoy doing long repetitions of bread flopping over everything, then buy it. I personally find it very boring, slow moving and frustrating because you never feel truly in control.The game does give people like me some help though. If you fail twice on a given level, some super butter or something comes and gives you unlimited life and grip. This makes beating the levels much easier, but it makes a boring game even more boring.One good thing I can say about ""I Am Bread"" is that there is a rather large amount of content. Too bad the game is too horrible to play through it all. I usually force myself to beat terrible games, but for the second time in memory, I have had enough after 5 levels."

The more elaborated answer is a bit more... complicated.Yes, I recommend it because:+ The ultimate challenge for your patience+ wonderful, playful music+ nice graphics+ excellent ideaBut I don't recommend it because:- It's way too hard and unforgiving for its own good (imho).- Short soundtrack - all though lovely, I only played like 70 minutes, and I already got tired of the soundtrackI want to comment a little bit more elaborated on the ""too hard for its own good""-point here. I know this game is supposed to be hard, and I know it is the ultimate challenge. But in my opinion there are too many factors that makes you fail in order for this to be fun to play. Prior to ordering this game, I was just thinking that people were too bad gamers and soar loosers for down-voting this game due to its controls and being too hard. But now I understand them.It is hard enough to master navigating the bread; but once you learn that it's quite simple. HOWEVER, what I cannot grasp is why the most difficult aspect of this game is to get into the God forsaken toaster??? You've just been through hell to get to the toaster, and then you simply cannot get into the bloody thing. On the first story mission I mastered my skills to get to the toaster in like 3 - 4 minutes, which is quite good considering I just bought the game. But then you are rewarded by having to spend another 5 minutes to get the bread to actually go into the toaster. And that blew a fuse for me.The second thing that makes this game too difficult is how unforgiving it is; not only do you loose edibility (health), but also have a grip-counter which is way too short/small considering how you are sometimes supposed to hang above the floor infront of a grill in order to become toasted.It is also not rewarding enough. The grading scale in the end is way too demanding, which more often than not sends out a vibe that ""Hey, You suck ballz!"". I mean, I don't expect an A-grading for completing a mission in 10 minutes, but a D when I lost no health at all? That is just mean.So how to ""fix"" this game in my opinion? Make it a bit more forgiving; don't make it so difficult to get into the toaster after all the hell getting to the toaster, indicate WHAT is the toaster (it is difficult enough to get to it, you should not have to search for WHAT is the toaster), and make the toast more responsive to your controlls.All in all: If you like to torture yourself, and/or have an incredible amount of patience, this game is for you. The concept is brilliant. But considering the immense difficulty of the game I would not recommend this for the weak-minded (I guess I am a weak-minded gamer in this sense).My final verdict is a 7/10 for being a brilliant concept with good graphics and being a game that really stays true to its intended gameplay. But NO, I don't recommend this, unless you have some serious nerves of steel and is serious about sitting hours just to get through one or two levels of the game."

Learning and mastering the controls is the main challenge.You start out clumsily flopping around, smashing everything your way. And by the end you'll be making flips from wall to wall like a preschooler on acid.Cons mostly consist of some unwarranted failures due to wonky physics knocking over a toaster you desperately need. The learning curve is pretty harsh too. And the lack of real tutorial can be an issue if you get frustrated easily.Overall. The game if real fun.

You play a piece of bread on a quest to get toasted in each level, using various items such as irons or radiators or frying pans. Touching the floor or any other dirty surface will reduce your edibility percentage and once that hits 0% you lose.Unfortunately, the game’s engine and programming also mean you will have to battle with the camera randomly adjusting itself on certain angles and the bread ragdolling around spastically from time to time. You can alleviate this to some degree by predicting which corner will contact next during a flip and hold that corner’s respective button down but even that can be a guessing game. Keeping in mind, your grip meter is counting down the entire time you are holding any buttons down so you’re on a time limit until you reach stable ground. After a few rounds of flailing and failure the game will throw you a bone by giving you an invincibility power up although using it basically removes any challenge from the game.I Am Bread is one of those games where you either love the concept or hate it, and I couldn’t find anything to love about it.

Environmental hazards like used band-aids and dirt reduce your edibility, forcing you to find different pathways as you jitter and flip your way around the house with the shoulder buttons and the left analog stick. The variety is surprising, as you'll find multiple ways to flip, toss, and jiggle your bread with the shoulder buttons.It might be weirdly unintuitive at first, but with practice, the controls become quite natural. It ultimately becomes a key part of the game from easily becoming a stale novelty. Suffice it to say though, a controller is a must. The keyboard and mouse combo would only wreck your hands.The crusty parts eluded to earlier involve a camera that can sometimes work against you. The angle can change quickly, altering the way the controls and forcing you to compensate for it. It happens infrequently, but leaves an irritating impression when it does happen. The environment could also use some life to it, as aside from the multiple ways to become toasted, there isn't much else to do in it. Some challenging trigger events like turning on the TV (which I found disappointingly unresponsive in the second level), or even a combo of related actions could have added much more value.Nonetheless, I am Bread provides fresh, delicious scent to an indie landscape overstuffed with me-too first-person shooter and rogue-lite games. Highly recommended for those looking for a new, action-oriented game and recommended still for everyone else."

""I'm so in,"" sucker me said. I fork out the asking price, start up and am impressed by the settings options better than some games. Choose controller option, then realize I can't navigate menus (including restarting) with my controller still need mouse for that, not fun annoyed starts. Ok start playing, controller seems way better then keyboard and OMG, I'm controlling a piece of bread go me... but soon I realized the controls are about 10 times more horrible then surgeon simulator, the collision detection is horrible, collision detection can also be influenced by camera angles, and the camera angels are forced and hard to get a decent line of sight. Furthermore the lacking camera angles prevent you from being able to see the level and the game lacks a free roam mode with no edibility so you can explore.I have played early access games thinking this has potential, however I feel this game isn't even developed to the point where you can tell yet. Also the question ""how do you control a piece of bread?"", was not answered very well by the devs. Until I see some major improvements in playability I would not recommend this game!If in the future this game does improve, I will update my review.UPDATE:So since my original review the game has receiceved quite a bit of content and polish.Of the content I enjoyed the startch wars, the controls were actually playable but couldn't figure out what to do after destroying three weak points on the main ship. I gave up on the bagel race but felt like the rampage control where pretty good. I also found 0-gravity mode fun but sill nearly impossible to controll, there was cheese hunt and free roam but those are thing I only do with my girl friend so I didn't give them a shot. I tried tutorial mode and it took my a minute to realize they disabled the joystick in tutorial mode which really made me think why!? am I alway suposed to be controlling my bread with the d-pad? The other thing I realized was that the menus are still not fully navigatable with a controller so overall I just can't recommend this game to people, the video makes it look like fun but then you play it's just too difficult to enjoy the experience."

In fact, it's designed to be hard to master, just like its predecessor 'Surgeon Simulator'. The difference this time, though, is that you yourself are not in a fixed position. Also you are a slice of bread. This lends to some awkward hand-eye mishaps and equally awkward doughy propulsion. Eventually you get the hang of it and start cartwheeling and breadboarding all over the place. Once you figure out basic movement, you can conquor any environment. I have come to write this review shortly after beating all of the available campaign, and I plan on trying to get higher scores than straight Fs and Ds.The health system of the game, I think, is actually great. It is 'Edibility', how appealing your spongy self looks. Seeming loosely based on the Five Second Rule, you can't spend too long touching the floor/rolling in ants or hair. This subsequently results in many restarts from mishaps in your yeastly yaw, which is also hilarious to watch. Who doesn't like watching a piece of bread fail at a highly unlikely adventure by spinning out of control across the room?There's more than one way to slice a loaf. You can navigate through the room the way you decide, be it by skateboard, wall climbing, or by the 'easiest' path. With many different ways you can go, I am Bread is like an open world game. Just... open room. Swing from cabinets, smash the plates, hang off ledges: there's a whole bathroom of adventure out there!With hope of more amazing content (and secrets), this game is worth every dime (and possibly penny). Definitely a must if on sale. It's truly a game, and not just a 'flop til you pop' gimmick.This game is a crusted challenge. You will not succeed often. Persevere. One day you will be toast."

Playing without a controller is just like having a hardon in tight jeans. Not enjoyable and painful. Either ways, if you absolutely can't play with a controller for any reasons buy the game anyways because bread.11/10 toasts out of 3 loaves"

,Recommended,327890,17160351,"Posted: 21 July, 2015",all,No Animals Were Harmed,"In a game that takes you 10 minutes to get to the toaster and 20 to get in it, this game is a must. Why is it a must? Well, the physics in this game are incredible (get this: bread can actually break ceramic plates.), the idea of this game is amazing, I mean, come on. You're bread. What's more original than being bread? The reason I actually completed the first level was because of the soundtrack. So derpy, fits the mood (""What mood?"" BEING BREAD, YOU DUMMY!), and it is pretty comical... An ""edibility"" meter indicates how edible your slice of bread is. How do you ruin this? Falling on the floor, going into the sink full of water, failing epicly and plummeting to your doom in a litter box, etc.Story: What story?All you need to do is get to the toaster as fast as you can and with as much edibility as you can! Simple, easy, and straight-up original. Can't find this anywhere else.Gameplay: 9/10This would be a perfect score, however, if the controls weren't clunky as hell, it'd be one point higher. The gameplay involves you moving through a series of household obstacles (like plates, stoves, openable refrigerators, sinks filled with water, the floor, and even crumbs on the counters) to get to a toaster on the other side of the room by using the controls (see controls). The controls kinda tie into the gameplay, hence bumping this down a point. The thing that really irritates me is the grip. Grr. Kinda reminds me of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness. It's okay, because it's a long grip time, but gets irritating when you fall a hundred feet to the floor and have to climb back up again. The annoying part about this game is when you first start out, you have to take about 10 minutes to get to the toaster and another 20 getting in it, unless you grasp the controls and mechanics quickly.Graphics: 8/10Not high definition, but it's not supposed to be. It's a game about manuvering bread. Are you supposed to see every grain of bread on the slice you control?Controls: 7.5/10(I've played with a controller, and it's way easier than mouse and keyboard)You control the bread with the triggers, bumpers, and the A B X Y buttons, with the triggers and bumpers to grab and the A B X Y buttons to lock your grasp, useful for pulling things off of counters and watching them crash to the floor. The D-Pad can be used to look around your slice of bread, and the right stick is used for orbiting your slice. The left stick is used for moving around the ""limbs"", or in this case, corners of your slice. The controls are okay, amid the ""I want to move you this way, but you move this way (then when I try to correct you, you fall to the floor and start losing edibility)"" type of gig.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack, the breaking of ceramic plates, the sound you make when grabbing things. Utter perfection. By ""perfection"", I mean it perfectly fits the game in it's own little way. Comical, stupid, wierd(, original).Replay Value: 10/10Continue to fail epicly in an attempt to get to the toaster.Overall Rating Value: 8.9/10This game is for you if you like the frustration of Surgeon Simulator: 2013, the bugginess of Goat Simulator, and the comedy of Mount Your Friends."

Got to the bathroom level and then I just ended up saying ""no"".I guess some of the jokes are funny enough, and the story seems interesting, but I was expecting Surgeon Simulator kind of fun.

Moving around is beyond silly. What makes it worse is the lag in controls as well.  I'm running a i7 and this game still has delays within the control system.Graphics are mediocre at best. (And this is final version?)There IS a goal of trying to toast yourself. Exciting.Anyway, if you hit the floor you die very quickly.Move on other objects and they smash.Not sure if I am meant to smash all the objects or what but that seems the high point of gameplay.Its general control has improved slightly since alpha, BUT there is still virtually no control of the main player.  The bread apparently has suction cups on the corners but they only last a little while. You end up just flopping around and spinning in circles. Movement is based more on luck that skill.Game itself seems aimed at either little children who may get a thrill out of flopping around like soggy bread, or those that may be easily amused (or those with child like mentallity.) There is no real purpose to the levels or real storyline.I gather its meant to be a bit of a joke type game but really the gameplay is the joke.The developers seem to have had enough of the game, and released it as ""Final"" rather than fix up the bugs, poor graphics, poor gameplay and contolability issues.They did add some silly levels that appear to have been done in a rush just for basic content fill, but none of those add anything to the game overall.Contrary to all the silly coments and juvenile jokes, the only joke is developers charging for this.For anyone looking for a game that is challenging, fun to play, and value for money - LOOK ELSEWHERE!This game is not worth it, and although while it was in alpha I had slim hopes they would improve it, now that it supposedly finished, it is not worth the time of day.AVOID!If you want to join the kiddy clubs and make silly jokes then spend your ""bread"" on this, and enjoy a half baked crusty game. Just another way to blow your dough!Isn't that fun - </sarcasm>"

I am going to say though that this game isn't for everyone. I wouldn't reccommend this game for people who just rush into an area on COD with no mental stratergy or skill. You need to ability to stay calm in stressful situations and think about what you are going to do. However, on the Keyboard and Mouse, I don't think this game is any good. I dont think with a controller it is that good to buy. Even with all that said, I don't think the game is worth £10. I did get it on sale (but obviously requested a refund) for £2.49 but if it weren't on sale, I would say a good price is £4.99 or lower (in my opinion, I would rather get other games than this).4/10 total but If I did have a controller (which isn't the games fault that I don't have a controller but stil), maybe 4.5/10UPDATE:A comment recently came in from the developer of the game (Colm_Ahern) telling me about controller support.Yeah I did realise there is controller support but a controller isn't the only problem with the game. The game is slighty decent in terms of graphics and humor but the controls of the game (the way you have to grip the corners in the way the bread moves) and don't even get me started on the toaster. I got to the toaster over 10 times and not once could I mangage to get the bread inside the toaster (not just me who struggled with that). Also, the camera angles are really annoying and the bread can sometimes do 10 backflips in the air when you get the toaster and lands somewhere in the level nowhere near the toaster for no apparent reason and then land somewhere in the level no where near the toaster. Futhermore, the bread can move a whole fullsize wooden chair but not a salt shaker? Really?I think to make this game good please, change the controls (the way the bread grips, not a controller - although a controller may help, the controls are still not good), fix the camera angles and I think that it the bread touches the top of the toaster, the bread should go inside the toaster, not the player having to do that. And I saw many friends and youtubers struggle with that aswell (alot of youtubers never even got inside the toaster)."

You may or may not like this game. If you're like me, you brought the game because of the interesting title name and backstory.That said backstory is that you literally play as bread. You are some guy's bread, and you need to move around his house haphazardly in order to 'toast' yourself. I thought this title would be worth a look, so I went ahead and brought it, and soon found out that this was a hard game.I'm not opposed to challenge. Some of the best games of all times were also the hardest. Challenge however shouldn't come in the form of bad camera angles and shoddy controls.The idea behind I am bread is interesting, but once the novelty wears off, you'll probably find the game to be lackluster. Spending ages climbing up a fridge only to have you work undone by the punishing game mechanics isn't fun. It's tedious and boring. And once you get to the top of the fridge, you have to  proceed down a linear path in order to climb the next obstacle.Ultimately, my point is this. You are apiece of bread which climbs things. There are literally only three or four game play elements that provide challenge. These game play elements are nothing new or exciting, and certainly not worth the price of this game.If you can get it on sale, it might be worth a try. As it stands however, I Am Bread leaves a lot to be desired with me. This could have been an interesting game, but it is just so... boring, repetitive and tedious."

In high settings the kayboard/mouse performed just as well if not better than when I played with a controller! So if you're having troubles experiment with different graphics settings. This issue may or may not get better as the game is worked on as it is currently in Early Access as I'm writing this review.***If the above or below is helpful to you please thumb up so it can be helpful to others as well :-)Here's the ""what you need to know"": Control the 4 corners of a piece of bread to navigate across levels and find a way to make yourself into toast. It's much harder than it sounds as the bread is quite difficult to control. You can move and break most anything in a level so sometimes it's fun getting sidetracked and just break stuff. As you move your way up along objects and walls your ""Grip"" meter diminishes and when it's empty you fall prey to gravity, but it recharges after a second of not climbing. Also, avoid gross things in a level, namely the floor, ants, etc, as coming into contact will decrease your edibility, which is the games equicalent of a health bar. THAT'S IT! That's everything you need to know to jump in and have fun with I Am Bread.I've posted a brief and comical video of my playtime with the game on the I Am Bread community page, which can be seen here if you want to see my experience with the game firsthand:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxHRBbSpSdM"

I won’t. But I could.******************Due to popular demand Ive decided to add a more ‘wholemeal’ first look review for people who like that sort of thing.The game is essential qwop combined with the floor is lava. You navigate your slice of bread around various obstacles on a quest to get yourself nicely toasted (insert your own joke there). Encountering dirty items reduces your edibility and therefore your overall score, whilst getting smothered in tasty tasty jam boosts it.The game controls exactly how you would imagine it does. Each corner is assigned a different button which when pressed holds that edge in place apparently regardless of the surface/physics. The mouse or thumb stick flicks the bread around of can be used to nudge it around for precise movements. Practiced or naturally skilled will surely be able to cartwheel their way onto the leaderboards quickly whilst people starting out will ultimately spend more time flailing around like a dying Magicarp. Your main opponent is your own frustration.If the play style is sounding very familiar that’s because it is. Anyone who has already played Surgeon Simulator or Octodad will immediately recognise the pattern of destruction and failure. This means that behind its freshly baked exterior the game is likely to become stale fairly quickly. Like its sister games there is a big potential for fun workshop content but ultimately you cannot judge a game on what could possibly be made by fans later on.It is worth pointing out that it is an early access game, meaning that it is essentially unfinished, although this game does feel a lot more complete than most. It is very much playable with the exception of a few minor bugs. Enabling the gif record mode makes the game basically unplayable and the music always seems to be coming out of a random corner of the room.I think overall most people will have already made a decision about this game, and whatever your thoughts they are probably correct. It’s ultimately a casual iPad-destined meme-maker but it clean fun and will give most people a few laughs for less than the price of an average cinema ticket. If flinging a slice of bread around for a few hours is the sort of thing that will brighten your day, then this is probably for you."

,Recommended,327890,25899898,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Golem has a HALFface,"We were all told not to play with our food.  Now, our food plays... with us.Straight out, it's clear this is not a game for everyone.  Expecting a silly Bread 'Simulator' Youtube-sensation smash-em-up?  Look elsewhere.  I AM BREAD needs *surprising* amounts of skill and puzzle solving.  Surprising unless you've played Surgeon Simulator, Bossa's previous game, which likewise required you to train your brain to learn what keys WON'T hurl spoons and scalpels all over the theatre.  This'll sound scathing but some reviewers prefer the Bagel Racing because it's a lot more straight forward and not at all punishing.  If you're interested enough to read this, you'll laugh plenty while you play, yet I AM BREAD will make you feel like your mild-mannered alter-ego has been bashed around the head with a baguette.Story Mode:Yes, story mode about living bread.  The other modes are a very fun distraction but Story Mode hooked me in.  It's a surgeon simulator prequel!  As surreal and daft as that is, it works. You're taken on an adventure and the world really does become all about one thing: You aren't just bread; you must become TOAST.  You play through as a loaf possessed with life, each slice seeking any and all ways to become everyone's favourite morning accompaniment.  Story Mode takes place over the course of a week.  One of the joys is how the mission at hand engages you completely, and before long the escalating impact of your toasty obsession becomes deadly clear.  This loaf will stop at nothing, slowly pushing its owner into a frenzy while the world (or his therapist and security guards, at least) thinks him insane.Controls:You have complete control of every corner and every movement of your wholesome slice, and you will have to learn how not just to grip, but how to flip, how to leap, how to swing and hurl things about to get through the levels.  The levels aren't just kitchens and lounges and petrol stations, because there is an increasing requirement to learn what you've tried out in previous levels to get through the next.  This is one thing that makes I AM BREAD much more of a game than I think a lot of players give it credit for.  It takes timing and practice and a lot of patience - with yourself more than anything!! You'll totally flop on some key manoeuvre and curse your aching fingers, but you'll try again and figure it out.  The only difference between limping across a kitchen surface or crawling painfully up the side of a bin, and flipping across car bonnets or leaping across chasms and flipping gracefully over petrol station shelving, is YOU.Levels:Over the course of a week, you'll have to find heat sources, of which there are a few even in the same level, while avoiding anything that'll render you inedible.  Later you'll have to be a bit more creative (and destructive?) in your mission to toast yourself.  It requires level exploration until you spot something, it clicks, or you have that ""I wonder if..."" moment.  The levels are littered with everyday objects and I adored how everything seemed to move right, from bin lids to swinging petrol station signs, to individual piles of books and rolling gas tanks.  Some things break physics conveniently without going anywhere near the stupidity of something like goat simulator - switches move easily at a stroke, bread is surprisingly strong enough to hurl bricks at cars, and lighters will flick just by touching them.  These breaks are convenient and welcome!  If things get too difficult too often, you are offered a way to become edible no matter what you land on, but I recommend avoiding this.  Staying edible is half the game!Other Modes:Thanks to Bossa's intent on providing banquets rather than just the one offering (surgeon simulator had several modes by the time they were done), the other modes add content to this game each with its own brilliant twist.  Bagel Racing is easy to get to grips with, though I did initially expect to race other bagels and multiplayer bagels would have been fantastic.  Starch Wars is pretty epic in which you'll take on an evil ironing board and its Rye Fighters.  Rampage puts you in control of a very angry baguette intent on smashing everything, swinging itself about like a baseball bat.  Cheese hunt sees you take on a quest for several pieces of cheese in a room as a piece of Rye, but isn't so interesting.  Zero-G is surprisingly addictive and very nicely done.  I haven't completed the Team Fortress mode but its a quirky version of the same thing and looks a lot of fun as you interact with familiar objects and weapons from comatose Heavy Weapons Guy's world.It's not a long game, over with in a couple of evenings or maybe 4-6 hours (depending on what you do with the other modes).  It's very silly, great to play with mates or family around, it's got a nice dark glint in its eye, it's easy to play and difficult to master, but your patience and determination will be rewarded.  Remember this is a game in a true sense and you'll be ready - YOUWILLBE TOAST.  I am a fan.  If you've even read this far, just get it on offer and have a great time.No spoilers intended here but my girlfriend was absorbed in this game's story and right at the end just asked one question:""Why doesn't Mr. Murton just make his bread into toast?  Then everyone would be happy.""Why didn't you just, Mr. Murton?"

They bash the controls for the game, the objectives and so forth leaving it with the verdict that it is simply ""YouTube bait"".That analysis couldn't be more wrong. I am Bread is an original idea that not only continues with Bossa Studios' satire of simulator titles and the joke simulator ones too (*cough* Goat Simulator *cough* Rock Simulator *cough* Grass Simulator *cough* Air Control *cough*).The plot is about a slice of bread living in Bernardshire and its quest to toast itself. This highly disturbs Mr. Bob Murton, who happens to live in the same house as the slice of bread, who sees a therapist and is informed that bread does not do things on its own.The controls, as mentioned, are awkward, but only to the new player. Within half an hour, one should be able to master the movement of bread and the game mechanic. Frustration will be a part of the game, but those who ragequit and then complain only have their lack of patience to blame. The game will remind you of Surgeon Simulator 2013 in that respect.Outside of the story mode, you have a free roam mode, a crispbread mode, a bagel mode, baguette mode and zero g mode a la Surgeon Simulator 2013. All these game modes add extra to the already interesting game.Oh and give Starch Wars a go, it's possibly the best space battle you may experience since Battlefront all those years ago."

There are various scenarios, but since I haven't become toast yet, or even close, I can only speak to the first one.  You start off on the kitchen table and have to make your way to, presumably, a toaster, without touching the floor for too long.  The longer you are on the floor, the less edible you become until you finally lose the level.The mechanics are tough to get used to, even more menacing than Octodad.  Each side of the toast is assigned a key and you have to decide which corner is your pivot point and move the mouse.  You have a ""grip meter"" for moving up surfaces, like climbing the refrigerator or the cabinets, so this adds an extra, ""time sensitive"" element to it.Overall, I really have liked it so far.  Seems like it will provide a lot of very fun and challenging play.If you want to see the gameplay, I did make a video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1raeIfAo60M&feature=youtu.be"

,Recommended,327890,17636347,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,jsauce,"Well as of writing this review I've played it less than an hour and to be honest I didn't acomplish much. While this game is a fun look at physics, as a game it lacks some of the more satisfying things we've come to love.I consider this to be much more of a test of frustration than anything. The controls are stiff and very hard to use. I've seen people complain about how hard it is with the mouse and keyboard so I opted to use the controller instead, and its still way too difficult for the average person to grasp. It demands motions that your brain isn't familiar with making and gives you very little time to work with it.Overall it's still a good game, and I plan on dedicating more time to it later, but its just not really fun to play right now.Pros:- The graphics are fun, and the music is nice to play to.- It seems like with a little work it COULD be fun to play.- As a physics game it is very solid.Cons:- The controls are awful. And when I say awful, I mean they are just not intuitive. It seems like there could easily be a better way to work them but they have elected to go with the most difficult non-intuitive choice possible. The only way it could get harder is if you had to order the bread around with your voice.- The game timer and edibility meter sucks. When you fall on the floor you have mere moments to react before you lose. And I understand ""Who wants to eat dirty bread?"" But it wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't such crap to begin with.- It seems like the difficulty isn't in the placement of obstacles or even the fact that if you get too dirty you are trash, but rather it seems that they have chosen to make the controls as difficult to use as a way to make it a more difficult game, and that takes the competitiveness and fun right out of it. If they made the game's controls a whole lot easier to use and instead ramped up the difficulty with obstacles it would be a more successful game in my opinion. Instead it feels like lazy development.- You are going to get frustrated, and I mean at epic levels. Once you realize that the reason you cant get somewhere easily isnt because its a difficult game but that moving the bread around sucks horribly you will want to throw your controller out the window.All in all, I am still recommending this game for two reasons.1. Some people like these really difficult games and they do have a place in the market, and the game isn't terrible. I imagine if i wanted to dedicate like 12 hours just to learning the controls I could probably master it. The problem with this as I see it is I'm not learning to fly an airplane or drive a car here. I'm playing a video game. When a normal game could be finished in 12 hours and I'm still learning how to move a piece of bread around that might be a problem, but I digress.2. There is a game somewhere in here if I can find it, if I find more patience. With enough time I could master this and that is true of any strategy based game but is this one of those games?I wonder if your average person would waste the time needed to get good at this game or just uninstall it and chalk up the wasted money?I don't think unless you are a true fan of torture this game is worth full price, however if its on sale at least 50% it's worth a try."

It's hard to imagine how they might improve the control system for mouse and keyboard, but one remains hopeful.The concept remains quite funny, and the bolt-on story serves to amuse as you progress, as well as give reason to the increasingly elaborate household gauntlets of various unpleasant substances strewn across your path.In short, as the novelty goes I think I would recommend the game - However from a purely critical perspective of enjoying the game itself and the content that exists as of yet, I would say go for it if you're interested, but only cautiously."

But the toaster is ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROOM. plus you have to make it back to the plate with the ""ediblility"" meter still remaning. It may sound simple but you CANNOT touch the ground more than 1 MINUTE. If you stay on the ground, YOU WILL DIE! That's not only the ground! Here is a list of enemies that you CAN'T fight:-Ants-Sharp Objects-etc.Things you CAN fight:-NothingSome people have trouble using their Gamepad. I'm one of them. The gamepad NEVER works.But the biggest problem is: The Grip Meter. The grip meter is so short that I barely got up to a counter. It's so short!The goods things are:-Good Grpahics-Smooth Framerate-Good MusicThings that are bad:-Controls-The Grip Meter-Glitches-The Ground HURTS YOU!This game is a good game in it's core but it's held back by it's♥♥♥♥♥controls. I know they made Sergeon Simulator but that game have a better control scheme than this. and nothing kills you in that game aside from your paitent dying. I was excited for this but I got extremley dissapoited.This game gets a          3/10"

I got bored of this game pretty quickly.Pros?+You are food.+You can spread butter or jelly on yourself making you more food.+Learn what it feels like to be toasted+Skateboarding+Spaceship?Cons-I recommed having a controller for this, the keyboard controls are wonky and difficult to use, it was like playing Twister with my hands.-The entirety of the main game is finding a way to cook yourself. I think the Starch Wars addon is different, but almost too different.-Bread can stay on the floor for longer than 5 seconds. Everyone knows the 5-second-rule is the one true law of dropped food. That bread is too gross for consumption and you know it.-Game makes me hungry.Summary:I would probably produce a better review if I had played more of this. Something deep down prevents me from doing so, though. I paid good money for this game and it just feels like a disappointment.

It certainly looks fun anyway. When it works, it is fun. But the camera is atrocious, and since your bread rotate based on where the camera stands all it takes is making a few steps of progress for whatever angle you had on your bread to change and thus having to do a frustrating balancing act with both joystiq when all it would take to make the game actually playable would be to have the camera fixed. The camera doesn't move unless you move it.That's all it would take to make the game three times more enjoyable. It's that one tiny little thing that makes the game pretty much unbearable.

76561198034740265,Recommended,327890,25157955,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,Bizarro lexilogo,"I do kind of wish there was a ""Neutral"" option for this review.This game falls under the category of games such as Goat Simulator that expects you to find it funny on premise alone, and sadly it's one joke that lands for very few and even if it does land for you it's unlikely you'll find it funny for several hours.So... Why is this a recommendation?-Unlike Goat Simulator, there isn't a grand total of one joke per level. It's ridiculous how many puns are packed into the game and some of the more subtle ones actually made me chuckle. There are no shortage of bread puns in this game.-This game succeeds in the same way Surgeon Simulator succeeded- It actually has merit above just being a game with bad controls. Both this and Surgeon Sim are games with actual learning curves and the potential of mastery- Games where you can actually get better and better at them and earn your A++ rank.-Actually really, really hard. I'm not even joking, this game is pretty tough especially if you want high rankings.-Surprisingly open levels. Your goal is to become toast, but there are many different ways to do that- Making your way to a toaster is one, but you could also toast yourself inside an oven or on a BBQ. How you get to something that can make you into toast is also completely up to you, as long as it doesn't consist of crawling along dirty surfaces such as the floor- But even then, skilful play can get you across the floor with minimal damage, too.But there's a lot of things that drag this game down, too, unfortunately.-Like Surgeon Simulator's A&E Edition it outstays its welcome. The campaign mode is at a pretty good length, but if you want 100% completion in this game it will be an incredibly painful and boring experience. They mix it up with different kinds of bread but it isn't really different enough to work particularly well. Especially with all the extra stuff they've added through updates. It's very unlikely you'll actually have the interest to play every extra level at least once.-The controls are actually TOO bad. Surgeon Sim is a game that appears to have bad controls to the uninitiated, but all you need to do is actually learn the controls and the controls will no longer be an obstacle to your play. I Am Bread, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have that quality- No matter how good you get the game's physics engine will still screw you over at times because your very movement is dependent on the game's physics engine. This may have been because of the fact I didn't use a controller but I still feel like even movement felt more difficult than it needed to be.-Once again, it may be because I didn't use a controller, but those zero-gravity levels... UGH.-There didn't appear to be any secrets or secret levels like there were in Surgeon Simulator. Surgeon Sim had this titanic number of easter eggs and so on that were pieced together in order to discover an amazing secret level- I Am Bread doesn't have anything like that.Overall I Am Bread is IMO not as good as Surgeon Simulator was. It still manages to do what games of its type consistently fail to do but it's a downgrade to what Surgeon Sim was. It's not exactly a game I can muster up a ""Not Recommended"" rating for because it does have merit especially if this kind of game is what you're looking for, but I'd still recommend you pick up Surgeon Sim instead of this."

It can be hard on the latter levels of course, but calling it impossible is just moronic. It saddens me, as a gamer, that people thumbs down a game simply because they can't play it."

,Recommended,327890,13229727,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,Kuroodo,"This game is1. Challenging2. Funny3. FunThis game also has alot of replayability. From changing the ways you proceed through the level, discovering funny things or maybe something cool, doing tricks and stunts, etc.There is one thing you will need in order to play this game though...and that's patience. At first the game is VERY hard. Simply because you have to get used to and learn the controls. With a bit of patience you will be able to master the controls and be on your way as Top Bread. If you've learned to master the controls, you will find your self doing stunts, tricks, and even leaping across areas to get around the map. Not to mention that you can also use things that you find in the world around you to help you as well.The point of the game is to turn into toast. There are multiple ways of doing so in every level. Either with a heater, toaster, hair straightener, etc. That adds some puzzle elements to the game. You proceed to the next level by toasting both sides of the bread. Make sure you don't over-toast though!You also have an edibillity meter. You can think of this as your health. If you touch anything that can spoil the bread (a dish of fish, floor, bugs, dirt, etc) you will find the you will lose edibiillity. Once it reaches 0, you lose and must restart. Once you beat a level, you are scored with a letter grade based on your performance. You also have a Grip meter. You can't stay griped onto an object forever. So be quick and make sure that every move is worth it or else you will find yourself losing your grip and possibly falling all the way to the floor. It only takes about 2 seconds to fill up once you stop gripping things though.Overl this game is very fun and very challenging.The game only includes 4 levels at the moment, but more levels are planned.As an Early Access game, there are very very few bugs. 85% chance of you being able to play without a problem.The developers are also very active on the forums. They tend to joke around with the community, have fun, help players with troubleshooting errors, work on bugs, etc. They are a very awesome dev team to talk to on the forums!At the moment, I see a possible 10+ hours of gameplay with the games current stage. But with more planned content (levels, easter eggs, more features, etc) I can see the amount of gameplay hours sky rocketing to a huuge amount.This game is worth your $10"

,Not Recommended,327890,13779973,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Richard,"Just learned that if you cover yourself with jam, you can rest on walls. This solves my main problem with the game.This makes the game far less irritating. It's still challenging, if you make a wrong move, you'll end up on the ground and become inedible.I find bread with jam far more enjoyable. I think they should make that feature more obvious.--------It looks like fun, but it gets pretty tedious.Many indie games use poor controls as a humourous gameplay mechanic, eg Octodad. But here it is an exercise in frustration.This is mainly due to the Grip meter. You can only hold on to things for a certain amount of time, so if you're not quick enough you'll have to do the same thing over and over and over.While Octodads challenge comes from the poor controls, the challenge here comes from the timer. This makes the game irritating instead of humourous.Maybe they'll remove the ""timer"" based challenge to something more substantial. But until that happens I wouldn't recommend this game."

A  WHOLE GRADE GONE BECAUSE OF CRAP CONTROLS. This game will leave you in frustrating tears and will make you want to smash someting. The only part of this game I enjoyed was the playing as a baguette and smashing a random guys plates and wine glasses, but even then the controls will screw you over and you will rage.

I am very into quirky games, I pride myself in checking out all of the strangest, most oddball games on Steam. And I had heard great things about I Am Toast. But sadly, for me at least, this game is almost unplayable. Wacky concept with pretty nice graphics and a TERRIBLE control scheme. Maybe my brain doesn't work in the way it's supposed to for this control scheme to make sense. I even played it mostly with a PS3 gamepad, and I still could not get the hang of it for the life of me. Nothing but frustration. The grip meter depletes too quickly, so you barely have time to hang onto objects. Attempting to flip over the edge of ledges is a chore in redundancy and pain, as the moment you flop onto the ground you are basically dead. You get, what, like 5 seconds at most to find a surface to latch onto after falling to the ground? I'm sorry, but this is not challenging, it's just downright AGGRAVATING.Just when I thought the controls couldn't get any worse, I attempted Zero G mode. HA!!! A true exercise in futility. Made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me as to how to accurately control the flying toast. Honestly, the controls could have been stellar if they were based more off of the scheme used in Katamari Damacy. Maybe I'm crazy uncoordinated here, but I just can't understand how so many people out there love this game and are able to get the hang of the controls. It's rare in this day and age for me to play a game that is so unique and has so much potential, only to be buried by horrific controls. I feel like it's been a solid 5-10 years since I've played a game with a control scheme as unbareable as this one. It's sad, really, because it simply destroys what I was hoping to be a fresh, original, exciting experience like the first time I played Katamari."

I've tried several fixes but none have worked. I think I'll just get a refund. :(I'm sure this game is very fun but be careful if you have any controller other than Xbox 360 or PS4, as those are the only officially supported ones (and even then there are several potential issues). Even if your controller works perfectly outside of I Am Bread and you've used it to play plenty of other games, there's a chance it won't work in this one.

Bread, I don't feel, is anywhere near as good as SS.Bread's friendship with Goat Simulator sort of reduced my minimal respect for such an original game, that is Bread. GS is an extremely buggy game that thrives off of bugs, glitching and clipping, all are annoyances of mine. Labeling weak coding and QC as an aspect of gameplay doesn't cut it for me. I felt Bread went down that route a little bit, which I don't like.Performace of Bread is questionable. I get huge frame rate drops when the Goat destruction levels start up and also every time I break that jar of jam with the bread. Speaking of the jam, the glass containers in this game look like something from a 2005 title. They are a huge eye sore, and they are everywhere. Technology exists today that makes glass look realistic... please use it. This is a 2015 title. Even with it being from a small developer, they still have enough money to get some decent looking glass going on. 21st Century Fox is a partial owner of Bossa, there's tons of money there to get some better graphics and coding. Hopefully they go down this route as Bossa becomes more popular. I hear they're working on a MMO open-world title right now... yikes. That's a huge jump.Speaking of graphics, it's hit or miss in each level. The few levels towards the end are the worst, visually. It doesn't make sense why this is even happened other than laziness, or they ran out of time. The game has a gradual decline in graphics the further you progress. I see tons of low res textures, a very poor sky box, background visuals look like they're from the 80's, etc. Graphics aren't everything, but they are important.Some visuals are cartoony, some are more heavily detailed.... don't mix this sh**, pick one and go with it for the whole game.The third person camera... Christ. Yes, many games suffer from third person camera issues, especially those old GTA games, but lets get this sh** cleaned up, guys. It jumps around everywhere, clips through everything, hinders those bagel racing levels like crazy, and is poorly optimized. It pisses me off. Unity can do better.Iffy physics. Props and movable objects sometimes do move around in a natural manner when you grab them or push them, but not all of the time. It's inconsistent, like the visuals. I've gotten stuck on props many times, and have had myself, and different objects bounce unnaturally in different directions, before saying to myself ""wtf is this sh**, seriously?""Negatives aside, Bread does have its moments. I'm glad the 0 gravity mode is back from SS. It is very difficult to control, but is rewarding when you beat it. The humor is nice. The game is fun to watch. The concept is fresh. Like SS, the controls and movements have a steep learning curve, but is awesome when you get it down.Like I said previously, maybe give the game a whirl, it's pretty unique. Like SS, it requires a lot of patience. As for the questionable overall quality, Bossa: talk to Fox and get some heavy funds rolling in, hire a few more devs (get some people from big triple-A companies), get some Unity pros to work with ya'll--Unity can accomplish so, so, so much more.Thanks."

This, along with some frustration, is what you can expect to find in I Am Bread. So why am I recommending this game? Because despite some wonky controls, this game is fun, and well worth purchasing. In what other game are you able to crawl across someone's bedroom just to toast yourself on a light bulb?I will admit that the controls are hard, and the situation is made worse by the fact that there's a limited amount of time you can hold onto to something, but if you can get used to the controls the game is actually fun, and hilarious. I've had fun just trying to find out how many ways I can toast myself. I've managed to toast myself on everything except the toaster oddly enough. There are other game modes as well, incuding a time trial mode and a zero gravity mode, so beyond the hilarity of being bread, there is a actual game here. Top it off with jam, butter, a graet soundtrack, and the magical marmalade that let's you crawl across the floor, and you've got yourself a pretty tasty treat. So overall, I give it a score of 9/10. The controls are a bit hard, and there aren't as many toasting levels as I would have wanted, but overall a solid...uh...adventuring puzzle(?) game."

But there are some issues that the game makers must over come before they can consider this game Grade A ToastExamples of problems in this game are the breads physics. Some times when ive played id get Myself stuck INSIDE and object like the pot or the butter dish even the toaster on a few occasions.Another one is the physics to objects you grab on to specificly the plate, the pot, the skate board, and any object the bread can move and lift with ease. if you Permenatly grip the object (with the letter keys or AXBY if your a remote player) and grip with one corner of the object(1234 or the bumper keys for same reasons above) the move in the direction of a elevated surface you can GLIDE slightly or even levetate upward if your on a lighter object. i dont know if this is a glitch or a weight factor in the game that got change of if this is on purpose but it kinda runs the fun (sorta) of trying hard to get a toasting source if you can WITH YOUR BREAD GOD POWERS lift up an object and float over to the source of you becoming Toast.the negatives aside i found the game really fun with the inginuity of the ways to get toasted to the ways of getting to the  toasting source even to the struggle to get off the floor like "" NNOOOOO my Journey to become toast can`t end in this litter box. NNNNNNOOOOOOOOO!"" which is just one reaction to failing at the first level.So i can`t wait for the new level and the hope for a few TF2 easter eggs like a I AM SANDVICH level you can unlock or a interactive level screen like in Surgeon Simulator so i hope this game gains continued supportToast level: Almost Golden/Golden Perfection (9/10)"

My gamepad doesn't seem to work and I've read that others have similar problems. Since very much depends on your control handling when climbing and leaping it's best played on a gamepad.

No real surprise given their last game, ""surgeon simulator"" was excellent as well. These guys have a knack for making fun, querky games that provide an interesting level of difficulty. The gameplay is inventive and you'll always be on the edge of your seat. One wrong move and there goes your level progress. This difficulty seems to add to the fun for me instead of making things frustrated. I am Bread is a bit more straight-foward compared to their last game as well since guiding your bread to a heat source to make toast is far less complicated than carefully cutting a fake person apart. One thing I will say is that if you want to play I am Bread for any length of time make sure you have a compatible controller. I downloaded the neccessary software to use my ps4 controller because my hand that controlled keyboard functions got cramped pretty fast playing. Every once in a while there is a bit of drop in framerate. I'm running a AMD 6100 6-core processor with a Radeon 6800 HD graphics card with 8GB of RAM, and I know for certain the game is having the problem. Just wait for it to catch up and then resume.

It took me a hilarious hour to finish the tutorial. I don't regret it. Went into free roam next to get a better handle on controls, check out the environment. Being each type of bread can present its own difficulties surprisingly. I did connect one of my controllers up to play this, and it is much easier. Although, if you just set your ""grips"" to comfortable keys close together, it shouldn't be much of a problem to use a keyboard. Going through the game, there are a lot of little things to find, and interact with. At the end of one game session, all that I could see of my little toast was chips, eggs, and jam/jelly sitting in a pile of mass destruction. You can try to skateboard, but I seem to fail that, and just send myself flying. Curiosity sent me into a garbage can.

,Recommended,327890,13906101,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,LCDR. Harding,"Components+ Graphically, I AM BREAD gets it right, if it were extremely realistic, the game wouldn’t be as humorous and enjoyable, as when things get realistic, it feels to grown up and focused rather than fun and enjoyable. And I AM BREAD is all about enjoying being a slice of bread with a mission of getting toasted. Although the levels of I AM BREAD is very well designed, easy to distinguish which area is dirty and which is clean, and the effect it has on your bread as it comes in contact with certain substances.+ Gameplay is rather self explanatory, four keys for each limb and an extra button for each to lock the limb, and with the compatibility of the Xbox Controller, it makes it easier to control as well. The developers do a great job on getting reactions from players, because accidents always happen, the controls can be confusing when under pressure, thus panic and overwhelming emotions, all of which make the experience enjoyable.+- Gamemode is very simple, just get toasted, but I think they could expand on this like Goat Simulator did, which was make it an MMO, allowing for more interaction with other players. I am guessing they could make I AM BREAD larger with multiplayer modes, who could get toasted quicker or something like that, you can challenge your friends on a level at the same time. Because a singular game mode will be easy to get bored of, adding more, or specifically multiplayer, it would probably benefit the game largely.+ The amount of room you have to be your slice of bread is good factor. Because you have multiple ways and approaches to getting toasted and what to slather yourself with before you do. Because the toy is only as good as the room you play it in.+ And I think with the continuous involvement of the I AM BREAD community, they will continue to improve, and maybe with the addition of the Steam Workshop which could alter your type of bread, or add more levels to play, I AM BREAD will be a long lasting game.OverallI AM BREAD is without a doubt a very fun simulator game, it has never been done before and that is what gamers like to see, something unique and amazing. People might’ve thought of making a simulator for ridiculous things but never thought they will pull it off so they kept to the cliché simulators, which are vehicles.But I AM BREAD has been pulled off spectacularly well; it is most definitely fun experience, playing as bread with the mission of getting toasted. The idea was ridiculous but the developers made it happen. It’s an ambitious and successful idea, which deserves all the support it gets. Well worth the price and the experience. I suggest this game to simulator lovers and people who just like to play ridiculous yet great games (Goat Sim | BroForce)."

Markliplier may have said they are bad controlls... but they are not, but they aer diffucult to master and simple to use. This is a truly original game with a nice crew behind now working to polish everything. Now if your negative you can say well not everything looks High Definition! Ughhh did Skyrim have everything in HD even though you could play it in HD? No and this looks better over all and Skyrim was make a by a large game studio. It is amazing such a non crumby ( sorry had to make a bread pun the game has tons! ) game about bread non the less exists! So overall I give this game a 10.5/10 for being great and original! Go play now! I only hope they add more levels and a.... wait for it...... I said wait! A SOUND TESTER! IT NEEDS TO BE ADDED imagine all the music in the menu to listen to for hours upon hours.... WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS PLAY IT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!"

Once you learn how to easily move through each level, you start to notice annoying glitches that you ignored before. One glitch, which caused me to lose the level (and my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I went crazy after that) is that you sometimes get stuck on an object. You literally go INTO the object, and in some cases cant move. Another glitch is that you sometimes cant even move. For example, I was on a wall but it took FOREVER to move, and I didn't have anything that would cause it. If you think these are bad, you should see the camera angles. DAMN! They can go from OK to I WANT TO DAMN YOU TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL in a couple of seconds. Half the time you can barely even SEE where you're going!Other than that, the game is pretty fun, although VERY aggrovating. I almost broke my table with my controller.PS: Use a controller.

Everyone is saying how great this game is but I need to give it a few honest critiques. For one, the edibility meter is really tedious as it is near impossible to avoid the floor enough to survive, especially with the complexity of the controls. For the record, I'm using keyboard and mouse, the controls of which need work. Before you say that the game is better with a controller, keep in mind that this game is on steam and is PC exclusive. If I buy a game on PC, I expect it to have manageable keyboard controls. I spend about 20 minutes trying to get through the first level during one attempt, and ended up getting stuck in the cat bowl with no possible way to get up because of the annoying grip meter. I suggest adding more time to the edibility meter as well as the grip meter, if not entirely removing that one. Fun game, needs a lot of work.

It's not just using a toaster to toast the bread, but using some of the surroundings and that's just awesome and clever.The soundtrack sometimes cuts out on my headphones.

,Recommended,327890,13717636,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Villager103,"My review for I am Bread by Bossa Studios.Basically, you play as a slice of bread, and your goal is to become toasted with wacky controls similar to QWOP, Octodad and Surgeon Simulator.There are 9 levels, one is a tutorial, the next 7 are main levels and the last one is an epilogue. The levels are as follows:Cell(tutorial)KitchenLoungeBedroomBathroomGarageGardenPetrol StationCar(Epilogue, unplayable in any game mode other than Story)However, each level gets progressively harder than the last, meaning you will probably snap your keyboard(or controller) in half in rage.Another great thing is in the later levels, especially the Petrol Station, the heat sources require lots of thought as to what you must do to toast yourself.There are also 6 game modes.StoryCheese HuntRampageZero-GBagel RaceFree RoamThere is even multiple bread types! All game modes have a different bread type as the star, exept for Free Roam, which you can pick any bread, and Zero-G that uses the same bread as in Story Mode.Wholemeal(Normal, all around)Crackerbread(Agile, less strong)Baguette(Agile, very strong, only 2 grip points)Bagel(Fast, less strong, only 2 grip points)Lets start with the HUD.At the top left of the screen, there is an 'Edibility' meter. This is your health meter. Doing stuff like laying on the floor, touching bugs, picking up toenail cippings and band-aids and other dirty things will bring your edibility down. If your edibility goes down to 0, you lose.At the top of the screen is the 'Grip' meter. Holding onto things bring your grip down, and you can let go of the said object will make it go back up. If the grip meter runs out, you will let go. So basically, you can only hold onto stuff for a limited time before you let go, and this can be INFURIATING at times. There have been times that I have been climbing along the wall like Spiderman, only to fall of and land on the floor and struggle to get back up.At the top right of the screen is the timer, which times the level.Now let's have a look at the graphics.The graphics are very smooth and nice, lighting effects are beautiful and it's very easy to differentiate dirty things from clean things, because I have played a lot of games where you can't tell which things are okay to stand on and which things kill you.Gameplay:The gameplay is very similar to Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and one thing I really like about this game, is the fact that there are multiple ways to beat the levels.You may have seen the 6 gamemodes from before, so let's see what each one has to offer.Story mode, starring Wholemeal, is the normal game mode. Edibility, Grip and Time are here.Cheese Hunt, starring Crackerbread, is the 2nd game mode. You must find 5 lumps of cheese hidden around the level.Edibility has been replaced with Integrity, which means you can walk on dirty stuff, but you can't get beaten around too much or you will break into pieces. Grip and Time are here.Rampage, starring Baguette, is the 3rd game mode. You must destroy, smash, break, shatter and obliterate as many things as you can in 2 minutes. Edibility and Grip are no longer here, and the timer has been changed into a time limit.Bagel Race, starring Bagel, is the 4th game mode. You must run through the level whilst going through checkpoints, and you must get to the finish in under 1 minute. Edibility and Grip are no longer here.Zero-G, starring Wholemeal, is the 5th gamemode, in which Bossa has turned the old Zero-G glitch into a whole new gamemode. There are a whole bunch of new controls and grip is gone. Same goal as Story Mode. One other thing about this game mode, is the fact that they actually are in space. There are windows showing stars and nebulae, and I really like how the Garden is in a biosphere, that's really cool.Free Roam, starring Wholemeal,Crackerbread,Baguette and Bagel! Pick any bread and roam free in any level you like, with no limits! Do whatever you like! No grip, no edibility, no integrity, no time limit, nothing! Be bread, and go on an adventure!Conclusion:When the game initially released, with only 1 bread type, 1 game mode and 4 levels, I didn't think this game was really worth the full price. But, then look at it now, with 6 game modes, 9 levels(7 of which are playable in all game modes) and 4 bread types, this game is actually worth it! A must have for your Steam Library.My final rating for this is: *drumroll*9.5/10.It's definitely a great game if you are a fan of Octodad or Surgeon Simulator, but if even if you have not played those games, it's still worth a try. It blends 3D puzzle-platformer and adventure together, and creates a wonderful experience. If you like puzzle games, I would reccomend you buy this.And there is even a little suprise at the end of the game, which I will leave up to you, after you buy this game.This is my honest review for I Am Bread, Villager103, signing out."

Err, what can I, oh! Toast! I can become toast!After a few mistakes I have learned that the Limbed One's ""seet"" provides ample ground for which to make my way to the next rise. Upon ariving, I find many unappealing beings swarming the space around me. While traversing through the beasts, I come upon a small container. After what feels like hours, the lid flies off and reveals to me the treasure inside. I hoist my new shield in the air only to find it filled with holes. What a waste.Physics is my friend, upon opening up the freezer door, I am able to grab on whilst I slam it shut once more, sending me soaring towards my destination. After a mighty struggle I slip inside the warm confines of the toaster, and finish my tasking journy.Day 2: I have found that latching on to the bottom of this strange device with all corners and subsequently lifting has granted me the power of flight. Moments later, the room is in chaos, but I have makshift a heat source out of the local idiot box. Perhaps the Limbed One will not notice.Day 3: It noticed. The Limbed One is testing me now. Such a powerful heat source, but with the grime and little amount of clean land to traverse, reaching it will be difficult. I notice the Limbed One has left another aircraft for my pleasure. Shoddy workmanship though, it broke under the force of my own body. No matter, nothing shall keep me from my destiny.Day 4: I have never before seen horrors such as this. Fluids and grime cover most of the room. Why in wheat's name would any being have a room such as this exist? Upon flying to a safe haven via the door beside me I notice a glowing object across the room. This must be the Limbed One's treachery, it has placed my salvation across the lake of death and bottomless pit. There will be no ease from this venture.Actual revew: This game is amazing. An open (enough) world allows for as much tomfoolery as you want with only one true goal in mind: Become toast. The game gets increasingly harder as you drive the owner of the house slowly insane and he begins testing the dexterety of bread. The controls are rediculous, the platforming is the same, and you can fly given any flat object. Best. Game. Ever. And you can use the narriative above  as a walkthrough if you can find out what I mean. A level builder, multiplayer (Along with more levels) and even enemies are the only thing that can make this game better."

That is decidedly not the case here.  While the premise - a slice of bread journeys to become toast - is indeed ridiculous, I am Bread does not rely on its absurdity.  Rather, it uses its outlandish premise as a guise for challenging and immensely rewarding gameplay.  Much like they did with Surgeon Simulator, Bossa Studios gives the player more controls than they are probably used to: you will need full analog control and eight buttons to maneuver your piece of bread around the terrain.  This quickly becomes second-nature, though, and the game relies more on using interesting mechanics to solve puzzles than simple ""LOLphysics"" gameplay.  You may be a veritable bread ninja, but unless you can find a heat source you shall never become toast.Once you have the basics down, becoming toast simply isn't enough; you must become *delicious* toast!  Who wants to be dry toast when there is butter and jelly available?  Sure, being slippery or sticky may impact your ability to navigate, but you get to be tasty!"
,Recommended,327890,15282173,"Posted: 9 April, 2015",all,Chronos the Sniper,"Hoo boy... I am Bread is a game that makes me feel stupid. I mean, I liked it, but it's hard to say WHAT I liked about it.Gameplay: The main meat (or should that be Wheat? Yes, I am Bread and its players are all full of crappy puns like this) of the game is the main mode. You are bread (duh) that can hold on to objects by its corners. Your ultimate goal is to reach a heat source and toast yourself 100% on both sides, whilst keeping away from the floor or anything that could possibly spoil you. If your edibility drops to nil, that's it. Of course, getting to the end is easy enough by this game's standards. If you want a good rank, you'll smear some spreads on yourself (the bread, you dolt, not YOU) and pick up some tasty things along the way and do your damndest to keep your edibility from going down, along with doing all of this in a timely fashion and making sure you don't burn yourself. Only then will you obtain the coveted A++ rank.Controls: One of the biggest points of contention with this game are its controls. By default, a keyboard has you use 1, 2, 3, 4 and the arrow keys to grab on to things and move around as well as Q, W, E and R to hold things, along with the mouse to move the camera. A controller will have you use the four shoulder buttons and the control sticks to move yourself and the camera around. It also uses the four face buttons to hold on to things. Leaning towards using a controller? Good, since that's the way the game really should be played.But hold on. Let's not be silly. You can't just hang on to the ceiling all day like a bread bat. You have a grip meter in a manner reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus. If that runs out, you drop off of what you were holding on to and drop what you were holding. Anyway, that said, the bread controls quite oddly. Don't expect to sit down and be able to control your bread right away. This takes time, and even then you may still struggle a bit. Because this game and its controls are seriously difficult.Adding on to the above, it seems that few bugs may have slipped through the cracks in Early Access. For instance, don't be surprised if your bread gets stuck in something, and the fixing of it sends it flying through the air having a seizure, ruining what you've just done and forcing you to start again.Still, despite this, don't get me wrong, the game is still quite a lot of fun (it's also massively frustrating, but still). You have multiple modes to play with, with seven different levels to mess around in. You have Cheese Hunt (you play as a cracker), Rampage (you play as a baguette), Zero-G (you play as normal bread with rockets all over you, no joke) and Bagel Race (no♥♥♥♥♥♥. Each mode has its own objectives, and each level has its own ways of cooking yourself. Some of which require some thinking. Seriously, you'd be surprised at how much of an actual game this is, rather than just a piece of shallow Youtube fodder/PewDieBait. Is it worth its current price? Maaaaaaaaybe. That's down to you, since there's quite a bit of content (albeit the same seven levels in five different scenarios, so not counting the free roam, you'll have 35 levels to keep you occupied), but as was mentioned above, it is majorly rage-inducing. Even so, whether on sale or at full price, give I am Bread aryeTRY sometime"

The premise is you use the 4 corners of the bread to move yourself towards a destination, such as the toaster. It's very difficult at the beginning but the more you play you'll find yourself moving faster and easier. Though the gameplay is simply ""Get from A to B"" you can do this through a bunch of different ways, like climbing the walls or trying to dash over the floor (not recommended as this effects your score) but you can also knock over skateboards to gain extra distance past long hallways.If you have no patience for silly games with simple goals, this won't hold your attention for very long. The gameplay is a bit samey and unlike games like Mount Your Friends that have a similiar premise/control scheme, this is so far single player which I find drops replayability quite a lot.The game has a story which I also find entertaining, I won't spoil anything but if you're the kind of person who sees a game where you play a piece of bread and think ""This is my kinda game"" you'll probably enjoy it.""Today was the day of my expiration, and before my passing I wanted to achieve what so many of my brothers could not.

I slide in place and feel the toaster's warmth envelop me, but I slipped in too slowly. My toasting is too uneven. My goal today is to be the perfect breakfast anyone could ask for, I must become the perfect toast. I spring from the toaster and try to swing, but I am now drying out, I can't turn like I used to, and then I lost my grip. This is my destiny, to fall, to never achieve perfection.

This is a direct result of its controls feel as though they were poorly designed (note that I'm not referring to the default keyboard controls so much as how the controls result in your in-game movement). Unfortunetly, ""I am Bread"" lacks the humor of QWOP given the price tag (~$10) and amount of effort devoted to developing the game (i.e. it's been given more than the ""it's a small flash game"" amount of effort).Ultimately, this game looks really amusing in YouTube videos and might work for some very small bits of humor during live streams, but isn't something particularly fun to play as a game. My suggestion is to either save your money for a different game (e.g. Banished, Democracy 3, Kerbal Space Program) or to wait until it's on a 70-90% off sale.tl;dr: It's ""QWOP 2.0 -- Bread Edition"" without the humor of QWOP.

It's shameful and it just makes you look much more stupid than the people you're calling stupid. We can all see you don't own the game.There was none of this about 2d Boy's Little Inferno and that was a game about throwing toys in a fire for gods sake. That also had an awesome storyline and was captivating in it's own way.Especially since it's actually a very well made physics puzzler. The controls - ala Surgeon Simulator - are confusing as all hell but critically only add to the fun of playing. The physics simulation itself is very controlled, it's not too floaty or bogged down, it's just right, letting your piece of bread soar through the air in buttery grace only to land exactly where you wanted it takes not only skill but timing as well.There's a few bugs but nothing game-breaking, some prompts disappear when you tab out but overall it's behaved very well so far. Less bugs than AC: Unity by my count.

If the bread comes into contact with certain objects such as the floor or inedible loose items around the map, it loses edibility which is calculated into the score at the end. The bread can also over cook if it is left toasting too long, or if it is not toasting the whole side of the bread evenly.

And what's better is you can free roam around the map after finishing it in the story!I reccommend playing this game with an XBox 360/One or PS3/PS4 controller. I use the XBox 360 controller with this, and I cannot emphasize enough that it makes the gameplay a LOT more easy. The keyboard is very well useable for gameplay, but controllers are best IMO.I really feel that this game is something that I could play for hours on end and not get bored. I just played it for 70 mins before deciding to write a review, and haven't found anything I don't like about it yet. The gameplay is very straight forward and easy to figure out.

So I went to use the controller and the controls were just as silly and confusing as the keyboards! After a little bit of time i finally adjusted my controls to how i wanted them and tryed to play the game. Notice how I said ""tryed"", as in i tried to but it didnt work. The game had crashed and i had to reset the controls once again. This time they let me play. but i got rlly bored of the silly mechanics. After a little bit of the first game mode I went & played the other modes. This is what im very disappointed in. They all played the same you were either trying to get somewhere in a time limit or falling to your death or some♥♥♥♥♥♥2 seconds into the game. I was very disappointed and the only reason why i haven't refunded this game is because I am milked it for cards.

My father called me crazy, exclaiming that my dreams would never be realised, and that my punctual attendance to the yearly 'Breadcon' was for nought. But, as I was laying in my bed, sobbing to myself because my dreams would never come to be, I could see a faint light in the distance. An illuminated slice of bread descended from the heavens, and granted my wish. Now, I can laugh in my father's face as I sit on the kitchen counter, waiting to be inserted into the toaster.Sometimes, dreams do come true."

The controls take a little bit of getting used to, but they make for some really compelling gameplay. The story is great; I had a lot of fun watching the reaction of the hapless guy whose house was being upended by sentient bread.The graphics are really well done, the texturing and 3D modeling at the level of detail at which bread exists was really compelling.If you like games that break the mold, this would be a most welcome addition to your library."

There isn't really a story other than trying your best to become the most delicious toast ever. The tutorial teaches you the basics and then throws you right into it. You muck around the room, flopping about, climbing refrigerators, dry-humping slabs of butter; all in the name of becoming toast.Brilliant."

If it were virtually ANYTHING else, I'd say it's a sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥In the main game, you are a slice of bread trying to become toast. You can grip surfaces to move yourself and climb around, but you can only grab at each of your four corners, and you can't grip for too long so you have to stop and rest sometimes. And BEWARE THE FLOOR!The buttons you have to hold down keep changing depending on your orientation, and the camera always seems to work against you. Maybe you're moving in a straight line, but the camera decides to orbit you in a 360 pattern. Or maybe you're trying to figure out how to get up a stack of objects, but the camera keeps putting boxes or other stuff between you and the bread. You may as well try to play the game blindfolded.Almost every surface is loose, too, so it's not uncommon to have something slip out from underneath you and kill your whole run. Mastering the art of the fling is almost impossible because when you only have one point of grip, you never know what the analog stick is going to make you do.I enjoy the different games within the game, to some degree. The bagel race is about as infuriating as the main game largely because of the uncooperative camera. And the times you have to beat are INSANE! The rampage game is my favorite because I find it to be the easiest (relatively) but you only have two grip points this time so orienting yourself and making yourself go where you want to go is almost impossible (I often wind up going backwards.) I also don't understand the physics because I can break a glass, send shards flying, and then subsequently grab onto a flying shard and get carried halfway across the room! The Zero Gravity levels are excruciating, and I can't even beat one level of the Cheese Hunt because the damn cracker bread breaks too easily.Despite all this, the game is still fun. And I can't help but laugh at the whole premise, and chuckle every time I see ""I'm not eating that"" thrust on the screen. This is a game that is hilarious to watch other people try and beat, but I've found that I can laugh at myself, too. But it will make you very angry, to say the least."
