You start out as a lowly samurai doing jobs for your daimyo (fighting in top down zelda style battles, battling in one on one sword duels and even going on assassination missions and whatnot) until you're promoted to Daimyo yourself at which point it becomes more of a strategy game where you have to birth heirs (or face game over with your death) and slowly start conquering every province of Japan until you can claim yourself emperor in one giant RTS battle.  There are so many facets to this game and even in this crude state it still brings me hours of fun.  Check the credits closely and see even the great Sid Meier worked on this one.  It'd be a definite classic if they'd put his name on it but I don't think he had that kind of clout yet back then.  I have looked for years and can say there is no game out there that fully encompasses everything this game has to offer and I wish someone would make an updated remake or at least try something as ambitious as this game was."

At the time, I immediately answered Sword of the Samurai. It was an immediate buy for me when I discovered it tonight. It was (is) a very deep game for it's time and had many different, and fun elements. Heck, if you are ok with minecraft graphics, then you should have no problems with these. And don't forget, Sid Meier was invloved with this game. He helped develop the AI and the dueling. Long Live Microprose! And that! Don't forget the long history of amazing Microrpose games. Look it up. Who can't afford a few dollars for an amazing classic?"

Despite the tropical paradise surrounding me, I spent a lot of time sitting in the hotel room reading through the extremely well done manual, excited to get home and give it a try.   And, of course, when I finally did get home to try it, I played the living crap out of it.I've always felt this game never got the recognition it deserved.  I'm glad to see that it's available on Steam at a low price so those who missed out can give it a shot. Obviously, this is an old game and if the older graphics are a problem for you, you may not enjoy it.  But if you are into the kind of gameplay provided by other Microprose games like Pirates!, you don't want to miss out on this.Personally, I think a modern remake is in order."

,Recommended,327950,17071453,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,rpundurs,"Sword of the Samurai is an unbelievably deep and charming game. The ancient graphics hardly distract from the incredibly solid mechanics, especially since retropixel style is all the rage these days. Sword of the Samurai offers essentially three minigames under an umbrella of casual strategy roleplaying. The one-on-one duels, one-on-many melees, and full-scale battles all have their charms, but by far the most satisfying (and difficult) play experience is to be found in the melees.Sometimes you'll be minding your own business when you come across a band of uppity ronin whose heads need to part ways from their necks. Sometimes you'll be stealing into your lord's mansion in the dead of night to stab your way to a promotion when a tripped alarm turns your stealth mission into Kill Bill Volume 1. Sometimes your psychotic father-in-law keeps breaking into your house to kidnap your son. It's delightful!That said, the strategy roleplaying layer that connects these minigames is nothing to sneer at either;  even taken on its own, it's more interactive than some RPGs. What's truly remarkable about Sword of the Samurai - especially for its age - is the depth of agency it grants to the player. Your goal is to become Shogun, naturally, but your means of doing so are entirely up to you. Diplomacy, conquest, and subterfuge are all valid paths to success, and a successful player can make use of whatever tactic suits the present moment. It's little wonder that a young Sid Meier (yes, *that* Sid Meier) had a hand in its creation.The least attractive aspect of the game has to be its control scheme, which is somewhat opaque and unintuitive even with the help of the manual and technical supplement. (PROTIP: The keys you will be using most are the arrow keys, Enter, Backspace, Escape, and F1 through F3.) Even once you've figured out the controls to duels and melees, the battle interface is so unwieldy that in battles with more than three or four units to a side, mostly you will wind up watching your troops do the fighting for you on autopilot - attempting to intervene directly usually does more harm than good.All things considered, Sword of the Samurai is a forgotten gem that's worth at least one playthrough. $7 may be too steep for any game from 1989, no matter the quality, but if you see it on sale (like I did), be sure to snag it."
,Recommended,327950,17996778,"Posted: 12 September, 2015",all,saegon,"IntroductionEnter Japan in the age of warring states. At the center of this role-playing, action-adventure simulation of combat, statesmanship and intrigue, you are a samurai warrior struggling for honor. More important than life itself, honor is crucial to achieving your ultimate goal: unifying feudal Japan under your noble rule._________________________________StoryBasically, you lead a lineage of noble Japanese lords as they ascend from simple local leader to conqueror of the entire realm. During your voyage, you will have to perform numerous feats- from leading your armies in combat to sneaking in kidnapper hideouts, wishing to rescue the maiden worthy of your family's name. You will also enter in furious duels, and take part in court intrigues which never cease to threat your position in game.Your goal? To ultimately become the Shogun.GameplaySword of the Samurai is a fantastic mixture of strategy and action elements, which can teach a lot of lessons to modern gaming titles.It is up to you to use your wits, followers and skills to usurp, assassinate or befriend the opposition. You can also dishonour your opponents, and force them into ruin by nefarious means- but beware! Any treachery resulting in failure to slay your superiors can mean loss of face and honour, forcing you and your family to commit seppuku, ritual suicide.You can take on a wife and create a dynasty, that will one day inherit the title of Shogun, lord and master of all Japan, unified under your banner.Graphics | Immersion | SoundSword of Samurai is remarkable at giving you the impression of really ""being there"". Despite old graphics and rudimentary sound, it somehow manages to immerse you in its fascinating world, as you anxiously think of your next move.DifficultyFortunately the game is very unforgiving on higher difficulties, but never frustrating. You always blame yourself for failures, angry that you succumbed to your greed or agression.The drawbacks? Sometimes you build your character to a very high level, only to die in a duel or lose prestige due to a bad choice. Then you are put in position of your character's own son, whose stats might annoy you at first. But luckily, thanks to quick progression the game doesn't bore you too much with this.PriceNormally the game will hold you back $6.99, I bought it on sale for $0.97 however._________________________________ConclusionIn any case, I highly suggest this game to everyone, especiallly those who value gameplay and immersion in a title. The controls may be a little wanky, and the graphics may not have aged incredibly well, but if you put your mind to it and take the time to settle yourself on the game you're in for a good time."

76561198104120145,Recommended,327950,12584369,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,jd5team,"Really a great game. It has simple controls with complex decision making. In regards to the controls, I highly recommend reading the manual and the technical supplement before you start playing. They explain what the controls are as well as what sorts of strategies you might want to employ in order to ascend the ranks of medieval Japan. With 4 difficulties, and 48 provinces to start from, this game has a lot of options that can fit any play style you might choose.Types of choices you may come across. In the quest to increase your honor, you can complete quests offered by your lord, wander around killing bandits, OR you can sneak into your competitors estates and decrease their honor. Be careful though, if you get caught it takes a huge chunk of your own honor out. The game also takes several generations in order to win. You start off with your initial character being a youth, and as you increase your land and honor, you become a suitable spouse. After the marriage your wife will give you children and once you have a son you have an heir. If you decide not to get married you do have an appointed heir who is not related to you, really your preferance, but it is nice knowing your name will be carried on. Once your son grows up and your character dies control is transferred to your son and the cycle continues. You also have your daughters to consider though. Suitors will come with interests in marriage. This is useful in creating marriage alliances so choose your daughters husbands wisely.While this game does have a lot going for it, the strategic army v. army battles are pretty clunky. Its not really a surprise considering this game is from '89, but really the only way the ensure victory is to have an overwhellmingly huge army against a moderate to small army.so, in the endPros:Highly replayableSuits many play stylesVery good RPG elementsFunVery nostalgicCons:Clunky RTS combat"

The controls suck so I recommend grabbing xpadder and mapping to a controller. It's pre-mouse era with graphics about NES level. You start off as a low level fedual lord and gain power and honor through missions or random encounters that come out as one of three mini games. The game is very difficult until you get the hang of it so start on the lowest difficulty. You continue your lineage through your first born son unless he is kidnapped or killed by a rival.

However, Sword of the Samurai places you in the role a lord capable of owning and conquering land. You start out with several men whom which you can drill, recruit, and fight with. The game also allows for stealth tactics, sabtoge, sword fighting, bow fighting, gun fighting, anything. For what it's worth, you will get more content out of this game then the most recent Call of Duty."

In that sense, this game is a sibling of Pirates! and Covert Action, both of which I also highly, highly recommend.In this game, you are a low level Samurai  in feudal Japan, with a few loyal warriors under you, and ambitions of becoming ruler of all Japan. To do this, you need to beat your rivals to become the leader of your province, then the leader of your clan, and from there set your sights on total conquest.You do this by you, personally, aiming to be the best possible candidate for succession when your lord and master dies. You do that by acquiring honour, land holdings, and skill in swordsmanship and generalship, exceeding that of your rivals.Or.... if you are without honour, you can sneak into your rival's home, silently kill the guards, kidnap their heir, and force them to send you a proportion of their income or even speak well of you before your mutual lord.Or, if you are a skilled swordsman, you can challenge your rival to a duel, by insulting them and their ancestors. They must accept or lose honour, and then it is down to your own skill with the blade (and the swordfighting minigame).Or you can wander the countryside, righting wrongs, slaying sea bandits, kidnappers, thugs, and anyone else who would insult the honour of a noble samurai.Not forgetting to get married and have a child to take over your legacy when you die or retire (alowing you to continue the game after your character retires or is killed).One of my favourite things about the game is that it does not prevent you from doing illegal, dishonourable things. If you are caught, your lord may order you to commit ritual suicide, but you still have the option to act the next turn (including launching a military assault on your sworn lord). If you do not carry out the seppuku (or depose your lord), the game ends with your entire family exterminated. If you do, your heir takes over and the game continues.Very much recommended. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Japanese culture and/or history.The one major gameplay flaw I've found is there's not really any honourable way to increase your rice income except for military conquest of foreign lands, but you need rice income to recruit soldiers to participate in campaigns. That said, there are dishonourable options available..."

From the immersion, to the sound, to the intricacies of the combat, to the variety of choices. You really just can't go wrong. I would love if this game was remade so a new generation can appreciate it and not write it off simply for being 26 years old.

76561197996231297,Recommended,327950,12683887,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,tanglebones,"Graphics aside - this game stands as a hallmark of design in computer gaming history.  It is somewhat sad to see that it was 'cult' status but then again, just about all PC games were during the era in which this was published.The game itself - is steeped in Japanese imagery and music... and bows low to Feudal Japan's system of honor and caste.  It plays as a series of minigames with over-arching strategy that will span generations.  One need make decisions in order to make oneself stand out amongst his peers for promotion.  This can be done in numerous ways from performing feats of honor (by way of minigames - the duel, 1 vs many, or military engagements), or by subterfuge and treachery (inciting rebellion, insult, kidnapping, and even outright assassination).As one progresses in game - your character will most likely be survived by an heir.  And as one reaches Daimyo - the conquest and unification of Japan becomes the mission (as opposed to posturing oneself as the most honorable retainer amongst one's peers).  This is where the game might more closely resemble ""Nobunaga's Ambition,"" ""Romance of the three Kingdoms,"" or ""Shogun: Total War"" - as one would be concerned with the map of Japan and bringing each fief under his control.While the game isn't overly complex the path to greatness is multifaceted and has a depth because of it.  It's about honor, jockeying, and skill in all three mini-games."

IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST SAMURAI GAME EVER!Many might criticize this game for having such old school graphics, but it dosen't matter. Despite being a little dated what is impressive about this game is how it managed create a depth of character for the player.I thought the game well executed the experience of starting of as a local landord samurai who eventually ascends through ranks and later become capable of uniting Japan as Shogun. During this ascention there is plently of opportunities to display your might as a Samurai by crushing bandits, rescuing damsels, stopping assassinations, preventing kidnapping of your own family members, winning numerous duels, and winning numerous battles in the war for Japan. All the while you have to manage to rival clan members who also aspire to become daimyo or even shogun while also ensuring that your heirs are safe and capable of taking your place when you retire and thus can continue the campaign.I must say for an old game, it did a really great job of immersing the player into the role of a samurai lord, what with the many adventures, risks, and responsibilities that becoming a shogun entails.Do not let the graphics make you shy away from this game.

In fact i would say that if a game like this took its original immersive experience, and employed the graphics and fighting style like that of Mount and Blade, also managed a politics and dynastic experience similar to Crusader Kings II, and just maybe tried to employ some of the battle styles of Total War, then we got oursleves a really good samurai game right there.Ahh heck, in all likelyness such a fantasy might not happen, if anything if we are lucky, Mount and Blade bannerlord might inspire a really good mod instead."

At lower difficulties it's quite easy and the difficulty curve rises at a reasonable rate so don't be intimidated. If you don't usually play retro games I suggest waiting for a sale, but don't miss this game, it's a blast!8/10"

When I gain control of my pc I have tried not attacking not exploring and not assassinating people. I've also tried doing all of that, and I simply cannot figure out what is going on. lol Its rather funny but I still love the game and feel it deserves a full fledged remake with a brand new GUI and some half way decent graphics. Buy this game only if you have the patience to learn to play it. Its not a bad game, its just really old."

The controls maybe confusing at first but there are some very well made manuels on the internet that kept me playing. It has more than what really meets the eye. For my first playthrough I thought that grinding was the only way to rank up, and ranking up only usually happens when the higher power dies. I later learned that you could assinate the other lords, and attack their villages to weaken their power and up your standing in the realm. You can also dishonor the other familes in several different ways. I know I just kinda went off a bit but I just wanted to point out that this game gives you more than just one way to play and more than just one way to conquer Japan. I would honestly recommend this to anyone who loves older games like these and has the patience to learn the controls from an online manual for the game."

76561198021913143,Not Recommended,327950,30002489,Posted: 17 February,all,natpcon,"(This game is ancient and runs like DOSBOX, the controls being designed for atari or whatever it was. Still played on my win10 just fine. I figured what I had to out, others may not have the patience for that project) Unfortunately I never got the chance to play this GREAT GAME as a kid, it was slightly before my time. However having played it since I can see that it truly is unique in its immersion, even to today's standards. You play a daimyo making your personal decisions and in personal control of your character during travel and combat. However it's age tells, games like Nobunaga's Ambition tell this tale and in a more in-depth and (inarguably) newer fashion. Not to say this game isnt fun and doesnt hold certain aspects of personal choice and courage involved in being a samurai that I feel many modern contemporaries lack, but it is old and frankly like many games of it's day the illusion of depth gives way to the crudeness of 80's programming and graphical capabilities. For free, yeah sure, but a literal antique w/ a slew of more modern takes.. I just cant suggest it."

,Recommended,327950,29709702,Posted: 4 February,all,I'm Tiny Rick!!!,"Primitive game by 2017, somewhat dated even on release in 1989.  That said, the core concept and game there is fascinating, to say the least.  You're a low level samurai warrio making your way up to daimyo and, eventually, united Japan under single clan rule.  The game is broken up into two halves, the first being you living in a homestead, overruling a feif of rice tillers.  You can do things like raise taxes and raise troops, practice your swordsmanship in a primitive 1v1 fighting minigame, and send your troops to play war games in a fairly shallow real-time strategy sim that is somewhat easy to manipulate and light on options.Or you can choose to leave your home.  You have options here as well.  Leave with your army to court women at your peers or your local over rulers aboad or respond to calls to military action or heroic deeds.  Of you can set off at the risk of being alone but recognized and attacked in an attempt to gain notoriety.  These minigames give you more ""honor points"", which let you rise up in your social circle.  You can challenge your peers to a duel to play the aforementioned 1v1 minigame.  Finally you can shoose to venture out as an obscure and unknown ronin which allows you to commit espionage against your peers.  This is a third minigame, an over the head action RPG-ish mode where you either swing your sword or shoot a bow.  You enter this mini game while in the field to, say, repell some bandits attacking a village, or while traveling to your enemy's home to wait for nightfall.  Espionage against the AI lets you do things like assassinate esteemed guests, plant stolen heirlooms, kidnap members of the house to hold ransom or, ultimately, assassination of the head of the house hold.Ultimately the game is juggling gaining of enough honor points, recruiting soldiers, and correctly raiding or assassinating your enemy.  The system itself is shallow yet satisfying.This game would really transfer to a fleshed out and in depth game if it were taken on by a modern day team with proper development."

This is without a doubt the most realistic samurai game I've ever played. I love that sid meier worked on it as well. The ukioe-styled artwork and shamisen-MIDI music is so good it's bad retro. All-in-all this is one hell of a game, and I got it on the christmas sale for only $1.24!!Update: 1/28I have put in just about 10 hours into this game now, and it only gets more and more interesting.main lord Saiyoshi made it to the second rertainer rankingt taking the rank of hatamoto, but never achieved it within his lifetime so I retired him and allowed my descendant Hiyashi to take the reins: he was successful in becoming hatamoto in his lifetime and even made it to the second ranking of the vassals under lord asakura. After his retirement to a life of zen study and contemplation his heri Boruto went on to challenge one of his retainers; daigaku to become the new daimyo of echizen prefecture. He wasn't voted for it, but his descendant shall surely become daimyo!"
