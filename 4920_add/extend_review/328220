Even paid top dollar for the original SNES cartridge which I still have and can play today.  I was really excited about this game until I purchased it and actually played it.  Seems to have a lot of potential but sooo many bugs that it's unplayable.   People forget about you, things in inventory disappear, and for me the game randomly crashes when I go to save it.  Thus losing that days work.  Now I hear that they think it's ""finished"" and they want to move to episodic charging more for people that haven't purchased it yet.  No thanks.."

Unfortunately, it caused me to have a lapse in judgement and buy an EA game. I bought it in May, and it was unplayable. I sat on it until just now, played it, and was bored in 30mins. The biggest problem I had with this game was its unbearable control issues.My disappointment doubled when I heard they're doing episodes instead of a full game. They outright admit the new format is because they failed to manage their money, and no other reason.  I regret paying a dollar for this game. I don't anticipate ever having the complete game I paid for.It's a bummer because this game could have had potential if it was in the right hands... oh well.EDIT 7/2016: Just tried to play it again for giggles. I did a new game since it'd been so long and was immediately greeted by a sequence of yawn-inducing 2 second cutscenes paired with 10 second fades to black. Great. The controls, shockingly, are now somewhat tolerable. Not much else is too different - it is still a glitchy subpar game. I got bored by day 2 and quit without saving. I bought this game a year ago and it still sucks."

I don't usually write reviews, but I'm writing this hoping that it will help someone else out.The game design overall for Wild Season is fantastic...feels just like a mobile Harvest Moon game.Just that overall could sell me. I bought the game and immediately regretted it. (Or at least within the hour)Within 24 hours I had refunded the game.I understand it is in Alpha (SINCE APRIL 2015 MAY I ADD) so it became very clear to me that ""What you see is what you get"" with this game. I would play an entire day, struggle to get the game to actually save, and then when my character finally went to sleep...I would wake up the following day and the day would repeat...everything I had done was erased.Random lag in areas...unclear goals. Delay lag.Overall I give it 2/5 Stars. Dissapointed. Hope this helps you make up your mind as to purchasing this game or not.TLDR; The game idea is great, but the game itself lags too frequently..causing data to sometimes not save. Not worth the frusteration. 2/5 Stars."

And all that is taking into account the fact that this is just the first episode of the game. The first episode is not close to completion. In the state it's in, it's barely at a Beta state. I usually expect Beta games to have most of the core content ready to go but in need of some polishing.In the first 30 minutes of the game you are introduced to a lot of content that, when you attempt to access, just ins't there or is completely unusable. This is the definition of a game in Alpha state.I get it developers, you need the money or you won't be able to finish the game, but there were much better ways to go about this that did not involve blatantly lying about the state of your game."

It's not even a good Harvest Moon clone, let alone anything more. There are rampant spelling errors, the plot is meh, and last time I checked, purchasing a chicken corrupted your save file.If the game was more complete, and less buggy, it would be worth the current price of ""episode one"", but I didn't pay for an episode- I paid for a complete game. This is not even close. I'm definitely regretting purchasing this one while it was in early access; it never improved.It's a painfully unfinished game that's made up almost entirely of references to other media, rather than an actual plot.

If you progress though the story, try to do a simple dilevery quest, try to farm... I assure you you will find a bug that makes it unplayable.

I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage? You move in and they quite literally treat your existance there as a crime... it's a farming sim not a maximum security prison.

It's missing so many elements that makes Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon, and for a game that's inspired by that, it's nowhere close to it. This game should not even leave the beta/alpha stage at all. It's so bug prones to the point where you can't play. Now with their new ""episodic"" contents or in other words, trying to milk the cows but only produce some rotten cheese while the rest is dump down the drain. This is pretty much a typical kickstarter game with what seems like very inexperience developing team that can't even remotely bring what they promised without giant piles of bugs that is game breaking. The episodes plus game total if you buy all 4 is 32$, pretty much the same as the price before the price ""drop"".I do not recommend this game at this stage at all.

I honestly think people who are paying so much for a game, many of whom were backers for the Kickstarter who still haven't recieved their keys, deserve a bit better than this. You're far better off spending your money on World's Dawn, or waiting for StardewValley, at least until this game is finished and all episodes are released.They found more bugs while fixing the others, but pushed out the update for the others without fixing the ones they found. The new update didn't really change the quality of gameplay due to the new bugs. They're still asking for 20$ for two seasons worth of gameplay, when you can't even continue at the end of episode 1 without paying for more of the game. They even acknowledge that they cannot promise a second episode can even be released. On top of this, they're claiming to have enough money to finish the game, and then just a few sentences later asked for fully qualified volunteers to work for free on things they should have had done a long time ago.The game itself is still very much broken and can be a very frustrating experience.I have friends who design and create games, I am part of some of these, I understand it's a lot of very hard work, but this is getting to be ridiculous._____________________________It's not worth it as it is.I bought the game then realized they'd switched it to ""Episodes"" just a few days earlier. A little miffed, but I'd get over it. I should have read the game's page again before I bought it and I didn't. I've been playing it only to come to the conclusion that paid 20$ for an unfinished piece of garbage. I've played through one and a half seasons and just don't know if I can play through any more. Most of the hours clocked playing it are from when it drove me nuts so I just minimized it and forgot about it for a few days.None of the bugs they said were fixed are fixed, you don't have access to any tool or farm upgrades, it's near impossible to make any sort of money, there is glitch after glitch after glitch, it constantly fails to respond to key presses, and the list goes on and on.They failed to manage their money well and pushed the game when it just wasn't ready, insisting they didn't want to disappoint people who have been waiting for it, but I would have been far less disappointed had they just took their time and put out a finished, relatively polished product."

I love Harvest Moon, and the idea of Harvest Moon with some lurking, dread secret sounded wonderful to me.But part of the charm of games like Harvest Moon is the environment. Simply walking around and enjoying the small town. It needs to be a character, too. And there are some enjoyable visuals in certain areas. But much of the town is blank space, making it hard to navigate. You shouldn't feel lost in a tiny, homey town.Also, while I like the idea of the townspeople not wanting to have you there, in practice, it doesn't lead to them being likeable or interesting characters. This sort of thing could be used to build intrigue, with glimpses of who they really are peeking out between the cracks. But I never got the mystery-solving itch. I just wanted to leave. It's also easy to either sleep through cut scenes, or cause weird bugs when the game insists on showing them anyway.Currently, this game is episodic, which boggles my mind. A farming simulator is a time-eater. This genre is not one meant to be broken up into little bits. And after a kickstarter and early access, this game should be complete. Worse still, the game is buggy, and core elements of gameplay are still being built.I'll praise Quickfire for not giving up on the game, as they still do regular updates. It's the sort of thing where I'm tempted to leave a ""don't buy it yet"" sort of review. Because I want to view this game as a work in progress. But Wild Season isn't in early access anymore, and the game is still being debugged. And I can't recommend a game based on hope. I dropped $30 on the game before it went episodic, and feel incredibly foolish having done so. It doesn't deliver on the simple pleasure of growing lots of different crops. It doesn't feel like I've been invited or challenged to solve an interesting mystery. I don't care about the characters. The ads and information released by Quickfire make it look like there's so much to this game, but in my playthrough, it just didn't deliver on any of it. I appreciate them working hard to try to deliver their own spin on Harvest Moon, but your money would be better spent on a copy of virtually any other Harvest Moon game."

Yea you can access a bit, and play around abit (f you don't mind things like characters flying off the screen etc), but this feels like a demo, not a game.  Sad to say, but this situation reminds me a lot of Godus. Example: Wild Season has implemented the need for advanced tools since the inception, but still have not seen fit to provide the player with said tools so you are left with boulders and tree stumps throughout your farm. Also a watering can that only does one spot at a time, and there are easily 40 seeds plots, which means 9 spaces per seed plot... that is 360 clicks just for watering... don't buy this until they actually turn it into a game."

But that's not the fault of the developers.While there is still some missing content (for instance, areas of the map that are inaccessible) I expect them to open up in a later update.Two things I noticed: After saving and exiting the game, the next time I started it up most of the NPCs had forgotten who I was! I had to reintroduce myself to them. Also, my character (a male) is referred to as a female by some of them (another issue I expect to be fixed in a coming update.)Besides that, the nostalgia is real.

Mouse, game pad, keyboard....Nothing works! For $30, I'd like to play something, even if its buggy or choppy, but to be able to do nothing isn't right.

Went through the menu's, options and the like are ok. Started game, again, a bit touchy, but all in all, going ok. Speeding up now, I get to start playing, saved my game, which also is touchy but works, and step outside to start first full day. I meet the guy that will be picking up what I ship and offers to show me how to farm. I have a sickle and a hoe with some seeds now. I do the first part, but when the secound part comes up, he gives me a hoe...which now is no longer in my inventory. So in short, can't complete the totorial. So I reload and try to skip it, but once again, when he hands me the tools that I can use, the hoe once again vanishes from use/inventory. Can't farm, when the most important tool, the hoe, is not avalible, makes things kind of hard ha ha. Still, as said, the game is a bit choppy, but does seem like it'll hold promise like the old SNES Harvest Moon with some updated art work. Currently sits at ver 1.0, and I've sent the developer some notes, so hopefully they look into them. I'll update again when the game is patched...soon I hope ha ha."

The characters have interesting personalities--the dialogue is fresh (unlike what can be found in the Harvest Moon games that inspired it). While it DOES have some bugs (e.g. don't get paid for weeds or wood when you ship them), most of them do not detract from the overall appeal that this game has. Some say that an episodic approach is bad, and that is an opinion that I do not share. I say whatever floats the developers metaphorical boat. They have their reasons. o 3 op.s.......the turnips are adorable. \( ; A ; )/ <3"

I am, however, looking forwards to the next episode. I really wish they had fully finished the gameplay aspect prior to rushing the release for Ep. 1. I know it was because they needed funding.. but honestly, a lot of people have decided against this game because of it. The fact that even the carpenter or tool upgrades hasn't been implemented was quite upsetting. Overall, the game does seem to have an okay future, but don't let my review turn youi away.

I go crazy for anything like Harvest Moon, though I do appreciate that this is NOT Harvest Moon, it is a completely separate game and should be critiqued as such.I'll start with what is, by far, my favourite thing about this game. The characters. I REALLY like how unique and different each character is from one and other, I find myself getting more and more invested in them and the story the more I play. I find myself feeling differently about certain characters at various points in the plot, maybe suddenly someones motives become clear or even more clouded, maybe they spoke to you slightly differently and your character picks up on it. There's so much going on in terms of plot and people, which makes it a winner in my book. I do however, have one critisism, as you progress and talk to people they might give you clues about what they, or maybe others, like to receive as gifts, I just wish these clues were a little more obvious, and if there are obvious clues, I haven't seen them just yet. Also, I can't end this part without mentioning how happy I am that the Bachelors (and bachelorettes if you roll that way) are so much more age appropriate than in the HM games, I know that you never really get given any ages in HM but just the fact that they LOOK older, it makes my little heart so happy!Now, I suppose I COULD comment on plot but, honestly, I don't really want to; mostly because I'm still experiencing it for myself but it's also hard to give an honest review of the plot, in my opinion, unless you have seen the whole thing in it's entirety. So far, all I can really say about this games plot is that it sucks you in, stick with it, follow the story, and you'll see exactly what I meant when I wrote about the games characters.The only glaring problems, for me, are the bugs and keeping in mind this game is still early access, I have to say, they're not actually THAT bad. I mean there are some that really 'bug' me (not even a little sorry for that) but all in all, none are game breaking and I have yet to encounter any that can't be fixed by a simple save + restart. Yeah it's a pain but it's early access! There is one, however, that I havent been able to solve for myself and that is the issues I've been having with the stores, all (barring the animal, general and now Lilly's store) dont actually seem to be interactable, which is annoying because as it stands, I have no way to recover my stamina. I did have the same bother with Lilly initially but that seems to have corrected itself somehow?All in all, I love this game and if you enjoy Harvest Moon, odds are you will too! I, personally, am enjoying playing it now, as is, BUT don't let the fact that it's not complete put you off, it's a fantastic game with an excellent story and I am addicted!"

As of right now there are a lot of bugs that need to be reworked but if you dont mind the whole having to chase down an NPC to get their AI on the right track, the rest is a piece of cake from what I have encountered. I made a quick list of the things that have made me shake my head to the things that I have liked in the game and while I do vote to recommend this game, I cannot say I 100% recommend this game in its current state.Cons:- The NPC AI have them running off the map, its a pain to attempt to catch them- Sometimes you get stuck on the door frames of the house but thats normally caused from sprinting- The stacking system is a bit flawed when it comes to resources but its simply a pain- NPC normally get stuck or you are unable to find them- Fishing is a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ the bar that you need to get into the red area is off but a few seconds so you have an awkward timing.- You cant really tell some of the enterance ways from an exit in town(List will be updated as I play)Pros:- The story makes you wonder at the start, I find it pretty interesting.- It does have a very strong feel linked to Harvest moon.- On a personal level, the graphics are 'cute' to me.- Harvest works for the most part though its a bit awkward to have to not just harvest the plants with your hands.- The days are long letting you have more time to find people and talk to them as well as tend to the farm and animals.- Map is pretty big so lots to explore.( Shall be updated in the future!)"

I started with really nice audio, set my name and everything and the next second I couldn't hear myself think.  It was only when I got to the very end of all the text that I could access my settings and that heavenly audio button.*Controls: The Tutorial doesn't actually walk you through what buttons to press.  Its J, K and L just incase your wondering.   I changed mine back to the good old emulator set up of Z, X and C however it doesnt tell you any of this which can be a bit annoying when Frank is giving you the farming tutorial.*Cutscene: This is just my own complaint but at the very beginning I skipped the entire Intro thinking clicking would only go to the next text box.  Call me an idiot but they should change the skip to an actual button or something that says 'Click To Skip'All in all this game is amazing, the developers seem involved with their community and are constantly updatiing.

Okay, yeah, the controls are a slight annoyance, but if they're that bad for you, you can remap them. Okay, yeah, I don't always agree with the Episodic format. In some siutations it works others it doesn't. All in all, though... I didn't find it too bad.The few minor glitches I found weren't as game breaking as some would lead you to believe (for me, I had a few instances of things disappearing from my inventory, but upon adding something else to my bags, POOF! it's back). And I never once found the instance of people 'forgetting me'.That being said, there are a few things that do bug me more then others. The collision detection on some things (ore rocks in the mine, the hit locations for your hoe, axe, sickle, hammer and watering can) can be a mild annoyance, but it's not something that takes away from the soul of the game. That soul is - at it's roots - it's the Harvest Moon we've always wanted. I love Harvest Moon and Rune Factory - it's the whole reason I jumped to buy this game, even before seeing the epidosdic format - and I think that the developers honestly love the series as well. It's Harvest Moon taking place in that seedy little town you're not so sure is as 'upstanding' as everyone says.On the whole, I think this game has potential - and even though the 'pay for more content' deal caught me completely off guard as I didn't read much past that it was basically Harvest Moon - I will continue to buy the DLC. Some of you will disagree with me, others will agree, but as I stated before, the heart and soul of the game is there... and it is good. A little bit of elbow grease and some love, and this game has the potential to shine brighter then most of the Harvest Moon games, if you'll excuse my pretentiousness."

I'd scrap the car,leave town and then sell the deed to some megacorp like walmart or monsanto and laugh all the way to the bank while the town gets some long overdue scrutiny.2. triggers for cutscenes either went off early or never went off at all. especially when the runt tells you to leave in the beginning.3.I didn't care for the player character models but that's a personal peeve of mine and I won't ding the devs for it.4. a sandbox mode where there's no story and the townsfolk don't all act like they all need to be burned at the stake would just be fine with me.5. Minions! Farming is hard work and would be nice to hire some expendable hired hands to help out with the daily grind!

Also the darkness that sets in when nighttime comes was still there on the next day.I really hope there'll be a way to change stuff like the resolution and make it windowed rather than fullscreen because I don't have a very good computer and I would love to play this without having lag. Another I would love to see in the options is the ability to change the controls so that instead of needing to use certain keys I can change them to my preference.

This is the ""Harvest Moon"" game that I would believe those whove played Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature would enjoy. As did Friends of Mineral Town, Wild Season is bringing in all what makes the RPG Farming Simulation genre good and addicting. In its current state it is still heavily buggy and lacking in many areas but judging what I can see in game, I believe it is headed in the right direction. With a bit more polishing and a whole lot more content I would really think this will be one of the best RPG Farming Sim games available.+Great Farming ActionIts not like Farmville or anything like those online clicker games. Its old school RPG Farming. How it should be. Youve got a variation of crops and trees. Using different (hopefully upgradeable) tools you tend to them, from plowing to watering to sowing and eventually selling them for profit. Not only that, you also have a variety farm animals to tend to such as cows and chickens.+Active-Time FarmingTime moves on as you do things in the game and in this certain characters will have their own schedules and  will be found in different differnt places in differet times of the day. As more work is to be done in your farm youll have less time to do other errands like buying seeds, getting your groceries, wooing women and celebrating birthdays.And when I said birthdays, yes, there are birthdays. Other than an active clock to keep you on your toes, there is also a calander that shows you the season, holidays and events. Most crops only grow on certain seasons so you need to work hard and quick to get the most profit since they wither as the season ends.Time really adds to the game and makes it more immersive.+Alot of charactersYour Farm is not only the place youll be in for the entirety of the game. Youll get to visit the town and meet the colorful (and friendly?) townspeople. The Townspeople provide you with what you need such as seeds and farm animals, if you have the coin. There are characters that are viable for marriage too.+/-Nice ArtstyleThe game has an interesting artstyle similar to that of the old handheld Harvest Moon Games (sort of like RPG makers-esque). That is a cute and colorful and kinda tiny. It does look nice but its honestly nothing we havent seen before. Im sort of hopeful of changes to be had in some areas, like it just feels sort of flat (I know its a 2d game) and lifeless.+/- Decent SoundtrackWild Season got it right to get the sound of an anime RPG farming sim but its sort of lacking. Like footstep noises and such. It may sound like a nitpick but things like these and to the immersion and it just sounds sort of really quiet without those. Sometimes the soundtrack repeats cut and the repeat doesnt sound seemless.-Buggy as all hellAs do most Early Access games, Wild Season is really buggy. From messy button inputs to characters that seem to be out of place this is what truly breaks the game. The controls are sometimes unresponsive and characters just bug in and out (sometimes they get stuck in a loop within conversations/cutscenes and you cant progress.-Really expensiveAs of the state of the game it does not really justify its hefty price tag.Overall the game is fun but it heavily needs more work.

I have poured many hours into this game trying to see if I could get through to a certain degree, which is probably even less likely than before given it's now episodic, but the same bugs tend to keep happening regardless. At the time I had originally written this review, I don't believe Stardew Valley was around, but dare I say that it has otherwise filled the void that Wild Season failed to keep its promises of. Though as angry as I am, it is because I genuinely wanted this game to pull through. Even Stardew doesn't have the same things that I do like about Wild Season. I really would be extatic to hear literally ANYTHING from the devs about this game- even if it's to say they're taking an even more extended hiatus.
