Give it a try, get hooked and fall in love with a very unqiue setting.I honestly can't recommend this game enough.Here's hoping the developers go on to do great things and that this universe will continue to exist in future games."

Dont be fooled by screenshots may which remind you any generic ""hidden object"" game. This game is pure visual novel! Okay, not pure since there are point&click-anventure elements, but this makes game even better. Oh and 18+ rating is not just for show. Your dialogue choices matters and define the ending you'll get. Story, however, is not fully ""completed"", ending does not feel completly satisfying. and there's a lot room to explore both in story and in the world. Definetly looking forward for sequel which, hopefully, will be released soon, in february."

Under the glitter aritocrats hide foul secrets and the longer we play, the  more we uncover. Nothing is white or black, nothing is as simple, as it looks at first glance. Everyone hides something and seem to use main character for their own goals.The game itself feels like a prologue for some bigger scheme. It sets up the world, introduces us to the foul ways it works and prepares the stage for something that can possibly change it, for better or for worse. What starts as teens revenge quest ends forcing many hidden players to make their moves. Power plays that go behind the scenes seem really interesting, but all we see through the eyes of our young protagonists are mostly the consequences. That's why sometimes it is hard to understand what was really going on. I love how the complexity of the world slowly unfurls, but we don't get all the answers. The scene is set for a bigger performance and I hope we will be able to play it in the next installment.I loved the graphics and character designs, as well the characters. Kael has won my heart and I would love to see more of him. It is sad that I couldn't find any romantic content that included him, although the game didn't seem to be prude (there were some romantic options inlcuding girls and it mentiond incest relatonship, possibly some sexual abuse too). Although there appeared to be conversation that sets up MC sexual orientation early on but it didn't seem to matter later in the game, which is sad as Kael was the sweetest boy and best friend one can have (and he went through a lot of s**t because of our protagonist). I really feel for him and hope to meet him again in the next installment.The game itself is mostly linear, would love to see more locations and sometimesi felt that the choices didn't matter too much. Although we can keep our MC pure or turn to evil (the world of Leviathan is foul and for every choice there is a pretty high price to pay), but other than that there is not too much when it comes to characte development.English is not my native language but I saw some typos and sometimes the sentences were a bit weird, but it didn't bother me too much.As for replayability value, there are more choices I would like to explore as they may provide more hints and new information about the world and its characters."

Leviathan is a point-and-click puzzle mystery set in a Steampunk-esque world. I was really impressed with the amount of lore in the game so far, much of which turns out to be necessary to figuring out the puzzles and mysteries in both the larger narrative and in each episode. The mystery is fairly compelling even if some of the characters are more than a little disappointing, particularly how women are portrayed. I was also fairly uncomfortable with the homophobic tones taken with one character. There's also a few spots with typos and one place where information wasn't actually translated into English yet and a couple of achievements are broken (such as the achievements for completing episodes two and three). Despite its issues with characterization, the narrative is really compelling and I was impressed by the subtly of the moral choices so far. Usually in a game that has moral alignment, the choices are mostly ""SMASH! KILL"" or ""SAVE EVERYBODY"" in their obviousness. Leviathan, so far, avoids that trap and allows for more flexibility. So despite the game's issues (again, the major ones being characterization of women and the homophobia), I'm really interested in seeing what happens in episodes four and five."

The art is wonderful, on its own, but a lot of the assets don't mesh well together. The immersion is hampered immensely by a poor translation, reading like a fantasy roleplay thread comprised of a bunch of 15-year-olds, complete with mispellings and *asterisks denoting action right in the dialogue*. The world isn't firmly established, the characters don't mean much, and what story there IS is hackneyed and cliched.I'm an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, but my god, I'm dreading the idea of sitting through this game to FINISH, let alone play through multiple times to get the different route achievements, etc. I just can't spare the time on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not worth it.

Even if there was going to be a sequel, it still wouldn't justify how abruptly everything ended, leaving multiple characters, subplots and supernatural elements totally up in the air. It wasn't just a deus ex machina; they dropped the ball.There's currently a pretty serious bug that prevents a player from transitioning from Episode 4 to Episode 5 without switching to Russian for a while. This was incredibly frustrating, and I had to hold my phone up to my computer screen for a while to get an instant translation of some text. That didn't go very well.There is some good about this game, mainly the art style.

,Recommended,328270,17046559,"Posted: 14 July, 2015",all,Jala-chan,"Leviathan is a dark, episodic visual novel/adventure game. Your mother was murdered and you were adopted by the killer. Seeking to punish your guardian, you investigate the circumstances around the death and uncover much more than you first anticipated - including your own complex feelings related to the man who both killed your parent and lovingly raised you.The world of this game is intricate and richly developed, with a history that is both enigmatic and unique. It is dark fantasy with cyberpunk and even alien elements. The art stands out as both familiar and distinct, with animations which often make antagonists seem appropriately more grotesque. Though there are few tracks, the music is enjoyable and memorable. The characters are familiar personality types, yet as the story progresses you reveal new facets, emotions, and convictions. Many characters are not simply ""good"" or ""evil"" but rather a mixture of the two. The society in which this story takes place is filled with corruption, classism, racism, and politics. You commit crimes during your quest, even in selecting the most virtuous path you are offered. The writing depicts realistic situations, which are always a shade of grey (rather than black and white) and more difficult to suss out than is reflected in entertainment media. There are also reminders of your character's age (flirting, going drinking with friends) even as he is working on his investigation. I feel this is not a drawback to the story but rather enhances it, giving the protagonists a more human feel.The only issue that some players will encounter is the translation in terms of localization and a few grammatical issues. The story is still very much intelligible and therefore this does not detract from the game to any great extent. Furthermore, Lostwood has advised that a professional translator will be hired after the release of episode 5 to proofread everything. This will likely be released as an update when episode 5 is available in English, or shortly thereafter.I definitely recommend this game. It is quite easy to see the love and dedication put into this game and I absolutely want to see more of this world - and more work from Lostwood."

Caution not because of the content or even the dark themes but because of the vagueness in places within storyline itself and some plot holes.  Lots of things become confusing, twisted, conflicted and totally unanswered from motives to storylines to character involvement to what actually is going on in the world in general.  Yet at this point, if one just focuses on the main character Oliver Vertran, and stays totally within in his first person point of viewpoint (as a player), the game play makes perfect sense including all the plot holes, unanswered questions, questionable motives, and the choices made for self survival. (Making the best choice does not necessarily include having good options or even really any actual choice.  Which is often the case in this game as well as real life.)Oliver can not possibly know the answers to many of the questions he uncovers or the movitations of those he lives with, is friends with or even encounters. And he certainly does not know or even understand the gruesome truths and cruel tactics of the political world as a young adult (18 years old) he is still sheltered from.  If this were a book it would be the first book and followed by a sequel, a trilogy or even a series about this dark, mad, death laden world of Leviathan.Oh yes, forgot to mention this is an episodic visual novel and as of April 22, 2016 (when this review was written) is complete with all 5 chapters. Personally I do not recommend playing any episodic game until it is complete or unless the episode itself is a complete self-contained storyline (like a TV program).  I mention this only due to the reviews written, many that were written and not revised, after the first episode.Storyline: At the age of eight Oliver Vertran (from an ancient yet impoverished noble family) witnesses the after mass of his mother's murder at the hands of a shadow creature/demon controlled/or is an extention of a very wealthy noble Kristian Orvood. (Orvoods are one of the five ruling noble families of the world Leviathan.)  This murder occurred on the first day of the Decade.  The Decade is a decade long (10 years) pandemic plaque much like the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) of the 13th century or even the Ebola virus of today, and the death toll among the lower classes is in the millions.  (Only the noble class has an immunity.)  Though not mentioned directly this plague is caused by the Undead King or Plague King reasons unknown and cause unknown.  (Like I said earlier many unanswered questions and vagueness - yet Oliver growing up in this type of world would not question this any more then the air anyone else breathes.)For ten years, Oliver grows up under the strict yet loving? tuttelage of Kristian Orvood (who adopted him), while Oliver harbors thoughts of being able to prove Kristian murdered his mother.  The end of the Decade arrives (the day the plague ends can be calculated 10 years to the day, hour, minute from when it began) and Oliver's friend Kael discovers a clue to Oliver's mother's murder.  Oliver's desire to gain proof that Kristian murdered his mother engulfs him.  Most of the visual novel centers around Oliver's investigation of his mother's murder which leads to even more complicated life choices and basically a growing up understanding he knows nothing at all about his own life, hertiage and the world he lives in.So my friends as a story it a wonderful, chilling and quite horrific tale about a young man, Oliver, who encounters more then he can deal with and has to discover who he is and where he stands.  (Though do understand it seems that some episodes seem to be written by different people and therefore the focus shifts just enough to get a discord in the story fabric.)There are side stories too, which only add to the horror and disjointed feelings of the overall story.  However, the main points of the storyline are concluded, and the rest left for reader speculation being unresolved.  And for my literary friends this is one of those games that can be analysized for a college theme paper due to a world based on death, human nature, survival, morality, ethics, greed and power just to mention a few.  It's all there and more if one looks for it.PS Spent way too much time on this game trying to be bad, and still could not do it.  I wonder if that is a reflection of me or the game itself?  Update: Finally was bad enough on April 30th 2016, after following a YouTube video of Chapter 5 done by Tha14GR."
,Not Recommended,328270,31679896,Posted: 11 May,all,"eddie, pls","I didn't hate it, but on the whole the flaws outweighed the strengths.The most frustrating part of the game is the interface, which imitates the worst stylistic choices of late 90s adventure games. HUGE text and garish design elements clutter the screen, moving with the grace of a three-wheeled shopping trolley. As an adventure game, the entire flow of the player experience is dependent on these design choices, and gameplay suffers as a result.Secondly, the game is obviously not interested in coddling you - which is great, except when access to basic information is seen as coddling. I had to google the name of the protagonist's guardian, as there was nothing in my current stage of the game to remind me, and the alternative was going through around a dozen different options to find the next story trigger.The art style and world building are both wonderfully distinctive (if sometimes unpleasant) and the story itself is interesting, even if not a flawless translation. Unfortunately, I just didn't find these things compelling enough to slog through the muddled interface, or design choices that felt deliberately obtuse."

There is one elephant in this room, for me, though; there is an 'almost-sex scene' and I found this awkward as all get out.

The art was mostly quite good. Especially enjoyed all the backgrounds, some characters looked sometimes a bit weird, one of them looks really good untill he smiles which just looks akward.The mechanics are pretty much, read the story, click on stuff, go places, make some choices.I do not think the choices really matter for the story, I think this is linear, since sometimes there i only one correct choice otherwise you end of dead. There are some achievements that seem to be tight to choices but these are more meant as extra or easter eggs and have no impact. I would have liked a little more impact of the choices since giving any choice in the first place implies it will have effect which it does not. So they might as well remove it.Sometimes you have to 'puzzle'  which is just choosing correct items to use for instance, nothing difficult.The characters are interesting, some of them they just brushed over for a second and did no come back to, which i think is a shame (or maybe a choice does affect this?

With a wealth of reading - both to flesh out the world, and bring the characters and plot to life, it's one of my favourite VNs of all time after playing it. The storyline should really be played fully without any spoilers - with branching events, side quests that are optional, multiple endings, and a in-built morality system that is both a part of and seperate from meaningful choices (your choices can have weight regardless of getting you 'bad points' or subtracting from them) - it's a real treat of choose-your-own-adventure writing.The art style grew on me quickly, is quite charming, well-done, and lends itself well to the atmosphere - not just for the characters either. The gorgeous and gritty backgrounds and locations are splendidly well illustrated (and animated, in some cases!) and it engaged my imagination in the way some of my favourite authors have, like Michael Moorcock or Raymond E Feist. The first person narrative itself is reminiscient of a protagonist like Shiki Tohno from Tsukihime, a mixture of youth and bravado with a certain reserved nature and observant attitude. Easily relateable while being his own character, Oliver was a great protagonist for the game.The music is indeed, amazing despite being a relatively small track. Peaceful, intriguing, or thrilling, it nails the feeling of each scene everytime. There is no voice acting, but I feel like it was not truly required - I am quite used to my visual novels being read, not read to me, and those that do have voice acting have been few and far between for me.All in all, this game's developers really pushed it to get an english from russian translation, and I am so glad they did. Two kickstarters for it failed quite badly - and publicity for this wonderful game is quite low. It was a real diamond in the rough, a bit of a chance buy when I grabbed it, but I was more entertained than I ever thought I could be. A definite high quality purchase."

When I originally started it up, the game froze about two minutes in. Rebooting the game, it runs fine afterwards. However, the second day I play it, the same thing happened. I restarted the game once more, and all was well. I've yet to have it crash on me again. What's helpful, is that the game saved right before it crashed the second time, so I didn't lose any progress.There are spelling and grammatical errors throughout the course of the game, although they are easily discernable, and it doesn't prevent you from understanding what was said. During the third chapter, the errors seemed to have increased (Or rather, it hasn't been looked over too much more as of yet), the fourth containing the worst of the errors.While playing the game, I couldn't help but think it was missing a Back button for dialogue (But it has a Forward button, thankfully), if only because a click too soon during text immediately either finishes the sentence on the screen, or takes you to the next dialogue (And I will admit that sometimes I end up misclicking). Having the Inventory and possibly the Save/Quit Menu available during dialogue would be nice as well, but it DOES auto save, so that was extremly helpful for me.All of that aside, I really do enjoy playing this game! The plot and story is interesting enough, and I really enjoy the art. The backgrounds and character style is different and refreshing from the usual anime-esque visual novels usually seen.The music fits the atmosphere and I really like the menu screen (Theme of the game?) background music as well.Overall, I'd probably give the game a 6/10.

But don't be shocked when things are going well at a steady pace, and then music is changed to a discordant key and tensions are heightened for no real reason.Also, I've experienced some bugginess--one with not getting an achievement [not a major deal, honestly] and the other with accessing Episode 5 in English. Since the latter is a brand-new release for English, I understand that there might be a problem or two, and the discussion board led me to a quick workaround.So, do I recommend this game? Yes, I'm enjoying the weirdness of everything. But I'm also glad that I didn't pay full-price.Solid B+ territory."

If you're looking for the next Skyrim, this certainly isn't it, but as its own kind of genre it excels. Between mystery and ACTUAL moral dilemmas (@Bioware), you certainly won't feel like the story's lacking anytime soon.However, I feel like this game could have done a lot better. There's so much room for a variety of choices to be made, when really, the only choices that matter are the obvious good/evil ones (and some money-managing). You definitely play as the main character, who has his own unique personality, and I've gotta say, that was a little irritating. He says some pretty stupid stuff sometimes, and only has the option to date one person (*cough* where's my kael romance option). I guess I was looking for more freedom, and this game is very linear (playing out more like a movie than a game).On the bright side, the graphics are lovely, and the characters mostly intriguing. I was drawn into the world of Kroistham, and enjoyed discovering its secrets. Only character I didn't like was Ruth (I think they re-named her Darina?), but I LOVED Kael.Tl;dr: buy it on a sale. 6/10, nice small game.Looking forward to more by these developers in the future!"

Sure a sequel has already been confirmed, but this doesn't say 'Chapter 1' in the title, so it would have been better to put a better resolution in this game and then continue from there in the next one.Apart from that, this is a very cool technomagic adult oriented Harry Potter / Phoenix Wright combination. You actually have to do things to move the story along and there are even a couple of puzzles, so this isn't just a digital picture book like most visual novels. These parts are pretty easy, though, so this won't satisfy someone who wants a real point & click game, but I like this style a lot better than kinetic visual novels."

A treat for those who like to experiment with dialogue and pay attention to minor detail-a story with lots of twist and turns to keep you on your toe-I actually felt terrified when my character was in danger. Something I seldom experience in video game.Cons:-strange choice of music at times-I enjoy the ever changing plot. Nothing beats a good mystry to keep you guessing what will happen next. But the final chapter really threw me off. For some reason they introduce a big revelation of a character. They do so in a very abruptive way. The biggest problem is this revelation serve absolutely no purpose, and only take up time and break the flow of the game-no closure endingTo me a good story is one which makes you emotionaly invested in the characters and the world. This game has definitely achieve that. I highly recommend this game."

So I will revisit this game when they are released and based of how long it takes.The one thing I would have to say  did not like was the sound effects dissepancy of volume for some of the text blurbs. It felt louder than it needed to be. I ws in fact using head phones at the time but I tried it without and it still sounds way too loud.

The dialogue is quite stilted at times, and there are some strange grammatical syntax errors that make it clear that this game was created by non-English speakers.  This can be a bit jarring, but it doesn't interefere with the story per se.  I believe the creators are Russian, and this gives the game a cultural flavor that I found interesting; however I do wonder if I may be missing something by not being from that part of the world.  The story threw me into a story that I had no context for and little backstory was forthcoming.  I did finish the story, but it didn't really feel complete.  Again, this may be due to contextual cues that I was unaware of.  Overall I'd give it a qualified recommendation, but since there is no button for that, I'm forced to pick the thumbs down button even though I personally liked it."

You discover the your guardian murdered your mother, bought you, and molested you as a child but the game implies you simply forgive them. Your best friend confesses to a murder you comitted and then blames you for putting him in jail. However as far as I can tell you have no options at all to make different choices. Your friend just confesses and there seems nothing you can do about it. These events just happen and the game tries to make you feel responsible for them which is confusing and baffling to me. The game is extremely preachy and it feels like most of the decisions you make don't matter in the grand scheme of things. The game frequently stops in its tracks to TELL you how you're supposed to feel about certain people and events. The translation is pretty bad and the writing in general feels pretty poor. The game gets kind of soft core pervy in a few places but it seems more awkward than sexy. Lots of things are introduced but few are developed and after playing through the game twice, I got only a slight variation on the ending.This game was quite literally baffling to me and at the end I found myself wondering what exactly I'd accomplished."

Unfortunately, it all mostly goes down hill from there. The game introduces far too many interesting background elements that are left in the dust and ultimately never explored. Even its main plot lines are not satisfactory concluded and the ending in particular is a short disappointment. If you get the 'best' ending, absolutely none of the plot lines were resolved, great huh?It feels as if the game tried to do much, and fails to intergrate the background elements it introduces with the main plot in almost any way. Despite being called 'The Last Day of the Decade', the Decade itself is just a background element with almost no relevance to the plot. And what's disappointing is that all of these were very interesting and exciting elements if they were incorporated. They just weren't.CHARACTERS:They're okay. Darina and Julia are fairly good characters, but everybody else is chronically underdeveloped. Oliver (the protagonist) struggles from the writers trying to tell you how you should think about certain situations. Is the point of a visual novel not supposed to be that you figure this out for yourself?TRANSLATION:It's playable, but it clearly wasn't proofread or edited. There are clearly lines that make absolute zero sense in English, and it feels like subtext is lost from the poor translation and it can be a struggle to figure out the relevance of some of the conversations you end up having.GRAPHIC STYLE:Cute, but it doesn't really get any points here. It's a visual novel though, so it's not like it's bad.OVERALL:4/10A below average visual novel, and the only reason I rate it that highly is because of the potential the game had.
