Instead of using Direct3D it uses something called nGlide, this means that you no longer have the bump-mapping of the original nor do you have the option of true colour textures (this being a game made back when 16bit colour was actally an option).On top of this the crosshairs are noticeably off center making long-range engagements more difficult, especially now since the lock-on missiles no longer work.Until these issues are fixed I shall not recommend this game."

Don't take my lack of hours in steam as anything.I played this game and finished it years ago when it was new and was very happy when i found it on steam recently.Slave Zero is a classic mech game that i feel no one else has ever pulled off quite like this.The levels are different levels of a massive populated futuristic city. when you finish the stage you either jump into a massive elevator to the next area of the city or go through blast doors.you can use a lot of the environment as weapons.such as the people walking around, the cars on the highways, you can destroy buildings to get iron pipes to club enemy mechs and police helicopters. you also can replenish health and ammo destroying buildings.the levels while you would expect for a game its age are a little linear you can still explore to an extent. the game is challenging in a good way as you find better weapons to fight your foes on the enemies you have already crushed.the boss battles are challenging and oldschool where you find the weak spot and keep attacking it when the opportunity arises. the game is also littered with lesser bosses that you just have to be quick and deal as much damage as possible.i feel i should also mention the soundtrack. it is fantastic and compliments the game extreamly well.ah yes, and strafe is your friend!so happy this is now on steam as i get to relive a piece of my childhood.if you have never played it i highly recommend it. it of course is showing its age now but that does not distract from the excellent core gameplay.OSwhile i can't speak for Windows 8 i can say with pure confidence this game runs exceptionally on windows 7 and as yet i have not encountered any bugs. i do think the controlls need to be remapped for the best gaming experience. however that is down to personal preference. textures are a bit blurry but that is to be expected from a game this old. as far as i know there are no texture packs available. but that does not change the fact the game itself is still incredible. please, if you run win 8 and buy this don't hesitate to drop me a comment. i would love to know how it runs.Aspect Ratioits pretty much locked to 4:3 but there are a myriad of resolutions to choose from that range from 640x480 to 7680x4320i highly recommend picking it up.11/10 - glad to be throwing humans at giant mechs once more."

The game definitely feels easier than I remember, but a lot of old games feel that way.  Some of the graphics options are not compatible with current gen hardware but that is to be expected, they are red and cannot be selected in game.  The game still runs great on my three year old windows 7 hardware.  I would have liked to see a few updates with it, like better textures, but it's not that important.

When I saw it on steam, I had to get it.It's amusing looking at reviews from back in the day that were generally unfair to the game.The game's essentially a run-and-gun game in 3D with cutscenes thrown in, and it lives up that description. Essentially you point your gun at things that shoot at you and hold down the mouse button while running towards the end of the game. It's more about taking part in the journey of getting through the game and enjoying the scenery than it is putting your skills to the test, and the game somehow still looks okay to this day. I think reviewers 15 years ago were expecting Slave Zero to be a different game than what it is -- but what it is is perfectly fine from my point of view.Well, if you like run and gun games, and you want to see how they were done around the year 2000, Slave Zero is a nice experience. It's also short enough to get through in one afternon."

Even if you get the game running, you will still need to perform a few extra steps to get Direct3D support and Multiplayer up and running and you may become too exhausted to properly enjoy the game. In this case, I would Suggest one of two things:1. If you want to skip the setup BS, and have a properly working version out of the box, Get the Version available on Good Old Games (GOG). Aside from the fact that it's DRM-free, It also comes installed prepped and ready for modern gaming action!2. If you don't mind some DIY to get the game to work, wait for this game to go on sale (I got it for $1.94 CAD [75% off], but ultimatley returned it due to the effort required to get it running not being worth it).Regardless of the way you get the game, you may just like the interesting mix of action, atmosphere, and fun that only a game from the late 90's can provide."
65765611980926675,Recommended,328470,33216196,Posted: 3 July,all,Brandon360(taken over),"Slave Zero is a great 3rd person action game, where you play as a giant mech with big guns and nonstop action!The Good:* This game has a great feeling of being a giant as you go through the streets murdering innocent people, crushing cars, and destroying buildings, in which you can pick up something's(mostly just cars, people, and metal rods from destroyed buildings) and throw them around.* This game's combat is basically like all classic shooters back in the 90's, like Quake and Unreal Tournament. ""Fast paced action shooting""* The weapons in this game is somewhat good, they have a great kickass sound to them, especially the railgun, it feels so good and satisfying to here upon firing this weapon.* There are great variety of enemies in different levels. There is some big enemies and small enemies, each that might do medium or heavy damage to you, depending on what weapon they have.* The soundtrack is ok in my opinion, it's just basically futuristic music.The Bad:* The crosshair doesn't match up with your firing, it is slightly to the left of the crosshair and sense this is an old game it has to run through a program called nGlide. This program gives you more resolution options but no widescreen support. Normally the game is supposed to run in 640x480 resolution so the crosshair would match up with your firing, but this Steam Port forces the game to run in 1280x1024, which moves the crosshair slightly to the left. This may not be a big problem if this doesn't bother you, but it's just kinda annoying bug with in the game.* The game's difficulty can be annoying at some parts. Were sometimes they would throw a ton of heavy damage enemies at you, which makes the game much harder in most levels. (This may not bother you so this one gets a past, ""for now"".)* The game is basically unfinishable, where you encounter these enemies that are called Slave Units, which if you try to kill them the game would crash, you can just run pass them but at one point of the game you have to kill these two Slave Units that's at the end of a bridge in order to pass, but you can't because the game would crash every time you try to do so, which makes the game unfinishable. The Disc Version doesn't have this bug, but the Steam Port Version does for some reason, so get the disc lol! But now for some reason I did get pass this part and idk how I did it. so yey?* Picking up objects is ok and all like what I said before, but this throwing objects feature isn't really a big part of the gameplay and later on in the game, this feature of throwing objects around is just there for show and slows down the pacing of the gameplay in my opinion. But you can use this in combat if you really want too.* In conclusion of this review, Slave Zero is a great action game to play, if you can ignore most of the issues with this Steam Port, then you might have a good time playing this game. But if you can ever find the Disc Version of this game, then you can download this patch and would have a great time with this game.https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/546-slave-zero-direct3d-patch/"

We don't see much Mecha games nowadays.You feel really powerful as a giant robot walking into a futuristic maze-like city, playing your role as an anti-hero who fights the powerful tyranny of SovKhan while grabbing cars and even people, to throw them at walls or other robots.There's no pause, it's all action.Recommending this game in these days is hard, not many people will have the will to disregard such old graphics and play it for the pure fun. But people like me, who had or still have the game CD (yes, in that magazine) will have no doubt to jump right in and own a copy. Having your old games in the cloud and updated to run on modern OS is really convenient, definitely worth the price.And the game as a concept, I find this have a lot of potential for a remake."

The game is very fun to play with great controls, a great variety of enemies, and beautifully designed futuristic areas.I've noticed a lot of people comment on the story. The story is there purely for story's sake — it is the glue that ties all the missions together. Don't expect any intricate character development, or any sort of interaction among the characters whatsoever. Most of the exposition is presented at the very start of the game in the opening sequence and that's that. The hero of the game, Ch'an, doesn't communicate much with the rest of the cast - he merely executes Guardians' (the rebels) orders. This can be either good or bad depending on your preferences. If you're the kind of player that likes to assume the role of the protagonist - then this is the game for you - but on the other hand, it is hard to have some clear idea in terms of what Ch'an is like. The intro states that ""Ch'an must permanently merge with the Slave,"" meaning he's doomed to stay inside the robot for all eternity Neon Genesis Evangelion style. It would be interesting to read about his backstory, but the game is so fast paced and focused on bringing down Sovkhan that there's never really any time to address that. It is only near the end of the game, during the final mission, when Sovkhan reveals (spoiler alert!) that he murdered Ch'an's father which possibly explains Ch'an's decision to permanently merge with the robot. Unfortunately, since the plot never really makes you feel invested in the characters, this grand revelation felt very underwhelming and anticlimatic. But you don't play Slave Zero for the story! It is the fast-paced action packed gameplay, one of a kind atmosphere, amazingly intricate boss fights, and great atmospheric music that makes the game what it is. All in all, It is a great cyberpunk adventure that is still very fun to play now.Having said all that, I was quite disappointed by the Steam re-release. I must say I'm quite fortunate that I still own the original copy of the game because I've encountered a few issues with this version. First of all, a lot of functions don't work/are disabled for some reason. You can't turn on bump mapping, true color textures, the multiplayer doesn't work. I've also encountered numerous crashes throughout the game. I think Slave Zero deserved a much better treatment than this, but at least the game isn't completely forgotten and is actually available here. I'm still giving it a great score because I don't want to tarnish its image here, and because in spite of the butchered re-release — it's still a kickass 90s classic!"
,Recommended,328470,31514832,Posted: 2 May,all,Exus,"This is a third-person cyberpunk mecha action shooter. A love letter to video games, drenched in early/mid 90's anime, dystopian sci-fi, and Hong Kong cinema. Tight controls and exhaustive, yet refined shooting gameplay that will test your skills as a gamer. It's a straight-forward affair of action punctuated by intense boss battles that will leave you hungry for more. Seriously. Slave Zero was birthed from PC gaming's golden age when development was largely driven by passion instead of dollar signs. Infrogrames NA was a small, underpaid, and overworked team of veteran developers that clearly had a love for this type of schlocky science fiction. If you are willing to do a little bit of Googling to get the game up and runnning on a modern OS (there are many guides and resources to help you do this!), Slave Zero is an absolute treat of late 90's game design. Treat yourself!Side note: I recommend skipping the widescreen patches and opting instead to play the game in its native 4:3 aspect ratio at an internal (defailt) resolution of 640x480 and let nGlide render it at 1080. The widescreen patches, though handy and well-crafted don't use the game's Steam-provided exe, thus you cannot track your game time but also there is something oddly satisfying experiencing the software rendered closer to its native state as the creator's intended."

Gameplay is reminiscent of Quake's fast-paced arena-style combat but applied to linear singleplayer stages instead (there is a multiplayer mode but it's completely abandoned, as expected). Good selection of weapons and enemy variety, the mech designs are very cool, and the whole setting seems inspired in dystopian futures where technology has gotten out of hand like Ghost in the Shell, though the technical limitations at the time arguably held the developers back from achieving this artistic direction fully.It's criminally short but the game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around towards the end.

Slave Zero is a fast-paced shooter with a lot of giant robots, awesome music, and big bosses.  The game itself is pretty simple but fun to play. Unfortunately, after battling game crashes and performance issues for about 90 minutes I am ready to give up on this port.The game comes with a tool that can set almost any resolution if your computer can support it. It does make the game look a lot better. However, it seems like messing with resolution will potentially cause more crashes at least on my system.For some reason, I get a lot of lag when there is too much on the screen but I am pretty sure it is not my computer . Restarting game tends to temporarily fix it so it must be a glitch. Some features like local multiplayer may need a workaround. I did not have a problem starting the game but apparently, it is a common issue depending on operating system.Gameplay has a very arcade feel to it. This game does not mess around and throws you right into the none-stop action. Killing enemies and raining chaos feels very satisfying but I was a little disappointed by the lack of moves. You pretty much limited to flipping couple weapon and using rockets. You can also stamp but I never got anything accomplished with it. The character has a big arm with claws so it is kind of unfortunate that you do not get to melee as well.There is no RPG element management and perhaps the game is better without it .The uptempo music and cyberpunk settings give the game nice atmosphere. Although the voice acting is not great the plot motivates you to keep going and see how many overpowered robots you can trash.Verdict:I would give the game 7/10 but Steam port is less than serviceable. It depends on the system and how compatible your computer is with older games. Maybe it works better for some but not for me. I only wish I had the pleasure to play this game in a better state."

The game suffers many technical issues going from not detecting controllers, slowdown issues which can glitch you out the map unless you restart the game (This is specially prevalent in the sewer levels), and freezing in the late stages. The full package makes it the usual port that came out and never got fixed except by fans.If you can pass through all those problems, Slave Zero is a wonderful game that aged in a few departments. Is fast paced and with short yet several levels to beat. The controls are very simple regardless of playing with a controller or a keyboard, becoming casual friendly. And although graphically old since you're mostly seeing robots is barely an issue except of some cutscenes with humans. However, Slave Zero can become very stiff when comes to ammo, and for a very action packed game seems like shooting ememies punishes you in late game. You can end in several scenarios having a hard time against basic enemies or even bosses just for not having ammo enough of certain weapons, and with upgrades spending even more ammunition along your health not recovering after each stage it can become a big challenge even in the easiest mode for the wrong reasons.In resume, Slave Zero has two big negatives: Buggy programming and obsolete ammo system. However, if you can find ways to solve its bugs while also become a master managing your weapons, it becomes a wonderful game. Otherwise, the first half of the game is still a fun time to give it a try."
