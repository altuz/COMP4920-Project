Potatoman doesn't do this. The game shows thisRandomnessheavily from the second area, having the player dodge on a whim where projectiles will land, sometimes even having to die since they won't be able to evade anything.All in All, I really want to recommend this. Honestly I do...but the insane amount of RNG just makes too hard to play."

I like this game - it's a solid platform game and I liked the cutscenes at the end, but I just felt like I didn't get enough of it.

I just kept dying to the game, not realizing what the heck was going on. Once I grasped it, this game is difficult to complete and that is a fact. Up to the point where I just stopped trying, the majority of the obstacles were predictable. What made me stop was that I noticed some were not and were completely random, Meaning, there is just no way to get by the obstacles when that happens. Not exactly sure how much of a reflex-type of game it is if the obstacles yield no way for you to get past them (unless you count dying to generate a better path).The game's graphics derives itself on pixel art and I do find it kind of cute to see such a game at this day and age.For the persevering type of gamer, this is a game built for you. While I tend to like platforming games, this one isn't for me. Overall, I say 6.5/10 as a game and I recommend this to gamers that are seeking games that you can only hope to pass by trial+error. (But even then, some luck to overcome the random one)."

The platforming/challenges are kind of a more forgiving ""I wanna be the guy"" style where the rules are always changing on you and the point is to figure those out.

The game itself isn't actually very difficult or challenging in any way, but I enjoyed going through it nonetheless. The ending was quite powerful and sends across a great message. I'll definitely be playing more of this game. And that's the TROOF."

Could buy a few real potatoes and make dinner for the price of $4.00, but $0.59 is a steal for this breathtaking experience."

IT is a bit fun, do not get me wrong, but some of the obstacles are just to random, even in their color schemes at times to complete it 100% without getting lucky.It is frustrating when you get to the fourth world with no continuesand suddenly the rocks are nearly the same color of the background and you lose because you can no longer see. Then there is the last obstacle before the final level. IT is infuriatingly difficult to get past, let alone without any continues. It is just far to randomized and chaotic to be considered a 'fun' obstacle."
