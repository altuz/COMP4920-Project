I highly recommend this game to those that like this genre or wanting to get into it.The gameplay is very solid.  There are 4 different characters to choose from, they all play the same, but differ from their looks.  There are various passive buffs you can equip, up to 3.  As for weapons there is a handful of different guns you can use, not much of a huge selection, but enough to satisfy.Currently here are 3 different stages,  all procedural, and have their own theme.  Each level consists of completing an objective and going go the next level.  You do a total of two objectives and 1 boss level to complete the stage.My favorite feature is the weapon heat system.  Weapons don't use ammo, instead the more you use it the hotter it gets.  After constant use the weapon will overheat and be put into a cooldown.  This may sound bad, but it really isn't that bad.  I feel this system is far superior over an ammo one in that you don't have to worry about finding ammo and can just focus fighting (which there is a lot of).  And you get to keep your favorite weapons on hand instead of having to swap.A couple of negatives I have about this game is how short the stages are, I feel another level can be added to give each stage a bit more meat to them.  Lack of mid-game/mid-stage save is something I would like to have.  Once you exit the game that's it, you have to start over again.Overall this game is great, lots of huge potential and best of all the dev's are very active in the forums and listens to all feedback.  This game is worth it, pick this up whenever you can."

Despite being in early access this is a well rounded and somewhat polished game. While being in early access it does indeed lack some content and alot of pollish, as the game stands it is very enjoyable, challenging, and fun. Down below is a list of pros and cons as well as a video of gameplay.Pros:Fun gameplayGood game designArtwork and music goodLarge variety of enemies and three bosses to fight (so far)Controls are tightDecently challengingMany fun and unique weapons to choose fromCons:A few bugsNot too much level and content to see (Early Access)Not worth the money as it standsSingle player is lacking, better off playing with friendshttps://youtu.be/6uWXBzx0j8A"

It's closer to a Beat-em-up than a shooter game, and the merge goes very well. Don't come in expecting a Gungeon level experience, because it's in early access. But your input to the devs is what will make it a really good game! Very fun, worth the price."

Each to his/her own, but I think comparing this to Nuclear Throne or Enter The Gungeon isn't really fair. It's similar, but different enough in pacing. rate of drops and setting to differentiate it from those titles. It's just the right level of difficulty and gun synergies for me. The controls are solid and the gameplay keeps me coming back for more. Honestly, it's one of the better and just flat out fun games I've purchased in a while. Camera is a bit wonky at times (especially in Local co-op), there's no map (however, the dungeons are well laid out and I don't tend to get lost), but this game still really shines and has a lot of polish for an early access title, and honestly feels more solid than a lot of full release titles in my library, especially of this type. If you're a fan of this genre, don't hesitate for as long as I did...just get it. You will not regret this purchase. To think, there's more coming, as this is an early access game. Great stuff and a really solid title."

76561198155656396,Not Recommended,328510,26058811,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,[Freak] LivingDead,"I was quite hyped about this game when NorthernLion reviewed it on youtube. I went on steam, bought it, and kicked back with a friend and started playing. In the beginning, it was OK. The graphics and gamplay was an obvious inspiration fro Nuclear Thrones. The gameplay was smooth, the guns are decent, and the 3 maps that were given are decent.That's it.Two months later, I found this game somewhere in my folder and decided to see if it had any changes. It had not.The gameplay is horribly short. The story... wait, what story again? The guns and pickups are repetitive. You lose EVERYTHING after you die, and there is no way for you to save your progress. Take the binding issac for example, the game forces the player to play over and over again to unlock more stuff. As you progress through more levels, you get more powerups, you get better tears, and you actually feel powerful. Yes, this game allows for you to use your coins to purchase powerups after you finish a level, but the powerup system is HORRIBLY linear and forces the character to choose, instead of having the unknown variable of obtaining a good or bad powerup. This game fails on all points of that. Although it may be true that this game has only been out for less than half a year, the first binding of isaac has WAY more content, and it costs less than half of this game. There is no objective whatsoever, and don't you dare tell me that the ""quests"" that pop up after every stage is an incentive for me to continue playing this game, because it is not. This game even fails to even incorporate a minimap, a key aspect in ANY rogue-like games.I am deeply sorry for whoever bought this game for more than $15 just to finish it in less than 2 hours. Unless changes occur, I stand by the fact that this game was one of the worst purchases I have made on steam."

Challenging gameplay was off-putting at first, but not anymore. It's a blast to play!! I'm single player only on this...and it has some similarities to other games of the genre...like Nuclear Throne or Enter the Gungeon...and yet Monsters and Monocles has grown on me to the point where I'd play this one ahead of the others mentioned. Early access hasn't hampered the game at all, and there are plennty levels, waepons, upgrades and gameplay that I'm surprized to see it IS early access. A big thumbs up for me...especially after leaving it behind for a time, and playing it again. May be improtant to note that it takes the game a LONG time to start...I get blackscreen for about two minutes before the game eventually loads up and starts...but once it kicks in, it's fully functional."

Although I feel the camera needs some work on M&K, not sure about gamepad but it's really hard to control the camera. I'll be shooting down at ghosts and then one teleports behind me and there's nothing I can really do. Other than that, pretty alright game."

While the game does NOT offer a whole lot of variety in terms of weaponry and map choices at the moment, the sheer amount of joy it brings makes you forget about the missing variables! I've only tried it single player for the time being, but I definitely feel as though couch co-op or online co-op would be much more fun!"
76561198030796880,Recommended,328510,24980397,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,dowhilebreak,"Player profile: I've played a few hours worth of solo adventure. I use keyboard/mouse controls.Overall: I really like the Gauntlet-style play, the variety of enemies and the procedurally generated levels. Despite a number of shortcomings (expected for early-access stuff), I would totally recommend this game for anyone in the mood for an arcade style dungeon shoot-em-up.Noteable things I appreciated:- The variety of enemies is great. I had expected variations on a theme across the ""worlds,"" but was happy to encounter totally different concepts.- The map size of most levels is great.- The system changing the goal per level is a nice way to shake things up.- Vast assortment of items/weapons.- Weapon overheating system is (in general) used effectively to control scarcityThings I'm less keen on:- The game is currently permadeath which is a bit of a shame considering there is a home base of sorts and a number of things to collect. Adding some manner of save system would help immersion tremendously. It just feels like a missed opportunity to me.- Boss battles seem outlandishly hard by comparison to the standard levels, and with permadeath this gets immensely frustrating really quickly.- Health and damage items don't show stats of any kind to help the player gauge their value. (I may just be hankering for more RPG-style play that was not the goal of the developers.)- Keyboard/mouse controls are tricky to get the hang of. Especially controlling the camera as you move.- I hate to mention it because I’m sure it will get bigger as time/money allow, but it is currently a rather short game to play through.Note: This review is for the early access release, and probably won't be very useful as things change and improve."

Walking into walls greatly slows you down, you constantly get stuck on props while trying to dodge (I think you should be able to walk and dash through props), and if enemies surround you in a corner there is almost no way out.This game has a lot of potential, and again I haven't played enough to make a good judgement, but that was one of my initial thoughts."

If you like rogue-like, just as Enter the Gungeon, or Nuclear Throne, so you can just buy this game without any reflexion :DWeapon have a good feeling, and gameplay is also nervous (not as much as nuclear throne but just enough to get some fun)Probably if you are really good in this kind of game, this one will be easier for you. But it's still wip, so we have to wait the real launch.Also the multiplayer online is a real good thing (but don't have test it for now). This kind of game nerver have this possibility so it's great.One little default for now is probably that we don't really now when we are touch. It's not clear enough when you take damage. You should probably improve that.Anyway, it's a real good game, fun and it seems that Developper will add some content in the futur.So Thx for this game, i'm really enjoying it ! :D"

The graphics are absolutely fantastic! All the little critters and creepy monsters and little explosions when they die to the enviornment makes a really enjoyable place to run around and kill in ! Then the awesome music just adds to the effect. First time i was going throough the town and had the music blasting it just caught me how great it was. I love the overheat system which is a nice change up from games like nuclear throne and ect. Keeps the game fast paced and more focused on the combat. Im sure it will also make it more enjoyable in multiplayer (which i havent tried yet) where both players dont have to fight and worry about who is getting what ammo which would in the end slow the pace of the game down. If you already love these kind of top down shooters (Nuclear throne, BoI ect.) or are new to this style game, this is deff one worth picking up IMO"
,Recommended,328510,24984454,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,Giodyne,Its a good game that seems to have a ton of potential. It gives off an Enter the Gungeon feel but is different enough to make its own thing. Be aware this is in early access therefore improvements will be made.

,Recommended,328510,25122082,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,Nick,"I just played through this with a buddy and had a blast. It's a lot like Enter the Gungeon but manages to create its own style of play with emphasis on different gameplay elements. Not only that, it has ONLINE CO-OP!In it's current state the game is rather short and may seem a bit overpriced as it stands but does offer multi-loop difficulty and loot adjustments. I think they have an amazing foundation for a true hit here. The kill streak power up system is really great as your firepower will increase, up to a point, with continuous kills. Small caliber machine gun bullets become Ryu Hadouken size blasts when you get in the zone. I can't wait to see more of this as it develops. (MORE GUNS AND MORE LEVELS PLEASE!)It is worth noting that the game ran with out a hitch in 4K resolution with very minimal lag through its entirety on my PC. If I had to give it scores right now it would break down like this:Graphics: 10/10 (Excellent, crisp, clean sprites and animations)Sound: 8/10 (Great sound effects for weapons but not much in terms of a soundtrack, a little more here would enhance the presentation and feel of the game)Value: 6/10 (Very short initial playthough time with price considered makes it hard to give the game anything higher than this)Fun Factor: 9/10 (Absolutely sound game all-around, good control, interesting map themes, co-op, variety of enemies, bosses, etc. Very fun game)Definitely check this one out!"

76561198082573935,Recommended,328510,30207135,Posted: 26 February,all,Melting Squid,"Nuclear Throne meets Overcooked and gets a steampunk look.If I were to describe it in one sentence then there you have it. Monsters and Monocles is a game where you, and perhaps 3 friends if they have the game too (yes there is online multiplayer), go through steampunk worlds fighting the most dapper monstrosities you'll ever see. The controls are great and the creativity is easily spotted throughout the many unique locations you'll fight through. The game has a great sense of humor, and the guns are ridiculous. With all this good stuff said, there isn't much bad. I do think the gun variety is a bit lacking, and sometimes its hard to see where enemies are. The gameplay feels slower than the other games of its genre, and there is almost no one online to play with. Honestly, if you want to play with someone, grab some friends who have it, because there is rarely a single player online.Overall rating: Good. While it doesn't have a lot of the things that make Gungeon and Nuclear Throne great, it's steampunk atmosphere, online support, and great sense of humor make this a good game overall."
