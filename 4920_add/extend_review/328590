76561197997678124,Recommended,328590,34774269,Posted: 6 September,all,fragkitten,"This is a review for the Non-VR version.I enjoyed this game but I feel like the price is a little high. I think this should be closer to $10-12. This is mostly based on the length of the game.First let me start with what I didn't like. Opening doors. It felt like a real pain in the butt most of the time. Eventually I learned that there were some doors that I could open partway and forcably walk through without having to spend ages dragging my mouse.I was kind of bummed with the length of the game for the price tag. I've played 'meatier' games for $5 so I would have really liked to see a bit more. What was there was very well done in my opinion. Maybe I can keep my fingers crossed for a possible DLC with some back story about the family and it's journey through the generations with the curse. :)I found the controls while handling the axe or hairspray-torch to feel a little clunky. But I did like that I could still interact with objects while holding them. I just had to be careful or I would drop them a lot.There were lots of things I did like. The graphics, the ambience/atmosphere, looking for those pesky matryoshkas, chasing achievements, and the story. I even found a piece of poop that I could pick up and fling to appease my inner primate. Oddly satisfying. But I digress.The jump scares were a little meh for me, but I'm pretty desensitized to them so I don't fault the Devs for that. That being said, I found the artwork for the monster to be quite well done and very scary. I would not want to ever see that thing in real life. Yikes.I liked being able to interact with almost everything. I got to briefly relive one of my fond memories of Amnesia: Dark Descent by flinging books and random objects wildly around the room.... I really like to fling things! Don't judge me!At the end sequence, the game broke. :( Luckily, I was able to return to the main menu and reload without having to kill the exe. Bonus points because I'm lazy. After I reloaded though, my mouse sensitivity felt broken. I turned it all the way up and noticed no difference, it was really hard to turn or look anywhere. Eventually, it sort of fixed itself in time for the ending sequence again. It went ok the second time so I didn't have to reload. <3I'm still processing the ending. It wasn't amazing and it wasn't terrible. So instead of 'Whoa!!' my reaction was more of a introspective 'Hmmmm...' because it sort of tied the pieces of the story together. Spoopy but not terrifying.All in all, I had a good time and will probably play this a few more times for achievements and cards. I look forward to supporting future projects from these Devs. :)"
76561197991269066,Recommended,328590,34806259,Posted: 7 September,all,Maglot,"I've been waiting for this game since last year, and was happy to have it finally come out. I was hoping to play it as my first VR horror experience, but after its release date got pushed back a few times, Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul ended up taking its place. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite stack up to my experience with that, but it IS a pretty darn creepy game by its own right!The game sort of feels on-rails at times, taking you on a tour of the house rather than encouraging you to explore. You have a cell phone that will buzz to let you know where to go next, and doors that squeak open mysteriously as well. Most of the time, you are lighting candles in the dark hallways and just getting a feel for the mansion and the growing dread as the excellently done sound work has you looking over your shoulder within the first fifteen minutes, even though nothing major has happened.There aren't too many encounters in the game, but when they do happen you are thoroughly freaked out. That said, the ending was definitely my favorite bit, and gave me the chills.Being brand new, there are a few bugs that could be worked out. I'd like to have a way to carry more than just the cell phone on my hip, like the map, for instance. I'd also like the option to run, as the super slow walking locomotion, while appreciated, is just mind numbing when you're back-tracking for stuff you've missed.I do recommend the game, especially now that we're closer to the spooky season. You'll have a good time."

So, you can freely move around.There are some scarry parts in the game. And playing with VR glasses make it more scarier.The only problem I had was that when I entered another room, and i had to pass the door, that I had to duck. Because otherwise I would touch the ""roof of the door"" with my head, and then I had a black screen.I finished the game in a bit more then 2 hours and it didn't get bored.I did not play it without VR, but with VR glasses I would really recommend it.If interested, you can watch my full gameplay:https://youtu.be/No1R6tgdxgY"
,Recommended,328590,35366855,Posted: 30 September,all,@Dicky Spanish,"VR version: Awesome, what I have been wanting a Layers of Fear game in VR. While not as polished as LOF it's an excellent VR game really enjoyable for those who like psychological horror that's just not full of jump scares like most of the VR horror titles. While I can understand it is a little underwhelming in flatscreen gaming, in VR it's one of the better horror titles out there atm.While A chair in a room Greenwater is a great VR game I am enjoying this one more, it flows better and I feel more tension in this one than a chair in a room. Either way, you can't go wrong buying either but I would suggest buying both.A couple of problems, a little too dark for the Vive and you get that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mura effect but it's only in the darkest scenes.Grabbing is a ♥♥♥♥♥ with the Vives grab buttons, prefer to use the trigger. The stairs to the cellar I could descend but not ascend not sure if designed this way or not. Get's a little annoying having to go round to staircase to go back to level 1.Overall a great VR game and well worth buying if you enjoy psychological horror titles."
76561197972025376,Recommended,328590,34766142,Posted: 5 September,all,justintd,"It took me 100 minutes to beat this. It's very similar to Paranormal Activity, except PA takes about twice as long to finish. DKT has nice graphics and sound. There are multiple jump scares, and I yelled out loud 3 or 4 times. There are teleport and free locomotion options. I used the free locomotion option, and it was a little hard to control, and you'd sometimes get stuck on objects. The doors are a little hard to open sometimes too. For $15, I recommend it but not for $20 due to the length.Edit: I forgot to mention that achievements pop up often and are annoying, so I turned off notifications in Steam VR settings when playing this game. Problem solved."
76561198019046685,Recommended,328590,35004127,Posted: 16 September,all,Hooded Crow,"I do feel this game is well worth the buy and offers great atmosphere as well as gameplay however I do think it's lacking in the scare department.  Comparing this to ""Paranormal Activity""  I'd say the graphical quality is just as good and even feels  a little more alive in some ways.  Price point is a no brainer, especially since the overall length of the story is maybe slightly shorter the PA but pretty close to the same.  PA does offer actual danger however where this game is just you progressing forward with maybe two or three scripted scares. I can understand not wanting to rely on jump scares to heavily but overall I didn't get much of a thrill out of this game and wish there was at least some way to lose the game.  I'd say definitely buy it as a surreal story driven game that offers a beautifully crafted house to explore with attention to detail in every crevice but don't expect to wet your pants."

76561198130193229,Recommended,328590,34981535,Posted: 15 September,all,SirNewbington,"Kept me genuinely scared for the most of the game. The atmosphere stayed true to a horror game and kept me emersed throughout the playthrough.I recommend using headphones for full emersion, otherwise you won't get the full effect of the game, like any other horror game.One downside (and its a silly gripe) is that i wish the monsters model looked more refined. maybe in an update the devs will polish it up but as of now, that's the one thing that that cracked the horror atmosphere."

I with this in every game like this so i dont need to get everything if this to hight or on the flore.First time it was laaagy! Wery laggy... never see thos lags what destroy the immersion and VR experience... SO if you have same, RAID HDD (3 discks stiched together) the problem was here:I have a RAID of 3 hdd Western Blue and the read is fast as the the one SSD so the game have bugs when installed on this RAID disk only: may be write on disk to much or something related.SOLUTION was to move the game on SSD drive.Thank you!"

,Not Recommended,328590,35096738,Posted: 20 September,all,MatiasBaci,"TL;DRDon't buy this game, getA Chair In A Roominstead.PROS+Some very nice scares. Good tension.+Some good use of the VR medium, like swinging the axe to break open doors and lighting candles.+For a short horror game, the story is good. There's not much of it, just enough if you're interested in it. I liked the ending as well.CONS-Buggy controls. The trigger kept being spammed, making it extremely difficult to navigate the main menu, and annoying to read papers or use flamethrower. Plus the player moves too slowly.-Buggy physics. Very weird hitboxes and collisions. I often got stuck just by walking close to things. Waving objects such as the axe feels very awkward, and they often get stuck on walls and objects. Unlocked doors sometimes get stuck.-Bad graphics. Reflections look like there is a smaller, wallpainted version of the room on the other side.-Some things look like they should be much smaller in the real world. Glass that is like 5cm thick, just things that make the game more unimmersive.-Achievement progress kept ruining immersion too. A lot of notifications pop up during the game.To the devsA few suggestions that might help:1) Allow for both forms of locomotion at the same time. Could help when the player gets stuck using trackpad locomotion.2) Custom trackpad movement speed.3) Add the ability to store essential items like map and axe on the waist, just like the cellphone."

I think it's important that we write them to help the devs! ;)It's very similar to Paranormal Activity, but in a good way, I guess. It will definitely scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you ;)Loved the ending! ;)"
,Recommended,328590,34898947,Posted: 12 September,all,numb,I played the non VR version and I really enjoyed the game.The jumpscares were well-timed an didn't feel overused. The atmosphere and environment were very well done as well as they managed to keep me on edge the entire time. The sound effects on the game and how it built tension I can only describe as a master class in sound design.I'll probably go back to get the rest of the collectables and it's a must play when I get a VR device and I highly recommend it.Overall a very positive experience
,Not Recommended,328590,35196759,Posted: 24 September,all,Istadane,"First horror game I ever played. Did the no VR version. It's got some good tension, but didn't give any real spooks except for one jumpscare, which is kinda cheap. It also gets kinda boring in the middle when it turns into a collectathon.Good first horror game, but not great if you want some good scares.EDIT: Forgot to mention: not worth the price."

It's not a great horror game.  But it does deliever.Graphically it is fine though not at the level of graphics you have in Paranormal Activity. (I will reference that a lot,. this game feels like a PA knock off that the troops buy in war zones)  there were some very nice things like lighting and shadows, and then not so nice like flat shading, or areas you see in the pattern of wall paper and you think,. I need a bomb! or a sky that looks like a wall paper mural.  It does the job but not realistic enough that you forget you aren't really there.It has decent sound.  the whispers over you shoulder, distant rattleing of a door, clap of thunder. all do what they are supposed to.  there is errie ambient music playing a lot.  The sound in Paranormal activity did something to me.  there wasn't even music,. well execept that damn record player,. but the sound reached into you and got in your head and just made you feel that pure sense of dread.  I didn't quite get there with this game.Locomotion ,.. well there were two options,. niether worked very well.  My smooth loco would just die,.. then teleport would be hit or miss.  I tried 2 other vive wands and still the same issue so hopefully that gets ironed out soon because nothing pulls you out of the experience more than constantly having to fight your controls.Scares were totally there.   I am mostly scared in these games by the anxiety on not knowing what is coming.  This game did that pretty well even though for some reason towards the end that died off on me.  plenty of jump scares.  a couple not on the link above made me really scream out.there were some puzzles to solve to place objects in,. well you have seen it before,. the story is one we have already played through,. I don't know,.. this game is fine at the price it is on sale.   other wise it just feels like a rehash of games I've already played at a cheaper level of production."

,Recommended,328590,34828071,Posted: 8 September,all,T.Pyrdol,"I highly recommend this for VR. For those who have fear issues, I recommend watching a youtuber perhaps first and I'm sure that will make the trip completely more relaxed.  However, I wouldn't miss out on it because the atmosphere is just nailed perfectly. The scale feels just right and it's one of the highest quality horror games out there currently. Plus, you have both options of locomotion, my choice being Teleport (I do get VR motion sickness) and this makes me happy because due to a lack of it in Paranormal Activity (Which I really wanted to play also) I could not play that game. Thumbs up, great horror for VR."

It seems that some stuff are thrown just because it has to have some background story.I played just 20 minutes and could not go any further. Not because it was scary but instead just boring.It is worst than Paranormal Activity.And the floor is beyond reach. If something falls to the ground you canot pick it again."
