76561198053422627,Recommended,328710,15601397,"Posted: 28 April, 2015",all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"Here is my ""First Play on Launch Day"" video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o35GCAPxwzAThis game has similar graphics and art to the free Steam zombie survival game called ""Unturned"" which has lots of rave reviews and fansHowever, where Unturned is completely free to play, this game has a small price to play.  Is it worth it?Well, it's very early access, and some pretty obvious glitches are exposed in my first look gameplay video linked above.  However it seems to run and play smooth.  I haven't played nearly enough to see the depth of this game, but it looks to have a pretty deep and rewarding discovery crafting system and tons of different resources that you can collect.The infected (zombies) are much easier to kill then they are in Unturned, so this game is going to need to rely on PvP and other players to created a challenge if that's what you seek... at least at this very early point in development.  Right now, the balance seems to be on the ""easy"" side as mushrooms grow everywhere and can heal you for about 20% of your life.  The infected mobs would be lucky to get one hit on you, and just one of the over-abundance of red mushrooms could quickly fix that and have you running at 100% again.I will post more details about the online aspect of the game when I experience it, but when I played this game about an hour after it launched in early access, I seemed to be the only play online playing.As I stated at the end of my video, I give the game about a 70% right now with what little i have experienced, and if the online aspect turns out to be as fun and smooth as my first hour alone, then that score could jump up because my ""value"" rating would go up for sure.Definitely a 'two thumbs up' right now, but for those looking at the price in disgust, you might want to check out your free alternative here on Steam called ""Unturned"""

It spawned me in the middle of the night in a city infested with zombies I was scared ***less . It took me a while to get used to the settings of the game such as controls for inv placement, etc.  I cant wait to see what it has in store in the next update!"

Starting off must say this game needs alotta work.That being said, I was going to give a neg review before I realized the 64bit dont run correctly.Switched to 32bit and could finally play.Now that I can play, I can see great potential in this game.What sold me was after eating a can of tuna, a couple of minutes later I FARTED. Yes my character broke wind.And it was an achievement. Clever.Pros1) Great graphics even on low. Awesome on high.2) Really good lighting and shadowing. Climbimg ivy exquisite.3) World looks clean and polished-for the most part+ Has good texturing4) Has a great feel to the game5) Runs surprisingly smoothe...Did not expect that6) Appears to have a weather biome7) No (Sl)enderman...lol8) Definitely does not feel like MinecrapCons1) World gen needs sped up. Too slow. Buildings kinda odd shapes sometimes.2) Sometimes spawn above all and can't move and must exit after dying3) Better help guide (all though you will figure it out)4) User interface could use some tweeking5) 64bit will not run correctly. (looks worse than 32bit counterpart)6) Starts you with weapon that has no ammo7) Reticule goes away when using tool or weapon8) Not enough gamers supporting Indie gamesOverallI think this is an up and coming title and more people need to geet it for support.I will buy this for my friends to show my support.I do believe this game can eventually go toe to toe with MinecrapSo in conclusion Dev, good job.---LDKPS- Would really like full controller supprt :)"

I am very interested in continuing to play it in the future, once it starts to work for me. Right now though, unfortunately I cannot recommend One Last Day because I have had nothing but problems. I do want to encourage the developers to keep working on this and I believe that in the future, this game will be a success."

It welcomed me very unfriendly: bugged main menu screen at first launch, crash at first map while looting first chopped tree (map become bugged, doing generate on each load, had to delete it), clunky UI (invisible mouse cursos seems to randomly push buttons on screen, opening windows), poor AI (zombie teleporting when not able to find the way)..Looking at date of updates this game will require 10 years of such development. Don't be fooled by positive reviews, check their date first and reviewer's played time. No one sane will play this game in current state."

The enemies so far are interesting.The weapons looks great (Most of them)Though some stuff I would like them to fix as fast as possible is:The lighting... When the clock hits 00:00 in game it becomes black... Normally its day to night, but in this game its day to night to black.Seriously you can't see ANYTHING. Expect the moon. The enemies are able kill you while you can't see where they are (And they keep spawning close to you)Another thing is the crafting system might be mine that is bugged. But my recipe list don't get expended when I craft something. Also I am able to craft sticks then thats it. No matter what I do I can't craft anything else... Not even another stick.The game has a lot of potential, but really need some updates fast."

,Recommended,328710,17663730,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,JellyMule,Great game with lots of potential. I am glad it doesn't try to immitate minecraft or unturned too much but has its own method of crafting and object/world interaction. Lots of bugs at the moment since its still in Alpha but I hope the devs will keep improving and optimising the game. The game lags a lot on my system eventhough I can easily run Crysis 3.
,Recommended,328710,17711444,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,Jϕk∈r,"This game is pretty neat, reminds me a lot of the F2P game Unturned but it looks much nicer. The graphics are similar in nature but much clearer and a higher resolution. As of now, there are no options (graphics, rebind controls, etc...) but I am sure that they will be implemented eventually. Buy it now if you are interested, it is on sale but it is not very playable yet and is very barebones. Give it some time and it will get better though. Also, for early access, it's pretty well optimized, runs more smoothly than any other alpha/beta I have played."
