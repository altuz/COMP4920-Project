Not only that, but the cherry on the icing on the cake on the plate is that the wordplay is nestled neatly in the trappings of an RPG, like a Jimmy Dean sausage patty in a light fluffy croissant.The ability to equip gear, raise your stats, and even drink potions all contribute to the RPG feel, while various special and less than special types of letter tiles force more strategic play than simply 'what's the longest word I can find'.  If that isn't enough, each level has challenge modes such as time limited, or words must be longer than your arm, or you can only win if you live in Iowa.  Letter Quest is a pretty cool game is what I'm saying here.  Think about trying it.I'm Otter Chaos, and I approve this message."

,Recommended,328730,13029766,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,Ariamaki,"An extremely solid game in the vein of Bookworm Adventures, that is to say, the woefully under-populated ""Scrabble combat"" genre. A 15-letter word bank with less RNG smoothing than BA creates a slight bit more difficulty inherently, and the game pulls no punches, expecting large words and smart item-purchasing decisions from the very start.One downside compared to Bookworm Adventures is that specialized / bonus tiles are given at random, with gear and passives to improve your chances, as opposed to being rewarded for creating high-length or high-value words. The game also seems to favor a grindy approach to building up your resources, as the gem flow in the early-to-mid game is a bit unstable, and the potion costs are exorbitant. A larger variety of chest minigames would not have gone unappreciated, for that matter.Upsides include a MUCH larger array of modifications, gear, and enhancement items, as well as a more robust dictionary. There are some sly references here and there, and a very good stable of achievements and challenges.Music tracks are regrettably short, and sound effects have punch but unique ones are few and far between. The end result is audio that can become somewhat grating after a straight hour or so of play.All in all, it's an extremely solid and welcome addition to the genre, but not without its flaws. I'd recommend it over any other game like it that I have played, however, despite those issues."

What I actually prefer the most though are the challenges and the special conditions on some levels. Instead of just pushing you to find the longest word possible (still not a bad thing however), the game will push you to find different kinds of shorter words. I find that, all in all, this game is not only really enjoyable, it is also a good way to improve your vocabulary. More so, while going through the community hub, I found that the devs are really involved in making this the best game possible for everyone (i.e. the colourblind fix update)."

Essentially, you're a grim reaper-looking dude who's on a quest to get pizza - a much more relatable story than many other games I can think of. On the way, he has to fight monsters, such as ghosts, snakes and giant rabbits - just like going to the corner pizza place in real life. You defeat monsters by spelling words on a Boggle-like board, doing more damage for longer words or words with less common letters. Then you earn points that you can use to buy upgrades.The game does get a tad repetitive after a while, but it's a fun thing to play for a little while here and there. My only serious complaint is that the game is a mobile port - not a problem in itself, but there are a few cases here and there where it really shows, with instructions to ""tap"" a button, for example - just little things not exactly meaningful when you're playing on a PC instead of a tablet or some such."

Of the two recent titles that resemble Bookworm Adventures (the other being Words for Evil), this is the more RPG of the pair. It's turn-based, so you can take your time in assembling words and figure out what to do.That said, while it's not a bad game, I found myself enjoying it less and less as the game went on and it began adding in more and more conditions to the enemies, or the ""challenge"" stages that consisted of nothing but ""enemies have 2x HP"". This is a game that expects you to replay earlier levels for more currency to unlock new items every once in a while, and maybe return to them to unlock new paths on ""Hard Stages"". If you just play the ""required"" levels, the game actually ends quite early, and there's a bonus world at the end which is sort of an HP sponge slog.I will also admit I dislike this game's dictionary - it feels incredibly limited, which is ill-suited for a game wherein you need to create words it recognizes as such to play. I know I'm being negative here, but I'm just pointing out that this is not my jam and maybe look at that other title I mentioned if it doesn't click for you.

,Recommended,328730,13066074,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,Spiral,"A cute game that is best described as a light RPG using mechanics from popular word games.Progress through zones and defeat monsters using a Scrabble type system of creating words from letter jumbles, enjoyable if you like the idea of a single player Scrabble and taking your time. Additional challenges are condition based such as time limits or letter limit caps which serves to increase variety and challenge difficulty.The role playing aspects are fairly light. Clearing a zone or additional challenges in each zone yield gems which are used to purchase both cosmetic and equipment upgrades, increasing your stats or limited use buffs. Chests that may appear in each zone are solved using a system analogous to the popular word game Hangman.Overall the art style is cute and well designed, and serves as a strong word based puzzle game. Grinding might be an issue for some as some challenges are gated by equipment and your stats. A great addition is the inclusion of word definitions after playing a word, though at present some definitions need some tidying up, something the developers seem keen to do. I can certainly see the potential for this to be used as a useful educational tool after tightening the definitions, but it is equably just as enjoyable as a casual game for those that enjoy word puzzles and word challenges."

It has light RPG elements to it to build your character to do more damage/take less damage.  There are numerous combinations to use in the game thereby offering a fairly rich variety of things to try.  The equipment and the upgrades do make a material difference as to whether you'll win a level.  And the part I like is that you can pretty much build any combination and still win (which cannot be said for quite a few RPGs which are very equipment centric).The achievements can all be reasonably accomplished.   I completed all the levels and most achievements  in one play through without paying too much attention to them.  The last few took a bit of grinding.  The 3000 words took a lot of grinding.My playing time is a fairly accurate reflection of one play through and the grinding to get to 3000 words.   For a few bucks definitely worth it if you like word games.
,Recommended,328730,13117640,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,purgatory101,"After finishing both Bookworm Adventures and Bookworm Adventures 2 I knew I that the full depth of the RPG word game genre had not yet been discovered. I knew that there needed to be greater challenges, more powers, more wordcrafting and more stats. Grimm's Journey a firm addition to that genre and delivers on all of the above.PROS: This game takes most of the core elements that made Bookworm Adventures great and expounds on them.There is a lot of content: Each individual level has 3 more challenges to add both depth and varied game play. So each""level"" is really 4 as you attempt to collect all 4 stars. The first star is always a standard play-through, the second is usually a time challenge, the third is a run-through where each monster has special restrictions or weaknesses, and the fourth is hard mode where the monsters are high-powered. This provides a decent amount of extra playtime and provides more choices on what type of game play you are feeling during any session.Stats are awesome: The game stats that are tracked are comprehensive. Max damage with and without bonuses, palindromes spelled, the number of times you have used each letter, how many times have you spelled bacon...that is just a few. The list of tracked data is huge and is lots of fun to look over.CONS:  I really wish there were still even more powers. The ""books"" that you can equip can help both form a strategy or just generally make your character more powerful. I feel like more options in this category should have focused more on that strategy elementIt is difficult to craft a strategic run during a given level because they are mostly short (2-5 enemies) and a decent number of enemies have powers that can change tiles or prevent you from using certain tiles. In bookworm adventures 1 you could carefully spell short words using left over letters as you purposefully work toward collecting the necessary letters to spell ""Nonproliferation"". A mode or ""book"" that protects your tiles from alteration or lockdown would go a long way toward empowering the overly calculating player.OVERALL:  This is an awesome game that exands the niche RPG, word-game genre. This game is worth every penny and has been a great addition to my ""regularly played"" game collection."

The genre of ""role playing game"" has never crossed my mind as having a potentially educational aspect to it, much less one that could be simultaneously educational AND fun. However, Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey does it very well. The art style is adorable and smooth, the simplistic story is funny and compelling, and the ""special conditions"" ensure that gameplay is never stale. Small things aren't forgotten by the developers either -- there's comedic blurbs that explain each monster ""history"" to you on the right when in combat, and on the left there's definitions of the words you're spelling out. If you're a parent trying to get your kids to entertain the idea of entwining education and fun, or if you're like me (a college student killing time), this game is a blast.

Easily worth the small price tag.Decent little spelling game.  Mostly, you're just making words from the tiles, though there is occasionally a hangman mini-game mixed in.  Each level can be played in four modes:  regular, timed, special challenge and elite.  Timed was usually the hardest for me (I had to try a few times on some of the levels).  The special challenge and elite really aren't that hard, if for no other reason than that you aren't under time pressure.  If you want to collect and max out all of the toys, you'll be doing a bit of grinding.Don't expect any deep RPG elements.  There are a few upgrades, gear options, and heroes.  The heroes have different stats, though I never noticed a compelling reason to use one over another.  Character optimization just doesn't seem necessary.  You can carry a few each of two different potions (one heals and one clears tile debuffs).  But you won't be having conversations, nor do you get any choices that affect the story.The story is told in comics at certain points.  It's fairly lame, doesn't pretend to be anything other than silly, and doesn't get in the way.  I had to go back over the comic while writing this because the story made virtually no impression on me.  Easily forgettable, but similarly forgivable.The dictionary is fairly good, though it's definitely got gaps.  It didn't recognize heliophobe, for example.The art style is consistent with the previews.  The music is OK.  It could use more variety, but I've seen far more expensive games with far worse."

For pizza.As if a whole horde of monsters guarding pizzas wasn't odd enough, I could have just dialed for a pizza delivery instead of questing for a slice of pizza at the end of the day.Putting that aside, now for the very long game review.__________________________What's there to say when it's basically a word game? As long as you have a good vocabulary you're good to go... but not quite. Throw in the idea of RPGs, and you'll need not only your wits, but strength to overcome this arduous journey. The game itself is like scrabble, but it isn't a crossword puzzle. Consider it boggle, but you don't have to link the letters in a line to form the word. That's freedom, and I like the idea of it. Given a set of 15 letters, you try to form words 3-letters or more.You think that forming longer words makes you smart and powerful, but I say ""That's rubbish."" On your quest for pizza, you will find yourself facing some 'smarter' monsters that can only understand certain words you throw at them. If you had the brains but know not how to use it, you will definitely find yourself dead, no matter how much time you spent investing in forming a long word. Naturally, long words do more damage, but would they always? No. Some 'wittier' monsters can only understand baby talk, so insulting them with witty words proves no help in your quest. But I'm sure you are smarter than these monsters guarding pizzas.By RPG elements inclusion, it isn't you being a hero and saving the day since you're just out hunting for pizza using your trustworthy guide. You equip yourself with books that actually aid you in your journey which automatically writes new experience for itself as you battle your way to the delicacy. You upgrade your stats to aid you in your long battle. You find a new girlfriend and you decide to let her battle for you in the frontline while you take the pizza for yourself. You prove your wits and unlock cool stuff. What more do you want? Oh yes, the pizza.So let me put my cynical talk aside, the game itself is decent. Difficulty is well balanced, graphics are simple and clean. More importantly, fonts don't hurt your eyes to look at, especially when it's a word game. You will immediately grasp hold of how the game works when new stuff appears which in my view is ideal. Music is alright, and can get repetitive easily but no one said you can't turn it off to play your own songs, so get on with it.

Your job is to come along for the ride and use some fancy words to get your way out of difficult situations. Better the vocabulary, better the chance of you winning and sometimes it really isn't as easy as it looks.Honestly, at first glance it looks like a bit of a childish game due to the animation and bulky look of menus, playable blocks and just the general idea that follows this, but it's honestly perfect for all ages as a casual puzzler to lay back with and get yourself really thinking to try and get passed certain levels.I enjoy that the difficulty is set in the middle somewhere - Not punishing, and not dead easy. It's pesky in mini-boss fights as well as certain levels (Also hard levels), while not being impossible to get through. It makes winning feel rewarding and for a game to get that right, it has a lot of brownie points from me from the get-go.Graphics:Cute, smoothly animated, nicely cartoony, all round really nice.Soundtrack:Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the soundtrack to the levels, menu etc. However, it does tend to grate a bit after a decent amount of play time as there isn't enough variations to how it sounds. I found myself turning the music down if not nearly completely off after the 3 hour mark hit as that was my limit.Menu:Isn't really much of one, but for what there is of it; it's nicely set-up, easy and simple enough for anyone of any age to navigate around.Final Conclusion:Wonderful little blend of RPG and a family favorite (e.g Scrabble/Boggle/etc), It blends together really nicely for a game that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. It keeps you thinking, possibly even teaches you new words you had no idea even existed while feeling both engaging and rewarding.Brain teasers and adorable-ness, how much of a better combo can you get out of a relaxing puzzler?"

It's a little grindy in place but never overly as long as you use your letters wisely.My only gripe is with one achievement "" cover the grid with plague tiles "", only around 8% of people have it i have tried repeatedly to get it as the last achievement i need but cant seem to get something that should be so simple. Looking at the plague tiles and how long they last on screen it also seems mathematically impossible - so if you figure it out please drop me a pm, i must be missing something obvious.Great game, educational and quite a bit of gameplay in it. overall 9/10 ( could have had a lot more achievements for expert mode as its quite tough and there is no reason to play after you finish regular mode )"

Basically you are given a grid of randomized letters and have to spell words from them to damage monsters and reduce their hitpoints. The longer the word and the more difficult to use the letters are, the more damage it will do. You earn gems for slaying monsters and finishing levels and can spend these to upgrade your characters abilities and buy potions and items to help you in combat. Each level has a set of four challenges, starting at the easy first star and building up the the quite difficult crystal star. Earning stars and crystal stars unlock new things for you to nab in the shop. An addictive little game that is good for coffee break fun or for longer sessions, in fact keep an eye on the clock as its easy to lose track of time."

But really it's just spelling words until you occumulate enough points to pass a target.  I will say if I wanted a boggle game it would be great since it gives it a new feel by giving certain challenges in the form of upgrades and cursed letters that encourages you to spell words in different ways like multiple vowels or infectious letters that lower points.As a word game with an rpg feel it's great, but as an rpg with a word game feel it doesn't meet expectations."
76561198004785038,Not Recommended,328730,16608000,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,davis_zaq,"This is a game in the style of Bookworm Adventures or Word Realms—you have a handful of letter tiles, and you have to spell words to attack various enemies. Longer words and rarer letters make for more damage, and you go back and forth until either you or the enemy falls over. Simple enough. I'm a big fan of that genre (what few games exist for it, anyway), but unfortunately, this game doesn't really do the genre justice.This game is a lot easier than Bookworm Adventures or Word Realms, though. For one, you have a massive hand of tiles (20 at once!), so it's not at all hard to spell words. Second, enemies rarely do anything especially bad to you—they do sometimes mess with your tiles, but none of the things they do to you are particularly problematic. You can purchase all kinds of numerical upgrades (increased health, increased damage, etc.); some of the challenge missions basically aren't possible until you do this, but that's more due to strange enemy design than due to actual challenge. Also, letters don't have specific point values, but instead are just ranked into three tiers. This makes it easy to spell words that score decently high, but it also means that there isn't much reward for using really obscure letters.Once you beat a level, you'll have to go back over it three more times, with different rules each time. There's a time trial, which is exactly what it sounds like. There's a challenge level, which either beefs up the enemies or puts restrictions on what kinds of letters you can use. And there's a ""crystal star"" level, which is where the real gameplay happens; in crystal star levels, different enemies have different attributes that actually affect what words you can or should use against them (one might take extra damage from words beginning with a vowel, and one might be only damaged by words that involve letters from the corner of your grid). Crystal star levels are actually fun, since the different monsters feel different and are more than just blocks of tofu for you to spell words at. (Outside of the crystal star levels, the monsters feel very, very similar—they might do slightly different attacks to you, but they don't feel differentiated from each other at all.)As far as presentation goes, the game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The music is awful, the graphics are boring (the monsters are all basically recolors of the same five or six sprites, and they aren't even animated), and while you're not playing this game for a gripping plot, even the paper-thin story is lackluster. This game lives and dies on the gameplay (which isn't really a bad thing, since the gameplay is the most important part of any game, but still), since it doesn't really do anything to make itself pretty.Overall, this game's only real strength is the price. If you're looking for a word-combat game that actually feels well-made, you're better off playing Word Realms. If you've already beaten Word Realms and Bookworm Adventures and just want something else in the genre, this game will keep you amused for a couple hours, but it won't reinvent your world in any sense. I don't regret the few dollars I spent on it, but neither am I clamoring for a sequel, at least not without some kind of assurance that said sequel would have a lot of improvements to it."

It's also somewhat punishing where I think when you die you have to restart the level and early on (or the entire game) there's no reliable method of healing.

Since everything seems to auto-save constantly, this isn't a big problem. Second, I disagree with some definitions and/or word inclusion. But it's a big language out there, after all. Third, it's a bit grindy. Now, that complaint really only applies if you look at it from a ""speed thru and never look back"" perspective.

The difficulty of game highly depends on your vocabulary.Other than the word-spelling part, the mechanism of which is traditional, the game incorporates some RPG elements, such as you battle through various scenes to defeat enemies with different abilities to modify the letter board, you are given quests involving spelling during battles, you can buy upgrades to improve your hero's performances and you can level-up your books to receive bonus under specified circumstances. All these elements and factors are integrated into the game smoothly so that the word-spelling puzzles become very attractive and addictive. Although grinding may be needed at some point, this game is not hard overall. 15-20 hours are needed in order to complete all the stages, achievements and buy all upgrades in the store.This one is much better than any other word-spelling games on the market, and it might be great game if the producer could bring in more contents (e.g. an intriguing story, NPCs, more weapons, items, foes, etc.)."

But worry not about the latter, the developers will take note of any errors reported."

It's like Scrabble crossed with a word jumble crossed with a random fantasy RPG (we'll go with The Legend of Zelda, I guess), and it keeps you involved with four different versions of each of the 40 or so short stages in conjunction with a surprising variety of upgrade options for your little Grim Reaper(s). An extensive series of achievements and in-game objectives gives you something else to strive for, and positive and negative letter tiles flesh out the actual gameplay. Perfect casual gaming."

The one star levels could be harder and you have to do all of those to move on.   There is more strategy to consider in the Bookworm Adventure games.   Still a B grade game for all of my grumbling.
