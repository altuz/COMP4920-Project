Initially the game wasn't great, the menu navigation and UI wasn't amazing, but after playing around with it for a while you get the hang of it and are able to move between sections easily. Whilst the graphics aren't great I don't think that's what this game is about. The in game player base is awesome with great depth. The match mechanics are okay, not a big fan but if you get the hang of the plays and what not it can be quite fun.So yeah that's a broad look at the game. The killers for me however are more minute.There's a few big problems IMO. First and foremost is the unrealistic simulated games. You can have a team of 'World Class' players and lose to a team of 'Nationals'. Look I know Rugby and I know you can't count anyone out and what not but this lead to a lot of head scratching from me.Some players are not up to date; e.g. Duane Vermeulan was argueably the best player in the world this year and he's rated as 'International'. So yeah there's a few cases like that, some players over rated and other underated. Which once again left me scratching my head.Sometimes I felt as though my team simply sucked for no reason. I would have an awesome back line, they would have a crap one, set my tactics to play a more expansive game, and strangely, I lost. More head scratching...Overall though it's a fun game to play, if you're not a rugby fan, don't buy this unless it's on sale, I don't feel like you'll get $40 worth of satisfaction. I'll continue to play this game and learn more about the mechanics (still learning!).Cons- Confusing/clustered UI- Unrealistic results- Some players not up to date- Bad graphics- One or two crashes- Players brought up through the 'Colts' and 'Academy' when selected for international duty don't have a name unless editedPros- In depth teams- Aweosme development of your players through your teams system- Accurate coaching system"

The basic premise is pretty solid, and the functionality is pretty in depth so it should keep you engaged for a pretty long time. Particular highlights include the colts system - being able to bring young players through and shape them into world class players is what will keep me playing in the long term, and the player stats are generally not too bad, with the editor there for those which are questionable.For me the biggest negative is the interface, which is frankly a bit of a mess and needs some serious thought going into it. The game really doesn't flow very well, and there is a pretty steep learning curve to be overcome.I've also noticed that the number of knock ons and penalties in a game is incredibly high, not sure if I'm doing something wrong but surely you shouldn't have to manually give a command to make players release the ball at every ruck, I'm currently seeing about 10 penalties against me per game for this and its beyond frustrating.I would definitely recommend this game, as it is a very strong first effort which will only get better with incremental updates and I hope the developers will listen to the feedback they receive"
76561198028289632,Recommended,328830,13956664,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,Spl1nters,Great first effort and the best rugby manager game by a long shot. The interface takes a bit of getting used to but once you find your way around there is a good bit to keep you interested and lots of team and player depth. I'm a rugby fan playing Football Manager for years hoping for a game like this. It's a bit rough around the edges but it's a good stand alone manager sim and hopefully just the start.

It is far better than PRM.Sure, I agree with most of the previous comments, but its is a fair first game effort.Its not as polished to FM standards yet. But if the developers listen to Rugby gamers, it will surely improve with patches..Don't allow these negative comments stop you buying this game. You won't regret getiing a dud.I'd recommend this game to any serious Rugby fan."
,Recommended,328830,13438475,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,old_jingle,"So this is a good game!As others have said the menu takes some getting used to but apart from that it is very enjoybale.There are however still quite a few AI issues that I feel at the moment means its not worth the full £30 maybe £20.However the dev is very good at adding updates so hopefully this will be sorted.The AI issues noted so far are;When computer AI kicks to your full-back he will 99% of the time kick the ball out on the full from the 22. Despite being under no pressure.When your own fly-half kicks the chase is always horrendous and if their 15 runs at you he will normally do very well.THis is a real pain as the second issue is that turn-overs from rucks are extremely rare and I have Sam Warburton playing 7 every game!!!!!!  I have also on instances driven the oppostion back from my 22 to theirs without gaining possession The issue with this is that the computer can have possession for almost an entire 1/2 especially if you win it back to just knock on! More turnovers are essential.The game also doesn't notice things like the touch line when running or when a player is blatantly isolated.For some reason when it gets to 80 or 40 mins even if you are 5m out from opp try line your fly half will kick the ball dead.  Not useful when you are on 3 trys and need the 4th for a bonus point.When players make a clean break through the line they will often stop and pass to a heavily marked player rather than continuing themselves (this has cost me several games/bonus points)  or they will not give the ball when there is a ridiculous overlap that is guarenteed a score.It is very intermittent as to whether a player will try to but the ball down between the sticks after crossing the line unapposed,There also seem to be some really basic back moves that seem to end up with a try.  Especially as some defenders run all sorts of crazy lines that completely miss all the attackers.Finally the back row never break off the scrum.  This ties into the point above, especially during a blindside move as it creates a ridiculous overlap.SO in conclusion this is a very good game and I do enjoy it greatly.However with the bugs/glitches mentioned above I don't believe it is currently worth it's premium price as the bugs glitches do somewhat ruin it, especially when games are tight and you feel like the computer is just cheating you.Edit: So as mentioned above the dev has issued an update that introduces more turnovers etc to the game that does give it a better feel.  There are still of course other bugs present still but the developer is continuing to update the game and is committed.  If you are considering purchasing this game, stop considering and start buying you will get a lot out of it!"

I dont regret buying this but for sure the match engine I dont like the trailer makes it look so much better than it is imo. It takes a while to understand all the controls and to figure out about staff recruitments etc I suggest you hire an agent 1st of all as he saves u lots of money when buying coaches assistants and scouts saves u %25 which i only found out about this after half hour lol so had to restart :(. I could not understand why all my matches was simulating until i realized I had put all my assistants on Auto assign help nd added them to senior squad which meant they did everything and all I had to do was sit back and see the wins pile up 3 in a row undefeated since starting game lol. For me this is awesome with all the database and many decisions you have and so many players in the game and I really like the academy and colts squads to and getting your own coach for the colt squad good to, The only thing I dont like is the match engine so for me will be getting that on auto assign with my assistants and managing that way :). I also like the features such as the best player table in your league, manager acheivements and trophies to view etc :) Will use other Rugby for match engine this will be for huge database and many other aspects I like :)"

Hopefully with support it can become an annual franchise and continue to improve and get better. There is an active development team releasing updates and fixing bugs.

It is rough around the edges and needs improvement in a fair number of areas, but at its heart it is a very good management game, highly enjoyable to play and allows you to manage your favourite rugby team - what more could you really ask for!?  What is good is that the devs seem to be intent on updating the game to fix problems and seem to be paying attention to what players want to see from the game, which is very encouraging.All in all, the game is very promising and is, by far, the best rugby union management game available. I would recommend  buying the game, so long as you don't expect perfection from the get go."
,Recommended,328830,14538565,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,RoryGamesFree,"this is a pretty decent game, it pretty accurately allows you to manage a rugby team from the top national leagues, the interface takes a bit of getting used to but once you do it works pretty well. the database is good as well. resolutions are limited to 1024*768 and 1024*600 at the moment, but I think they may have updates planned to add to this. the pre-game editor is okay but limited to players and their stats. overall it's a pretty good game, most importantly I think it has a lot of potential, future versions or updates could well make this into a passable Rugby answer to the awesome Football Manager series. certainly it's a far far superior game to any other rugby management sim I have played in recent years."

The editor allows you to fix this relatively easily but it's a fairly big investment in time just to get to the point where you can start playing.Game engine is pretty shakey too. The most common penalty seems to be for high tackles and I'm yet to see a penalty given for scrum or breakdown infringements. Play generally won't move on at a breakdown until the scrum half has arrived (unless they're in the ruck) regardless of how long it takes them to get there. Players make clean breaks and then pass to players in worse positions.And the cherry on the cake? It's just crashed with no reason given. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for this if I had the choice at this stage."
,Recommended,328830,18026784,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,J'Hole,"I came across this game when it was still freeware floating around, and it's essentially the same game. I'm certainly not saying go find it for free; I bought this because 1) I like having my games on Steam 2) it's great fun, if basic 3) i want this series to continue and develop, and it needs faith from consumers to get where it needs to beThe UI is clunky, but navigating is simple enough once you know where to find things. Some elements are poorly implemented, for example having two equally competent physios is ignored by the auto-assign function, and you have to manually assign new injured players to either if you want your second physio to be used at all. the simulation is fair, with some issues. fights break out in nearly every game, which doesn't really reflect the modern game. sure it happens, but not nearly every game. It's not too hard a management game, you can see if your offer will be accepted or not, you just need to hit a certain level of agreement (dictated by the level of your club's Agent), so getting in better players isn't too hard.I don't mind the graphics. It's harsh to compare these games to the football managers of gaming, because it's early days. with enough support and dedication, this could be a cracking series, and good for rugby representation in gaming, and that's worth £30 to me"

Forwards don't seem to be very athletic in the game (this does not represent modern rugby).The game has depth in terms of leagues although there are problems with All Black, Wallaby and Bok clubs as all the players who play in Super 15 franchises ONLY play Super Rugby, not in any of the national leagues.  The national leagues from these three countries are not great as these players are missing and made up mediocre players make up the unions.  The unions that play in the Super 15 are totally seperate and this will be an issue if the game is to develop in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, among expats from these countries and among European fans who follow the excellent rugby from these countries.  The unlicensed player names is not the problem, but rather it is the way they have set up these competitions.The game overall is great though and there are lots of things you can control from matches, preparation, training, club infrastructure etc."

The animation of play is very basic and so are the features of the game.HOWEVER...For the price of the game, which compared to other similar styled games, isnt too much... the work that has been put into the database is incredible. Unfortunately some licensing is missing but that can be fixed using the provided editor (wich is another positive) or you can feed off of the hard work of others by clickinghereIf you can look past the low budget graphics the game is really enjoyable to play and is quite addictive as a rugby fan.I bought the game to aid with the development of future ""RUTM"" games and would urge anyone on the fence to buy it even for that sole reason.If noone had supported/bought Football manager when it started we wouldnt have such great games now, and so I hope my investment in the game with the developers will be met with a few updates/upgrades as time goes on... but we will see."

A good game for fans of rugby union and management sims, but a long way off the depth and polish you might hope for if you're used to similar series, such as Football Manager. Worth picking up, but only at a low price."
76561198009084708,Recommended,328830,33292395,Posted: 5 July,all,HidDan,This game is precisely what I've been waiting for.I am a huge fan of rugby and the football manager series and have been on the lookout for a rugby manager game for years. It takes a while to get used to it (I'd recommend reading the userguide) but once you are up to speed it is so very rewarding. A little arcade esque but a hell of a lot of fun. If you've been wondering about trying the game hoping for football manager but for rugby this is such a great place to start and by far the best series on the subject out there. Can't recommend it enough!
