76561197993578600,Recommended,328900,12837722,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,imshandon,I suggest a quick look at the date released and expect it in graphics.....That being said there are just not many games out here even today that seemed to get all the pieces right as this game has. Tough learning curve with an insane attention to historical detail.I do not know how I missed this game all of these years.

It resembles Silent Hunter Sub sim with crew managment although if you wish it can also be a hard-core B-17 simulator, down to starting up each individual engine ( the flight physics aren't the most detailed).One problem is that the controls aren''t the least bit intuitive. Imagine trying to start up a B-17 without even having been into one before.Bottom line, I highly recomend this game to anyone that loves Silent Hunter, B-17's or flight sim fans as this will provide for hours of fun."

,Recommended,328900,12877214,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,Rosso,"Not so much a simulator as a crew managerment a la Silent Hunter, though crew progression feels shallow beyond skill improvement and medals. I found it difficult to be attached to them when they're in the hospital all the time."

A Joystick is vital to fly the plane, is practically impossible to fly with keyboard.It tends to be repetitive after a couple of missions.I recommend this only if you are really into flight simulators."
,Recommended,328900,30500805,Posted: 13 March,all,PFC Henson [29th Ret.],"This game gives you the feeling as no other does. Many people play IL-2 Sturmovik to get the feeling of true dogfights and bombing. While this game is old, it still offers immaculate physics as well as the opportunity to control every aspect of the daily bombers life. Positions go from various gunner positions, the navigator, radio operator, bombardier, and even pilot. It doesn't quite stop there, as one can even take it a step further and control friendly/enemy fighter aircraft operating in the airspace with the B-17. You can step foot down on the runway as a bomber commander, or take it a step higher and take control of the entire bombing squadron. As the squadron leader, you can plan the missions (including loadout, select what bombers, and what point you wish to bomb on the map) and also be part of the mission inside of the leading bomber. This game gives me a feeling of excitement as I wait for my 1000 lb. General purpose bombs spill their way into Brest harbor, ruining enemy trading routes. I'm proud to have this in my library, and can honestly say I've put many hours well spent into this game."

Good news - it still works on modern kit. Mostly.If you're just uncovering this game, it's a bit of a gem but it's a sim, not an arcade game. Don't expect to pick this up in 5 minutes, and for the first few goes have the manual open on your phone or something. You'll need it! There's good tutorials in it but note the tutorials in the game don't tell you what to do. They're supposed to be played alongside the manual.The game itself is big enough to support hundreds of hours of play (note the steam counter only tracks time spent in the launcher dialog). Each mission can consume an hour or so of time, making it quite frustrating when you've fought your way to the target and your bombs miss anyway. It's a sim and that happened in real life too!You can do as much or as little as you like during the missions. Natural instincts are to take over the pilot role (being a flight sim and all), but this is probably one of the harder jobs as you need to manage the engines and the such as well as fly the plane. The co-pilot will assist, but perhaps best left alone until some of the keyboard shortcuts are mastered. I started by just taking over the bomb aiming (go through the tutorials), and a spot of navigation after each time jump. The navigator usually has the plane in slightly the wrong place, so you just have to drag it back once you've worked out where you are.What is currently stopping me from exploring other bits of the game is I'm struggling to get the joystick working. This effectively prevents me from taking up the gunner and pilot positions. Other reviews suggest it could be some conflict with the mouse, so once I've had my fill of navigating and bombing I may investigate this a bit further.In summary, if you like getting involved and want the full sim experience, there's a lot to be had from this game. If you just want to fly around and bomb some stuff for 5 minutes at a time, this isn't the game for you I'm afraid."

,Recommended,328900,29406471,Posted: 21 January,all,KRAMer,"this game to me is still more addicting and fun than a lot of the newly released AAA games on the market, ""Not bad for a 16 year-old game eh?"" i thought to my self and the best thing about this, is that you don't need a high end PC to play this game, hell even an office computer can run this game very well without any problem.Also i would like to say that this is the only game that really enforced the player to read the manual. with out reading it i bet you will even struggle to find out how to start the mission let alone to control everything the B-17 has to offer...this game is a flight sim and crew management all in one although most people remembers this game for it's hardcore realism, the devs still humble enough to give you plenty of options on how difficult your game can be. you can set the difficulty of this game to a certain degree from your 8 year-old son can play this without a sweat to even a huge challange for veterans of this game. this also makes the game not repetitive and boring after for just a few hours playing it and anything can happen at any moment even if you're playing a very same mission with exactly the same objective not all flights are the same.there are 2 game modes in this game, Historical Campaign and Squadron Campaign. In Squadron you can take control a whole squadron of B17's where you plan your own attacks and set your own waypoints towards your target. to be honest i'm not a huge fan of this game mode because it's rather complicated in my opinion, i think the best is the Historical Campaign where you are in charge of a B-17 in some squadron you pick and you can name your plane and pick your own nose art to even name your crew.But i have to remind you that this mode i think is the most rewarding as well as punishing because you only mind about your aircraft and crew, when your crew gained a lot of experience from missions you start to relate to the crew and treat them as real humans, as weird as this may sounds you'll realize this when one or even more than one of them are KIA/taken as POW then they will be replaced by newly fresh recruit rangeing from skilled to know absolutely nothing,  brave to be even a massive coward so my top tip here is to don't use the skip functions too often some times they may be injured in the worst of times (e.g. when you're on your way back crossing the english channel to even sometimes when the airstrip is on sight.)i believe that this game is mainly based on skill, patience and luck (mostly luck) because in this game the scariest thing you will ever encounter is not 109's or even 262's no, but it's actually Flugzeugabwehrkanone commonly known as FLAK ,yes. There is no escape, the best thing you can do is sit tight, tighten up your butt-hole and cross your fingers through the entire FLAK event also bombing runs.anyways i'm rambling in short this game is unique and it stand the test of time better than any game in my opinion and it's unforgiving realisim is what makes this game fun to play but difficult to master. I dare to not count the thousands of hours of playing this game before i created my steam account 2 years ago and even with that thousands of hours experience playing this game i still consider my self a noob.If you are a massive WWII aviation fan and for those of you who interested in Flight Sim, i highly recommend this game, but remember this game have a steep learning curve so you really need to actually learn on how to play this game."
,Recommended,328900,25314648,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,Luftwaffles,"Quite simply, this game is the very embodiment of ""Graphics don't make the game.""   That being said, I think these were stunning graphics for 2000, although I was too young to know or care about video games then.  The gameplay is certainly unable to become outdated, and it's among the best of any game I've ever played. It's like Silent hunter but with planes and without the bugs that we all love ubisoft for."

Totally DestroyedDon't mind that this is an old game (Runs well on W8.1!). Graphics may be dated but there is no sim out there with gameplay as complex as this for a bomber sim."

Thereis quite alot to learn and get used to but beyond that this is quite a good game I got it for $1.74 but I'd consider paying $10 for it hell maybe even alittle more.
76561198115633641,Recommended,328900,24337283,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,RoadMaster,"Highly recommended. Currently running under Win 7 Pro 64 bit. Upgrading to Win 10 today, so I hope it still runs...Great sim. I bought it when it first came out. It DOES have some problems, some of which players made some modes to correct, but I'm not sure if they can be installed on a Steam version.1) The high section of bombers (to your left and above) doesn't seem to really exist. While they do get shot down from flak, fighters ignore them.2) The plexiglass gun turrets are completely dirty and it's almost impossible to see out of them. To be sure, these were cleaned and polished before EVERY fligtht. I'm not sure what the developers were thinking or where they got a dumb idea to do this. But, you can still see well enough to shoot at fighters if you want to manually.Overall, still a great simulator. When you fly on the bomb run over a flak sight and they zero in on you, the sights and sounds of the barrage will absolutely stop your heart!!"

76561198089402095,Recommended,328900,30885139,Posted: 1 April,all,MegaAmpen®@youtube,"A recommended classic.If you pick this one up, consider that it's nearly 17 years (I think) old.While this game won't win any awards for graphics these days, the gameplay is still the only one available to my knowledge that centers around the WW2 B-17 bomber. Consider this being a game about 17 years old though. Graphics for that time was stunning as I remember it, and while it somewhat struggles today, it still holds up enough to be playable.In the game you can control all different crewmembers, as much or as little as you like, so if all you want to do is tag along and when time comes for the bomb run, you'll do that, that works fine. On the other end is taking care of navigation, fighting off bogeys, piloting the aircraft and so forth. So do all you want, or as little as you want, it up to you. If you really want to dig into it, there's also the option to sign up as squadron commander, wich will mean that you'll plot targets and the approach to said targets, pick bombs to use etc.Considering the age, the options available, and the amount of different difficulty settings available, this game really shows what kind of work could be put into a game back then. You can either go with a simpler approach of gameplay, you can do the full simulation, or anything in-between, and enemy/friendly experience can also be adjusted depending on the experience you want. What you'll find out though is that this is a very good game of doing bomber missions over Germany 1943-1945.Of course, a remake would be very nice, but it doesn't look like that will  happend, and no one has even bothered to re-work or mod the current game, other than some nose art and olive drab skins, but bottom line is that this is the only real B-17 game around. So if that's what you want to experience, this is the way you do it."
