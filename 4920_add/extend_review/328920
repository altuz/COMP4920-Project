76561197970711674,Recommended,328920,12834337,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,NightHawk,"Get a joystick.If you can look past the antiquated, cartoonish graphics, this flight sim will provide you with hours of challenging fun. One of my personal all-time favorites, F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0 is the sequel to the ground-breaking 1988 stealth flight simulator F-19 Stealth Fighter. If you like stealth games, this one's for you. Attack Saddam Hussein's palace in the Desert Storm campaign, blow up a submarine pen in the North Cape, take off from Key West, Florida and attack targets in Cuba, storm the Iron Curtain in the Central European campaign, take out (virtual) targets in North Korea, Vietnam, and many other scenarios. Each mission is different; no two missions are alike. Choose between the more realistic Lockheed version, or play Microprose's version (bullets, two more weapons bays, and Sidewinder and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles).The game comes with the manual (for free) in PDF format. The manual will automatically be downloaded into your ""\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\F-117A NightHawk Stealth Fighter"" folder when you download the main game itself. You will need the free Adobe Reader to view it.http://get.adobe.com/readerAlso, the control instructions are included. The file is called F-177A Key Control Card.PDF and is located in the ""Bonus Content"" folder. It is a necessity for people who are unfamiliar with the game's controls.You can use the DosBox DAUM mode for better compatibility with more modern computers. Press Ctrl+V to turn off the shrill engine sound, if it bothers you. Also, to get the game to perform smoother and play faster, go into windowed mode (Alt+Enter) and press Ctrl+F12 several times until it gets up to 15,000 cycles. Make sure you do this before you calibrate your joystick at the game's startup menu. Then you can go back into fullscreen mode (Alt+Enter), if you wish.Buy this game. Seriously, it's worth every penny. Plus, you'll have it on your Steam account forever."

,Recommended,328920,18181963,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Toot Toot (Yeah) Beep Beep,"Strictly superior to it's predecessor, F-19. And that's high praise given how great F-19 was/is.PRO TIPS FROM THE PROS:- Tired of hearing the engine whine? alt + v will let you cycle through different levels of sound. All but the highest leave out engine noises.- On a long boring stretch of flying back to your landing site, with nothing to do in the meantime? Alternate hitting shift + z and shift + x every couple of seconds. Shift + z speeds up time, but only seems to work for a few seconds. shift + x puts you back into normal mode.- The way to earn the big points is on Cold War, not Conventional War. You make more points for flying around unseen than you ever could from blowing stuff up- If your game is running really choppily and your controls suck, it's not the game. What you're experiencing is lag. ""Lag? This game? On my modern machine? How could that be?"" Well, DOSBox isn't emulating a modern machine. Throw some more cycles it's way with ctrl f12. Somewhere in the 15000 cycles range will cure all your problems (default is 9000)More controls here:http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=603"

The graphics are 20+ years old, for sure..but the gameplay!If you have ANY interest in the genre, treat yourself to this game! It also has the advantage over the Good Old Games version in that the look up copy protection is disabled. This was a pain in the but..as you had to correctly identify an airplane from the manual...and this meant you had to print out the manual, and they hope the quality of the print was good enough to tell the planes apart!I highly recommend this game. I have finished this, start to finish, three times of 99 missions each."
,Recommended,328920,15392511,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,SkUnimatrix,"This game was a re-release of F-19 Stealth Fighter after the world learned of the real F-117A.  Those of us who remember F-19,  you can select the ""MicroProse F-117A"" and it's just like flying the old F-19 with the same air-to-air capabilties.  This was the DCS of its day.  With CH Control Manager my Fighterstick worked like a charm.  Ironically 25 years ago I was using either a CH Mach III joystick or the original CH Flightstick.It's simplestic by today's standards, but I spent a lot of hours playing F-19 and later F-117 as a kid."
76561198027102199,Recommended,328920,13069820,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,Incredible General,"If you are experiencing crashes with this game, load through Steam instead of your desktop shortcut and select ""Play F117A in DOSBox Daum"". This should clear up your problems.Sid Meier has always made amazing games in any genre he turns his hand to, and this was a great  simulator in it's day. Like all early 3D games, superficially it hasn't aged well, but the gameplay is still enjoyable today. Someone needs to do a modern remake with improved graphics and physics, and a more in-depth & cinematic career mode (but retaining the random mission generator).Basically an expanded version of F-19 with more maps, better presentation and the choice of using a more realistic craft, it's a totally unique experience as you weave low and slow through the enemy's radar coverage on the way to photograph/destroy your objectives. Great stuff, if you can remember the keyboard controls - print out the reference sheet that comes with the game!"

,Recommended,328920,19911814,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,Iridium,"Ok, so yes, this was a complete nostalgia-buy for me. But after having the time to get used to the controls again, I do remember why I love it: this was probably the earliest ""serious"" combat ""flight sim"" I ever played. A friend and I played this on his dad's computer, spending hours trying to figure out how best to play it. And yeah, for all its modern simplicity, it still feels good to be able to run randomly generated missions, blow up a few SAM installations, and somehow land in all its sub-480p goodness.I don't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have that nostalgia factor, but then, those people probably wouldn't buy it. It is, for folks of my generation, a classic.Oh, and tip: Don't pick the Adlib setting in the sound card stuff, seems to crash constantly. Pick Roland. Slightly less good but it's all so bad you never notice anyway."
76561198062607762,Recommended,328920,31031059,Posted: 8 April,all,killerx3012,I remember playing this on the Amiga 2000 back in the 1990. When my dad recieved it from SH as a beta tester. It was well thought out only a few bugs like using machine guns and blowing up a building 30 miles away.But I give this a 9/10.
76561198025865405,Not Recommended,328920,12755221,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,deadSnowman,"I remember playing this game on a probook when I was little and was pretty fun.  It's a bundled DOS game, so keep in mind the graphics and controls are going to look pretty dated.  It's also a flight simulator, so don't expect an arcade feel with lots of action.  Missions involve avoiding raidar detection, using defenses to avoid getting shot, bombing a site, and escaping.  Basically, it's not for everyone, but still pretty good.Missions are pretty straight forward, but the controls are a bit confusing at first, so here's some stuff to start off with:Taking off:Adjust thust with - and =pull up landing gear with 6 and open flaps with 7Flyling:use numpad or arrow keys (I don't think there is a way to yaw though)toggle autopilot with 7Weapons:cycle through missles with space, open the bay with 8, and fire with enterfire guns with backspaceDefenses:1 - 5 are chaffs, flairs, decoys and jammingDisplay Controls:F keysPause and QuitAlt+P and Alt+QThere is also a Key Control Card pdf in the Bonus Content folder located in the Steam directory that is pretty handy.EDIT:I attempted the first mission several times and the game kept crashing before I could land to complete the mission.  I'm not sure if the game is broken under DOSBox, or if there is some issue running it under Linux.  Good game, but it looks like it's unplayable for me (and it looks like some others as well).  I'm going to have to unreccomend this until I find a solution."

F-117 was a game that sat at the perfect spot between game and simulation, and even though I love my study sims I really wish there where more games like this today. Excellet game!I also have to mention the guys behind DosBox for the great job they are doing with running these old games!"

Flight dynamics are not the best (like doing turns with 90+ degree roll), lack of yaw and somewhat erratic stall. But overall for a game from 1991, this is really good.Landings are challenging - not only because runways (especially carriers) are a pixelated mess and really short. On the bright side braking distance is almost zero, there are no bounces and vertical velocity is pretty forgiving even on max realism."

I can run the abanware f19 in a dos box my self and have more luck. I would not recommend this. This is a poor implentation to say the least. I would like my money back.

There isn't too much more that can be said about a game that Computer Gaming World gave 4 stars out of 5. Most players today will be turned off by the dated graphics. However, taking a few moments to read the PDF manual that Retroism gives you with your purchase along with some other Easter Eggs, you will note that this game is a challenging flight sim that requires you to constantly focus on your keyboard as well as the state of the aircraft. Focusing simoultaneously on the speed, altitude, target among many other things makes this game intrigeuing and better than many games that have come out after it. If you're snowed in this weekend, definately buy this game!"
