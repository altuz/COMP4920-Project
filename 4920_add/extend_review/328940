76561198039394829,Not Recommended,328940,14686080,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Varulf,"This game is broken. A couple times I'd die and then not be able to progress through the game because certain ledges require you to be at least a teen deer before you can reach them. Sometimes very small platforms are obscured by objects in the foreground, making it very hard to land the jump and not die immediately.Also I got stuck under the turtle boss TWICE and couldn't get out because he just sits on top of you. Died of hunger. The AI is dumb as all hell, the dash costs too much mana and is hard to control, dashing near spikes is not recommended.Once you're an adult, the game becomes almost too easy, but if you die and turn back into a baby deer because you ran out of those extra life things, you're screwed, buddy. You can't jump or hit for crap as a baby and by that point all the enemies are meant for the adult deer.This is not good game design!Aside from all that, the game looks gorgeous and the music is good. The platforming is fun when it's not game-breaking and infuriating, which is a minority of the time. I want to like this game, please, fix it!"

Relaxing music!*BUT WAIT...!Any positive traits that could possibly be bestowed on this game have the misfortune of being attatched to a design that is pretty baffling if I am being totally honest.  And I dont write negative reviews.  I rarely have a reason to complain, if at all.Well good job then Deer God.  I can't, not, talk about you.So here is what you can expect to be doing in Deer God:- Jumping.  No like, endlessly harrasing  your gamepad's A button to get over obstacles that you eventually learn to do with your eyes closed.  That is, after seeing them for the 7,000th time.- Retracing your steps through the same handful of endlessly repeating maps, just waiting to come across an NPC with more than fairly dissapointing dialogue.- Do a fetch quest.  For nearly every NPC.  The items or actions for which may be located 10 feet away from them.  Don't have the item they need?  Tough!  You'll be seeing them as you run past them again and again within the next 30 seconds as the game decides to spawn in the same encounter again and again instead of one of the other current, applicable ones.- Mate with female deer.  Which produces an offspring that will follow you, because?  Then either Alpha, or Beta occurs: A:  It gets stuck shortly after being born, or B: Immediately jumps into the nearest hole with spikes in it.- Eating over and over and over and over again.  If eating in Minecraft was ever an annoyance, Deer God cranks it beyond levels we have not even begun to fathom.- And Basically evading every element of danger with ease.  Because by the time they know you are there, they are either STUCK or the programming is removing them to save resources after you leave it 50 yards to the west.There is another point worth mentioning.  The game wants to think that it is about survival, thus it only gives you one life total for each adventure.  However, due to the IMMENSE non-difficulty of the game and thanks to an overwhelming abundence of resurrection items, it is never really a danger.  Ever.  Unless of course one of the resurrection items - which must be reactivated from inventory after every demise no matter how many you have - puts you into a death loop, whereby you spawn back on top of the same thing that killed you  -- to die again and restart the adventure from the absolute beginning.  Thus is the only real danger in the game.The different levels that this title might work on are maybe worth a 25% investment.  The other 75%... just doesnt work.  And with so little time left in beta before release, it is very unlikely that this game becomes interesting by then.Deer God... I am so sorry.  I wanted to like you.  :("
,Recommended,328940,13214496,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,☆Punchy☆,"So far this game has been enjoyable, but to be honest there are some features (or issues) that have made gameplay irritating, I'll start off with the good bits- the pixal art, the music and the story. The scenery is gorgeous, it's been a long time since I've played a game that put this much thought into a pixel art game. The music and the sound effects are very good, there's been a pretty decent mix of relaxing music and more complex/energetic tunes. And the story has been entertaining, who wouldn't love to play a deer? So far, I have enjoyed the story but with just 2 hours of gameplay I haven't made much progress.As far as complaints go, mine aren't very harsh. Gameplay with the controller is good - intuitive and fluid. Later, I played with a keyboard and mouse for awhile and the controls were awful (weird key assignments and awkward movements). A menu screen to change key assignments would be very helpful. My other chief complaint is the learning system, there is essentially no guidance for this game at all. Attibutes menus and rules are not explained, I was 40 minutes into the game before I realized you could assign fireballs to the antlers. Just a "" press Y to open attributes menu"" would have been nice.Also,the permadeath, I hate it. I'm not hardcore enough for permadeath so the ability to save would be an improvement. I'd rather see permadeath as a hardcore setting instead of the default. But you probably shouldn't listen to me, I'm too old to be a gamer  nowadays. I better stop typing and get my fish oil and prune juice for the day."

Its extremely relaxing and lovely to look at- a perfect title to unwind with.Its AI is rather ignorant and all battles amount to ""charge- jump over their charge- charge the other way- jump over their charge- ETC"" so theyre pretty simple.Quests are nonsensical (a man asks you to recruit members into his church? Wuh...?? Oh, theyre literally right outside the door, cool) and require little to zero thought, which makes this even more of a title to relax to.Theres supposed to be some message about reincarnation or killing nature or something, but I never really ""got it"" (because aside from the intro screens and some asinine quests theres no real story progression).If you treat it like the ""laser light show"" that it is- AKA ""kick back, let your brain go into neutral and look at the pretty things""- you may enjoy this one.Otherwise, if youre looking for ""legit"" platforming, story, quests or enemies, well....this unfortunately doesnt have much of any. Keep running right til the game ends.As a member of the Cervine blood, I really wanted to like this game more than I did. It had lots of potential. Optimally, this shouldve been a ""Metroidvania"" type of game- a maze which you couldnt progress through without ""X"" skill.Unfortunately, as a member of the gaming community since the mid 80's, Id suggest you pass on this one unless you really, really like deer or those type of quiet, pretty games that ultimately put you to sleep.I wish Steam would allow a ""NEUTRAL"" recommendation, cuz I honestly cant approve or disapprove, depending on how you take the title. Youve heard what I have to say about it at least!"

Check out my review in video form herePros:_Beautiful: I don't usually care much for artistic design, but goddamn this game looks good. The pixel art is well made with lots of details in both the environment and the characters. Colorful, too, with the ambient lighting and mood changing with the time of day. In short, it's purdy._Great soundtrack: Don't know what else to say here. The music is good._Interesting concept: You play as a deer hunter reincarnated as a deer by the deer god. Then you go and eat food to grow into a big deer then have deer babies. If you die, you get reincarnated as one of your babies. What I'm trying to say is the game is weird in the best posible way._Tight control: the game feels great, jumping is nice and solid, and attacking is impactful.Cons?_It's... boring: Here's the part where the discussion happens for this game, or at least I hope. Mechanically speaking, this game is boring. You just run right, then run right some more. Tired of running right? Keep running right, then, until you're not tired of running right anymore. There's an inventory system here that doesn't do much, and a quest system that's pretty bare-boned.But does that matter?Now that's the million dollars question, isn't it? I feel a lot about this game the way I feel about Sunless Sea. In term of minute-to-minute gameplay, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. There's no game here. But somehow I don't feel like it's a bad game. I find myself strangely attached to it. For such a boring non-game game, it's... good. it's immersive, beautiful, and interesting.Overall, you'd like this game if:_You like pretty game with good music._You like tight jumping control with lots of platforming. Cuz this game has tons._You want to fulfill your lifelong dream of being a deer. Majestic creatures.Is it worth $15? I think from the first glance at the game, you already know this answer. If you the type of person that would like this game, then you're already at the checkout screen. If you're a more mechanic-minded person, however, this won't be the game for you. But for the cost of 5 cups of coffee, you might find yourself surprised at how much you like it. I certainly did.Shameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that.

I stupidly bought it because of the visual design and the soundtrack but £11 is not worth a game that only consists of jumping and running right with minimal shoddy combat.They've sold it on having some sort of profound spiritual content in the story but the story barely exists. You're a hunter that has shot a baby deer and is turned into one to find redemption, you'd hope there was some environmental meaning or something about the barbarism of recreational hunting but no theres nothing, just simplistic platforming and holding the right directional arrow. You dont even need to engage in combat really.Don't waste your money on this game."

However, if you are looking not for sightseeing, but an actual game to play, you'll have to look elsewhere. Deer God is a game about running right, jumping over spikes and wondering what is going on and what are you supposed to do. Gameplay literally falls apart. You get attacked by foxes and skunks, but can easily outrun any enemies. There are NPCs with rudimentary quests like ""please bring my children a nut from that barrel"". Sometimes you run across a primitive puzzle and get rewarded with a power like fireball, which you have no enemies to use on. Sometimes you run across bosses with no reason to fight them. The game is a terrible mess pretending to be a work of art. Avoid it."

What I expected was a metrovania game where you're a deer.  What I got was -Super Run to The Right The Game-. Never before have I been so disappointed by running to the right for 2.7 hours.   Fortuntely, the game was short and sweet.  I beat it in about 2.7 hours and will never return to play it again.On the positive, it looks like someone put a lot of heart into this game and I respect that.  The game has some beautiful areas and an easy listening soundtrack.  If you're looking for a casual, peaceful gaming experience and don't mind the repetitive nature of runnig to the right for a few hours, this game is for you.

I was also unable to progress due to some tortoise NPCs not spawning?The map seems to repeat itself until you complete your 'task', and kind of assumes I know what I'm doing, with no option to review quests or even controls.Pretty much all I am doing is running right and jumping, and trying not to die, but also trying not to get tripped up by glitches.

,Not Recommended,328940,31474862,Posted: 30 April,all,N'wah,"TDG might not be early access anymore, but it sure doesn't feel like a finished product.The music is great and atmospheric, and of course the world looks as stunning in-game as it does in the screenshots - but that's about the only positive feedback I can give. After a while it feels like you're just running in circles while waiting for the game to start being fun.You start out by watching a scene that implies there’s going to be a story, and it actually sounds like a good one to begin with; You’re a man reborn as a deer as punishment for hunting them, and you have to redeem yourself by aiding both deer and men in various ways.It becomes clear after playing for a little while that 99% of what you'll be doing is just running through the same 4-5 or so areas on repeat, double-jumping, headbutting critters, and solving puzzles that require no thinking or effort. Bosses don’t make sense in any way either, as there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to defeat them (even as an adult buck that can shoot fireballs and use temporary invulnerability). Die too many times and you'll respawn at the beginning as a baby (assuming you’ve been playing the game as intended), and you have to repeat every tedious action all over again.Being reincarnated is the whole point of the game, but it all feels way too grindy for it to actually be enjoyable. The karma system is fairly interesting, but will probably screw you over in the dumbest ways. I killed a fellow deer and turned into a fox after dying later on, and ultimately got stuck between two cliffs since you can only double-jump as a deer. Accidentally killed some other non-hostile animal, and turned into a snake that fell off the map and didn’t die (I just kept falling until I closed the game).The Deer God is a cutesy game with a cool concept that will punish you as promised, but mostly because of the *bad* gameplay, and the fact that it feels buggy and hollow. It’s aggressively dull and poorly executed, unfortunately."

If you do want to play it, you should probably wait until there's a really good sale, instead of saying, ""Oh that sounds neat,"" and purchasing it at a smaller discount like I did.That said, I don't hate it or I wouldn't have played it for so many hours.  I just believe that until it is more polished, and probably until there is more content available, you're better off saving your money or spending it on something else.  It feels very ""beta.""  Hopefully it isn't, and the developers will polish it more.Pros:-Lovely graphics.  Animations are quite nice too.-Relaxing soundtrack.-Interesting concept.  You're a deer!  Now survive predators, hunters, random inexplicable spike traps, and angry porcupines.Cons:- Finicky controls when selecting items/powers (I'm using a controller, as it has been said it plays best with a controller)= Glitchy.  Some quests get stuck; some puzzles to acquire powers (specifically, the ice puzzle) may only generate very rarely if at all.-Not optimized.  This computer plays Dragon Age: Inquisition smoothly on maximum graphics settings.  The Deer God, on the other hand, skips frames, freezes, stalls, stutters, and slows down from time to time,  and I am not convinced it's only when the game is generating new terrain.-There's stuff that's supposed to be in the game that I can't find.  At all.  Resurrect as a different animal:  that's in the achievements.  Where do you do this?  How do you do this?  The closest I've come is being turned into a toad by the witch.  Is it a feature that hasn't been added yet?  Something that just never generated within my game?  I have no idea.Now, as far as story goes, and text?  It's very cheesy and includes a poorly written poem-prophecy, but I'm going to assume that you're not playing a simple retro-styled platformer for its deep dialogue and complex plot.  Will it make you evaluate your religion?  Maybe, but more likely not.The game isn't really that deep, and the message it sends seems to mostly be ""Hunters are wicked people.""  Since it's a game I don't take that too seriously, but if you strongly disagree with that sentiment and might be offended by it, you might want to pass this game by.Long review short, I think the game could be better than it is, but even then I don't expect any serious depth to it, either plotwise or philosophically.I may revisit it again at a later date after it's updated a time or three, and give it a fresh review at that point. I believe it has great potential, but I'd like to see it optimized, see the controls in the inventory/power screen be a little less sensitive, and hopefully see more features added in and the glitches mostly ironed out."

,Not Recommended,328940,15255042,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Arietide,"This review may contain spoilers. The warning has been given.I've been watching this game since the Kickstarter, so I feel like I should leave a review for this game. The concept as presented then really had me interested. Playing as a sort of nature entity taken form as a deer? Philosophical and metaphysical questionings? Those pretty graphics? Hell yes! I didn't help funding it back then because with all the scams going on I'm always really wary of crowdfunding, but around a year later I found out it was already available on Steam, so I bought it Early Access. It was the 0.2 Beta.Now that the game is out of Early Access and in its version 1.0, can I say that it delivered what it promised back on the Kickstarter? Absolutely not. Well, the graphics indeed are pretty if your video card can handle them, but let's go point by point:- Progress in the game is made by traversing through randomly generated biomes where you kill the fauna (whether they're aggressive or not), the hunters, complete some quests and solve some puzzles. And being honest? That gets old and predictable really fast. The quests poise no challenge, offer no variation, and only take longer to solve because they're artificially lengthened by the randomly generated biome blocks. It comes to a point where you can even identify said blocks, because the game seems fond of generating 3 or 4 of the same in a row. And the puzzles? There should be a logic to their showing up in game, but there are so many bugs (more on that later) that if you manage to find them all it's by sheer luck.- The claim that the game would make you question your beliefs is pretentious at best. It only tackles the subject of religious in a very superficial way, and I can't imagine it affecting even the most sheltered christian types. There is of course an environmental overtone in the game, but it's handled with the subtlety of a Captain Planet episode (you remember those, right?), and even with that taken into consideration there are a lot of incoherent things about it. For starters, what is it that makes it okay to kill a porcupine but not an otter?  What is it about spiders and beetles that poises a threat to a deer that can easily trample them? Why is it that you have to help people but not other animals (that aren't deer)?- Bugs. So many bugs. The most bugged feature is no doubt the karma system through which supposedly you gain new abilities, by solving the aforementioned puzzles. It didn't seem bugged when I played it in 0.2, but from 0.5 onwards either you get no puzzles at all to solve after some point, or the puzzles appear when they shouldn't and then they don't anymore. None of that has been solved as of 1.0 when the game got out of Early Access, and the devs seem to have abandoned the discussion forums completely after that, too.As it is now, I don't recommend paying for this game at all, as it's clearly an incomplete game with such glaring bugs still present. Honestly, the replayability factor for me is summed up in ""has this bug been fixed already?"" and it's frustrating to try and get all features of the game when you keep encountering the same problems keeping you from achieving completion. I don't recommend paying either if you prefer challenging games, or less linear games, since it gets very predictable after the first play through and there is literally no way to get sidetracked in this game."

I'm not usually much for pixel art styles- they begin to feel overdone and lazy after a certain point- but The Deer God manages to impress with its graphics.That said, the game can at times feel poorly thought out, even sloppy, and definitely unfinished. There are a great number of glitches, nonsensical puzzles, or dead-end situations that force the player to wait several minutes to starve, respawn, and try again, an unwelcome interruption to otherwise fast-paced gameplay. The story, voice acting, and dialogue also leave much to be desired. No updates have been made to the game to address technical issues in over a year, which is unfortunate.That said, it is fun in the moment, when you're leaping between platforms with cervid grace, solving puzzles to gain magical powers, or battling hostile creatures in breathtaking environments. My personal advice would be to wait for a sale and pick it up for cheaper; a full price for a game that could hardly be considered complete isn't reasonable, in my opinion, but it's an experience worth having if it's available to you."

There's no clear objective of how you win and turn back into a human, and when you die you either become a baby deer again or get chucked back into the title screen. Over all, entertain and somewhat challenging, but the novelty fo this wears off quickly if you don't knwo what you're doing right away."

Think of it as a procedurally generated Echo The Dolphin, only with deer (doesn't that sound fantastic? Here it is) instead of marine mammals. You move about the world, gain powers and abilities, try to stay alive, try to gain new lives through mating - and try to keep your replacement incarnations alive despite the fact they try to follow you around - and work to gain power in the world.You will die a lot, initially, until you gain some mastery, but this game is worth the effort to learn it. Initially, you can only run and jump and eat and mate. But you are no ordinary deer, you are a magical deer on a misson of redemption, and before long you will possess the powers of... a god. A deer god.This is one of those rare, special, precious games you should jump on and get immediately. This is a 'Wow!' sort of game,  the kind of one-in-a-million wonderments that there are far too few of. This game is a work of passion and love, and it shows in every astonishingly crafted pixel... and voxel.You will learn how to move through the forest as a primal deer Lord Of All. You will also learn that foxes, porcupines, and men with guns are jerks. Seriously, get off me you damn fox. Leave my babies alone. Dammit.Want to do Dragon Ball Z fireballs from your antlers? Well, get your hooves on. Sunch power won't come easily, and you will get your flanks chewed up more than once... but it will come.Recommended!"

You're given an excellent framework for a story, but nothing else, there's no substance to it. The story seems to just be a reason for why you turn into a deer, because after that it hardly gets mentioned in any sort of depth. It gets very repetitive very quickly, and you will get bored after the novelty wears off.It's also incredibly easy to fall off the map. This is the games other biggest issue aside from the lack of story/gameplay/substance in general. Once you fall off the map, you are stuck there. You can jump, and you can move, and if you jump high enough you might even see your little pixel deer pop his head up on the bottom of the screen - but there is no way that i have found to get yourself back up to the terrain.To put it simply, this game is not finished. This game is nowhere near finished. The developer seems to have just lost interest and decided to lazily say it's done so they don't have to bother with it anymore.I genuinely had high hopes for this game, the story setup seemed interesting and the graphics were beautiful and unique, but it is not worth the 16.99CAD.

Oh boy.Let's see, this is a game where you keep walking right over and over again until the game decides to stop padding itself and give you something to advance its ""plot""; there is little to no challenge, as there is no reason for you to fight other animals, unless you're specifically trying to fill up your karma meter one way or another.The game has several puzzles, most of which are extremely finicky - such as requiring you to hit a rock in a very specific place or it won't break and you have no indication, you just have to keep doing it until you hit the right spot - or outright buggy - such as a lightning puzzle where you must get rid of all that stands on a couple of light pilars, except the puzzle may or may not be solved when you do it right.I don't see why is there an item system beyond some feeble attempt to add more depth to the game, as the combat would otherwise be incredibly dull otherwise, since the AI is simplistic, your charging headbutt does a pitiful amount of damage and any other power you get is not very useful in most combat situations. This AI also means every time you have a child, it will probably throw itself into a spike pit, in the same manner of most enemies you'll find on your way.The game isn't also about exploring nor requires complicated platforming - you get a double jump very early on and one of the first things the game asks you to do is take a leap of faith without double jumping, except there's no indication about where you must do so. I understand that the game is procedurally generated, but I don't see why must I trek along a forest, a desert and some rocky cliffs to get shown a checkpoint and then travel through some snowy area, some plains and then a different forest for the game to show me an empty cabin and then go through several areas again until I find someone who tells me I must find someone else, also at least five areas away.In short, this is a terrible ""game"" where you do a chain of fetch quests while holding right forever."

There is always a way out though, but since it's procedural you never know when you will get the chance to finish your tasks (example: as a baby I had to fight the turle, I basically escaped because it was impossible to fight and I didn't find it again until half an hour later, when I was luckily an adult again and I could fight it)Apart from the game balancing (I always like a challenge) the game is pretty good, but if you're a whining ♥♥♥♥♥ you probably won't like the game."

From choices made in the game (or should I say actions) you may be punished or rewarded after you have died.To be a deer (or anything else) in existence is represented by everytings interconneection in this game, when everything has some sort of meaning. Okay maybe the frogs jumping up and down on the same spot are really pointless but in the case with the deer you realize that you are just that. A deer. Just as the hunter, just is a hunter. It is rather hard to explain but I found this game really relaxing and nice.I could go on for hours what the game has to it that really makes it wonderful but in short, it is a game where your thoughts may relax and your mind can just take in the wonderful scenery with the soothing soundtrack accompinied by the beat of deer-hoves on the earthy ground."

The final boss and the ending felt very anti-climantic. If there ever comes a sequel to this I'd really would love to have much more content as well as perhaps a far better story to interact in. I would wait for a sale though if you'd like to give this a try.

The procedural worlds are done brilliantly with all the ambient effects coming together well to produce some visually impressive set pieces. The core gameplay is rather repetitive and predictable after a short time and whilst the puzzles break it up a bit towards the end there's simply not enough there to break up the monotony. Credit where credit is due though for The Deer God getting out of Early Access as quickly as it did, even if it came with some rough edges.

When I installed it recently to play again, I was excited to finally play it and get some achievements along the way.Turns out the game has pretty much no point to playing it, it's essentially a big running right simulator. The game visually is nice, which is probably the only good part about it at this point.While playing I found many bugs and issues that annoyed me. Achievements do not unlock, certain enemies do not die. Puzzles are supposed to be puzzling of course, but with many it is not immediately clear what you need to do to solve it, and some just seem like they cannot be solved. On top of some enemies not dying when they should, some aren't exactly worth your time to kill, as the combat system in the game leaves a lot to be desired.Looking through the community hub of this game, it seemed to be pretty much dead. Nothing really going on with The Deer God anymore.I was really looking forward to playing this game, but I guess a better time would have been back in 2015 when I'd originally purchased the game when the developers where actively working on it. :("

The artwork is very wimsical and delightful to see and the music is really very nice and pleasent. The game play is simple.One thing I like is that it is, in my view, very family friendly. Some very small children, though, may have difficulties at certain times because some friendly animals do die from traps or bad falls, now and then, when they follow your character. But for any real blood or gore, in this game, is essentially non-existant.The story is strait forward. You are Ted Nugent out to shoot a deer and you get ambused by wolfs and end up before a Deer God who gives you a chance to redeem yourself as a woodland creature. Namely a deer. (Forget the Ted Nugent thing ... was just joking! Your more of the usual redneck hunter.) You start off as a faun then progress to different levels of deer maturity. You encounter different animals, both of a friendly nature or of an aggressive one. The aggressive ones you have to battle and sometimes you help other woodland creatures in that battle. You, also, get to pair up with does and when the heart symbol above the doe becomes full, you produce a little faun. I kind of thought it was cute.There are certain puzzles you  have to figure out. Not too hard, but they are fun and can produce offensive and defensive abilities to fight the aggressive animals.Saves in the game come in different types. One is cabins, others are pillars or stone ornaments. Other times they are big stone deer stags that save the game after you figure out the puzzle to activate it.I read in some negative reviews that if you die, you come back as a faun, again. True, but any of the offensive and defensive powers and abilities you've gained you still have, even if you're a faun again. So, you can still beat the more powerful creatures with those abilities.All in all, I think that this is a very well done game. It is pleasent, enjoyable and entertaining."

I'll be first to admit that maybe I lost interest too quickly and missed hints that only a bit more monotony had to be endured before things got more interesting.To be fair, this game is unfinished, so my loss of interest should not be seen as too big of a knock against the game.Furthermore, even considering that I've not played this game since its most recent update, given how beautiful the game is and how nice it is to spend time with, the $11 that I paid for it seems plenty fair(I am by no means someone who has much money to spare, but considering all, the price paid is a trivial sum for how nice this game is)."

It seems I had to rush through everything to JUST be able to jump on a turtle before it jumped off the cliff and left me, again, stuck in front of these huge cliffs. Even as an adult deer I can't jump that. And that is the WORST part about this game, is that it's not safe.

It's mostly about immersion. I'd rate it 3.75 / 5.Long version: The Deer God is an immersive platformer with heavy emphasis on exploration and immersion. The gameplay does feature combat, as well, albeit it's nothing too complicated. The controls can be described as well-responsive and sharp. The music and sound design are good. The sceneries are simply beautiful and the day-night cycle gives the world a nice atmosphere and makes it that much more alive. The pixel-art style works fine and the general look of the game is nice, with rain, light, moonshine and wind all affecting how the world looks. The world is procedurally generated, which ensures that each new adventure feels different from the previous one.While the game excels at creating a stunningly good atmosphere, it does sadly fall a little bit short in the department of the quest variety and some of the puzzles appeared to be slightly buggy, although I personally didn't experience any game-breaking glitches. The questing in The Deer God is quite straight-forward, and can be described as Fetch Item A from Person X and bring it to Person Y or Location Z. The combat can get tedious after a while (but then again, we are playing as a deer; I wouldn't expect to do much fighting with such an animal in the first place, emphasis on the word ""much""). One may avoid combat *almost* entirely if one so chooses, which opens a nice choice of path for pacifists and speedrunners (do notice, however, that there are boss fights that are required to be completed in order to progress the story).The abilities and items that can be found throughout the game add a nice variety to the otherwise slightly repeating gameplay. Some of the abilities do fall a bit on the weak side, while others appear to be a little bit overpowered. The inventory system could be better, since you can only have 6 items/abilities assigned to your hotkeys at any given moment. Fortunately, however, the game doesn't require insane APM spam nor lightning-fast inventory management. The game is especially tough in the beginning, but gets easier towards the end.All in all, The Deer God is an immersive platformer more than anything else, with a short and sweet story behind itself. Personally for me, the price for the game was definitely worth the ~5 hours it took to complete it. Even after 5 hours, there are still about half of the achievements remaining, so in order to experience the whole game one may expect from 4 to 7 hours of game-time, depending on playstyle and procedural map generation. Final score: 3.75 / 5."
,Recommended,328940,25393186,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,punkonjunk,"Honestly, I have trouble recommending deer god.I paid very little for it, 2-5 dollars on sale, having remembered seeing the kickstarter. It took me some months to get to it, and I was amazed to see it was the exact same game I'd watched a play of in alpha... very, very little changed, and the game is still about 2 hours long. I have 2.8 hours of playtime now because it took me nearly an hour to sort out the controller bugs. (it may not work with xbox one controllers - keep that in mind!)The game's terrain is procedurally generated. In some games, procgen adds to the mystery, the unknown, the survival in the middle of nowhere, etc. In games like rogue legacy, it's baked into the story, and well done, but it has one HUGE flaw - it makes the level design crappy, even the absolute most brilliant examples of procgen minecraft, diablo, you'd swear it was hand made - in diablo's case, it's because it is, it's hand made stage chunks shoved together, much like rogue legacy is. In minecraft's case, if you've spent a lot of time you know you can get something much, much more amazing by playing with the presets, and repeatedly recreating worlds with the same presets until you get something you really like... but even without, minecraft follows a huge list of rigorous, special rules surrounding it's procgen so it makes sense and is fun.The Deer God suffers from procgen as a symptom of popular things in indie games. Considering that most players are going to play this game once, maybe twice for both endings, it would have done well to cancel the bizarre looping world segments and instead focus on a hand designed, challenging world, especially considering 80% of this game is literally ""run to the right.""Double jump isn't used as a content lock, as the pretty much isn't any basic lock and key besides advancing on rails - find someone who needs help, fetch something or do something, go right some more... Which is hugely disappointing considering how tight the platforming and combat is, which is hard to see through the continuous random pitfalls that spawn constantly and everywhere, often identical to otherwise safe pits.This game is buggy with some controllers and very short. There isn't much content, and the procgen is a joke. I get the feeling the dev wants everyone to be vegan. (I thought I should play it because I was eating venison burgers, then after, I ate more venison) There are a massive number of criticisms for this game.That said though, all this ranting - most of it is targeted at the price-point and kickstarter success vs delivery of a product worth it's funding. For 5ish bucks this game is pretty excellent, and you might even be able to find it for that or less on itchier or humbler retailers.There are a lot of positives - the combat and the platforming are pretty excellent, just not really... realized, even in the bosses, who's AI is basically IF moving: stop and hurt, then MOVE, else move. (I was trying not to be critical for a minute but I can't help it.)It's also beautiful. It's an excellent combination of modern 3d lighting and effects over a wonderfully drawn and realized pixel art style. I would rarely, if ever recommend a game for it's graphics, but this game is amazingly good looking if you love pixel art, especially it's evolution in modern games - this game really, really looks great. This game makes me want to dump game maker studio and start learning unity. It's a beautiful game.If you like platformers and ambiently peaceful games, this is a lot of fun, but a quick play, especially if you can find it on sale. I truly wish the developer would have continued to expand the game because it's the bones of a really amazing early access game that just suddenly... was released for 15 bucks. Which is nuts."
