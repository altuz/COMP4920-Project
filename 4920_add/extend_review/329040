It is a grid based dungeon crawler with real time combat and runic spell casting. The leveling system is similar to Dungeon Master system, that means by casting spells you lvl up sorcery, by using melee weapons you lvl up fighting skills. So a fighter can be trained to become a great wizard/healer as well.The game is full of clever puzzles and riddles. It does not pull you by the hand, but for me it is a plus.The graphics are nice, and the controls have improved after the new patch.The game has a great potential, and I am looking forward to the full realease version of the game. So far only a town and a temple with 4 levels is accessible.This game is a must have for every old school RPG fan like myself"

76561197971244977,Recommended,329040,30279985,Posted: 2 March,all,gginos,"After several hours of frustrating play, I felt that there was very little to this game.  It seemed just too primitive, with no quest journal, virtually no guidance and almost no content.  I refused to quit though and have finally come to appreciate that it is indeed a retro game that is designed to thwart the player who does not listen closely for the click of a pressure plate, does not scan a wall carefully for signs of a button or something unusual about its state (compared to an ""ordinary"" wall), does not read notes and signs very carefully, pausing to think about what they might mean and keeping them in mind and he moves through the dungeon.  You cannot rush through this game.  You must literally crawl through the dungeon listening, watching and thinking all the time or else you will be frustrated as you fail to find out how to open a door or move to another level or find a treasure that makes the difference between your living or dying.  You must collect food and water and refresh your supplies or you will find yourself in trouble.  If you want an easy game, a game that you can cheat in and speed through, this game is not for you.  If, however, you miss the good old days of immersive dugeon crawlers, this promises to be a beaut.  It is a bit short, however, at least so far, on the number and intelligence of monsters encountered and the developers need to beef that up some."

If you enjoyed these games (or older ones such as Dungeon Master), you can't be wrong with this one. There is a story, graphics are very nice, level design is good (so far).

The graphics with all the lighting effects in the temple (which is the main part) are very very good.  It reminded me of dungeon master on my old amiga ,30 years ago. The difficulty of the puzzles is just right. Not imposssible like the Legend of Grimrock series. Initially I was a bit dissapointed because of Frame rate issues, but they have fixed that with the latest patch. Now I can run it at 4k (3840 x 2160) at max settings. It rarely drops a single frame. Almost constantly at 60fps. Ofcourse I turn off Anti-aliasing in the graphic settings along with the other options. You really don't need them at 4k. I would definitely recommend this game. I can't wait for them to release more levels."

76561198158618992,Recommended,329040,34225256,Posted: 13 August,all,brewer5753,iv'e been eyeing this game for 6 months now and desided to get it because it looked like grimrock which i love. so i started playing it and liked it right away. but how ever there are some things in dungeon i couldn't figure out like doors i couldn't open mostly. so after i was able to finish level 2 dungeon it just stops and says i have to wait till next level is made which was suprising to me because this game has been out for a while. so my question is to the people who are making this game is are you working like 10 hours a week making this game? looks like it will take me 5 yeras or more before game is finished. anyone who wants to buy game might want to wait till finished. great game so for though.
,Recommended,329040,32004957,Posted: 27 May,all,Mean Fucking Ostrich,"I bought this after exhausting my content interest in LoG and LoG 2.  I have played Dungeon crawlers all the way back to the ASCII days.  However, I've also enjoyed the cult classic ""Dungeon Master"" on the SNES, and have revisted it throughout the years several times.That said, this game is right on up to par with the rest of them. You won't regret purchasing this, even in Early Access.  In fact, you'll feel pretty good about supporting the devs...this is a diamond amongst the rough!"

I spent hundreds of hours as a kid playing and replaying dungeom Master. Since that time I've played a ton of DM clones hoping for that similar sense of magic. A handful of games have envoked that sense of discovery, wonder, and dread. This is one of those few gems that gets it right! Its still a bit rough around the edges, but the developer is working hard to make it a polished product and is very responsive to both critisizm and suggestions! Worth every dollar and more!"

Tried the game two more hours and now I had good fun without any crashes.It is a very nice dungeon crawler similar to the old Dungeon Master game. Graphics are good, it is fun to search for hidden levers.Moving around could be a bit more fluent, because it feels a bit laggy when I try to move quickly through known areas."
76561197968546709,Recommended,329040,22800795,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Toth Amon,"Good concept, but very buggy. I have a newish gaming laptop, high end stuff, but it is very sluggish unless I turn the video settings down and lower the resolution. It should not tax it based on the fairly simple graphics of this game, so it must be poor coding. That does not really bother me, but what does is the fact that the save game feature often glitches. You load you last saved game, and all your players have lost everthing they own. All weapons, armor and inventory is gone.My suggestion: Save often, and do not override one save, create a new file each time. That way, if a save is messed up, you can go to the save before it and not lose too much time.Still, I love this style of game and keep at it. If you really liked the Legond of Grimrock I and II, you will like this game. It is not as polished and you have to be careful with the saves, but until the next Grimrock comes out (and there is no plan for that, at least that I could find) this is the only option out there that I know of."

,Recommended,329040,19185939,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Losian Rooke,"This is a game where I wish Steam had a ""maybe"" option instead of YES or NO. I'm putting yes just because that feels more fair than putting no, but here's my hotughts. I didn't play for too long obviously, and I like a lot of what I see, but there's a handful of things that make me want to wait until it comes out of early access and is fully and officially 'released'!VOICES: Some of the earlier parts of the game appear to be voiced, not sure if more will be or just some bits, but honestly this one of those things.. Ya kinda gotta go all in or go home. In this case I'm assuming their budget and voice cast options are limited so, as far as voice, I say go home. Put your focus into good and compelling writing rather than voicing a few characters in a mediocre fashion! It'll pay off way more.ART/AESTHETIC: The character portraits look like some paint overs of stock photos and, frankly, they're not bad. But when engaging in dialogue with some characters the potraits are mashed and contorted to give the illusion of expression and speaking and.. it really just doesn't look good. I applaud the developer for trying to add more like that but it just looks super strange; maybe this is something that'll be improved, but I frankly don't know that I've ever seen the warping thing done well for mouth movements and facial expressions for dialogue. The painted protraits look just fine, let them do the talking for you - we as players can imagine them moving, don't hamfist it in via weird morphing and smushing of things around.GAMEPLAY: Movement is good, the game itself looks nice as far as the environments and all. I'd love to see some more character options as far as races - as is there's a swathe of humans, a dozen or so elves, two dark elves, one dwarf, one halfling, one ""labian"" wolf-type character, and a small trio of ""other"". It's not a bad mix, but it'd be nice to have at least a couple of each options, i.e. someone can make a halfling dominant party or similar, and not be forced to choose other races, or be able to mix whatever combo they like. Basically, at least four of each, ideally?CONTROLS: I'd love to be able to remap controls but there seemed to be no ability to do so - In this style of grid-based movement I prefer A and S to turn, and Q and E to strafe, but their controls are locked to Q and E turn, and A and S strafe. It'd be nice to be able to customize these as we see fit. Maybe in the launcher? The in game menu didn't have the option, anyhow.And speaking of, the controls are a tad inconsistent and not intuitive. Left clicking picks up an item in the world, but uses an item if in your inventory, rather than pick it up, so that creates some ""oops I used a potion/read a scroll/etc."" moments when you're trying to navigate things. It'd also be nice to be able to drop items on a character's portrait and it go into their first open inventory slot; instead you have to open the inventory, which removes visibility of other character's/inventory/hands/portraits, and gives you their bag slots.UI: I think the dev could size down the inventory UI and keep visible your hands/your parties hands, and even make at least the first row of your party's bags visible for ease of moving stuff around, as is it definitely is a bit clunky.I'm really on the fence - I almost wanna refund it and wait til' it's finished and out, but I do like a bit of what I'm seeing. Honestly a lot of my thoughts here aren't big game breakers, but all together it's enough to kinda be just annoying enough that it leaves me uncertain. A more intuitive menu/UI would be great, and it'd be nice of hitting ESC closed bags/stat screens/etc. as you'd expect, but instead it pulls up the game menu, which takes several seconds to slowly pop into view and then pop back out, which creates some annoying moments if you open it by accident when trying to close out something else quickly.When it comes to games of a particular style I strongly feel like devs should take what we know works - Might and Magic, Grimrock, etc.- and build on that as far as controls go. There's control schemes we're used to and as a result expected ways for it to work; don't reinvent that wheel. By all means do nuts on the magic and items and skills and all that, blow our minds with that, but don't make your controls rigid and kinda wonky. :D Recreating that doesn't add anything to your game, it just frustrates folks. Mimicking control functionality is one of the best things you can ""take"" if anything, in my opinion, when it's done well repeatedly elsewhere. The left-click varying functionality is really what threw me off the most, and the lack of ability to adjust or change controls from within the game.MAP: I also think the lack of ANY kind of map is a mistake. I know, I know. I grew up on grid paper and walked uphill both ways on dial-up and all that too, it's okay. But you have to realize that, these days, it's just not the same. I don't think I could even find a pen lying around, much less graph paper or something to draw up maps with, and as the developer said themselves, due to the 3D nature it'd be near impossible to map well.. But that also kinda begs the question, if it's that hard to make a map of it, how are we expected to navigate it without reasonably well and not just end up running circles and just dying?Some kind of compromise seems necessary here. At the VERY least I think a rough 'area map' that designates where you are and the rough size/shape of space is enough, something to at least help people navigate around in a general sense and be able to find entrances/exits/etc., while not being a perfect grid-by-grid representation necessarily. Or heck, I kinda like the DS/3DS Etrian method of giving you the tools to draw up your map, it was a clever way to provide both maps and mappingEdit: I just loaded it up and got the Unity launcher to check the inputs there.. You can adjust controls.. sorta? You can adjust the horizontal and vertical, but there's no options to change the turn bindings, which default to Q and E; they aren't even shown, in fact. :( I understand that there are often limitations when working with particular engines, but that kinda stuff can be a real sticking point, as it's awful frustrating to have to constantly remind oneself that what is usually turn is strafe and vice versa.I feel like there's a pretty good 'heart' here as far as a solid Might and Magic/Grimrock/etc. dungeon crawler, but there's just enough polish missing that I'm really just not sure.I also am kind've a grump and I hate to see just four classes. Maybe it's from a decade of playing MUDs and other RPGs and being so horribly tired of the SAME things, but just seeing heavy melee/light melee or range/divine caster/arcane caster as my only options just.. well it makes me sad, it smacks of a painful lack of desire to try and mix things up a bit.. There seems like there may be some hybridization which changes it up a little, but I'm not sure how much with what I've poked at thus far.I do like the atmosphere and aesthetic of the game itself, it's solid. I like that you can peer down into pit traps and such, that opens a whole new venue for puzzles, and I like that, for example, hanging cloth on the wall can be set alight; that opens yet another angle for puzzles and secrets if there are a variety of physics interactions (lightning, fire, ice, etc. for manipulating the environment?) I don't know how much of this exists or is used in the game, but it's promising in any case to see that kind of thing!TL;DR - I kinda like, I think I could totally like it with at least a few minor adjustments, you may totally like it, but I also think there's enough little snags that may just bother the hell out of you. Depending on what's left to change before ""release"" they may totally mop up all these little things, or maybe they'll carry on over to release and it'll remain kinda annoying."
