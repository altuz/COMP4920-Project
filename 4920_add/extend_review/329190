Worth keeping in mind as it is rated as *Negative*.  I've kept my original review below as it is worth reading through the chain of comments that sparked off, due to my unhappiness, and the responses involved thereafter (10th Apr - 10th May).  To my surprise, the developers were not, as suspected by me, camped out in a bar, but are indeed still working on this project, perhaps with renewed vigour.  Who knows?So, reviewing this again since I've had time to re-play and re-test.  It's definately more stable.  Actually, a lot more.  I regulary had to 'force quit' the previous version as it hung during loading about 50% of the time.  This one for me, had never failed to start since it came in and I've been in and out of it maybe 20 times so far.As for the content change itself, I was hoping for something more significant than a few shacks and hated wind turbines dotted around as eye candy.  However, we are still promised parachutes and multiplayer.  No mention of more map choices as yet, but I'll be keeping an eye out for update news snippets for future possibilities of worthiness.  The sound output has also changed from being active, to passive.  I can't tell anymore just how close I was skimming past surfaces.  Something I loved.  Instead, now it sounds like a flag fluttering at 15mph no matter how close I get  to a virtual surface.  Oh, and there's dynamic grass now!  A nice touch for when you do eventually hit the deck at high speed, but ""Mehh""Why have I rated this as Neutral?  Purely for the following reason.  I would recommend this, but for the lack of proof.  Proof of commitment and fervour.  One released update in 6 months dosen't do them justice.My ultimate recommendation then, is to watch and wait.  Stick it on your wishlist, or follow it.  See for youself if it's worth bothering with in a few months time, or set your own timescale as I can't even guestimate what will happen next with this project.  Perhaps take a chance and buy it if you've got the cash to spare.  To help them out and all that......****Original Review Below****Early Access..  Pahh..    ...Should read ""Early Abandonment""Don't bother with this.  After 6 months of complete silence from the (dare I use the word) devs, my feeling is that you'll just end up feeling robbed while they pocket your cash.    ...Unless some crazy update happens, this review will remain to help guide people away from this as an investment of faith.  6 months ago, I had faith they would pull through and took a chance as there are just 2 people working on this.  As of today, I have every faith that they've abandoned this project and set up camp at a bar.I can barely manage 5 mins a day in it's current state as it just gets boring after a while"

Nothing beats ripping down a cliffside at 135mph and just one little mistake can be fatal.  The game's physics and mechanics are amazing, the controls are well done and playing with a controller is key.  You actually fly through simulated air pockets, lifts, and gusts while cruising at speeds of 100 to 160 + mph just feet above the ground...well that is the way I like to fly anyways.  The beauty of this game is the map is open, drop in from one of the various spawns some simulating base jumps others simulating jumping out of a helicopter.  Really well done little game how it stands right now, something new finally.Its early access, meaning not much content small in size around 150mb.  Do not let that discourage you from buying this game, Volo Airsport has a lot of potential here.  Can't wait to see whats in store for the future.A few things I hope to see in the future:ReplaysDifferent outfits, ""wingsuits""Custom spawn pointsCreate your own custom runs placing rings where you want themNew mapsAbility to parachute at the endMultiplayer ""usually not a fan a MP games, but this one would be fun with other players""Map Editor"

It's a game that doesn't take much of your time yet offers a chill and thrill like no other, it's a unique experience - just like wingsuits themselves.You may not get the full product and super pimped up graphic of a wingsuiter, but take it from others that played this game for long - the blue man grows on you very naturally, while not being realistic it's simplicity offers great insight into whats going on in air and with jumpers body while minimalistic design allows you to connect better to the actual experience of what's going on all around you, it doesn't distracts you with outstanding textures and pixel shader 2000... scenery does, and HS it's gorgeus.Flight's not easy, you have to learn it, it's gratifying.Forget your counter strike instincts, let yourself chill with very minimal mouse movements as you go downhill 200km/h.(pro tip) Trace this OO slowly with cursor as if you were drawing infinity symbol, thta's how you play Volo with mouse.IF you feel like flying, give Volo a try.Thank you devs for this trip! I keep coming back from time to time :)[Early Access v.3.4]""One minute was enough, Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort.  A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection."" -Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club[Long version! (scroll down for short one)]What is it?- a game about flyingHow long does it take?- single jump can be anything between a couple seconds, up to about 10 minutes for now, with an averge speed flight close to earth being about 60-120 seconds... so not really long, but ""A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.""What's the story?- for now: You got kicked out of heaven, you have very short time to live; Learn to fly or die.Make the most of the time you have left, soar through air, fly as close to earth as you can, fly as fast as possible, find the way to never touch the ground, enjoy the stunning sunset above beautiful mountains as your short life as a blue stickman angel comes to an end. There's but a one rule for now - ground is lava.What can i do in it?- master the art of flying, gliding, proximity flying, some other technical terms, AND CANNONBALLING!- download players made challange paths (fromVolo forum)make your own paths and fly them as fast as you can- fly around seeking new paths to fly, new winds to use, making stunts along the way just for the thrills- select a spawn point from which you begin- change the camera view (left foot and right foot(GoPro style), first person, third person, frontal, and free view(two last not really usefull for flying but you can get nice photos ;D))Is it easy to play?- Not at all! For now there's no tutorial, but that's not a big problem since the controls are intuitive and it sets your brain on fire - first, to survive the fall, then to fly as far as you can, finally to fly as close to earth as possible doing stunts while flying as long as you can. It can be frustrating at the beginning, since your experience with it won't be like the trailer, but if you put your mind to it, you'll quickly learn to fly and begin to understand the mastery of the Art of flying!Is it worth it?- depends on how much you're fascinated by flying.If you dig skydiving, wingsuits, basejumping and all that stuff, i think you'll love this game!Despiting not much of content (for now), the game already offers amazing physics to play with, along with captivating gfx. It all feels very natural and realistic.It's challenging - don't only limit yourself to flying as fast as possible. Do cannonballs, make turns, spin around, fly on your back, learn the winds and how to use them and you'll be flying for many minutes in a single jump.Create the crazy course using all of the above and see how fast can you and others make it!The devs are active and communicating with players, and there's a lot of stuff to come![Short version]What can i do for now?+ fly with wingsuit stickman+ select a spawn point+ create, share and download fly courses (sharing and download via Volo forum)+ perform some stunts while flying+ use controllers as well as kb&mouse+ die infinite numbers of times by all kinds of unsuspected wind changes while flying at high velocities straight into the ground or mountains... or just pure suiciding :PWhat can't i do for now?- make the jump by yourself- use parachute to land safelyWhat's in there to come?+ Please, see the officialEarly Access infoAs anordinary player, for now i'd give it a strong5/10As anenthusiastthat looks for the game about wingsuits, that would give you the thrill of realistic flight, not story based and long, but captivating and moment taking, the score is7/10for now.Finally, when the game spreads it's wings (more content), make the score9/10Final word?I say Volo Airsport is well worth the price as it is now.Some may disagree; it's all about seeing and living the moment and will to master the art of stickman flight. It seems simple, but it's hard to master, with a lot of place to play around with pyshics and aerodynamics.I found nothing better after a stressfull day, than to put my headphones on, play some sweet music and fly the stress out!"

Volo is all about the freedom of flight in a wingsuit. It is different from other games because it has no real competition, leaderboards, or main goals (as of yet). There are no winners or losers, only people who learn to soar, and those who master the art of faceplanting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:-Great developer-Cheap price ($13 as of now)-Tiny file size (almost 500mb, takes 3 minutes to download)-Amazing graphics-Oculus Rift and gamepad support-Stunning physics and aerodynamics-Wind and sound very clean and smooth-Friendly developers (have had a chat with Ramjet Anvil and Frank V. more than once about Volo)-Future plans to include parachutes and such--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-Like all indie games, it is still under development and has multiple bugs-Character model rather simple, just a blue human figure (red if you crash hard)-No real goal or point (but that may be the idea of the game, just a stress reliever)-Extremely simple, but controls are difficult (using keyboard)-No instructions or tutorial, you are (literally) thrown off a cliff and told to fly---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, if you are reading this, then you must be considering getting Volo. I have one word of advice:Buy it."

I was getting it for my Vive, but tbh it's superb without it. If you hold any interest in a wingsuit BASE jumping title (or just flying in general), Volo Airsport will fill that craving nicely.Just be aware it's still early. Duh, ""Early Access"". But where it counts, this game NAILS it. It does an marvelous job of conveying the sensation and speed (shaking camera) of flight. You never feel quite in total control, just someone who is delicately urging chaos in the right direction. It always feels like you're right on the edge of success or failure. This makes skimming a few feet through a jagged ravine and barely blasting out the exit or cornering around large cliffs with your arm almost touching the side at 120 mph completely exhilirating. There's a decent learning curve to understanding the nuances of the physics model and how much a light touch is benficial to effective control, so becoming skilled requires patience, practice, and a LOT of 100+ mph faceplants. I do question the physics at times as your character can flop around like a piece of paper in situations, and there are ridiculous recoveries possible that'd be laughable in real life, but even still it accomplishes what I think it would feel like to pilot wingsuits....and that's what's vital.At $12 it's a steal, but it's VERY bare bones. It's essentially a tech demo with no additional content aside from six peaks to jump with a few lines each, but built on an engine that holds tremedous potential. If content matters to you you may want to think twice as at this stage Volo Airsport's more about experimenting with wingsuit fllight dynamics, perfecting them, and navigating courses. There's no selection of pilots, equipment, timed mode, multiplayer (in the works), career mode, none of it. I mean, the pilot doesn't even have a fully textured or realistic model. The courses are limited and do get repetitive so this is at this point great in short bursts.But don't let these things dissuade you if you enjoy games about flight as the game's still being worked on. More content is coming, and there's supposedly a course editor in the works. While I struggle to recommend tech demos, I cannot recommend this one enough as the gameplay is exemplary so I'd encourage people to purcahse this as it will enable the developers to keep expanding on it. Volo Airsport deserves nothing less.If you've ever wanted to soar like a bird high and scream like an eagle low without actually risking becoming a pancake, here's your chance. Take the leap."

You will be far more frustrated learning how to fly before you are concerned with a new map anyway.I see a lot of negative reviews, should I not buy this game?That is up to you. Nothing comes close to mastering the feeling of flight in this game, but that is not without much effort at first. That effort can be considered more then this game is worth considering the lack of different maps and/or variety in gameplay. That is where the players are separated, People purchase microsoft flight simulator to actually feel like they might have a sense of flying an aircraft, others choose to play ace combat or pilot wings. This game has most of its efforts masked away behind the actualy gameplay of it itself instead of features it has to offer to the player. This game offers exactly what it promises.

(I'm calling it a product because its a long way from a game). This is severely unfinished, it resembles the quality that comes from a game developer class playing around with flavour of the moment game engine. There is not much to do right now, except to fall to your inevitable ""death"" - which isnt in the game yet either. It is a playground being the point, well a playground should be fun.Comparing this simulator to other unique niched simulators like ETS2, this games features looks pale in comparison (even Goat Simulator packs more features) and it need some development time, maby it will be good in 2015-2016. It may be a cool experience with Oculus, then again - it may not be.For now i cannot recommend this product. Wait and see."

It currently is a shell of a game, as early access games are supposed to be, but the core of the experience is satisfying and fun.The general ambiance and core physics are incredibly cool to play with, and I suspect will be the main draw for a while.[EARLY ACCESS NOTES]There is only one mountain in the game, and time trials are in, but that is pretty much it. The soundtrack is absent from what I can tell, so play something with it. Someone on the discussion suggested boards of Canada, it works really well."

Apparently right now some problems with grass not functioning. The ""sensation"" of soaring through the air is fenomenal. It's very noticeable the flying is properly physics based. Can't wait for some real ""content"". Right now theres a few ring courses you can try to beat faster and faster.A bit of a downer is the fact that you sooner or later will be smacking into the ground is inevitable. Theres no means of properly landing implementet yet as far as I know. Still the ""feel"" of the flying is SO good I'll probably be putting a few hour into this for some ""casual gaming""."

Landscape is beautiful. Adding a parachute would be great, but attempting to land without breaking bones is a fun challenge. I imagine Volo + Oculus would be great. For a relatively inexpensive early access game, it's great to sink some time in to."

About the negative reviews: Consider this is a single person, who's doing the game with the help of another programmer. There is still life AND the internet that has its demands! And these are ruthless, especially for indie devs who try to get something up AND survive. And it's not easy to get the deserved attention, when millions of games are poping up like rain drops falling from the sky. Have indulgence. Start making a game yourself and then try to get the attention! You need 24 hours and you need to be the hell of a writer to get a small peace back from the oversaturated community! I bought the game to support the developer and if it needs its time, then it's supposed to be like that. If not - then it still was my decision to pay the money. Stop complaining about it. That's what greenlight is about. If it works, then it works. Every promise can be shattered by the brutality of developing and marketing a game or simply cause you can't pay your rent. It's a normal thing. And a lot of indiedevs suffer from this issue..  Sorry for my bad english."

But it sorely needs some features that have been promised for a year or more- parachutes, skins for the player, and have never been delivered.  I still feel silly, after a perfect proximity line, landing on my stomach at the end.  It's a little bit of a dud, early-access-wise.  I had hoped that a year and a half on, there'd be things like new maps to fly on, ability to make your own start locations, etc.That being said, what's there is good.  I've found it's my go-to game now when I want to relax.  Fire it up, zip a foot above the dirt while a beatiful sunset unfolds in the background.It's also not worth 13 dollars as it is (or probably ever, the way it gets updated).  Pick it up on sale or not at all."

The mouse or a gamepad isn't sufficient as a controller.
