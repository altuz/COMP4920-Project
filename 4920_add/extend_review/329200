Setting it in a museum is a good start, and some of the areas have a very believable, real look to them. I'm always a fan of setting-based horror games and this one uses that well. It has some effective creepy atmosphere and sound, and some of the puzzles were fun to solve, if a little easy. And I don't say that to boast. I'm a terrible puzzle-solver in games who frequently needs a guide, but this one didn't stump me at all.But, sadly, the shortcomings just kept it from working for me. The one monster, while creepy, was dumb and non-threatening, easy to escape or just glitch out entirely. An obvious setup for a chase scene had me just walking right in front of it with no reaction, as the detection radius seems to actually be very small. The moments where I was tense that I had almost been seen, I probably wasn't close at all. That along with some irritating physics puzzles that can glitch out and send boxes flying across the room, and a player character with a painfully small jump ended up eating up all the goodwill inspired by the positive aspects of the design. I don't like voting down games that I thought were original and creative, but the execution lacked too much for me to recommend this one. It might work for you if you're willing to overlook its flaws, but it didn't do it for me despite my love of all things horror."

Well throw those worries away, because Astray is one of the best small-time Indie Horror games to come out on steam in awhile. It's well polished, with an interesting story, great atmosphere, unique enviroments,  decent puzzles, and a run-time of about 2-3 hours which makes it worthy of its asking price. Let me get into what i think are the pros and Cons of the game.The Pros:Presentation: Despite this not being a triple A horror game, it still feels very polished and well done. I encountered no bugs or glitches the entire game. The graphics were really good.  the lighting is good, the ambient noises were effective with headphones,Story: An interesting story that progresses along well and takes a turn into Lovecraftian territory towards the second half. The notes you find pretty much tell the story, along with providing clues to solving environmental puzzles. Its to see the notes in a game to actually be useful for a change. The puzzles aren't to difficult, nor are they to easy, they seemed to be the right difficulty for this game.The Setting: This takes place in a giant museum around 1909. You stroll along in different exhibit areas, where each one was totally different from the other, offering a good change of scenery. If this museum was real I would certain go check it out in person. (((MINOR SPOINLER --->> i don't want to spoil anything but later you go to explore other areas that lead you into depths that are pretty lovecraft-nightmare-like which were pretty freaky and cool.The Cons:- The monsters you encounter are pretty average, and once one gets up close and kills you, the fear factor drops significantly.- There were some instances were sound was missing from certain enviromental interactions. I would move a box , or open a vent grate to no sound, it was kinda awkward.In Conclusion, I def. recommend Astray. Its a well done first person horror game with light puzzles and a solid atmosphere, and for its asking price you cant go wrong. Oh, and for having been developed by only two people(as the end credits do suggest), i was thoroughly impressed, and can't wait to see what these guys do next."

The Atlantis exhibit fills up with water?)CONS:-Only one type of enemy-Has backstory, but no present story (had no idea who I was or why I was even there)-AI is terrible-Flashlight batteries are useless-Not very excitingI recommend it if you have nothing to do and want a good laugh."

I loved the smoke that they were able to make.Wasn't too scary, but had enough of an atmosphere to make up for it.  They didn't go overboard with jumpscares or anything.The story was a bit meh, but was done in a decent fashion to keep up some mystery as to what happened.There are only a few puzzles and it doesn't really have a variety of creatures, and the end felt a bit shabby to be honest.....but overall it was a decent game to play and I can recommend it for a few bucks as a stocking stuffer."

The horror element is primarily the atmosphere, which I like, but the occasional sounds such as banging can be heard. When you first encounter an enemy, the game tells you not to shine your flashlight at enemies. Maybe because they want the next part to be in the dark, but I didn't shine it, I wasn't sure if I didn't want it to find me, or if I didnt want to find out what it was. The puzzles are also fun to figure out, altough one was your common pipe-rotating puzzle, and another one of the ones where you pointlessly press buttons until you get the get it right, the rest are very creative and fun. You almost forget its a horror game until it picks back up."

The game was the perfect length for the mystery to unravel in satisfying chunks. The graphics were very atmospheric, and the game mechanics worked perfectly. At the end i was shocked to see the credits contained only two names, for that reason alone i would recommened this game as a true achievement in indie gaming, I have played hundreds of small  dev-team games, and this was by far the most impressive in that arena."

Don't buy it if you're expecting anything new/exciting.Bought this game for 3 dollars during a steam sale. Was it worth 3 dollars? Yes. Is it worth full price? Eh.The puzzle mechanics are all basically ripped from other games (circle puzzles from The Room, pipe puzzles from Bioshock & other games).The story is kind of neat, so that's cool. The setting is pretty neat also, which is cool. Story is kind of your typical demon summoned oopsie-daisy situation. Setting is a museum which beyond the terrifying recent film Night at the Museum 2 hasn't really been done in horror before :thinking_emoji:.Lots of glitches. If you're streaming this that can be kind of fun and make for some intrigue. If you're playing on your own it's more awkward than anything.Few smoothness complaints. Crouching is really abrupt and getting into ducts is also clunky.Sometimes you're expected to climb boxes to get over obstacles and other times there are invisible walls on top of super short obstacles which kinda ruins the immersion and also just seems a bit lazy.The end of the game is super meh, kind of expected, and a little too hentai for my tastes.Actual weird gameplay♥♥♥♥♥♥- you can run indefinitely and you're faster than the monster so not only is the monster not a threat at all, it kind of renders it completely irrelevent. At least in some games the monster is a nuisance.-batteries recharge, and there are batteries littered throughout the game. The recharging is actually nice because sometimes you'll be in an area where there's no ambient light at all, but the batteries you can pick up are obsolete af then. Not sure why they're even in the game?-only one type of monster.-none of the items you can interact with make any noise. Maybe the devs ran out of money to buy sound licenses?"

You won't try hard for the puzzles but you'll have to use your brain once or twice.

There is technically only one enemy in the game, a slow♥♥♥♥♥skinny♥♥♥♥♥walking corpse that treads at less than 1mph until you startle it. Then it runs at you faster than the Usain Bolt. The lack of enemies was a bit dissapointing considering the great setting but the game still holds up. There is a boss ""battle"" at the end that was unnerving and satisfied me.

There's nothing revolutionary here, and it tries a little too hard to copy Amnesia, but it has some admittedly very neat environments and some areas are legitimately tense and creepy. It's your standard fare: You're a defenseless everyman sneaking around a spooky environment solving puzzles and avoiding a monster. There's also an interesting (if a bit silly) ""twist"" at the end that you may not see coming.There are about a million of these ""budget horror games"" on Steam these days, but this one definitely rises above the rest. It's not some hidden masterpiece, but if you're looking to scratch that horror itch for a few hours, this'll definitely do the trick.My only real complaint is that this ought to be a $5 game.

I do have a few critics however, the monster model is trash, but only because the rest of the game looks pretty good, it just seemed very out of place, that and the AI was very easy to run around so he did not present too much trouble, and felt if it was not there then the game would have not really lost anything. The only other thing I consider to be a problem is that the early game puzzles and atmospere, are great, so much so that from the basement to the end game the puzzles feel very week if you could call them puzzles at all. The door to the last area you literaly open by stepping on 2 pressure pads, which at that point is just busy work rather than a puzzle, however the early game was so good I would have no problem reccomending this one. Just remember it was made by one guy."

,Not Recommended,329200,18956331,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Polarizer,"Needs More CowbellAstrayis clearly the result of an energy drink fueled all-nighter. Its story is full of holes, contradictions, and dropped threads. The level design is chaotic and lacks any sense of scale. Other than the odd hidden pressure plate (no spoilers) the puzzles are dull and uninspired and, except for the last one, serve only as a means to move from one level to the next and have nothing to do with the story.  The opening puzzle, which contains a multi-part solution, is the most thought out in the game, though it fostered the expectation that the puzzles would be challenging (they weren’t) and varying (they’re all basically variations on the same thing, other than the final one). The influence of games likeAmnesia: The Dark Descent(mood and wandering monsters, not to mentionthe magic book puzzle), and especially the pseudo-parkour ofHalf Life II(all that box stacking). The final puzzle reminds me a lot ofMetro Last Light(only without the excitement) and Oblivion realms from theElder Scrollsgames. There’s nothing especially original here, and much that is frankly and obviously derivative.The world lacks any kind of human touch. The resources used (lamps, desks, bookcases, etc) are scattered about very sparsely. The result is barren, lifeless, echoing places that you run through looking for the next puzzle piece. You can't hide the lack of detail with fogallof the time! There are bad textures as well as missing textures. It is not conceivable that a mansion in 1909 would have modern galvanized steel air conditioning ductwork that looks like something out of, once again,Half Life IIor any of a number ofDeus Exgames. Don’t get me started on the water puzzles or the doors that mysteriously open (or close) triggered by things you do elsewhere. And hey, what about all those large crates in small rooms that could not possibly have gone through the doors--any of them?On the brighter side, the music seemed appropriately chosen for mood-setting and atmosphere, though the atmosphere loops were highly repetitive.That brings me to the ending, which consists of a final puzzle and a series of cutscenes. Here I threw up my hands. It was like cutting the Gordian knot. Important questions were tossed aside, quest objects were ignored, well trodden game mechanisms went out the window, entirely new and unexplained symbols appeared, and then suddenly it was over. I think I even saw a screenshot from Amnesia, but I can’t be sure. What a mess. Think of the worst head scratcher you’ve ever seen. This is much worse. Adding cowbell wouldn’t make it worse.Finally, the title. Really? I don’t mind so much that ignorant people have pointed out that it looks like “ashtray.” That’s the level of fan we’re dealing with, and that’s okay. I also don’t mind the people who have posted videos in which they prove that they don’t know what the word means by pronouncing it incorrectly--we live in a world in which ignorance is celebrated and correcting people is considered a microaggression--but what I do mind is that there is no discernible connection between the adverb “astray” (as in “Mary’s little lambs have wandered astray and she can’t find them”) and anything in the game whatsoever, on any level. Other than than the fact that I was let astray into buying this mess because it was inexpensive.My recommendation is that you resist the temptation to be led astray into this game. It's just not worth the time."

For instance the physics system often has abrupt and ""violent"" behaviour. Towards the end of the game my character also insisted on walking on his own in one particular direction (fix: pause + unpause).I think the game needed more polishing, for instance I think there is a distinct lack of environmental soundeffects. I.e. I can throw around rocks, boxes, ventilation grills and I never once heard a sound as a result. That really breaks the immersion.Astray is one of those games I think would have been better without an actual monster chasing after you and killing you. Those sections where you were more or less forced to interact with the monster felt not very frightening at first, and after that it just felt like a chore.I definitely preferred the first parts of the game, although I didn't care much for the demonology exhibit compared to the Egypt and Atlantis exhibits. I think the game after that needed more puzzles and the puzzles were generally too easy.

It was very scary at first, but after encoutering it over and over again, I learned pretty quickly how it behaves and could easily avoid it with zero deaths after a few maps.The storyline is yet another ""we found a mysterious artifact with evil powers"" we all have played a thousand times before, one of them being Amnesia The Dark Descent, but what really ruined it for me was the huge lack of character development. In fact, there aren't any. The main goal is to find my uncle, right? I found one dead body near the end of the game, not knowing if it was him or someone else from the expedition, and the character I played as showed no emotions about it what so ever.I think this game puts too much faith in us as players, that we will take the role as the main character and react for him.The ending was pretty weird and suddenly turned into a black screen with the credits printed on it. I hate when game developers don't put enough time with outros, and this game developer sure didn't.But you did a good job with the puzzles and it was very scary for me.

Nothing has ever been so fulfilling as playing through this game in a single sitting. Such unbeliveable replay value that I could spend hours playing through this beautiful masterpeice of a game. I felt that I was really a part of the whole experience with their revolutionary story telling methods. This game is worth way more than the 7 dollar steal that it is. I would pay the same amount for this game as I would any AAA title. The thompson brothers have yet again killed it with this horror classic. I nearly peed myself on multiple occasions. This sandbox thriller is rittled with some of the most challenging puzzles ever presented in a gaming enviornment. The most stunning part of this whole adventure was the engenius AI mechanics. The pathing and detection directives of these horrifying creatures are nothing short of perfection. I have never been so mentally challenged but this really drove the extra chromosome home. I would highly suggest seeing a therapist after completeing this game to ensure minimal brain damage.This game deserves a solid 11 out of 10 DlLDOS for how hard it has FÛCKÍNG wasted my time. I would absolutely reccomend this to anyone looking to throw away a substantial fraction of their life.

The game's strongest points are its atmosphere and setting - using a museum is a great idea that I haven't really seen done in a game like this before, and most of the areas are very pretty and eerie. It's really a fun experience just to go through and see what the developers built, and I wish there was a museum this size and scope in real life.The story, however, is about as cookie-cutter-Cthullian as you can find. There's no variation whatsoever on the standard ""lost artifact brings chaos"" plot, and the character you play as is little more than a camera for you to pilot around - no personality whatsoever. I don't mean his/her personality was written badly, I mean they literally say nothing, think nothing, and have no motive for doing all this except that someone's playing a horror game. The first thing you do is solve a very deadly electrical puzzle, and I can't help but think there is no motivation for anyone to do that so early on, no matter how long the uncle's been missing. There are a few well-written moments that build a bit of suspense and even make you question whether something is real or not, but it passes without much impact. What irks me about it so much is that this game is set in amuseum!One ""based on unusual cultures, legends, and supernatural themes."" There was so much opportunity to build a complex and dreadful mystery between different cultures, historical periods, and mythologies, and all that atmosphere was wasted on fetch quests instead of lore-building. Adding an experienced writer to the team could have done so much for this game.The puzzles are very simplistic. I've seen others compare this to Myst, but I wouldn't even call it close. The hardest thing you'll do is an ""A = weird symbol"" alphabet puzzle. There are enemies of an Amnesia: The Dark Descent variety, but they are quite unthreatening after the first encounter. They won't attack unless you shine a light on them (a creative touch, but it backfired) or are within a foot or two of them. Be aware that this game probably will not give you more than two hours of gameplay at most as a result.As a final note, several elements lead me to question if the devleopers have finished their work on it or not.In the beginning, you seem to be being chased, but it's never addressed again. Also, about midway through, a character in a painting vanishes when your back is turned and knockes over a display in the process. Creepy, but nothing happens in relation to it again. Not sure if I missed something or not.I know I've been hard on this, but in the end, the fact is I did enjoy it, and two hours of extremely well-built environments is not a bad use of $7. I hope the developers revisit this concept with a larger team and more time to invest, because it really could have been so much more. Just be aware that, if you're looking for a really scary experience or challenging puzzles, this game will probably disappoint. But as an intriguing exploration built by only two people, it's a worthy experience."

The only real bit that scared me was the recurring noise of a light that was, for some unexplainable reason, relatively unsettling to the point where I actually kind of jumped.The enemy ai in this game seems dull. Sure they react when you run near them or shine your torch their way, but I was able to escape one by standing on top of a double box combo. It proceeded to run up to me, get stuck on the boxes, get confused, then turned around and walked away.But the biggest thing that kept gnawing at me throughout the entire 107 minutes I spent in the game was the lack of anything. It felt like there were sizable chunks of the experience where I waited for something to happen, a startling noise, musical cues, a monster showing up out of nowhere, but no. Nothing.There aren't even any musical bits letting you know you solved a puzzle. It's just *press button* ""alright moving on"".The visuals are the thing that stands out the most for this game. Unreal engine was utilised pretty well for this venture.All in all, the end sequence is probably the most exciting bit of the game. While there wasn't any music, there was plenty of different sounds and things going on to spice up the solitude.TL DR: Pretty on surface, shallow with the horror.

Also if you like things that delve into the Lovecraftian, you'll find a familiar atsmosphere here.

It's a microbudget indie game made by only two people, but unlike many such games on Steam it's actually very solidly made and professionally presented. It definitely comes across as a professionally made game, rather than (unlike many first-person horror games on Steam) a programming student project.The game has fully rebindable keys, invert mouse, and decent graphics options, and as far as I've seen the game doesn't have any major bugs or other amateurish weirdness.It's a fairly short game (I finished it in a little over 2 hours, and that was on a blind playthrough where I explored around quite a bit and had to take several minutes for some of the puzzles), but there are several different environments/levels and overall the game does feel like a ""complete"" game.Graphically, the game isn't triple-A quality but is still reasonably decent. Overall, I'd say the graphics are on par with the average games' graphics from 2010-2012.The story is fairly simple and straightforward, on par with a Lovecraft short story. You play as a standard faceless silent protagonist, and there's no real voice acting in the game, with the story being revealed through readable notes scattered throughout the game (the notes are generally in obvious locations and you don't have to explore hidden areas to find them). Overall the game is more about the atmosphere rather than the plot.Gamplay is a mixture of exploration, steath/evasion, and puzzle solving. The puzzles are decent and not too difficult; I never got stuck trying to figure out how to complete a puzzle, although there were a few times I did get stuck trying to progress because of other reasons (finding the switch for the hidden door in the Egyptian area is the example that most comes to mind).Item-hunting is minimum as the game doesn't really have an inventory or item system. The only items found in the environment are key items, notes that give snippets of the story, and batteries to instantly recharge your flashlight to 100% (the flashlight also slowly recharges when not in use, so you won't get stuck if you can't find a battery).Like Amnesia, the game has monsters you need to stealth around or run away from. The monsters patrol along a fixed route, have a visual detection range of about 20-30 feet, respond to noise (i.e. running fast) as well as if you shine the flashlight on them. There's only one monster type and graphically they don't look great up close, but are decent and unlike some other games are at least not Playstation 1 quality models. Their A.I. is quite simple, but functional.The monsters actually appear fairly sparingly; there are only 9-10 of them in the entire game. They're mostly to create the possibility of a threat instead of serving as a constant, ever-present threat (the monsters are actually fairly scarce, but the fact theycouldbe anywhere are what creates tension as you move through the environments). I actually appreciated this as this allows them to create tension without becoming obnoxious or frustrating.I did feel that the Museum of the Supernatural setting of the game was under-utilized. For the most part, the museum setting (with creepy exhibits etc) was only really majorly used in the first 1/4th of the game, Later areas (which comprised most of the game) were a more generic backstage office area, a dark basement, and an underground area.The ending was rather abrupt, but if you read all the notes and take in mind the fact the game takes place just a few years prior to the outbreak of World War I, it may kind of make sense what the developers were trying to imply with the ending.Overall, I wouldn't say Astray was great, per-se, but it was a good, competently and solidly made, complete experience, especially when you consider the fact it was made by only two people on a minimum budget.  Overall, it's one of the rare first-person microbudget indie games on Steam that is a full legit game that actually does ""deserve"" to be sold on Steam for money, rather than being a glorified programming student project."

,Recommended,329200,17378266,"Posted: 3 August, 2015",all,Atara,"This Indie production suceedes in building suspense and fear using atmosphere, silence, and space. The environments, although somewhat generic and lacking in variety, are nonetheless well-designed to instill a sense of vast openness and foreboding.  This feeling is built less on cheap jump scares than on a more deeply-rooted, Lovecraftian cosmic fear. Astray takes a very minimalist approach to sound design, which works well. Without any music, every footstep sounds menacingly loud, and the slightest breath sets the player immediately on edge.Overall, while Astray succedes in building an atmosphere of dread, it is somewhat lacking in story and overall content. The game itself is very short (most players should finish it in under 2 hours), partly due to the incredibly easy puzzles found in the first half of the game. The backstory builds slowly through various notes found throughout the environments. Although the writing is fine, the story is somewhat thin and, until the very end, fails to evoke much intrigue or mystery. Despite this, Astray ends on a very strong note, and it is certainly worth playing through to experience the conclusion.Overall, Astray is a great effort by a small, independent team and succedes in building atmosphere and fear. Although quite short, the game offers a suspenseful journey through some unique environments, and is well worth the play through."

For only $6.99 one wouldn't expect too much from a game and that's certainly what you get with Astray.  It only takes about 2 hrs to beat and it looks nice and plays well, though there is some 'glitching', namely in the form of clipping = a few times while randomly standing in place to read a note, or while simply walking through a room, I suddently dropped through the floor and died.  It's an autosave game and whenever you die you're pretty much right where you last left off, which is nice, so don't worry about the minor clipping issue.There is no inventory in Astary and you only need to find little more than a half dozen keys/items to complete it.  Besides the clipping issue, the only other odd problem this game suffers from is a pointless use of batteries for your flashlight -it recharges when not in use and yet the developers thought it necessary to place some stray batteries throughout the game, which really doesn't make sense (were they trying to bank on the success of similar/non-inventory games like Outlast, wherein batteries are paramount to your success in surviving).Anyhoo, that and the clipping issue are about the only negatives I can come up with for this game.  The music/sound design works well with the pseudo-creepy museum the game largely takes place in and the handful of puzzles can easily be solved within minutes.  It's not exactly scary but it does have a 'Lovecraftian' theme to it, which is always good in my opinion. I would have preferred to pay only $4.99 for this, but still, it's nice to see more budget priced games like this on Steam.  Astray is worth a look if you have the money and a couple hours to kill."
