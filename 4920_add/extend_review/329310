It's just 5 dollers at this moment! So why not give it a try?Edit:There has been an EXTREME lack of updates, like the first update I remember, was when it released on steam, I recommend people be very careful before buying this as a result."
,Recommended,329310,14450681,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,Negark,"Hey there,I enjoy the game. I think it has a lot of potential. I've played for around an hour and a half to two hours, mostly because it just doesn't hold my attention a whole lot longer than that. That's partly expected because it's in early access though. With time I'm sure the game will mature into something very fun to explore and play with. I did have some issues with the game, and I go more into detail about that in a video review on YouTube.http://youtu.be/iZOf4EcLkI4"

I Hope For Is The Multiplayer To Where You Could Create The Server and Such Maybe Mods But I'm Getting Off Tail I Would Give It a 5/5!

,Recommended,329310,14639482,"Posted: 24 February, 2015",all,StratX,"[Edit: added video review]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xryrG0-lzXEI like what I see so far of this little RPG Maker-meets-Minecraft, if you will. It's early, but functional. I'm impressed with proposed graphics for it.Only my opinion, but I think there's oodles of potential in a builder game that looks like an old-school 2D RPG, especially if multiplayer is being added, the graphics look like traditional, Japanese RPGs.I see the potential for a host of possibilities, including appealing to an audience that loves old RPG artwork, by including countless craftable items, clothes, furniture and more.Not too mention if the possibility of modding is ever introduced in a way, say, Minecraft is moddable. That would expand the appeal tremendously if you can start including functional pipes, oil, engines and the like, similar to the way modding has blown-up around other building games.Or add a little bit of Terraria progression by having multiple underground levels, each increasingly difficult with better ore and items to get.This base framework functions and embarrassing or not, I've blown 7 hours just chopping trees and digging so far in its current state.I look forward to the possibility of more varied terrain, better graphics, and lots and lots more items and activities to take part it!"

Early access is exactly how it sounds - early.To me, it is definitely worth the price.If you have access please do not hesitate to offer suggestions or offer some kind of recommendation.The game is good how it is, but has potential to be great."

76561198117146064,Recommended,329310,14059133,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,Code,I've played 3 hours of this game and I am liking it very much. (Not sure why it says I've played 6 minutes weird time glitch I guess) There is plenty of content to enjoy and I still havn't tried some things. This game has so much potential and I am hoping it will continue to grow! Multiplyer is coming soon and I am very excited to try it!
76561198101570428,Recommended,329310,17517055,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,Cruzbones,"Before I say anything, I want to point out that the ONE thing this game NEEDS to be GREAT IS...nothing lol NO BUT FOR REALITISSteam Workshop. This would add a lot of potential that the dev can't fulfill all the time. Just a thought doe. Anyways, to the review!Okay, so I haven't ever seen an upstarter game that I ever thought could I have potential besides Terraria, but this does. This has a LOT of potential. But unless the developer works soon, it may not see it. What it needs is more ores, and more levels of mining. Not just one, it has to have at least 10 levels, and the bottom level be some kind of underworld. It needs a lot more ores, biomes, etc. There is also a rare glitch where sometimes when you spawn, you're in the middle of the ocean... yeah, that sucks. But Multiplayer will SERIOUSLY add awesomeness to the max. But, there needs to be things to make multiplayer become mainstream. #1, the developer needs to look at Minecraft for inspiration. Famous servers in MC have things in common, Texture packs, custom named items/potions, and redstone contraptions. This game needs these three things to become, well, AWESOMER THAN POSSIBLE! Well... in my opinion :3Now then, there needs to be an elevation system too. Jumping higher and higher, bla bla bla. This can add some amazing builds, and cool land features. A minimap would be nice too. Sprint ability is a must. But yeah, I realize this is Early Access, so what am I saying anyways? XDPoint is, if you have the money, GET THIS GAME. This game needs it, it will become great but remember that what this dev needs is money. Thanks for reading B-T-Dubz, :P :Dedit: Just read over my review... I realized I stumble on and on when I write XD"

It was secretly created with the Adventure Construction Set for the Commodore 64 and time warped to 2016.One resolution fits all!Can only craft 5 items in the beginning and none of them are tools!

Spend your money elsewhere guys, its a rare occasion where I'd say you're better off playing Castle Miner Z, at least there is a little bit more originality there."
