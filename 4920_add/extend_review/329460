,Recommended,329460,14400158,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,ShannonBlue,"This game is RAD.I'm not the kind of person that likes to play platformers - I usually get bored and frustrated by them really quickly.  This, however, is GREAT.  It's like Super Meat Boy met Flappy Bird and gave birth to a dinosaur with jetpacks on his feet.  ""Eww, Flappy Bird! That game is soooo stooooopid!"" You may or may not have just said. ""That also came out in 2013!! Are you stuck in the past, grandma?!"" Haha okay there buddy, but seriously, hear me out!In my first dive in I found that the game was very easy to pick up; the controls were very responsive and so easy to grasp that within minutes I was literally flying through the levels like I was DINO-PETER PAN!  It feels like its at the right speed too - not too slow to make it feel clunky, and not too fast to make it overwhelming.The art style is super cute - I just love my lil' Rex with his lil' cyborg eyepatch - did I mention you can dress up and customize Rex?  Yeah, you can DO THAT. And it's AWESOME. I may be just biased though because I'm a GIRL.  Who sometimes plays into GENDER STEREOTYPES.Aaaanyways, the levels are quite diverse and I never knew what to expect going into each one, which is fun! I love mysteries! I mean it's not exactly Jump Jet Agatha Christie but y'know, it's cool.  In all seriousness though, the level design is tight. There's also no forced tutorial but rather a main hub where you can learn basic mechanics and manoeuvres either yourself or through training, which is a nice option.This game, despite being so easy to pick up, is very punishing - something that it openly advertises, so that's probably what the devs were going for.  I found myself getting a little frustrated with the first boss battle after I died a ton trying to figure out how to beat it.  The problem with this one battle was that the pacing was so different from before - I'd been trained to just GO GO GO as fast as I could throughout the previous levels while in this battle I had to wait for the right time to attack - it was actually easier to stand still than to keep moving.  Despite this I've still really enjoyed JJR and heavily recommend it to anyone that is looking for a strong platforming game that you'll not only have a ton of fun playing but will also challenge you. Even a filthy casual like me enjoyed it! Support your the indies, guys! :)"

Jump jet rex is an amazing game, the levels are very colorful and the music is great. The controlls work well with the level design but can be pretty precise sometimes. I loved the boss designs and the abilities to customize your character along with the subtle homage to older games based on character design and other things. The devs are great and responsive, I found a total of two bugs during my playthrough of the game and after I recorded a short vid of what I did to cause the bug and I showed it to them they immeadiatly patched the game to fix it. The levels have different challenges that you have to complete which gives the game a good sense of replayability if your a completionist. My only issue with the game is the final stage, in an attempt to not spoil the game I will state that there is a MASSIVE difficulty spike between the final stage and the rest of the game that I did not feel that the game had prepared me for. It almost made me quit the game but I powered through it just to say I finished the game. I would give this game a solid reccomendation, if you are having trouble with the final stage just dont bother with it. Play the rest of the levels on the game because they are a blast and worth running through again. Overall I would give this game a solid 8/10 due to my issue with the flawed final stage. otherwise this game is great!"

,Recommended,329460,30936895,Posted: 3 April,all,Awesomov,"It's unfortunate that, among all of these retro-throwback games, JumpJet Rex doesn't seem to get a lot of attention and is even negatively compared. It clearly has plenty of buyers and players, but it's still seemingly not often mentioned. Even after reading some of the criticism (not that there's much anyway) I am still flabbergasted as to why, because it's easy to see just how much of a labor of love this game is (and I'll note right now that the game controls great, don't know why that was an issue for anyone). Much care and thought has been put into the game, what with the level design coinciding with the strict yet still possible time limits given if you choose to speedrun levels. This is mixed with some legitimately nostalgic aesthetic touches which show that the people who made this game clearly were alive back in the day long enough to know what it was like. This isn't just any ol' imitation, I could legitimately see a game like this having been around back in the 90s on the SNES (not the NES despite the style of the soundtrack; the graphics are too nice for the NES otherwise), and as a child I could imagine this being my favorite game.Admittedly, as an adult it's not my favorite, as it can be frustrating at times, particularly when attempting to obtain some treasures in the game, though it is due to a legitimate toughness as opposed to any glitches or nigh-impossible fake difficulty. Though the game does get harder, it does become more rewarding to play as you feel like you actually accomplish things when you obtain victories, even minor ones, as the game takes practice rather than luck. This is the case whether you are speed-running, exploring to find secrets, or just breezing through the levels, and it's great that all of those options are available. The game retains its challenge either way since you'll be facing actual platforming (or ""platflying"") challenges, especially when treasure-seeking. I will say, however, if you do happen to just play through the game in a ""Point A to Point B,"" manner, you are not going to enjoy this game nearly as much since, especially for ten bucks, the game can actually feel like a great adventure (yes, adventure).Though I said it's not my favorite game as an adult, the passion the developers show here seeps into my heart and makes me love it just as much as they likely did, and so I still find this to be among the greatest games on all of Steam, possibly even the best of the retro-throwbacks I've played (if not, it's damn close). In terms of recommendations, particularly since it doesn't seem well-known or oft-discussed, it comes quickly off the top of my head among my first recommendations."

Being someone whose considers themselves as a fan of this genre, but as a midrange gamer skillwise, I feel it's the kind of thing that will challenge me, and even if some of its speedrun/perfectionist objectives may be out of reach for me, I'd be happy to play it until I get as much out of the game as possible.

The game has an interesting 'speedrun' mode with the objective to achieve the fastest time possible. Though the game is fun playing casually, I found more enjoyment in beating people's times on the leaderboard.If you are looking to play the game casually, it's a very fun platformer where you are speeding through levels as a T-Rex with booster shoes! It also has a nice soundtrack that matches the game's nice 16-bit graphics. But it IS a short game(2-3+ hrs) and depending on how loose your wallet is, $15 might be a steep price to pay. I recommend this game and if it ever receives goes on a discount it would definitely be worth it.TL;DRGreat but short platformer. T-Rex in space, Chris Pratt would be proud."
,Recommended,329460,18497296,"Posted: 15 October, 2015",all,Mitch13pavel,"https://youtu.be/m3JHSnTKSREJumpJet Rex is a 2D platformer that puts you in control of a rocket boot wearing T-Rex on a mission to save the world from an incoming asteroid. The game consist of racing against the clock while navigating through increasingly difficult levels while collecting the power rings that unlock the gate at the end of the level. All the while you’ll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero.The game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you won’t feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty. If you get frustrated easily or hate repetition then this is not the game for you, as you will quickly learn the ins and outs of each level as you repeatedly die over and over again. This game does not hold your hand and mistakes are not forgiven, the satisfaction of finally overcoming the challenge of racing the clock and completing the level without taking a single hit is a very rewarding feeling.All in all the game offers a fun, fast paced, 2D platforming experience that that provides a high level of challenge as well as a high level of replayablity."

To really optimize you may have to change your control scheme.One helpful thing I didn't realize one could do is to cancel your horizontal dash with your ""drop"" (b button on xbox controller).

,Recommended,329460,17426242,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,pulver_toast,"JumpJet Rex is a solid casual jump and run.Unfortunately with a few flaws.Pros:- Nice retro setting.- Nice retro music.- Good control concept with the jumping jet boots (although it feels like flappy bird sometimes).- A lot of secrets.- Weird but nice and supershort story.- ""Super Mario Style"" amount of coins. Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!Cons:- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.In a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling, that sometimes when I hit a button it just doesn't react at all. So there seems to be a technical problem in the core engine.- Speedrunning concept: The developers want you to speedrun the levels. There is a bonus if you finish within a narrow time limit. But you just don't see enough in a lot of levels with your small point of view. So sometimes, suddenly, out of nowwhere, an enemy appears or a big block goes straight towards you. And you don't feel like you had a lot of chances to avoid it, except for learning the level by hard. Wrong approach in my opinion.- Boss fights: The bosses mostly annoy me, they are hard but not in a good way. Hard to describe.- Full price is too expensive. I paid 5€ during sale which seems ok, but it is definitely not worth 15€.  Here you have better options (e.g. BattleBlock Theater).Conclusion:It's ok to play it in easy mode, casually, then you will have a lot of fun.

It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails."
,Recommended,329460,15071374,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,Umbreön,"Update [Spoiler Alert... Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.Before we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]Jump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!Yes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.This game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.You can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)The difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.From what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!The soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.You can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)I'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.  See you when I update this review, and if I end up not updating it, in the next review I do!(Rating of the game that I consider as of reviewing: 10/10, as I can't see any flaws so far, aside from the fact that there's a few things not in the game just yet, but should be in the game soon considering full release is upcoming!)"

Its is colourful, charming, addictively fun, and very frustratingly difficult! As is the style with the retro 2D platformer, Jump Jet Rex throws its hat into the ring as an easy to learn, insanely difficult to master platformer. The aim is to simply collect all 3 ""stars"" in a level, awarded to you if you complete the level within a time limit, complete the level without dying, and one for just getting through the level at all. The challenge comes in the fact that the player needs as many stars as possible to unlock more and more levels in order to complete the game. You'll find yourself going back to old levels in the hope of beating it quickly this time, or without dying this time, all with the objective of collecting those prescious stars. The gameplay as one may expect is controlling a small dinosaur with jet shoes. That concept alone is endearing but the player can also fully customise the apprearance of their rex and their jet shoes. You'll be flying, jumping, and boosting your way through treacherously difficult mazes and obstacles. The game also features boss battles which offer a nice change of pace. Overall, this game is recommended for fans of old-school 2D platformers, the kind that are so addictive yet will have you screaming at your screen in fury at how difficult it is. Think Super Meat Boy, with jet shoes and you're not far off. However, if you are a gamer who would be put off bythe steep challenge, I don't think this game is for you.My score: 8/10"

And going through and getting good times on individual levels by themselves, too, I got it. This is a great speedgame, but a relatively easy game on its own, for a platformer at least. It's like, a casual speedrunning game, or something. There's not a lot of competition in the leaderboards though, unfortunately.The bosses all have a trick to them that basically trivializes them but fighting them any other way is tedious, I find them very weird. Sometimes it feels like my dash input was being dropped, or the dash cancel was being dropped. Not often, but I noticed it, felt weird when it happened.Game looks nice, probably not enough levels, only about 45 and only a few take more than a minute when speedrunning, ends up feeling really short. Not a fan of some of the grindy achievements, but they're optional and most of the achievements are good.It's fun to play and optimize the levels and that's about all I could really ask, just wish there was a bit more of a challenge to it overall but ehh!

Once you get used to these controls speeding through the levels becomes a lot more fun and earns you extra stars whilst you're at it!It can be both very easy and very difficult depending on how you play (1st boss was a nightmare until I figured out the gimmick) but even if you don't want a challenge it is still really fun to casually play and not care about the time and death stars.I'm yet to try multiplayer so I can't review it but everything I've seen in the single player is an extremely high positive!"

,Recommended,329460,17496933,"Posted: 11 August, 2015",all,nevik92,"Sooooo, what is JumpJet Rex?It’s a jump’n run game similar to Super Meat Boy. There aren’t as much levels in it (and they aren't as hard as in SMB) but the length of a stage is much longer than in SMB.You are a T-rex in space (a dinonaut to be a precise) who has the task to plant a bomb on a meteorite aiming for the earth (to prevent the extinction of all dinosaurs).Rex is equipped with a pair of boots which allow him to fly indefinitely (dash, rocket and unlimited jump). Of course you can’t just fly how you want. The levels are so designed that you have to carefully utilize your abilities to reach the end of a stage in one piece.In each level are 3 stars to get: one for finishing the stage, another one for beating a certain time limit and a third one for reaching the finish line without dying. As you collect stars you unlock more stages.Besides coins you collect in the levels, which you can spend in shops to customize Rex from tip to toe (different heads, body- , jumpboots- and jet stream-colors), you can also find hidden items in each stage which are merely decorative (referring to the gaming society and pop culture) but still nice to have because they aren’t easy to find and give you a feeling of accomplishment.Additionally to the normal levels are 4 boss levels. Those fights are entertaining and at the first sight very hard. But as soon as you look through the enemy and recognize their weakness you can finish a fight in a few seconds (which is also necessary to get the time star ;)).The 8-bit graphics are nice to look at; the different themes of the stages are good conversed to the player. As you would’ve thought the music is 8-bit chiptune. There are some tracks that I really like and furthermore none of the soundtrack gets annoying as you might have thought. Certainly the music and the graphics are not for everyone but if you are fond of 8-bit music and graphics there is no reason against JumpJet Rex (regarding the art and music).I’d recommend the game to those who’d like the 8-bit style, a challenge, and have no problem with doing a level over and over again to fully complete it (For your info: it is not necessary to get ALL stars to finish the game, 2/3 are sufficient to complete the game)."

Great controls (played with Gamepad), great Hub and attention to detail.The game(play) itself is a fast paced ""platformer"", in which you navigate through levels using your skills.Everything is in-the-air, without the need to ever touch the ground, so it is obviously not a ""classical"" platformer.Controls consist of jumps, fast thrust up and down, a dash, and a spin. These skills have additional nuances to them, and are very responsive.Fast respawns make time-hunting enjoyable.Really, nothing to complain.The only things I didn’t like:* No dub, thus a little bit of text to read at the beginning - story wise.

The other levels I always completed multiple times, to get 0 deaths, time and potential secrets.Up to now I played about an hour, and finished a little bit more than the first section.I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who can enjoy fast paced, skill based platforming.It’s a blast."

I clocked almost 10hrs so far without any co-op or another difficulty and im still not finished.The game really reminded me of Blues Brothers from the SNES sometimes. You have your basic abilities at your hand and need to get good with them to beat every level and get every star. You will rage a lot but mostly due to your own failure in timing or wrong technic in using the abilities you have at your command. I noticed that first hand as I progressed further into the game, at first some time based stars in the earlier levels were impossible to get for me but later on I just breezed through them as I mastered Rex movements more and more.There will be challenge, but dont be afraid to take it. Play with a controller, warm up and then attempt the star you want to get. All stars are possible as far as I noticed, some require strategy but that is expected.I hope I get to play the co-op based modes (race and normal adventure).The only negative I could think of might be story related. But a game like this doesnt need a lot of story, the old SNES games never had a lot of story and carried their weight purely on the mechanics as does JumpJet Rex."

A wonderful 2D 8-Bit platformer that I absolutely recommend to anyone (although I would recommend waiting for the final release).  As an early access title, I feel that there are a lot of problems that, if fixed, will make the game a tad more enjoyable.GREAT STUFF ABOUT THE GAME8-Bit Graphics are beautiful and done very wellMusic is excellent, nothing to complain about hereWorld map is perfect, I like the conceptIt's funPROBLEMS WITH THE GAMEMy main issue is the controls. Being unable to assign buttons yourself and being a controler-less keyboard player, it's a real pain having to use the Alt key and Space key together (I'm on a Mac). I would like to be able to asign buttons myself.The main character is pretty stiff to control. What annoys me the most is the ""Y"" button which is supposed to make the character fly, but the acceleration is slow and constantly jumping is faster. Same with the ground-pound, which has an acceleration too slow and letting the character drop down is as fast. Also, more precision is a little better.The mouse should NOT be used at all in the game. It's a platformer, using a mouse is hellish in these cases.The boss's life bar is often stuck behind him, making it sometimes invisible. The first boss fight (that's as much as I reached) takes a ton of time to beat.The title screen confuses me. I prefer having a menu rather than controlling the character itself. Also, it is very confusing to understand what's going on. Finally, the character can go out of bounds.GLITCHESGetting killed by an enemy and immediately restarting the level, the music will no longer play until you get killed again and you don't restart.Reaching the High Scores will result in having trouble quitting, since you need to use your MOUSE to click the exit button and resume to the title screen.Overall, great game, I can't wait to see how the finished product will look like."

When it was fully released, it went on sale, so I decided to pick it up. I was skeptical at first, but I didn't regret it at all.The thing you'll be doing in the game is just getting to the exit of levels. To do so, you can jump an infinite amount of times with your jet boots, dash left or right, hold a button to fall faster, or hold a button to fly upwards faster than you could jump, although this is difficult to control. Projectiles shoot out of your jet boots each time you jump or dash. If you jump, they shoot downwards, and if you dash, they shoot out in the opposite direction you dashed. These can be used to attack enemies and bosses, which makes boss fights unique and interesting. Although, there are only four boss fights. There are 37 regular levels, not including the final level. To unlock the door that leads to the level exit, you need to go through rings scattered about the level. Sometimes this just means finding them once and moving on to the next one, other times it means all the rings are on the same screen and you need to go through the same ring up to three or four times; there's an amount of time that must pass before you can activate the ring again. The level design is overall pretty creative, and many levels have their own little quirks.It isn't as simple as getting to the end of the level, however. Three stars are available to be earned, depending on how well you do in each level. You can earn a star simply by completing the level, another by completing it without dying, and another by completing it in a certain amount of time. Completing a level in the target time is usually the hardest thing to do. Other levels are unlocked by stars. You can't simply just complete levels or you wouldn't earn enough stars. However, unlocking other levels is fairly easy. You can earn a total of 123 stars (of which I have earned 109). If I didn't want to, I wouldn't even have to complete the last levels of the game, since I had already unlocked the final level. The amount stars required for unlocking levels is very low, so don't worry about having to unlock every single star; some of them are very difficult.Scattered throughout some levels are hidden collectables. Each time you find one, it is shipped to Rex's space base. It's neat to see the walls become decorated with various different things, although they serve no function. Also scattered throughout levels are coins and giant rubies worth 1000 coins. Coins can be spent at shops to customize Rex's appearance. You can customize the color of Rex's boots, the color of fire or whatever it is that comes out of his boots, his body color, and even his head; there are heads that make him look like Rambo, a ninja turtle, and even Megaman (this is the one I use).So now for the little things. The music is... lackluster. There are probably around 10 tracks, and none of them are memorable. They're simply mediocre at best, and if a glitch occurred that would have muted the music, I probably wouldn't have minded. Graphics are decent. I'm disappointed that yet another developer chose to go with the pixel-art route, however. I'd like to see more... wholesome graphics. Controller support is good; if you use a controller with Xinput, button prompts change. I have 9 hours in the game and I have 109 of 123 stars. I'm not going to try to get the others, as the're simply too hard. For what you pay for this game, that's a pretty decent value for your money.There's not much else to say, really. It's a simple game that does what it does well. I highly reccomend it."

The first boss was fairly straightforward once I realized I could shoot lasers from my boots, but still quite a challenge to beat without dying.Which brings up the most interesting aspect of this game: The DIY difficulty. Any level can be completed by simply hammering through it and dying endlessly (all items collected are saved), but you'll only get one star. The other two are for not dying, or doing it under a certain time. I really liked this because it gave me a reason for going back, but also didn't halt my progress when I encountered a particularly difficult (for me) level. It's also much better than the seemingly arbitrary stars given out in Angry Birds.As far as the mechanics go, I can safely say this game plays great with a keyboard and mouse. The controls are tight, and when I die it was annoyance with myself for rushing and not being careful, never with the game itself for being unfair.Definitely recommend to regular and casual players alike, but if Super Meatboy is more your thing, this game (thankfully imo) is not that level of difficulty.If you'd like to see a video of me playing the first few levels and first boss, I've included it below. Fair Warning though: this video was done as a ""Let's Play"" mostly for my friends at work, so it contains commentary and all together too much swearing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-AWPNNpTHg"

It is challenging but not so hard that you get stuck at one point and can't progress. Where the game really shines is the soundtrack, time trials and in its potential for speed running. A word of warning: trying to out race you own ghosts is really addictive!""More:http://www.games4days-review.com/2015/05/jumpjet-rex-review.html"

I was entranced. I couldn't stop playing, over and over until I had gotten each level perfect. My fingers hurt.I was very enthusiastic to get JumpJet Rex just as soon as I could, after playing the incredible product of the original Game Jam. I suppose I just wasn't prepared for how awesome and enthralling the full game could be. Would be. Will be.Worth every penny plus at least 15% more."

You control a T-rex with rocket boots, flying through space.If that doesn't already convince you I'll list all the positive things about this game:- Tight controls (they take a bit getting used to, but they work SO well)- Funky / upbeat soundtrack; especially the boss music is awesome- Loads of challenges, levels and different modes to keep you entertained, including co-op!- Tons of items to buy to customize your T-rex. Go crazy!Bottom line: this is an amazing little gem of a game. You might not spend countless hours on it, but if you want to get everything done you'll be busy for at least a week or so. Plus, the co-op mode is incredible. Highly recommend it!"

In the beginning you feel like the controls are maybe a bit too easy, and you'll worry this won't be the punishing skill-platformer you wanted, but it works out pretty great. The only minor grievance I have are some collision detection issues, but it's early access, so I'm hoping those will get polished out in the end,"

You can simply change your clothing and appearance. It's in early access and the final boss is missing still, but the rest is there. About 4 or 5 players are actively playing at the moment.All in all, I don't recommend it. It's more sonic without the speed than megaman/metroid.I was surprised that it was this boring and repetitive with all the positive reviews it got. It's literally just jump and shoot yourself forward. Nothing else!I recommend you to watch a video of it before buying.And thumbs up if you avoided buying because of this. Thanks ;)."

Fly through each level as fast as you can and activate all the rings while avoiding enemies, lasers and other hazards. Post your best times to the leaderboards. Plenty of secrets and collectables for completionists. I enjoyed my time with this game. The biggest complaint I have about it is that the last level takes place in the dark and is also a maze full of spikes. I didn't find it fun to die a ton of times trying to find the correct path. Once you know the way, it's not so bad. Pick this up on sale for a fun little indie title."
