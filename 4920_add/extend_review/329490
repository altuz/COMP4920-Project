,Not Recommended,329490,14227852,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,<3 Butterflies,"*Edit as of 09/15/16: Still not flipping the thumb becuase it's still not as good as the PS4 Version that was released a few months after this port was. I woud recommend that version of the game if came to steam, but that doesn't seem likely to happen.I originally recommended the game, but currently I would only recommend this game if it were:1) On sale for at least 75% or less (explained further on)2) Have nothing else to spend a couple hours on3) The developers actually make it better or on par to the console/vita counter-part.4) If you like waiting (and I really mean waiting) for updates and patches to be released.5) If Phantom Breaker: Overdrive came out on PC with all the DLC carried over from this one to not screw over customers who have already purchased itTLDR: Just know that the PC port at this point is still obsolete to the newer version out on the PS4 and that this version is a 2 year old port of an Xbox 360. There is also a superior version of the game that exists called Phantom Breaker: Overdirve on the PS4 that has more feaures than the PC port. Keep in mind that because of this, this is a review more based on a port to Steam and functionality rather than pure game-play elements.Now let's start with a few positives:1) Because this game started out as a fighting game, the combat system has a complex combo system that is incredibly satisfying to pull off.2) With the story and arcade mode in the game, it makes for a decent amount of fun for 2-5 hours.3) The character progression in this game is done well with spending points into skills and base stats.Because I actually do love this game, a lot of the following comes with why this game is such a bad port compared to the other versions of this game, why it's failing/ not worth your time as a PC game in general, and questioning developer decisions.Now on to the Negatives (It's a lot):I originally loved this game when it first came out on console and steam. But with nothing but disappointment after disappointment from terrible developer choices, limitations brought to the PC port, and bugs that are still plaguing people (me not included), I'm left in utter disbelief on what this game was and what it could have been on PC.With only 8 stages and 4 difficulty levels with the 5th one being impossible unless you have the level 99 DLC and/or friends to play with, the game lacks the replay-ability to even remain relevant. Even then, the hardest difficulty is pointless for anything other than points becuase you can't even gain experience from it. If you want the evidence, take a look athttps://steamdb.info/app/329490/graphs/and see for yourself how well this game is currently doing.I hit the level cap(50) at the start of Nightmare difficulty (This was from starting at level 1 on Hard because I unlocked Nagi). They finally did add achievements with patch 1.04, but it was implemented way too late. Take a look at the global achievement progress and have a look at how many people actually have the first achievementhttp://steamcommunity.com/stats/329490/achievements/A very important issue that many people do not realize, the content, pricing, and age of the game. This game was originally released on Xbox 360 on Feb 27, 2013 at $10 and later re-released on PS Vita for $12 on Mar 13, 2014 (JP) or Aug 12, 2014 (US). Now the pricing isn't very high, but the fact that the game price went up over time and was released on PC at $12 also is really weird. I asked one of the developers about why the price went up and instead received a round-about answer avoiding an actual answer.I also asked if they could make the Kurisu DLC free to at least regain lost faith and attract people to buying the PC version. I was then answered with, ""It would be unfair to previous Mages customers who have bought previous versions of the game."" I can see how that is a thing, but when your game is now 2 years old it doesn't do you any good to keep your prices the same. Re-releases do exist with more content in the form of GOTY editions and updated versions (Dynasty Warriors # __, Tales of __R, ____ GOTY Edition, etc.) with cheaper pricing and DLC included for free.I would also like to point out that the game that was released on Steam was essentially an ""Early Access"" game. It was released completely bare bones with zero online features and as an experiment to see how consumers would react to it. And now slowly over time, the devs are slowly releasing slightly more content that is still not equal to the original versions of the game.All in all, I could only recommend the game if it has fulfilled any of the things I have mentioned above at the start. But in it's current state, don't even bother touching this game until it receives the care that it deserves.A message to the developers of Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds:This game is a giant disappointment and your poor decisions have clearly held the game back from what it should have been on PC. You have released just another game on steam brushed aside into the trash, so GG. This thumb will flip when you can prove that this game is on equal footing with your new poster child Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Overdirve."

The game is built around use of a controller and the unchangeable keyboard bindings are pretty bad."

However this game is a 2 laned beat em up, not a free moving one; so if you have ever played Guardian Heroes then the gameplay is basically like that. Its really cool and well done, and with some friends included, this game can take up a lot of your time. You start out with 4 characters, and you unlock more as you go (I believe 4 more). They are all female except one dude who you unlock all the way at the end, so if you do not like playing as female characters (you sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) then this game is not for you.I am very disappointed that the developers did not decide to implement the online feature such as in the console version (360). So yes, WARNING! THIS IS A LOCAL ONLY GAME. This still does not bring down the game, and I really do hope with the inclusion of the dlc at one point, developers will include online support.TLDR: Is this game worth a buy? Depends, do you like Castle Crashers? Double Dragon? Final Fight? Anime School Girls with weapons? Then yes."
,Recommended,329490,17572461,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,Tom,"Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is a beat 'em up game which was originally released on Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Vita, before later ported to the PC in early 2015.The gameplay is side scrolling beat 'em up, with a surprising amount of combos, special attacks and techniques to use. The combo system is very easily mastered and you will be hitting high combos very early into your experience with this game. You gain experience after each level, which allows you to spend points in Attack, Defense, or Speed. You can also spend the same experience points in learning new attacks/moves to perform. It was hard to find a right balance between what to spend points on improving, so I just went down the route of improving stats along with improving basic attacks.The graphic and art style in Phantom Breaker looks really nice. It has a very cute look to all of the characters, even the bad guys. If you can put up with the again underage looking characters, which are thankfully quite covered up compared to most anime games of this type, then the look of this game has a very nice appeal to it.The sound effects were sadly something I wasn't a fan of, the over used moaning noises of the girls grows very tiresome after a while, it would of been nice to see a little originality. Phantom Breaker has a number of different difficulties to play, I wouldn't recommend playing on Easy mode (which I did) as it really is easy. There is no challenge to be had, I suspect the normal and harder modes really make you learn the bigger combos to get buy. I didn't actually die once during my playthrough on easy mode, which just shows how easy it was.Each of the seven levels are very well designed. Yes it is all just a side scrolling platformer, but the backgrounds/scenery in each stage look awesome. There are also various different items to destroy such as trash cans or crates in order to find health points and experience points.My first playthrough (on easy) took me just under two hours. I can really see this being a game which has good replay ability thanks to the extra difficulty levels, as well as the co-op modes which actually supports up to 4 players.  There have been reports that the online multiplayer does not work very well, but I have not had any first hand experience with that.This is actually a bad PC port; I couldn't even use my keyboard to play this game. You need a controller to be able to play; even though these types are games are best of being played with a controller, it would be nice to see basic keyboard functionality in a PC game.In conclusion, I would recommend Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds as it is a nicely put together side scrolling beat 'em up game. The price tag of £8,99 may be a little bit steep for some, but with the addition of local co-op, really makes this game a must have for people wanting some couch co-op action.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

,Recommended,329490,28342003,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Ally,"OverviewStory: 5/10 - lets be honest, you didn't buy this or shouldn't buy this for the story. Something insane about multiple dimensions...Graphics: 8/10 - I really enjoyed them, colourful and vibrant throughout, the pixel sprites were great, the Japanese backgrounds were great. A positive point of the game.Sound: 10/10 - I don't know if it was due to me buying the Kurisu DLC, but the sound throughout the game was awesome, from The Gate of Steiner playing, to very well voice acted main story characters(although in Japanese as a warning).Gameplay: 10/10 - Loved it, absolutely loved it, replayable to the max, a skill tree which isn't too indepth, nice combo system, decent change ups of gameplay to break up the repetitiveness.Overall: 8/10 - A loveable romp, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone who isn't into sidescrolling beat 'em ups. If you like them though, this is a worthy addition to your library!Full ReviewPhantom Breaker: Battle Grounds and the Kurisu DLC are what I purchased, so straight off the mark I want people to understand that this review takes both the base game and that DLC into account, I haven't had experience with just the base game.Right, that bit of admin over with, how did I find the game? I played through the campaign on medium(the highest difficulty you can start with, which I'll touch on later) as the first character available to me, avoiding my urge to play as Kurisu from the start. The story is, well, its crazy. Don't try and make sense of it, don't try and follow it, just accept it for what it is. Zany, colourful and incredibly anime/Japanese. It doesn't excel or break new ground, a heroine has her powers stolen and has to go on a quest to save parallel universes and rescue her friends. If you are buying this game for the indepth story elements, you've accidentally clicked on the wrong game and I suggest you don't read on and go and buy The Witcher 3 or something of that ilk.The music throughout the game was great, it had a pulsating BGM beat to it, it fitted in with the fast paced gaming mechanics. Having the DLC meant that I could enjoy the Gate of Steiner as well as a constant other flow of Steins;Gate references. However the base game seems to have been given just as much love with a really well voice acted cast, the language spoken is Japanese(obviously text is in English/native language you choose), I know some people that will put them off so fair warning there.The graphics are fantastic, it is such a refreshing sight to see colourful vibrant backgrounds in todays movement towards gritty dark realism. I love the dark worlds of Dark Souls and games of that ilk, I love the beauty that can be seen in games like The Witcher 3, this however is a world which is bright, in your face, but actually really well crafted. The backgrounds look like over the top recreations of real Japanese locales and then obviously the insane netherrealms they created. Even the ""dark"" worlds are awash with deep reds which add life and keep the tone uplifted. Perhaps my one criticism would be the odd design choice for some enemies, they looked absolutely mental. Some looked like rejected Pokemon ideas, I wish just 2 or 3 enemies had better designs to them, but it didn't really detract from the overall game. Look out for Evangellion style enemies which really look like Angels! That was neat, although I'm not sure a deliberate design choice.Finally we come to the gameplay, this is why you got this game(or you're a Steins;Gate fan and you wanted more Kurisu). You start on medium difficulty with a host of characters you don't even know about locked and 3 difficulties locked as well, that should give you the initial indication that this game is meant to be replayed. It's a hark back to the days of Streets of Rage where games were short, but meant to be replayed and replayed to get better scores, better combos, faster times. If that kind of thing is not your cup of tea, this game isn't for you. I loved playing multiplayer with my girlfriend and we completed medium difficulty in around 3 hours, then I went onto Hard Mode myself and finished that in around 4 hours. Nightmare mode is currently what I have unlocked and my character is around level 60(level cap is 50 without the Kurisu DLC). There is a skill tree, its not too in depth, 2 real branches to the tree and its designed to be completely filled out rather than make difficult desicions. You can also upgrade your attack, speed and defence with the same points you use to upgrade your skill tree. Whilst not being in depth, the skill tree actually changes the game quite significantly, adding combo's, specials and throws.There is a lot of depth there for both the button masher or the carefully coreographed veteren who wishes to perform super cancels into a 50 hit combo.Within the gameplay as well, there are changes from just straight up fighting, there is a ""bonus"" stage where you destroy as many eggs as possible in 30 seconds and a ""falling"" collect the coins minigame. These are a welcome addition that breaks up the game just enough so the fighting never becomes tedius.Additionally, as well as a story mode, there is a co-op, a Vs. and an arcade mode, so there is a lot to keep you playing.Overall I'd recommend this game to people who like beat 'em ups, Steins;Gate, anime or just good games. It's not the best game in the world, it doesn't try to re-invent the wheel, but what it does....it does well....that and Kuristina is in it. Buy it."

,Recommended,329490,32704387,Posted: 23 June,all,Sima,"A competent, casual 2-D plane beat em up with a heavy anime aesthetic that may have too many mechanics for its own good.  This game features a level up system where you can strengthen your chosen character after each stage, or after each game over just in case you have issues with a particular area.  Unfortunately, it's hard for this level up system to shine as the game is incredibly short.  So short, in fact, that by the time you finish the game on normal, you probably won't even have all (or half, depending on how you use your skill points) of the skills unlocked for your chosen character.  Naturally this encourages replayability, as difficulties are unlocked through each successful playthrough.  However, you also unlock characters on your first clear, so if your favorite character is unlockable, you can't transfer EXP over to the new character.  This can make it a bit difficult to start Hard mode with a fresh character unless you're willing to grind.  Since the battle system isn't too complicated, it's easy to burn out after a few clears unless you really enjoy the mechanics.  The game's music is nice sounding chiptunes.However, the game could have done with a much better tutorial.  Each mechanic has its own separate page instead of grouping similar mechanics together, which can be a lot of info to take in at once.  I'm the type who likes to know what he's getting into, so this was kind of a pain and, at worst, frusterating when trying to read the ""tutorial.""  I'm still not too certain on some mechanics after beating the game a 1.5 times, but I know most of the mechanics are there to keep you pressing buttons no matter what happens.  Additionally, some enemy types are pretty annoying to fight against.  It doesn't help that the background and foreground mechanic can make it hard to tell what is happening.  If you're in the back, for instance, foreground characters will block the screen with no transperancy.  This can make it confusing to tell what the heck is even happening as enemies later on get huge, and at worst can slow down the action when you jump inbetween planes to get a grasp on the situation.  I'm not quite sure why enemies not on your plane weren't made transparent as it seems like an obvious decision to me, and was my biggest issue when playing the game.Overall if you're looking for a casual, short beat em up with cute anime girls I'd recommend it.  It's not a bad way to blow off steam after a long day.  I've heard comparisons drawn to Scott Pilgrim, but they're not very similar mechanic wise.Cocoa/Frau > Itsuki > rest"

And to be honest, I've really enjoyed my few hours of playtime with it, but I do have a few complaints. First would be how you are not told the keyboard controls in-game, I had to look on a forum for a proper answer. Second would be the inability to map controls to other buttons, I prefer using the arrow keys to WASD, but that's just me.Online is fairly solid, characters are fun to play as, as my first beat 'em up, I'm impressed. The art style, while pixelated, still gives off a clean and polished look. The DLC is good, although I've only gotten the Kurisu DLC pack, simply because it raises the level cap to 99, and I'm a bit of a fan of Steins;Gate.While I'd like to stick to Easy mode, as it seems like my cup of tea, I can definitely say Normal mode has its challenges, even on co-op, as my friend and I died - several times with a few of the bosses, barely winning some of the battles. If you and your friends want a challenge, or you're just looking for a good time, then maybe you should pick this game up, especially when it's on sale.My total was about $5.40 or something like that for the game and one bit of DLC, I think it's a steal."

Highly Recommended even if your a fan of beat'em ups, even if your not a fan of the magical girl aspect.Game Showcase/Gameplay-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1K2PZ8r1dk"
,Recommended,329490,30093682,Posted: 21 February,all,Etcetera,"Did someone say classic?!?! That's exactly what was delivered in this Retro 2D Sidescrolling Pixelated Beat'em Up.This game brings back the good old enemy killing spree gig. With  over 8+ characters each with their own fighting gimmicks and combos the games brings hours of fun. The games also features musical DLC for the old Arcade cabinet feel. The online multiplayer and local co-op also allows for so good ol' family fun.Ok, Let's get down to business. The replay value on this game is only worth as much as the player gives it. If your a completionist and/or love to play Sidescrolling Beat'em Ups then this game is definetly  a game you should be playing. I recommend the game for action game veterans or old school gamers. You'll really get your money's worth. It's not a game for you to sit and play through but to play over the course days and months. It's a loveable classic that you can keep coming back to. The more you let it breathe the more it stays fresh.The gameplay is quite easy and simple to understand, although for the more combo adapted individuals a combo guide would be quite useful. I recommend an arcade stick with the game ""If"" if you want a good feel for the game. It's suits me fairly better than the gamepad and keyboard.This Game Features:- 8+ Playable characters +2 DLC Characters- 8 Stages in total with decent replay vaule- 5 Difficulties that challenge the player- Online Multiplayer and Local Co-op- Battleground Mode (PvP oriented  battle on various stages)- Online Leaderboards for the 100+ Gameplay hours you'll spend trying to get within top 50- Me (I'm up for a fight or a stage run almost anytime)Battleground Mode:This mode right here is where i'd heavily suggest getting a character to at least 80+ because for anyone familiar with fighting games this won't be pretty for anyone who isn't. Same rules apply as most boss battles only that you opponent can't stoic through any of your attacks. Combos can become creative in this mode since your opponent won't dies as much as the normal enemies so being stylish, juggles, frame traps and any other frame links are heavily suggested. Your best choice is to have all your character's moves down. Damage and speed and Defense are all up to each player to decide so it keeps things interesting.  *If someone has a manual overdrive skill and can combo good you might be screwed :D*In short for my first review I believe this game will fit well with a couple others in the Genre: Pixelated, Beat'em Up, SideScrolling, Action, Classic, Retro and Fighting. If you're familiar with or like Scott Pilgrim, 99Vidas, The Punisher and Alien vs. Predator then you should enjoy this game just fine.Thank You for your time.-Etcetera"

Despite the lack of online and remappable keys, Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds kept me entertained all the way through. The battle mechanic was surprisingly deep and it wasn't to the point where I wasn't overwhlemed with its techniques. Although it's a beat em' up, the gameplay is more like that of a fighting game (considering how this is a spin off of a fighting game) with oh so satisfying combos. The leveling system is like that of Castle Crashers where you'll add points to specific stats or your skill tree. The vibrant colors and soundtrack really draw you in the minute you start the game. This game is kind of like Scott Pilgrim in that you'll have trouble in the beggining of the game, but later on you'll be super buffed and the diffucult is basically nonexistant. The diffuculty really sets in during bosses, where most of the time you'll have to resort to spamming. The lack of multiplayer is a big downgrade from the console versions; but by myself, I was highly entertained. I HIGHLY reccomend that you play this game with a controller.Technical issues with this game include: No online co-op, No remappable keys, bugs (although I havn't had any for myself), and the lack of dlc from the console versions (where is Kurisu?). Overall, this is a TERRIBLE port. Simple as that. HOWEVER, the creators have gone and addressed these issues and are trying to patch these problems in the future. As for the online portion, the creators are hesitant to add this feature in due to the feedback from the pc port. Hopefully they go through with it.PROS:+Addictive fighting mechanic w/ deep leveling system+Bright colors and catchy tunes+Secrets and plethora of chracters add replayabliltyCONS:-No online-Unmappable keys-SHORT (I clocked in at 2.5 hours)-This game can be unfailry diffulcult at times (especially bosses)Final Verdict: 5/10*If this game gets EVERYTHING IMPORTANT patched then the score will change to a 8/10"

,Recommended,329490,16242889,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"These our strange times that we live in. Are you familiar with Phantom Breaker? It was a fighting game for the Xbox 360 that was never released in the West. Oh, I thought not. But you've heard of Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds. You know about the beatemup spinoff that was released on the Xbox 360, Playstation Vita, Steam, and soon the PS4? Eventually the original Phantom Breaker is going to appear on Steam or somewhere, and everyone will think ""they made a fighting game spin-off?!?!?""But that's all irrelevent, Battlegrounds is actually a spiritual sequel to Panzer Bandit, an obscure PS1 import. It's a multi-plane beatemup, the type where you can switch between the foreground and background at will. This is a very Japanese title, with stages taking place in Akihabara, enemies that include otaku and ganguro, and a heaping helping of shrine maidens, maids, ninjas, robots, and sword-wielding warriors of justice. This is all tied together with an 8-bit soundtrack and Saturn era graphics. It's absolutely nuts, and extremely well-done.Most beatemups keep things generally ""fair"". As far as moves and abilities go, you're only slightly more awesome than the 100s of thugs you beat up. The challenge is in out-maneuvering and out-punching everyone. In PB:BG you're waaaaaay more awesome than the goons you're brawling. Sure their numbers are far superior, but that just makes it more satisfying when you perform crazy special attacks and 200+ hit combos. Toss in the ability to level-up stats and skills, and nothing will stop you from looking your best. You can just keep spamming those crazy moves, and as long as you're playing semi-smart and remembering to heal yourself with the various full-course meals (found in trashcans), you'll be golden...mostly.Boss-fights are where things can become ""unfair"". Almost every boss is actually a playable character, just locked away until you complete the game on a couple difficulties. They're as awesome as you are, and will spam all of their favorite moves. I wouldn't say the difficulty does a 180, maybe a 150 or a 160, but it's still something that will lead to most of your game overs. Succeeding here relies on a different strategy, playing defensively. The cast of this game can guard, dodge, guard-cancel, ""burst"" to get out of danger (at the cost of health), and so on. Using these techniques is essential for the boss-fights as well as higher difficulties. Or you could just grind your stats up, that's fine too.While not as long as your favorite AAA franchise, PB:BG takes awhile to beat. I'd say that it's actually too long, especially considering it's designed to be an arcade beatemup. While the game does save between stages, the aptly-named arcade mode expects the player to go through the whole thing. I don't think it works in that context. With every level there are at least 1 or 2 sections that I would shave off, to give the game a more appropriate length. The story mode would retain its original time to complete (1:30 to 2 hours) while the arcade mode should take 45 minutes or even a little less. The lack of online-play is always unfortunate, and I'm worried that the changes/extras in the imminent PS4 version won't make their way to this release. Otherwise, I have no other complaints worthy of mention.What makes PB:BG such a joy to play is its options. The number of moves and abilities available to the player can be considered overkill, but they're easy to execute, and even more fun to combine. You don't need air-throws, EX special-attacks, super-moves, and the ability to guard-cancel out of a dash just to deal with a man that can barely swing his golf club....But what the hell, let's throw all that in there and go crazy. It reminds me of another obscure beatemup called Denjin Makai 2. Most of the enemies you fought in that game were losers, but you had the move-set of a grandmaster shaolin wizard cyborg. It was a hilariously one-sided match-up, but it was so much fun pulling off wicked combos that you simply didn't care.All in all, Battle Grounds is a great entry in the genre.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:Follow Original Curator Group"

The main flaw is that the designers really didn't know how to add 'challenge' to the game so they tried to band-aid it in. Bosses jump in difficulty way too fast and fighting them becomes a battle of attrition.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorThere is a bit of a difficulty spike at the bosses. It's helpful if you save up special gauge, the Phantom Breaker attack does a ton of damage if you can hit with it. Leveling up your skills makes a big difference too, so make sure to assign all your skill points too if you haven't already""Most mooks are just a speed-bump and while that is true of most beat 'em ups, here they just palette swapped a few mooks and made them hit harder and have more HP and bam ""challenge"".Stun-lock is an issue, you press nothing to block (why can't it be mapped to a button?!) and many enemies push you back when you block so you can never close the distance on ranged enemies in an effective manner.Boss fights are a joke with your health bar being the punchline, grinding to level up is akin to pulling teeth out armed only with string only for you to realize that you actually are holding a can of silly string and those teeth are actually a giantboulder.Overall though fighting the mooks to level up is boring and the boss fights don't feel like they are presenting a fair challenge, they just feel like 'you must be this level to pass, unless you can cheese us' and then you realize that the reason the game is designed like this is because it is so shallow. Their is nothing interesting or dynamic to keep you invested in the game, stage 1 is the same as stage 3 which is the same as stage 5, just mash mash mash away until you fall asleep.Buy Double Dragon Neon instead, both games are the same price but Double Dragon somehow managed to addFUNto the formula.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

First and foremost, if you don't have a controller, you probably won't get much enjoyment out of this as they keyboard controls suck and can't be changed, and you will probably get your face punched in... a lot. On the flip side, if you do, however, and you like the idea of a Scott Pilgrim/Streets of Rage-esqe style game except with magical girls on a rescue mission then you'll probably get a kick out of this. I found it to be pretty replayable with trying to unlock characters and clear achievements, however, this game will really shine if you have a buddy to play it with. My only gripe was there is an almost insane difficulty spike in your first runthrough of some of the boss fights, forcing you to go back, grind up some levels and sometimes respec your character's stats in a very specific way so you don't get turned into a magical girl puddle on the floor. Other than that though, 10/10 would Kurisu again."

You can break out of enemy combo's, but it will cost you a bit of your health doing so which means you have to be careful about when you choose to break free.There are several characters to choose from. Over time you will level up characters and you can buy talents for them so they for instance have better combo's or can double jump.

The game is not very difficult or strategic, and while there are techniques like blocking, counter-attacking, and move-cancelling, a simple philosophy of ""Dash in and mash buttons until everything is dead"" works nine times out of ten, the exceptions usually being the bosses (which can't be stunlocked into oblivion).

Otherwise you'd probably hate yourself for paying full price and not getting those oh so important missing features in the cons list. It's a nice little time waster if you just want to take a break and mindlessly slaughter dudes in suits, gyaru girls or floating demon girls that shoot lightning.

It's a short game, but a lot of fun.Unfortunately, there is a rather significant problem with the PC port.  It won't save data, the controller (I used two different ones, had the same problem with both) isn't recognising when I hit the lane change button, it defaults to German every time I open the game.  There is a fix, if you look in the community hub for a thread about the controller not responding.  There's a config file you can download and have to rename, pop that into the config folder, wipe the files that are there already, and you're good to go.As I was until a synch error wiped a) the config files and b) my save data.

I don't think I'll be able to pass the game in Nightmare plus mode.On a side note--when playing on my laptop (Windows 10) the character jumps by itself without me pressing anything, but on my desktop (Windows 8.1) it runs perfectly fine.

When one of their friends is abducted and held captive by their arch nemesis, Phantom,   They set out to save her.  5MP, Mages and Division games did a great job on this port.  All the achievements are super easy to unlock.  The only drawback is that it will take hours to level up your character the way you want.   The game throws  a crutch early in the game, with good reason.    Gameplay is simplistic and easily implemented.   Your buttons or keys will attack foes, or transition with a cool 3D move called ""Line""  where you can attack your foes who aren't on your X or Y axis.    The sound effects and Japanese voiceover are very well done.  They can get grating after a while,  But, the music for this game is enjoyable.  They even let you play as the other unlockable characters in story mode.  Something the Xbox and PS3 versions left out.  Although there is no added dialogue to the other characters to provide the storyline some lift.    I highly recommend this game, I'd fail to mention it's Versus modes, and Arcade Mode only for leaderboards sake.   Can you make it all the way through the hellish Nightmare + difficulty.

For a 2D Brawler it's got a lot of addicting fun in it. While I haven't played farther than Level 3, seeing as I'm trying to grind all my characters evenly, the game's already got a cute charm.Graphics: 9/10The graphics are exceptionally well-styled and have a cute appeal. The backgrounds have that little Japanese Cartoon feeling, blending it with the Anime style makes it really pop. (Yes, Japanese have both Cartoons and Anime, they're different over there.)Gameplay: 8/10It's fast, fun, and exceptionally combo-tastic, it's easy to get the hang of, once you get over the awkward controls.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack is really nice and poppy, it has the oomph where the oomph needs to be.Replayability and Variety: 9/10This one really, really got me. Each character has their own set of skills, so leveling each one up, unlocking all of their skills, and seeing how fast you can beat levels with each one or how big of a combo you can get with each one with their different styles is really fun and satisfying.Pros:+Colorful, vivid, and cute.+The Chiptune music is very poppy and bright.+It's fast, fun, and has a nice combat system.+The Skill Points go to both Stats and Skills so you have to spend wisely, making it fun to experiment with high stats and no skills, or vice versa. (Grinding exists but that's not a pro.)+Variety of characters to play as, with different skills and combos to pull off.Cons:-It can get really difficult when you're being pinned.-The controls are really awkward and the keys which the controls are bound to aren't explained to you.Final: 8.5Overall, it's a nice game for the price."

Not worth getting the soundtrack.- Too much grinding and not enough variety in moves to be comparable to cult hits like Guardian Heroes.- No online co-op, though most of my friends in my town play games like this anyway so I can always find someone myself.Still, despite all of this, especially the middle part that only ever happens to a certain amount of users, such as myself, this game was fun for the time I did get to spend with it before I began trying to get a refund for it due to the fact that it does not work anymore and it feels like I wasted my money, especially since they have yet to update the game.But, this game still works with enough people where you would be likely to fall into that same in-crowd of users. Only people with Windows 10 (for the most part) have ever experienced problems, though it is peculiar to experience any problems with Steam games, let alone game-breaking bugs.

You don't actually buy anything, they're just for points apparently, but there isn't even any score related achievments. A game like this that goes out of it's way to bring in all this new stuff to the basic beat'em arcade formula really doesn't need ""points"". I know this seems like a minor thing to harp on, but it's really distracting to have useless shinies flying across the screen all the time. The level up crystals are collectables enough.It also sucks it takes so long to unlock Phantom Breaks. Overpowered, sure, but they're so stylish and fun. They add a lot to the base fighting.Battle Grounds is a spin off to a fighting game that's never been released in the states. Just as well, this could be it's own series, if the story and characters were fleshed out more. A Battle Grounds 2 with more polish and care could be one of the best action games ever."

76561197990672230,Recommended,329490,17123700,"Posted: 19 July, 2015",all,NineByNine,"First impressions of this game are pretty good. Cute pixel art, good fighting mechanics, fun combos, easy to learn, lots of depth... An interesting point is that it is a 2d side scrolling beat-em-up but it has 1v1 style fighting mechanics as well. Also it's not exactly as 'free-roaming' as most 2d sidescrolling brawlers. You'd be forgiven for expecting something like Streets of Rage with free vertical movement along the stage, but instead you are locked to two 'lines', much like the older Fatal Fury games. This of course means that to jump you press up which is... kind of awkward to get used to, but it makes sense in context.You have four attack buttons, light medium heavy and special, and you can combine those for various special moves. There's a full set of 3 special moves done with directions and the special button (down, forwards and whilst dashing), and then also a set of various counters you can do with just the special button on its own (pressing just before an attakc, pressing just after, and also holding it for a really powerful counter/rage mode), there's an overdrive mode to increase your speed and strength, there's such a thing as a guard cancel, jumping attacks, throws... all this sort of stuff. The fact that there's 25 pages of how to play should tell you it's simple on the surface but quite deep once you get into it. Y ou CAN button mash your way through the game but you'll have more fun learning the technicalities.The very first level of the game also gives you all the powers possible for your character, and the level itself is ridiculously easy even on normal mode (the only other difficulty other than Easy at the beginning, oddly enough), so that gives you plenty of time to test out all the moves, see how they work and see which character fits your playstyle. It's a practice stage as it were, though one that's always worth playing because of the free XP you basically get to level your character once the game begins proper.Whilst it's not immediately clear, cutscenes are skippable by pressing the select button on your gamepad (honestly I recommend playing with one just because of comfort and layout, but it's possible and easy enough to play with the keyboard as well) in case you die during a boss fight and REALLY don't want to sit through the cutscene AGAIN. ugh.Speaking of, it is a one life and gameover type of deal. If you die, you get the gameover screen and have to continue. You still keep the XP and score you gained and that still applies to your character, even if you decide not to continue, and when you do continue it's at the last checkpoint you reached (given you're likely to die to a boss, that's usually the boss cutscene, hence why I mentioned the cutscene skip button), so it's nicely forgiving in that aspect.XP you earn goes into levelling your character you're playing with, which is persistent btw. As you level up you can choose to put the skill points you gain into their attack, defence and speed stats, or their actual skills which unlock what moves they can do, so there's a bit of a balancing act there. The vanilla game has a level cap of 50, wheras if you purchase the additional character who is from the Steins Gate anime if memory serves, you get to level up to level 99 instead. Which I assume means you can max out everything on them eventually. Given you seem to get 5 skill points per level, and the costs of each increase to stat or skill increases as you work your way through the paths, it seems unlikely you can max everything out by level 50, so choose wisely if you aren't willing to drop the cash on the level cap increase and fanservice character.It seems like this game would really come alive with multiplayer, and it has a nice local play option and a co-op mode, though I've only been doing the single player game at the moment. It's definately interesting and a lot of fun, and the action is pretty frantic. Boss fights are against other characters usually, which fight just like a player does. This makes them challenging and interesting to fight, but they tend to spam some really nasty damaging moves, and certain bosses have attacks which do lots of rapid ones. They are blockable but if you get hit by it at any point you are in for a world of pain. This is slightly frustrating but that's what you've got things like Emergency Mode and Reflect for, of course. Also dodging to the opposite line is always an option.All in all I'd say it's a capable brawler and a fair bit of fun. The level up mechanic works nicely with the story and also with the gameplay, though it does feel a bit frustrating having all your cool powers taken away at the beginning and having to choose between raw stats or cool moves."

Visuals are pleasant but not distracting. Music is supplementary to fighting enemies/typical brawler, but the sounds can get repetitive/annoying after a period of time. Length of gameplay may be limited, as there's only a Story mode and Arcade mode, both of which play out on the same ~8 stages.There are DLC that include seperate characters and increasing the level cap, but after playing Arcade Mode once and Story Mode twice, I still only reached level ~50-60, so it depends on your desire to repetitvely play the same stages with the same enemies in the same sequence.  There's also Easy/Normal/Hard/Nightmare/Nightmare+, but I did not invest the time to playing the Story Modey any further.The variety in characters and combos versus the repetitive nature of stages may be a point of conflict for purchase, but at a discount of 50% or greater, the game is definitely worth a pick-up, even for just a few hours."

It looks good for what it is. The music is catchy whiles the character voice clips can be abit eargrading but nothing that'll make you wanna rip your ears out. Pretty much all of the characters in the game are fun to play as with some being stupidly overpowered (lookin' at you Nagi.) whiles others are fairly basic, i don't really see anyone being totally useless if you know how to use em right.

,Recommended,329490,30516117,Posted: 14 March,all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"Why is it that the more complex titles tend to be weeb as hell? I'm serious: Disgaea is a really in-depth SRPG series; Guilty Gear is probably the most complex fighter of this generation; and this is a 2D beat 'em up with a lot of mechanics to take in. If it isn't licensed off an anime it tends to be relatively complex. Maybe it's the superior Japanese intellect that us Westerners just can't comprehend.Battlegrounds is a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up a la Streets of Rage and Final Fight, with the caveat of allowing you to jump back and forth between two planes and 4 attack buttons. You have your light, medium, and fierce as well as an ""SP"" button used for a variety of moves. Each character has at least one special, but they all have access to universal mechanics that allow you to backdash, parry, counter, slow time, cancelling animations with SP, and discharging an attack that hits everything on-screen. I won't go through every single one of those, but suffice to say there's a lot to take in. The good news (?) is that you don't need to really use all of this on normal, which is the unlocked default difficulty. On the higher difficulties you certainly need to make use of all of this, and the game becomes more exciting when you do. But that's if you want to replay it and really delve into it; otherwise you can do a quick romp through it.Worth pointing out are the graphics, which are pixelated 2D sprites that have more quality than your average 2D indie game that looks like sh*t. These sprites had work put into them, and what's amazing is that many items in the background are actually 3D items, but they blend in SO well that you'd be fooled otherwise. They achieve this effect with jagged edges on the models and simple flat colors; it blends in really, really well. Golf Clap.As this is a spin-off of a fighting game, there's some details missing here, but the general idea is that a girl has been kidnapped and it's up to you and your friends to get her back; going into a parallel world to rescue her and defeat the no-good bad dude. There are some details you're missing but nothing major that would prevent you from understanding the plotline here, so being ignorant of Phantom Breaker isn't a huge deal.Overall, a really good 2D beat-em up that looks and sounds the part, and carries a complex fighting system that requires full use when you reach the harder difficulties. Otherwise you can play through normal and get by with knowing the basics. Highly recommended if you want a quick 2D beat-em up with replay value. There are also some DLC characters if you want more anime girls for your fighter. Two gorilla thumbs up."

This creates a beat em up experience that does something surprising: being accessable for those who want to button mash, but adding a whole level of complexity to those who wants something a bit more technical. While the chaos on the screen can get in the way at times and the game certainly doesn't teach the above mechanics well at all, it's a solid overall experience that you can pick up on cheap (at the time of writing this review, it's part of the humble bundle weekly), and is a good local co-op experience as you bash a variety of enemies over and over again.Gameplay Footage and Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HBOKA_uknULists:+:Accessible gameplay for button mashers to technical wizards alike, pleasing everyone in the process.Combat system for beat em up is surprisingly deep and works especially with counters and situational awareness.Dual Lane system adds some variety to the game especially with enemies that throw bombs at you, causing you to relook at tactics.Soundtrack is reasonable and doesn't make you want to turn it off, and fits the level that it's usually playing with.Alright enemy variety, but nice to see cannon fodder get mixed up at times too.Even though the aesthetic can be all over the place, it all somehow fits together in the world. Scott Pilgrim like in a way.-:Lacks teaching mechanics to teach the player some high level skills, only leaving it for a menu that they would only see if they were looking.Dual lane combat can be problematic with big enemies in the foreground, who take up the screen and not let you see what's going on.Menus don't update to show what controller button your using, which is a shame."

I would give this one a thumbs-up. Overall positive experience and I'm enjoying it. Breakdown below.PROS:It's a Scott Pilgrim meets anime type game with the front and back rail side-scrolling action. The retro feel was captured well, and the sprites are pretty adorable. It's great for a game to sit down for a few minutes between two games and hammer out some levels on a chibi anime character. Good retro music and cute voice overs sell the experience. Crazy boss battles prove difficult and add to the challenge.CONS:My only problem is that the DLC for Kurisu, an additional character playable in the game, was 5$USD. If an another level or two, or even an extra character were included in the DLC I would not be as put off on the price of the addon pack. This DLC pack does bring the all-around level cap to 99 so that you can further level some of your characters, but this isstilla bit steep in my opinion without any extra content on the side. However, maybe the price doesn't bother you. I picked up the DLC in addition to the base game due to Summer Sale pricing (the Kurisu + Level 99 DLC was 4.19$USD).

Phantom Breaker delivers everything you want and more.  Not only do you get to play as waifu tropes but the gameplay is the best part.  There are plenty of great combos as well as button-mashing goodness.  The RPG elements of character leveling gives you a good level of control over how you get to play your waifu in combat.  The graphics are 8-bit in design but still includes the fluidity in movemnt of both the sprites and environment that we are accustomed to these days.I really enjoy this game as a pallette cleanser between long sessions of CS:GO and big games likle Witcher III."

,Recommended,329490,14155011,"Posted: 24 January, 2015",all,AritheReaper,"Alright. Before i start this review let me get one thing across to you readers. I have beaten the game on one character on one difficulty so far and am planning to 100% complete this game. Also remember this review is occuring the literal day after this game came out on steam. So with that in mind time to start the review.Story:Hey guess what? If your someone who just beats a game and moves on this isn't for you. The story is 8 missions long, including the intro mission. Each one of the 4 starter characters have their own story mode but each on revolves around the same topic, so what really is the major change is what each character says and the other character they're speaking to's reaction. Because of this the game can take maybe an hour for seasoned people to beat it.Gameplay:The game recommends from the start that you play with a controller. I however do not own a pc or xbox 360 controller so i used the pc controls. I will not disclose the controls on the keyboard because in my opinion playing the game without having an idea of the controls is the best way to go. It makes you feel you really are getting more and more powerful the longer you go on and the more you learn. This game is level based. Your going to want to start the game on easy mode from the very beginning. I am clearing normal mode with my mian character who is over level 30 as we speak and i am struggling to get through individual stages...right now stage 6. You level up by collecting red gems which turn into exp at the end of the stage or when you die. Now if you have played it, you will notice several similarities with scott pilgrim versus the world the video game such as graphics.Music:It's retro. If you don't like retro music then your going to find yourself playing through the game with your sound muted. For those of you who love retro music, you will most likely enjoy the music.Alright since this review is the day after it came out, i'm going to do my best to sum up the story without giving away any real plot twists or spoilers.Story introduction:A man named phantom (phantom breaker ha ha ha. sarcastic laughter <-) kidnaps one of the main characters little sister nagi and its your job to get her back. You go through out the 1st stage with them giving you the maximum power your character can have. When you get to the end of the stage after beating the boss, the boss will steal your power sending you to level 0. However if you've been collecting the red games throughout the level, you most likely will be at least level 6-7.Characters:So far playing through this game i feel like each character both in fighting style and in their personality's are diffrent in their own way. Now there are a few people that are the anime characters you so often run into, but they are all enjoyable in my opinion.Final battle:...this category is...strange...to say the least. You have found nagi and are escaping try to find the exit to where you are and the final boss is infinity, phantom's right hand man...although for the character i've played as, he has given very little information about himself and besides the intro to the game you've never really seen him until then. It sort of comes off as a random sudden boss battle that appears out of nowhere. That aside though, this is an extremely tough battle that will have you stressing yourself out. Remember that this is after clearing easy mode. I was over level 20 and i stressed myself out trying to beat this boss until the very end, in which case if i had taken 1 or 2 more hits then i would have lost.Score:8.5-9. It isn't for everyone but it is in fact a fun game for people like me. Go ahead and respond with your own reviews as you wish, but this game will always hold a soft spot in my heart for being one of the best fighting games i have played in the past few years."

There seems to be multiple issues with the game, some of them concerning glitches others about features of the game that havent been implimented.I got caught by the issue of a black screen bug that basically prevents you from seeing what you're doing in the game. I have been searching for months for a solution but to no avail. My best clue that I have gotten so far is a possible problem with windows 10. However that never stopped the problem from occuring in older windows.The game is entertaning and fun to play. I think the campaign was a bit short lived and the combat gets a little boring after awhile, but thats why there is the multiplayer function! designed so that you can play with your friends and enjoy the game together! except when you dont have friends it becomes useless especially when the online multiplayer function that was promised a year before never came out. It seems the developer is focusing more on the console front of this game rather than the pc front so I dont expect patches, help, or responses very soon.Basically its a ok game to buy, but if you should run into any problems or if it doesnt work at all, dont expect help anytime soon."

Here are some of its positive aspects:The game looks and feels great - the visuals are nice and the controls are responsive.The game has a pretty cool midi/chiptune (I'm not sure about the correct term) soundtrack.The game offers a pretty enjoyable combat system - you have a variety of options during combat (i.e. you can attack, guard, execute guard break, etc. Mostly things that you'd expect to have in a fighting game)The game offers 4 playable characters (5 if you've bought the Kurisu Makise DLC; After palying through the story mode I ended up unlocking a sixth playable character)NegativesI would like to mention the following negatives as they seem to be game breaking for some people...There is no Online Multiplayer (as of the writing of this review)The controls could prove to be problematic for some.The controls:If you have a 360 controller there should be no problems as the game provides detailed information about the controls and combos.However, if you intend to play the game with the keyboard, it's not going to be easy to figure out the controls (on your own at least). The game doesn't provide any information about the keyboard controls (logically, it doesn't allow rebinding of keys either...) and so, the player is left to figure them out on his/her own. Here is a breakdown of what I've figured out so far:Menu controls:W/A/S/D - Navigation.B - Confirm.J - Cancel/Back.1 - Seems to act like a Start button. Whenever J doesn't work, 1 sends you back to the main menu; otherwise it acts as a confirm button.2 - On the specific occasion when both ""J"" and ""1"" don't send you back in the menu, pressing ""2"" will.Combat controls:W/A/S/D - Movement.G - Executes a full combo - starting with weak attacks and progressing through medium attacks to strong attacks.H - Starts the combo sequence from the medium attacks onward.J - Executes strong attacks.H+J (pressed simultaneously) - Execute a special attack (This is a special attack shared by all playable characters).B - Guard.Y - Switch lanes (combat is done in one of two lanes at a time; with ""I"" you switch between these lanes).Esc - Opens the menu.Important note regarding the controls:If you open the controls options menu the game will display a 360 controller, however if you press one of the aforementioned keys, the corresponding key will be pressed on the screen.ConclusionOverall, I found the game to be fun and enjoyable. It would have been nice, however, to be able to play online with other people (both co-op and PvP)."

Many people bought this game in the hopes they could co-op with their friends and they can, so long as they are in the same room together. The only other issue with this game other then it missing that and the DLC is that there are no settings for PC, something I can look past, however the game does not want to remember that I told it to play in full screen instead of windowed mode. It doesnt seem to want to remember any of the game's settings, like volume, etc. If they fixed these things a more accurate and probably more positive review would be on the table, however even the unstable form of multiplayer on my xbox 360 was better then no multiplayer at all, especally if you try getting into the harder difficulties, where you need 3-4 people all at max level of 99, which you can't even get because this is an older patch of the Xbox and Playstation games so you are capped at level 50"

I have been playing this game since the 360 version came out a few years ago, enjoyed the heck out of it, bought all the available DLC, completed it on all the difficulties and still wanted more.At first glace it just seems like your typical Beat 'em Up but don't be decieved! This game combines RPG elements with combos you'd see from a fighter, you can choose what stats you'd like to have and skill set until you manage to max your character out, you also have a diverse number of moves, even special attacks you can chain into one another you can use to combo your enemies into oblivion. Whether you play this alone or with friends this game should keep you occupied for months to come.The replay vaule, in my opinion, is moderate at best since you only have 7-8 stages to choose from and the difficulty is what really spices it up in between how many of the characters you care to play as.If you get tired of beating up the A.I. in the game then there's a another game mode where you can fight eachother with any of the playble characters you have unlocked.This game, even 2yrs after I originally played it still holds up well. It's severly underrated and I have no idea why. Maybe it's just not that popular or not many people know about it. If you're reluctant to give this game a try, I'd say wait until they decide to inpliment the online mode as this is where the game really shined for me.So, just to recap:Pros- Simple to complexity gameplay- Combines Beat 'em Up with RPG elements- Tons of moves to do- Handful of characters to play as (outside of story)- A good range of different difficultiesCons- Only 7-8 stages- Currently no Online- A few minor bugs offline that need addressing (I've only run into one crash so far)- Subpar controller support/unable to remap keyboard keys(it doesn't even tell you what the keys are to my knowledge)- Slight framerate issueIf you're a fan of GH, SPvtW or CC then this should be right up your alley."

If they would actually deign to fix this long standing and game breaking bug, or remove ""controller support"" so that it's honest, then the rating would change.

That is why I was quite surprised when this one was actually really good. I've been suggesting this game to pretty much anyone who will listen for the past week. It's kinda like a mix between Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up and anime fighting game. You can get by with just button-mashing most of the time but you can also use a number of special attacks that is different for every character and adds alot of variety.The main story will take about 3 hours but it has tons of replay-ability with the multiple characters and unlocked hard modes. It also has arcade and some other game modes if you're interested in any of that. Multiplayer isn't live on steam right now but I hear they're working on trying to get it up and running. This game is definitely worth a pick up whenever it's on sale so go grab it!P-Face gives this game a 4/5. Reason why it didn't get a full 5 is due to the fact there really isn't anything to the game other than the gameplay and a short story. It can get repetitive fairly quickly and it doesn't have secrets or anything else to add like other kinds of beat-em-ups do.

So why am I not recommending this game?Here is the answer:- Been trying to do several runs in story mode now but the game automatically shuts down after the transfer between new areas (each shutdown differs between areas) so I've not even gotten the chance to complete Akihabara, the first stage. The fact that this is possible to happen when it's sold for real money is really bad. I can play the arcade mode just fine though.- It has one of the worst ""controller friendly"" settings I've seen. I've tested it with various different third-part controllers but none of them are playable. (They work but the settings are off by far) And you can only change the 4 different punch/kicks/special controls. On top of this it also has a horrible keyboard layout which you cannot change either.Positive things: The combat seems really smooth and satisfying. The reward system of gaining levels which allows you to improve your character is also something I think is a cool addition to a 2d fighting game.So what would it take for me to recommend this game?- The controller settings needs to be fixed ASAP (So that you can adjust even a third part controller, or atleast your keyboard to make it enjoyable). At the moment I'd say that it's only enjoyable with supported controllers.- Enable multiplayer for online-gaming. Nowadays 99% of the people who play games at a computer either do it solo or online. The odds that a person has 2 PC controllers that support this game and friends who actually wants to play this game with them are rather slim."

I wasn't going to buy it at first due to the lack of character choices then I watched it on youtube and figured out we could unlock more, which is nice. However, one of the things that s really crippling this game is the online multiplayer which is as of right now, nonexsistent.

The game has a skill tree that you must level for each character although the skill tree is the same across all characters. The Combat system is really fun allowing you to combo together different attacks. If you have a gamepad and like Brawlers I think this is a must own as we don't see many decent brawlers and definately not many with a skill tree and levels that give it a good bit of replayability.

I have no idea what sort of situation this studio is going through at the moment but that's no excuse to release a terrible port. Sure, you can say that I should get over and just use the wonky keyboard set up and get off my high horse. However, this was to my knowledge a console game, so, playing with a controller, any controller other than an xbox 360 one should be relatively problem free.

,Recommended,329490,14143994,"Posted: 24 January, 2015",all,CJ,"I think most people will not be satisfied with this game. I do enjoy it, but it has some severe problems:- Tutorial is only in text form. This makes figuring some things out a bit more tricky, since you don't know if you did it right. Especially since I have not once been able to pull off one of those ultra moves you see in the trailer. I think I can only unlock them once I unlocked the Phantom Breaker. Which leads me to the next problem.- You have to unlock all the skills, from double jumps to special skills to the Phantom Breaker, which is the highest skill you can achieve. You achieve skills by level up through collecting gems which will be dropped by enemies. This seems okay, but I'd like to have the option to try out all the moves of a char before I decide to put a few hours into maxing it out.- The balance is completely off for at least one character, which is the girl with the cat ears and the claw. She is too overpowered, since her forward special will take out almost any normal enemy. I have spammed my way like this through to the last stage without any problems on hardcore difficulty, while being able to collect most of the gems and points since this makes her go a decent distance, so already now she is a higher level than the other girl with the sword who I used to play through normal. Maybe I get more levels due to the difficulty, that's also a possibility. There is a bonus stage in the train where you can smash a lot of eggs for bonus points and EXP. Due to that specific move it was easy getting everything in there.- No rebindable controls, and an annoying way of prompting inputs. By that I mean, the game does clearly show an X-Box 360 Controller in the settings, but the buttons are not A,B,X,Y, but 1,2,3,4, and not even in the same order. This seems like a lazy thing to do, especially since you can't rebind keys. If you play with keyboard, good luck figuring out the keys. There's a ""guide"" on Steam which shows them.- Sometimes enemies will put you in a stunlock, since you're vulnerable the instant you recover from an attack. Maybe I just missed something, but I've had some trouble with that.- I think there's a story in there somewhere, but I'm not completely sure.- The story mode is rather short. If you're no completionist, playing through it once or twice will probably be enough for most players.But there are also things I like:- The overall style of the game is neat, from graphics to sound. It all looks and sounds polished, the soundtrack is perfect for the game, the animations look smooth, and the chibi style is just too adorable! The characters each have their own unique look and abilities. Voice acting is standard anime quality; not bad, but not anything special either.- The enemies can be quite challenging when it comes to bosses on higher difficulties, but it's never unfair (except when said stunlock occurs).- It has a borderless fullscreen mode.- I can see some speedrun potential there.- Rule 34 may approve of this game.I have not tried out coop. I imagine that will also put some more fun into that."

The game is fairly cheap and proportionate to the amount of money paid since the game doesn't offer too much. The DLC is what really bothers me, it's 6 dollars, SIX DOLLARS why does it cost so much for a DLC? oh well I dont know it only consists of adding one character and the ability to level to 99 which I find quite stupid. The devs are charging you 6 dollars for something that should cost like 50 cents, hell the ability to level to 99 shouldn't even be paid for that's something mandatory to add into the gameplay. From what I have seen on the DLC the new character isnt that powerful and that's another reason why to question it's ridiculous price.The DLC makes the game itself cost 18 dollars and no it's not optional if you want to enjoy the full experience because you know you are unable to gain 44 levels. Also why the hell would I pay 18 god damn dollars for a game that isnt even that vast, a six dollar dlc should consist of more than just 1 character and some new stages or something because, charging six dollars ( 18 whole) for a new part of a game that NEEDS to be there isnt very fair. There are many many many more games that cost less than this and offer much much more they are proportionate to their price unlike this.would I recommend this to an average gamer? no. To a gamer that doesn't care about his/her money and just wants to waste it, yes. also the fact you cant 100% the game without the DLC is sad.In the end I would ask to please please please change the damn price of the DLC to something more reasonable."

From basic blocking to counters, recoveries, guard breaks, etc. All these elements are nicely added into this game making a much more enjoyable experience than just mashing the attack button.The really cool thing about this though is: what you can do, your enemies can do too.So they too can counter, parry, block and what not(bosses especially).It's a bit short so it is best purchased during a sale."

And hey, i saw the video, i saw the pics, great graphics! the background look so good! the sprites are amazing! i am not even bothered by the whole anime-fan-girl-kawaii♥♥♥♥♥♥But then i start playing and i realize...this game SUCKS.Kurisu, a DLC character and one of the main reasons i bought the game, has crappy attacks and serve only as a way to play a harder game, but for gameplay reasons, not style.The game itself sucks as a beat'em'up, the first stage ( stage 00) disorient the player since YOU START WITH EVERY POWER ( even though the story justifies they loosing their powers, this "" god of war 2 tutorial stage"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), there are no pick-up itens and the lane-swtiching system could be cool, but it serves no purpose in this game.The worst part? being a button masher. you can spam HEAVY ATTACKS ( which are fast) and rarely will have to strategize ANYTHING. You can finish the game in two hours, button-smashing you way through.The music is bland, you won't remember nothing, every girls sounds exactly the same, a typical, standard kawaii anime girl. The story is uninteresting, forgetable and a lot of things don't make sense ( you fight 2 or even 3 alter-dimension selfs of your girl, and there is a discount Krieger from Archer who appears out of the blue).The best part is that the sprites are really good, there is plenty of enemy types with not bad graphic variety, the background isn't reallt original, but also got a good level of care, they are well done and appealing, but then...that won't save the game, it plays like garbage.The level system is only for padding, the only pleasure you get from this are blips-and-blops and pretty flashy indicators, it's like a pavlov gaming experience.I'll recommend only for one kind of situation: If you want to blindly play something just for giggles; AND only if you're a really into anime chicks stuff."

Unless you practise moves you won't learn them ( no practise mode either ). So we have very steep learning curve from the beginning.-Normal mode requires lots of grinding... ( to unlock special powers, move sets and really cool finishers ). I found myself dying TONS of time on second level with the boss... simply because I was underpowered.-Lack of emphasis on player skills ( this game seriously promotes spamming attacks and buttons ). Lots of things are happening on the screen at the same time and its hard to time things correctly because there is no way you will see enemy attack when you have like 5-6 of them stacked together + boss... Therefore counters and blocks are basically happening randomly.-AWFUL control scheme. First it takes time to get used to what H M L and SP means because game won't tell you YOUR key bindings. Add to that fact that block happens when you do nothing... who the heck thought it was a good idea? Annoying. Ok let's just say i can live with that... BUT SP button is frustrating! You want to do counter son? DO YOU? Well press SP just before enemy attack lands on ya easy right? WRONG!!!!Because SP button has BUTT loads of other functions it can activate EMERGENCY MODE ( that drains your HP ! ) so if you are tad ""too"" late, then you won't do counter but rather activate Emergency Mode... and IT HAPPENS LOTS OF TIMES because you can't see **** with all that stuff on the screen. That is the most frustrating thing ever.Combos are ok but executing throws is bad and half of the time doesn't work ( imput lag maybe? seriously its simple -> plus H when near enemy and YET it's so fricking hard... )-story is just non existent to me ( i found myself pressing buttons all the time because all those ""cutsey"" voices are just sooo annoying )-characters are boring and cliche.

And it actually fits really well, creating old-school atmosphere.Cons:* Controls aren't intuitive at all. Playing with keyboard was a bit painful.* Controls in the settings are only displayed as gamepad buttons, even if you use keyboard. A bit frustrating.* Learning new moves is absolutely spontaneous -- there's no ""press this to do that"" algorithm, you just mash everything until you'll understand how to do what you just did.* All 4 characters aren't exactly unique and have similar skillsets.- - - - - - - - - -Overall, I'd say this is one of the best old-school anime beat-'em-up games I've played up to date, even though it sometimes gets a bit tricky to learn and the controls are not really intuitive.I'd rate this game 7.8 out of 10.0 and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime, pixel-art, beat-'em-up genre or just wants to play something old-school involving some kawaii girls kicking♥♥♥♥♥"

It reminds me more of Scott Pilgrim then say the oldbies like Streets of Rage, but that doesn't harm the fun factor, as I loved the Scott Pilgrim game!

,Recommended,329490,16233119,"Posted: 6 June, 2015",all,ReignDarkness,"This game is ""Ok"".It's not great, it's not terrible, just ""ok"".It's a arcade fighting game simular to Scoot Pilgrim vs the world only with Anime girls with diffrent weapons and styles.The story seems half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and not very interesting, basically a guy called Phantom comes along steals some little sister called Nagi and you have to traverse diffrent areas, realms to rescue her.You start off with 4 main characters, Mikoto and Swordsman, Waka The Shrine maidan with a Naginata, Itsuki the Maid with a Hammer and Yuzuha the Ninja. The all fight diffrently with strengths and weaknesses. I personally like Waka and Cocoa.The main enermies in the game are easy, you can easily button mash them to death with ease, bosses on the other hand have a Massive diffaculty spike, they interupt your attacks easily, spam you relentlessly and kill you with seconds unless you block and time attacks correctly or Just spam your EX attacks.You need a controller if your gunna play this as the keyboard is unbearable.A few things hold this game back massively are the fact that the bosses are overpowered and cheap, spamming you to death with no way to counter. You could but they react so fast that you'll just be wasting health.Combat is barebonesThe early levels are a grind and airn't fun until you get combos and/or EX attacks.The game at certain points will force you to exit an area before you have a chance to pick everything up. For example you fight a massive boss with minions which could drop around 25-100 Big red gems total, but as soon as he dies your character auto moves out the area before you can pick it up.Claims it has online on store page.... it doesn'tThis is small but for the achivement Good Jump you need to jump off a building and grab all the stuff without missing anything, sounds good. However moving horrizontal is fine, VERTICAL IS GOD AWFUL. You'll glide up and down with laughable control like you're sliding on ice, it's pathetic.Villians are boring and tedious (I like Cocao but against her is a nightmare, spam centrual)AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE SHIRINE MAIDENS!!! They fire balls of fire, they auto lock, explode auto incapaciates your character and they continue to hit you down over and over till death. 1 is ok, 2 even BUT A ROOM FULL OF THEM!? Goodluck. Most of the time they are flying so your ex attacks won't hit. Plus attacks interupt you so goodluck getting close enough and hitting off a good combo.Also No story telling.... nice... how interesting.The good things are less then the bad.It can be fun later onOnline would have made this game more fun.Diffrent style characters means you will find one that you like.Nice art style and Music.Unlockable characters....even though all except 2 of them are♥♥♥♥♥♥and uninteresting.Price, I got it for around £2 on sale.All in all if you like fighting games, anime characters and 0 story just get to the stabby stabby, you could enjoy this, but if you want a decent game with a story, competant mechanics, fair system and ONLINE!!!! look else where.This Game Gets A 5/10, it is ok... borderline average. And in some cases like spam central this game could drop to 3/10 for it's lack of features, no story, no online, no fun until later slugfest."

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros:-Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies.-You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me.

Wanted to start that off because if that is a game breaker for you, now you know. Another issue is the game does not save your display options. So if you have to play it on full screen, you would have to change that in options which I can see being annoying. It does save all other options though.Personally I have a lot of fun with this game. Early levels start off a bit easy but get harder as you play. Enemies get stupid hard and result in a ton of deaths in later levels. Unless you grind it does get really hard(I don't grind :P) It controls and feels a lot like the Sega Saturn game Guardian Heroes or the 3DS game Code of Princess, so it will feel a tad like a fighting game/beat'em up. Controls take a bit getting used to but once you get the feel of it, moves are pretty easy.If you are a fan of this style of beat'em up I would recommend it, but if the problems I stated make it a deal breaker for you, I'd say get Double Dragon Neon."

76561198006416682,Recommended,329490,16810358,"Posted: 30 June, 2015",all,DoomyDoom,"TL;DR: A fine middle ground between mechanical depth of a fighting game and satisfactory button-mashing of a beat-em-up. Neither the worst nor the best port I've seen, largely depends on your expectations and opinion towards a few particular points.The Good:- reasonable mechanical depth without insane learning curve of a true fighting game. If you're looking to practice some basics or get a friend into the fighting mindset without scaring him by overwhelmingly complicated move lists and combos, this is a good place to start.- plenty of characters and fighting styles - rush, poke, zone control, jumpy tricks etc.- nice background art/soundtrack (obviously per personal taste)The Bad:- ""GHJBY"" for default keys that can't be rebound? Uh... yeah. Because it makes sense. You can rebind what button does what attack, at least.- Some random single-digit frame drops upon game launch until you've clicked through 3-4 menus. Nothing critical and totally fine in game, but still.- Difficulty levels are gated by stats. As in, they're balanced around a certain character level. Mostly a problem with bosses, as not having enough stats makes every mistake really painful.The Ugly:- DLC gating character progression? Guess what, you're not getting fully unlocked move tree without it. Just consider it a part of the game's price, really. At least it's one and only gameplay-related, the 2nd being OST.- No online mp/coop functionality from the original game. To quote: ""we're still working on other updates to the game, including the planned online multiplayer update and other revisions. Development has been slow because much of the PBBG dev team has been preoccupied with the upcoming PS4 version"". That's not a good excuse for PC gamers folks. It's been like 4 months since release.

If you're looking for a game thats little more then wandering the streets and beating up people (and monsters) in that Streets of rage style this games right up your alley.Mechanics aside the story is kind of boring as you have a friend whos kidnapped. There are also several different characters that play differently and a few of them are unlockable which adds a lot of replay value to the game.Overall its pretty good, I definately recommend it if you want a solid brawler"

While the controls on keyboard are not well explained, the key layout is workable and doesn't impact on gameplay or the abilities to perform combos (once you become familiar with the controls). With four girls to select at the start and a host of hidden characters that have their own skillset, this game does not lack in variety.Bright and colourful, this game takes a light hearted approach to the beat 'em up scene with a soundtrack that would expect to find at an arcade. Harder difficulties are also actually hard and punish players who recklessly attack, which is often because the combos chain together so well that you don't want to stop juggling that poor enemy that has had 0 hp for 2 minutes.It's a nice time waster that is a nice throwback to old arcade beat 'em ups."

It's like most of beat'em ups, yet imagine that your up and down buttons on the D-pad are broken and you can only move back to the background and to your initial position. Switching between these 'lines' takes way too much dynamics from the game and slows it down quite a bit. What's more, it is very diificult to maneurve when there're a lot of enemies (sometimes on nightmare+ it maybe even be impossible to evade their attacks)Secondly, who the **** thought, that having UP as a jump button is a ******* great idea!? Jet let me punch that person in his ugly face.-Although music in this game is really good, I feel that it suits Castlevania type of games much more.-Leveling up, which isn't that necessary, so why even bother putting it in this game? To make you feel that you've accomplished something?-The storyline...it's just there.-Voice acting...please, somebody, kill me already, I can't hear it no more.

,Recommended,329490,34983266,Posted: 15 September,all,Gator MacReady,"A side-scrolling beat-em-up with RPG elements featuring Japanese schoolgirls? How can I resist? Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is a fun button masher. If you liked the Scott Pilgrim game from 2010 then this one has similar pixel graphics and chiptune music. The spoken dialogue is all in Japanese with English subtitles. I'll be honest, I had no clue what was going on but I did enjoy smashing my way through the levels, until it got derivative and repetitive.It seems to take forever to fully upgrade your character and after my second play-through I still did not have enough experience to max-out so I just gave up. For a good few hours this game is a pleasant distraction but is hardly likely to go down as a classic with anyone.The soundtrack (forgettable as it is) is available separately for purchase, there are 46 trophies/acheivments, and 5 trading cards to collect. Worth getting in a sale, for sure."

For a spin-off of a fighting game it came from, it is surprisingly good! And if you've played the Fatal Fury series before (e.g. Not me!), you'll feel right at home as you make use of two lanes in this game, as you progress through the stages beating baddies on your way. The gameplay mechanics are pretty fun and, with the right skills to put your acquired points on, you can pull off some interesting combos and cancelable moves (For example, air chain grabbing with Itsuki is REALLY satisfying! You can always pull off one big YOINK, but make sure to jump in for one big YOINK after another!). The chiptune-style music is epic to listen to, and while the storyline can feel as though it's trying too hard, you can still learn some good life lessons, especially when you play Mikoto's story mode. Until the true successor, if not successful sequel, of Castle Crashers comes to fruition, this game will satisfy any beat-'em-up fans!P.S.: If you purchased the OST with the game, be aware that the Shinjuku and Shrine stage theme is mislabeled as one another. Until that [possibly] gets fixed, make sure to switch the names around to get the names right. Don't worry, the correct music is played in-game. :)"
