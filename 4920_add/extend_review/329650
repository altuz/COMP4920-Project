,Recommended,329650,12917102,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,Aro,"If you are a fan of the early DOS FPS games such as Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, Wolfenstein, Blood etc. thenNamis a must-have for your collection. I was never fortunate enough to own this game when it was released in 1998, but even nowNamis a great example of a challenging(though sometimes punishing)game. This is probably(to my knowledge)the oldest FPS title that has strong ties towards realism.The game is set during the Vietnam War, you fulfill the role of Alan 'The Bear' Westmoreland, a genetically altered Marine Corps sergeant, you are given different tasks and missions throughout the campaign which could simply be for example a case of elimiating all enemies or destroying a stockpile of enemy ammunition in the dense, hectic jungles of Vietnam. But the most important and difficult task is to simply survive what is ahead of you.Namuses the Build Engine, the same used by Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior & Blood, if that wasn't obvious enough, so the mechanics are essentially the same as those in the forementioned games, but the difficulty level(even on the easiest settings)is much, much more prominent inNam. It doesn't take many bullets to kill enemies or yourself, ammunition feels limited and anything explosive will most likely kill you in an instant if you're careless.The game is difficult, which is one of the reasons why I like it. It's not a walk in the park like many other games of the same genre, it is dangerous world in the jungles ofNamwhere Enemy Snipers, Booby-Traps and suicide bombers roam. The graphics however are one of the things that would ever hinderNamfrom getting a 10/10 rating anywhere, even for it's time they were questionable, but could definitely be much worse, the team did a good job with the limited amount of resources they had at their disposal back then.This review ended up being a little bit longer than I had planned, but as there are hardly any reviews as of yet I thought it would be good to give you some more insight regarding this excellent game! So to cut a long story short:Namis a must-have for your collection if you are a fan of old-school FPS shooters and a bonus if you're a fan of a realism factor. Though it's graphics leave much to be desired, it still has that great charm to it that gives you that wonderful nostalgic feeling.Also just for your information, I am playing this on Windows 8 and it works perfectly, despite Windows 8 not being listed on the store page."
,Recommended,329650,13357123,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,c5,"I'm a huge fan of the classic Build Engine shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, so I was surprised that I had never heard of Nam before it popped up on Steam. After playing through the singleplayer campaign, I now know why.The basic shooting action of Nam is enjoyable and I had fun with the game overall, but unfortunately Nam falls into the trap of lazy production and bad game design too often to be considered a true classic. Like i said before, the shooting aspect of this game is solid. Enemies go down in one or two shots and the player character doesn't survive much more, which makes for some tense, thrilling shootouts when the game decides to play fair. The difficulty kind of reminded me of Hotline Miami and this is definitely a game where you'll be saving anytime you kill an enemy. What also impressed me is that even though this is an arcade shooter at heart and not really ""realistic"", the enemy placement does actually seem to conform with the tactics used by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. Usually enemies are hiding around corners or behind plants, meaning they can take you by surprise quite often and you'll oftentimes find yourself shooting blindly into the jungle to try and wipe out as many as you can before walking into their hands. It is these moments when Nam is at its most interesting, and the number of deaths you will go through during the game's 14 or so singleplayer levels will definitely drive home how effective the tactics the Viet Cong used in the Vietnam War were. Beating each level genuinely felt like an accomplishment and trying to get through without dying was an intense game of survival. There are really only three or four kinds of enemies (grunts, suicide bombers, tanks, and snipers), and while I usually rag on games for lack of enemy variety, I didn't feel like that was a detriment here, as the enemies the game does have provide more than enough challenge.Unfortunately, Nam's moments of quality are severely hampered by some bad design decisions and lazy production choices. The main thing that drove me insane in this game were the landmines and airstrikes. Each level is littered with green landmines that blend with the grass. You generally won't see these until it's too late, so tossing some grenades or rockets into an area you're about to enter is advisable. I guess the landmines fit in with the theme of realistic Viet Cong tactics and again it does drive home how hard it would be to survive in such a situation, but from the standpoint of game design they just added cheap fake difficulty and didn't really do anything to make the combat more enjoyable. You'll also find yourself being driven insane by so-called ""friendly"" airstrikes. Throughout the levels, you can find radios to call in an airstrike on the area ahead, which is pretty cool and fun. Unfortunately, this game has tons of airstrikes that you don't call for and these can happen very quickly, giving you little time to take cover sometimes. The game also has a ""bleeding"" mechanic where you can gradually lose health over a period of time, but the bleeding doesn't seem to happen logically. When you get shot, you instantly lose health, but don't bleed. Instead, bleeding seems to be caused by bumping into certain walls and corners, and sometimes by jumping. The fact that the bleeding only seems to happen when your health is in single digits does not help things, and overall it makes for a pointless and annoying mechanic. Furthermore, some of the level designs employ some really bad game design choices. One of the levels near the end has a part where you need to drop down from a fall-damage inducing height not once, but twice in a row, and doesn't give you any compensation for it, which takes a massive chunk of health away from you and made the level unwinnable for me until I reloaded an earlier save where I had more health. With that said, when the levels were good, the shootouts were fun, but this game really does make some boneheaded mistakes that are detrimental to its enjoyment.Furthermore, this game has lots of rough edges and parts where you can obviously see cut-corners and half-implemented ideas. Where other Build games such as Blood and Shadow Warrior had their own identity, this game constantly reminds you that it's basically a mod of Duke Nukem 3D. Lots of sprites and art assets are recycled from Duke, which is fine for some things like environmental textures, but then you've got the shotgun ammo box using the same bright-red sprite as it did in Duke, which doesn't fit in with the Vietnam theme and the general look of the game's new content. The game also uses Duke's grunts of pain when you get shot, which is jarring, as the newly recorded lines for this game's character sound nothing like Duke's voice. As for the new art assets, they really aren't that good, even by build engine standards. Duke, Shadow Warrior, and Blood all had beautiful sprites that make those games look great despite their age. This game (which came out 2 years after Duke) on the other hand looks like most of it was drawn in MS-Paint. The tanks are cartoony and have no presence in the world (previous games on this engine avoided this through skillfully detailed sprites), and while the Viet Cong enemies are reasonably detailed, American forces look downright amateur (although they're kind of cute in a goofy way). Also, the weapons are renders of cheap-looking 3D models and the weapon sprites really haven't been worked with to make them look particularly good in the engine. It might sound harsh to criticize a game from 1998 for its graphics, but compared to games that came out two years before (again, Duke 3D and the like), this game doesn't hold up. The environments aren't bad looking, but that's mainly because they reuse Duke 3D textures.This game did try to add a few interesting things to the Build Engine formula, but unfortunately most of the new features are half-implemented or otherwise broken. One cool thing this game attempts is that it has NPC's who do things and sometimes talk to you. For the characters that give you the mission objectives, this works well, but once you start trying to use the combat NPC's, things fall apart. There's a medic you can talk to who heals you back to full health, and you can ask him to follow you, which is useful and he generally doesn't have any issues navigating flat terrain (although the NPC's can't jump, so they won't follow you through the whole level). Overall, the medic's pretty impressive, so he gets a pass. Next up is the gunner, and this is where everything falls apart. You can ask gunners to follow you around, so you would expect them to provide backup, but unfortunately they don't seem to actually shoot anything, making their entire existance pointless. Furthermore, there are only two or three levels that try to involve these NPCs beyond the briefing guy at the beginning of most levels, so the game really doesn't make use of its friendly NPCs (other than the medic) in any meaningful combat capacity. The game also peppers ""Viet Cong Ammo"" throughout several levels. You can't use it in your own guns, so for half the game, I was wondering what the point was. Then, in exactly one level, I came across a mounted gun that supposedly uses this ammo.  I hit the use key and a message came up saying ""you need Viet Cong Ammo to fire this gun"", even though I literally just picked up some that was lying next to the gun. It's a mechanic that only actually shows up in one level despite being teased in several, only to not work when it does show up.For all the ragging I've done on this game, I did have fun with it when the level design was good, and the bad parts don't destroy it. I wouldn't reccomend it as an introduction to 90's shooters, nor would I say it's worth $7, but if you've already beaten the Build classics and can get it for about $1.70 like I did, it's fun. It's not a classic, but it's not awful either."

I enjoyed the hell out of stuff like Shadow Warrior and Redneck Rampage, and those games had some really frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments. But for a Build Engine (Duke Nukem 3D, etc) game, this game is frustrating as hell and not at all fun.Expect to die a lot by random gunfire, random mortar fire, mines you couldn't see, among many other things. Levels are maze-like and are fairly confusing by shooter standards at the time. Expect to use and abuse the quicksave key if you expect to make progress.This game is basically playing through John Rambo's nightmarish hell over and over again. I swear, I'm probably gonna get PTSD from this damn game.Go play Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior or Blood instead if you want a similar-playing game that's more fun."
,Recommended,329650,26022676,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,ThatDarnOwl,"NAM has a slightly interesting history. It's was an example of a commercial modding team that was given the opportunity to make a full released game. However unlike Team Fortress Classic, it wasn't well regarded and generally faded from the public view.NAM is a pseudo-sequel/pseudo-remake of an earlier total conversion for Duke Nukem 3D called Platoon TC. It is very similar however many of the graphics were completely replaced and the entire game was given new levels. It's so similar that players later ported Platoon TC to NAM.NAM plays almost identically to Duke Nukem 3D. You have a mighty boot (reskinned as a knife), your pistol is a m16, your ripper is an m60, your shotgun is the same, your pipe bombs are grenades etc. The enemies are all vietcong footsoldiers who employ hitscan weapons. Imagine if you played Doom and all of the enemies were shotgun guys and chaingun guys. As a result, the game plays less like a run and gun, and instead more of a ""quicksave constantly"" sort of game.I have to give the developer credit for the attempt but there is a reason why the game was forgotten. It's a very amateur attempt at a first person shooter and released alongside games like Half-Life and Thief the Dark Project.But it goes on sale for 2$ usually, and for the price and the novelty of playing a Vietnam Duke 3D mod I think it's worth it. It also plays beautifully in eduke32 so you get widescreen, good mouse control and a good framerate. So it has aged technically better than some of the other Build engine games like Blood. So it's at least a playable experience, and one that piques your curiosity.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780135993"

This is VERY CHALLENGING and you will find yourself being blown to smitherines often. Remember they are usually US airstrikes so just back off for a bit until the bombs finish dropping then rush in and kill some viet cong. Throughout the game you will receive mission objectives which are awesome. This is a must have for any FPS library. Also look for its sequel WWII GI, which is for another totally different review. It is amazing what you can accomplish in the build engine, and NAM proves that it isn't just Duke Nukem. 5.5 two thumbs up"
,Recommended,329650,13351798,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Fractal Fischer,"These are my fiist impressions after an hour with NAM.  First off, It's a Build engine game, so right off the bat I knew I would get at least some enjoyment out of it.  If you love Duke Nukem 3D and can't get enough even with all the add ons and community maps, then for a a few bucks during a Steam Sale I'd say go for it.  Everyone else, best pass.  NAM is basically a cross between Duke 3D and a campy Reb Brown war movie but without the budget and polish of either.  It's super cheesy to an enjoyable point how seriously it seems they were trying to take the Vietnam War immersion, but that's also it's main downfall.  Let's be totally fair though, how many great Vietnam War games do you know of?  It's not exactly a theme destined for any Game of the Year awards...The Pros:-It's a build engine game and unavoidable for fans of the style for that reason alone, at least in my opinion-The theme is so-bad-its-good territory with ridiculous sound effects and ""story elements"", i.e. badly acted war movie tropes played out by pixelated soldier with 2 frames of animation and blank expressions like simpletons.-Level design is at least a bit interesting.  Seems like they put some effort into it, despite some glaring flaws (see below).-Configuration, while super old-school, is robust enough to set your controls like a modern FPS with WASD and mouse aiming.-Cheap, at least when it's on saleThe Cons:-The level designer was a huge troll.  This is by far the biggest flaw in the game, making it a bit of a save crawl and extremely frustrating on a regular basis.  Mines are almost impossible to see, enemies are almost impossible to see, and most of all, there are air strikes.  Considering you can't look or down easily, you are going to die randomly and unavoidably because of these damned airstrikes.  While not a total deal-killer, I've so far found myself just done with it after only 20 minutes at a time.  I'd play a lot longer in a sitting if it'd just stop♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off for a 5 minutes now and then.-The sound is just sort of all around bad.  Don't get me wrong, that's part of the fun here too, but the background soundclips are just so inappropriate for ambience because you just can't tell if gunshots are actually being fired at you.  Also, get ready to hear ""MEDIC!"" being shrieked at you every 30 seconds in a weird distorted voice oddly reminiscent of a cat being stepped on.-You'll need to ok with running a 1990s style DOS setup to change pretty much anything besides volume and gamma.  You'll also need to muck about in the controls a bit to update everything to a more sensible scheme for modern mouse and keyboard gameplay.  I'm not sure why, but I also have to run this every single time I play because the game won't start if you try and just go straight into it.  Odd.In summary, if you like old-school shooters and 90s cheese, and you're not too prone to rage quitting, it's worth picking up on sale.  Not sure I'd have paid the full $7 for it, but it's a good distraction for a half hour at a time.  I wouldn't so much describe it as ""quality"" (or ""playtested"") but it's at least competent enough for some mindless fun, and if you've already worn out Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior you might as well give this one a go."

The controls are awful and you can't change them, the graphics are an indistinguishable gray mess and you will not get a good framerate on DOSbox.  However this can be remedied quite simply by downloading the eduke32 engine and dragging the required gamefiles onto the .exe.  After swapping out the engine I realized that this game is actually quite good once the technical difficulties are resolved.  Especially in hindsight with all the other failed Vietnam themed games out there.  This game gets a lot of things right. Enemies hide behind trees, pop out of foxholes and sometimes seem to materalize out of thin air. the area is constantly being bombareded by aircraft and artillery, friendly fire is common and can go both ways, the M16 is a piece of crap that will ""jam"" on you at the wrong moment and get you killed (in this game you can't reloaded it manually, so you'll often pull the trigger only to reload, but like I said this does have a real life equivalent), stepping in the wrong place will activate a mine and insta-kill you. This game is hard, you will die a lot, you will learn to take cover, to fire blindly at bushes, to lob grenades like a madman and to never stay in one place for too long.  The sound in this game is actually quite good, even today. Airstrikes are looming and bombs are always going off, radio chatter is constant and enemy banter and gunfire is everywhere, it sounds like a warzone.  Again once I learned to play it right, in the Eduke32 engine with the music tunred off, and the doors in the background for atmosphere, I found myself really enjoying this game. It feels like a well thought out Duke3D mod and it feels like NAM."

First time I played this, I thought I got the use of the controls and stuff at least, but I did!Nam is pretty much Duke Nukem fighting alien scum in the city, but instead, it is changed into a World War theme and you are Sergeant Westmoreland bringing down soldiers in the Viet Cong. You can pretty much die easily if you dunno what to do, so as the game says; survive!8/10 is what I give for this game."
,Recommended,329650,22949527,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,Kyrii,"DOWNLOAD EDUKE32 BEFORE PLAYINGSeriously, EDUKE32 is a fantastic Build Engine Emulator and runs NAM like a charm. Comes with console commands, anti-aliasing, mouse movement and much more smooth jazz!With that in mind, playing NAM through EDUKE32 isn't required but it is great for those who are on a nostalgia binge and can't get past the state of the current game.NAM itself started out as a Duke Nukem total-conversion called ""Platoon"" and was pretty damn good for what it was, and while I'm not sure what led the dev team to jump into the indie-scene I'm quite glad they did, even if their product was panned at the time of release for it's engine and graphics.Gameplay wise, NAM is quite hard and in some areas is unfair, with airstrikes routinely killing you moreso then the Vietcong scrambling out of the woodwork. However, the meaty gunplay and pretty damn articulate level design (for the build engine) kept dragging me back in. The Story included in the original manual is laughable but is not necessary to enjoy the game entirely. Just shoot VC and don't get blown up.Graphics and sound is pretty good for the build engine but those who judge by graphics will not be pleased, as even at the time of release NAM wasn't the best looker.Long story short, NAM is a brainless shooter and has a certain niche amongst older FPS fans and is a favorite in the Duke Nukem modding scene. So grab both NAM and Eduke and kick back for a couple of hours, but make sure to watch your head, those damn airstrikes will certainly get you more then once."

For me this is a sign of a good game (they get you hooked right from the start) Make sure you save often, as there's a number of mines and traps you can't see while crossing open ground.  Enemies often hide behind trees and shrubs (like real life) so it's best to proceed with caution (as it's easy to die.)  Money well spent here.

You right click on the game in Steam and select configuration.  It will then load the original DOS based config screen where you can edit controls and resolution.  A source port is not required to remap the controls.)Still better than Call of Duty.   lolAbout the context of the games original release:This is from back in the late 90's.  Quake 2, Half-Life , and Unreal were out and the Build engine may have been ""old"" and outdated, but gamers weren't quite as snobby and picky back then.  Most of us pc gaming kids only had what PC our parents bought and were happy for anything that ran on them.   Honestly, we were still enjoying games made with the Build engine even after it was outdated.    It was a solid engine that ran fast on almost anything over a 50 or 66 mhz CPU.About the game itself:I personally passed on NAM back when it was in a large cardboard box on the pc gaming shelves of Wal-Mart and Electronics Boutique.  Being used to the more imaginative content of the ID software and 3D Realms games, a FPS set in an ""authentic"" setting based on historic events sounded boring to me.     Fast forward a decade and a few years, and I'm hunting down old 90's games I passed on just for nostalgia.NAM is pretty impressive for a Build engine game.    The norm for any Build engine game (and almost any other FPS) from the 90's was to copy the Doom formula of gameplay.  ""All by yourself, find the keys to open the doors to exit the level while shooting all the monsters.""NAM is on a scale beyond DN3D and it's Build engine brothers.   You've got actual air strikes with jets flying over. (triggered by the player a lot of the time), NPC's that help the player fight or replenish health (which can be told to follow or hold position).  A lot more speech and dialog than in the typical FPS of the era.  As well as the most convincing jungle that the Build engine could probably handle.  (most FPS of that era all took place in mostly indoor areas of metal and concrete.)I think it's pretty fun in the same way that Shadow Warrior, Blood, DN3D, Redneck Rampage, Doom, Quake, Heretic, and Hexen are.    If you're used to nothing but modern FPS then you'll be lost and confused as there is no arrow pointing where to go and no NPC holding your hand and dragging you through the game.  You can die pretty quickly after you spawn on the first level.  You just have to learn the rules of survival for this particular game and figure out a strategy to avoid cheap death.   (although it really aids in the atmosphere of chaos and panic of Vietnam)  I quickly learned that you need to try to keep your back to the walls and stay low as much as possible, as the NK respawns and likes to ambush you around corners.  Also, random mortar shellings often strike out in the open.Yeah.  NAM is a fun sprite based 90's FPS that doesn't totally follow the game design trends of the era."

That's certainly audacious, and the audacity only increases when you actually get a look at the game. It's a cheap Duke Nukem 3D ripoff set in the Vietnam War with lots of reused assets and mechanics, and its problems don't end there.There's mouselook, but it's not vertically enabled and the game doesn't recognize WASD or let you change the controls. Because of this, I at first had to manage with DOOM-style arrow keys and vertical auto-aim. I tried to change the key bindings in the game's files, but that caused it to crash. Later, I found out that you can change the keys in the config option on the Steam menu when you try to launch the game, but it took way too long to figure that out and it still doesn't have vertical mouselook.The game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (that is to say, unfair difficulty). Explosions that can instantly kill you are constantly happening everywhere, from either random air strikes that seem to target you specifically, rockets fired from enemies halfway across the map, or land mines. Now, land mines are a weapon that instantly kill or incapacitate anything that steps on the nondescript section of ground they're in. They're an effective weapon in real life, but they're the very height of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty game design. You never know in NAM if the next step you take will arbitrarily kill you with no warning whatsoever, which is unbelievably terrible. Add to this enemies (a whole two kinds!) that are really hard to see but can take off a third of your health with one shot scattered all over the place and spawned seemingly infinitely (even though you only have finite ammunition), and the game can become un-♥♥♥♥ing-playable at times. All you can really do is spray your M-60 in all directions and save every 5 seconds. At the start of the fifth level, there's an unavoidable ambush that I found literally impossible to survive, and that's when I turned Godmode on and never looked back.As I said, the game uses a lot of Duke Nukem's stuff, often without actually needing to. I can count the number of times the player needs the Use button on two hands, and there are plenty of weapons even though you can get through the game just fine with only the M-60.The game looks and sounds ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well. 2.5D is not good for rendering forests and trees, but that's about 80% of this game's level design. There's a near-constant wall of white noise composed entirely of explosions, automatic gunfire, and meaningless radio chatter. I'm not even certain if the game has music, and if it is, I'm pretty sure it was ripped off from Duke Nukem 3D.I'm not sure if the game is racist, but if I had to guess I'd say kinda. I'd be sure if I could find out whether the enemies are screaming actual Vietnamese or just gibberish.Thank God it's short, with two episodes of 7-8 levels each, and each level being about 15 minutes long, less if you're Godmoding it up.In short, NAM is a pretty solid reenactment of the Vietnam War; unfortunately, the Vietnam War was a horrible place where you could die at any time for a stupid reason. I'm not sure how or why it's on Steam."

Fun shooting mechanics, good variety of weapons, and decently designed levels. It has a lot of flaws, but nothing that completely ruins the experience as long as you go in expecting a very very hard game. Not worth 7 dollars, but if you see it on sale it's worth a look if you've already played all the other Build engine games."

I own both Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior and they have flawless controls. Blood on here has customizable controls....but for some odd reason it won't let you (me) use the mouse buttons to actually change anything. So I'm stuck with remapping the controls strictly with the keyboard which has mixed results. Which brings me to NAM....which has the worst controls that I've ever had to endure....and there is no changing them. So you are stuck with moving via the arrow keys....jumping with the A (!!!) key.....and firing with Ctrl. I didn't bother to learn any of the other keys because I kept getting killed by random mortar fire. What is really interesting....is that you can get within a few feet of the mortar team that is causing you so much grief....but they are invulnerable. I bought this for $.49 cents and I still feel ripped off.

This is basically a Duke Nukem 3D MOD for people who take war far too seriously.I am not one of those people.I'd never have even heard of this MOD if it weren't for eDuke32 - I wonder if perhaps some of the same developers worked on it. Actually, I don't think I should call it a MOD as it's a standalone game which doesn't require Duke to play. BUT - it's not quite a Total Conversion as there are still some elements of Duke's art and SFX in Nam.But yeah. It's a drab, deadly serious attempt at recreating the Vietnam war experience in the Build engine. It's playable, but it's VERY difficult - downright unfair at times. Perhaps that's the idea. I don't know. I like Duke because of it's hyper-realism. I don't buy games to simulate real life. That's what real life is for. And war is an element of real life I certainly don't want to experience.If you do... then go for it. Knock yourself out. But I'm sure there are better war games out there."

You are always meeting new people, having to sell yourself and your skills, and often getting the third degree about what you know or don't know. And, you have to stay upbeat and enthusiastic throughout each interview.Here are job interview tips to help prepare you to interview effectively. Proper preparation will help alleviate some of the stress involved in job interviews and the more you prepare, the more comfortable and successful you will be interviewing.Here are 7 Job interview TipsPracticePractice answering interview questions and practice your responses to the typical job interview questions and answers most employers ask. Think of concrete examples you can use to highlight your skills. Providing evidence of your successes is a great way to promote your candidacy. Also have a list of your own questions to ask the employer ready.ResearchDo your homework about the employer and the industry so you are ready for the question What do you know about this company? Know the interviewer's name and use it during the job interview. If you're not sure of the name, call and ask prior to the interview. Try to relate what you have learned about the company when answering questions.Get ReadyMake sure your interview attire is neat, tidy and appropriate for the type of firm you are interviewing with. Bring a nice portfolio with copies of your resume. Include a pen and paper for note taking.Be On TimeBe on time for the interview. On time means five to ten minutes early. If need be, take some time to drive to the interview location ahead of time so you know exactly where you are going and how long it will take to get there. Here's more on preparing for an interview.Stay CalmDuring the job interview try to relax and stay as calm possible. Remember that your body language says as much about you as your answers to the questions. Proper preparation will allow you to exude confidence. Take a moment to regroup. Maintain eye contact with the interviewer. Listen to the entire question (active listening) before you answer and pay attention - you will be embarrassed if you forget the question. Check out these tips for avoiding job interview stress to help stay calm. Also review our interview tips for introverts.Show What You KnowTry to relate what you know about the company when answering questions.  When discussing your career accomplishments match them to what the company is looking for. Use examples from your research when answering questions, “I noticed that when you implemented a new software system last year, your customer satisfaction ratings improved dramatically. I am well versed in the latest technologies from my experience with developing software at ABC, and appreciate a company who strives to be a leader in its industry.” Here's how to make a match between your expertise and the company's requirements.Follow UpAlways follow-up with a thank you note reiterating your interest in the position. You can also include any details you may have forgotten to mention during your interview. If you interview with multiple people send each one a personal thank you note. Send your thank you note (email is fine) within 24 hours of your interview."

In addition to the maps, all the other assets from weapons to enemies reek of authenticity. The biggest problem is the punishing difficulty level; hitscan enemies that can see you through thick vegetation while you cannot see them aren't really the most fun to fight against (and neither are landmines or mortar bombardments), so you're probably better off playing this on easy straight away. Anyway, this is pretty much as close as one can get to a jungle-warfare experience in this graphics engine so grab it if you're okay with 8-bit graphics and looking for a challenge."
