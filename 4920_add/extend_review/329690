,Recommended,329690,24209934,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Gunderson Mallard,"BasketBelle is a brief, endearing adventure with heart and style.Despite the name, BasketBelle is not filled with basketball in the typical sense. Small parts of the game have you playing some one on one, but mostly this a whimsical bit of puzzle platforming. In this linear experience, some reflex is involved in order to traverse the various platforms and pathways. Shooting the ball takes a bit more effort and aim, but feels satisfying. The few matches of basketball present in the game are fair and not too challenging. Players will find themselves dribbling, hopping on platforms, and making shots in mostly surreal environments with many hues of purple. The controls can feel wonky at times, but this isn’t meant to a demanding experience like Super Meat Boy, so it never really felt like a major issue. Instead, this is one of those games that’s more for the experience than to challenge the player. The experience is definitely enjoyable, but on the shorter side of just around an hour or two.The pacing of the game suits the length well, so there is very little downtime between levels and cuts of narrative. The game feels like it’s constantly in motion, save for the few more puzzle oriented levels, but even at its most difficult it can still probably be enjoyed by wide range of skill levels and age groups. The story follows a young boy trying to save his sister as she is kidnapped by a purple blob. Despite the rather simple and lighthearted presentation, BasketBelle manages to pinch at emotions carefully and confidently. At its heart the familial narrative is touching and pleasant. There is no fiery grandeur in the prose or obscurity in the delivery, but it is refreshing and sincere.BasketBelle is a short and simple treat. The novel art style does an excellent job carrying the game’s experience and the music accompanies well. The length is not enough to cavil about, but the controls might be enough to put off those not charmed by BasketBelle’s winsome visuals and character. BasketBelle is concise and splendid."

My second gripe is the controls.This game certainly has some quirky indie storytelling love that I have to give it credit for.It tells a fairly uplifting story about a family.Pros:+Great music and ambience+Great story that is very positive and uplifting+Its short, which I like for indie titles - leave me slightly wanting more instead of wearing out the welcomeCons:-Controls are awful - I want to use AWSD instead of arrow keys, and also - jump is the same button as shoot which is screwy, although that is part of the puzzle I guess-No full screen modefull screen mode is hard to find but you just push 'f' apparently, and the window is not resizable which means I am only using literally 1/4 my screen-$5 is a bit overpriced considering what other games you can get for thisGreat excercise in indie game storytelling, but the awful controls with the puzzle component drove me to not recommend it."

,Recommended,329690,33170382,Posted: 2 July,all,ThePenguin,"BasketBelle is an appetizer of a game. It won't wow you but it's an enjoyable little 30 minute game. It's a fun and refreshing idea to make a puzzle/platforming game about Basketball. The game looks and plays like a flash game you would've found on the Internet.I wouldn't say that BasketBelle is a game you have to go out of your way to play, but on sale it's €0.99. It's totally worth that.3 out of 5 stars."
,Recommended,329690,35056834,Posted: 18 September,all,RipWitch,"The power of basketball will bring my family back togetherI’m not a person that’s big on sports. I find them boring to watch. The only time I actually went to a live game was due to it being a school trip so why not go. When I did try a sports game years ago I did not see the appeal to buy it and keep playing it. I’m not sure why I decided to pick up BasketBelle when I did, but I do not regret it.While this may be a sports game, it does not primarily focus on Basketball, but the story. You play as the older brother whose father just gave him his own basketball and afterwards a game of Basketball with your little sister, Basketbelle. In the middle of the game, the basketball bounces out of the court and while you were retrieving it, Basketbelle goes missing. Not wanting to go in without Basketbelle, and feeling something wrong is happening, you follow a trail to bring her back.Each chapter has it’s own way of incorporating Basketball directly with what is happening. You might be going against an opponent traditionally, but it will occasionally change that depending on what happened. Such as when you were swallowed, you transverse the insides that would turn into a short puzzle platformer section so you can pave an empty path to throuw your basketball. No matter what, you will get what you have to do easily and the game is responsive enough for you to do move at the last second. Which is good considering there will be many situations where you will have to slide under something, or someone, and jump over obstacles to throw or dunk your basketball to score a point.This is a very beautiful game, both in sound, visuals, and the story it provides. As someone that do not seek to play sport games, this was one that I couldn’t help but finish in one setting. I had to see what happened to Basketbelle and the hardships you had to face to get to her. You also easily get the strong feeling of family and the love that they all have for each other that drove your character to seek out his sister as far as he does. Granted this might not be worth $5 with how short this is, I do recommend picking this up when you see it on sale."

A strange mix of genres such as ""puzzle/platforming with basket-ball mechanics"" has everything to fail; yet it gave life to a great experimental game. If you like ""artsy"" experiences that work, this game is a must. It's short and sweet."

I really like the artistic elements of the game. The visuals are superb, as I said, the story is touching and the audio is pretty neat as well. The only real downside is the gameplay itself. Apart from the, more or less, innovative basketball elements, it's a poorly made puzzle platformer. Terrible optimization and the control is even worse."

The sound design is spot on with the visuals, so every action the player takes feels incredibly responsive, you could almost play this game with your eyes closed thanks to how distinct the audio cues are.I greatly appreciate the length of it as well, each level plays with a core mechanic a bit, you learn how to do something and then you move on. There's nothing repetitive about it and that's how I like my games. Doing things over and over becomes a chore and this neatly avoids that."

The mix of ambient sound and hip-hop beats really sets the tone for the game. However, the gameplay falls apart because of the unresponsive, clunky controls. I felt extremely frustrated playing Chapters 3, 5, 6, and 7 and beating those chapters was based more on luck than skill. The gameplay concept in Chapter 2, combining puzzle-platforming with shooting a basketball, is interesting, but the rest of the chapters were unoriginal (one chapter is basically Flappy Bird). As for the story, it was.. fine? Scrolling through the other reviews I'm clearly in the minority but I didn't find the story particularly memorable, charming, or interesting.To sum up my opinion, great visuals and music but the gameplay really ruined my experience."
