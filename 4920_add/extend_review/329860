We're basically going for more ""funny"" and a bit less ""ridicule"" here by adding motion controls in this physics sandbox game.  The VR experience was mesmerizing enough to land me nearly an hour of gameplay in my first two tries.My only complaint would be, having an extremely substandard amount of space to play in (to the point where Room Scale setup in SteamVR won't let me finish the config) that the teleport feature likes to land you too far away from objects, resulting in a few accidental *real* object battings :-) It might make the game slightly easier to allow us to land right next to stuff, but it'll also be more fun that way.I'll try to give this a good shot in a larger space at one point. I just WISH I had the room to go nuts and unleash the fury.* Thanks to every anti VR shill who indiscriminately downvote VR based reviews. <3"

There's just not enough of a variety of tasks.A great game to vent some frustration out on since all you do is destroy things.Good in small doeses.Levels are fun and interesting but it's really the game mode. All you do is smash and knock things over, which is fine, but even the event's in the game are pretty shallow. Catch the mouse takes a few seconds to do, but the frequency for the events are few and far between that most of the time I just ignore them and focus on the objective.If there was some other danger to be aware of, like maybe a rampaging human that comes in early you need to hide to avoid, or another pet you can chase or be chased by.They did great on this, but it seems like there is a huge potential for more stuff."

There's something to just knocking everything all and about as a cat and causing massive chaos all over the place, even if the games variety doesn't stand up over a period of time. It's the perfect game in my mind to pick up on sale: or if you need a stress reliever right now, or ever really wanted to be a cat persay. There's some interesting elements for the genre like being able to open areas and the extra type levels like the super market, even if some of the areas are really really hard to get to. Overall, solid game that's worth taking a look at as a destresser tool.+:Lots of cat pictures. I mean, that's what you're here for in the end, right?Good physics for what you want out of a game like this (not necessarily realistic, but goes to the side of fun)Objectives add variety that the game desperately needed.Love the findable missions like the supermarkat.Randomly Generated Events keep things fresh and interesting. Particularly a fan of Moon GravityLike the openable cabinets and various items.Great destresser.Upgrades worth something.-:Some Strange jumping angles in particular with multi-layered overhead cabinets that can be frustrating to get to.While it has procedurally generated levels, they start to feel the same rather quickly in terms of basic layout.Really wish that one of the unlockable cats was a sabertooth tiger.Not really much more then knocking♥♥♥♥♥♥over simulator.Some reasonable bugs at times, like not being able to jump.For Gameplay footage and more verbal first impressions:http://youtu.be/xWp40YM1AXc"

,Recommended,329860,19362142,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,GLaDOStheFrog,"Catlateral Damage ReviewThis game is a masterpiece.Nothing else comes close to it. In Catlateral Damage, one plays as a cat, with the sole task of doing exactly what cats do best: knocking stuff on the floor.GameplayThe gameplay is well done, with everything working as it should. It's a simple idea, literally all you do is walk and jump and swat. But the developers have done a fantastic job with this, the only problem is getting used to the jump height. Now, I don't know much about cats, but being able to jump more than half a metre off the ground seems like a lot to me. This means that you'll often mess up your jumps and fail to get onto ledges and tables.The way everything falls seems very real and is wholly satisfying. The upgrades and power-ups are useful, but really only a minor thing in the game, and the developers have avoided making the aim of the game to be getting all the upgrades, something that just wouldn't seem right in a game like this.The events are an extremely fun thing that just happen every so often, randomly. Things like moon gravity, or killing the little red lights, or a disco. They just make you laugh when they happen.Aim of the GameThe aim of the game is to knock everything on the floor, and to unlock cat photos. And boy, are there a lot of cat photos.The game is collection based, where you build a collection of items to drop on the floor. They are divided into multiple categories, such as appliances, clothes, etc.GamemodesThere are two gamemodes; Objective mode and Litterbox mode.In Objective mode, you are placed into a randomly generated location, and you have to knock a set amount of items onto the floor within a time limit.In Litterbox mode, you go to that location again, without the time limit. The aim is to knockevery single itemin the location onto the floor. There is no time limit, but that doesn't mean it's easy, especially in the Supermarket and Mewseum, which have several thousand objects each!Level DesignThe levels are randomly generated, with the exceptions of the Supermarket and Mewseum. These two are the same every time, but are so big and awesome that you wouldn't notice.The levels are well made, and you can always find some totally cat-like way of climbing up to every shelf or wardrobe. The feeling you get from succesfully parcour-ing up to the highest shelf in a room is immensly satisfactory.Graphics/VisualsThe graphics are not great. They are simplistic and there are no fancy lighting effects. That is not to say it doesn't look nice, because it still does. It has it's own unique style, and I personally find that it is still aesthetically pleasing.The texturing and modelling on the objects is very basic, just boxes with coloured rectangles, but you can always tell what the objects are meant to be.PerformanceThe game runs surprisingly well. I have two copies of it on two separate computers; one for myself and one for my sister. I play on a 2010 MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM, a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and an NVidia GeForce 320M. The game runs smoothly at the highest graphics settings (called Purrfect). For my other copy, I'm using a 2007 Intel iMac, with 2GB of RAM, a 2.8 GHz single-core processor and an integrated Intel graphics card. It lags on anything other than the lowest graphics setting, but runs them extremely smoothly, at roughly 35 FPS, solidly. The game will lag on occasion, but only when you're knocking around ten items into the air simultaneously (this usually only happens on bookshelfs).Misc.There are many random things about this which I like, but do not, however, fit into any of the main categories.Trading Cards - everyone loves Steam Trading Cards, right?Achievments - a way to show how far you've comeThe 'f' key - pressing it can do three different things:On large objects, you bite themOn smaller objects, you pick them up in your mouthWithout an object, you just meowThere are Atari 2600s - everyone's favourite games consoleTHE CONCLUSIONThis games is fantastic for just messing around in, good for stress relief or if you're having a bad day and just can't quite complete that mission in Jedi Academy. The price of £6.99 is a bit much for what it is, though, so wait untill it's on sale to purchase it, but when it is on sale, purchase it immediately!"

See more below)The game has an FOV slider, but even when it's maxed to 110 it gave me nausea, and I'm not playing with VR (oh gosh, it must be a nightmare with VR).Of course, motion sickness doesn't affect everyone. Before buying you can take a test:Download and play Creativerse (it's free):http://store.steampowered.com/app/280790/Creativerse/If you get motion sickness on Creativerse, you will get here as well, since on these two games you have to jump a lot in a first person view. Again, I usually don't get motion sickness and can play even FPS with head bobbing, but these two games are the exception.All in all, this game is great, but I can't recommend something that can make you sick.I hope some day the devs revisit this idea, but in a third person mode :)"

This game drives you to be the super hyper 'destroy all belongings' cat, that my cat will never be, as he is a super fat and lazy cat and I nickname him Garfield because of his resembalence to Garfield. But this game as mentioned by plenty others gets repetitive somewhat quickly, so I wouldn't play just to complete the game in one sitting, as the game ispurrfectlysuited to play for short 30 minute-2 hour intervals depending on how long you can handle being a cat without the urge for milk.It's a good relief from other animal type simulators as it's goal isn't to make a buggy game that isn't actually buggy but those events are suppose to happen, but it's a polished game with tons of enjoyment to be had, and I would recommend this game for all lazy cats who wish to be active, or just regular people who just think this game looks like fun."

How dare they! I might just leave a hair ball on your pillow while I'm at it!While you're giving a bookshelf one of these and the fresh laundry one of those, take your paws on a exploration of your surroundings to ruin everything. Because you can.Because you're a cat.Use your mouse and keyboard to make a mess. Collect power-ups to stay in the game and rack up points so you can unlock new cats and secret levels. Sounds easy enough in theory. In practice, you're going to be starting over multiple times until you can master the feeling of being a cat in your surroundings. Once you find yourself in a groove and get the general idea of what you're doing, you'll be racking up points (and messes), and enjoying your new life as a new cuddly demonic furball that everyone can't help but love. You know, even if you busted that tablet for some points.Personally, I've been using this game to help with some physical therapy. Remembering to use left or right paw became a little irritating on my behalf because it did matter and sometimes picking the wrong paw to bat and swat with would make my life very difficult. Sometimes, going straight was the best choice. You do have to pay attention (sometimes) rather than make a haphazard mess. Sure it really is fun just to let everything fly, but when you need certain individual items, it actually matters. Mouse and keyboard aren't too exhausting to learn, but if you have any sort of disability or condition that flares up in your hand, reconsider or give yourself frequent breaks.This game also includes a lot of flashing light segments. There is a disco power up as well as a catnip high. This can be disabled via the pause menu if you are sensitive to flashing lights due to epilepsy, seizures, or migraines. Having the option to turn it off is amazing. Sure, I'm a person who does have this health risk so I'm already a fan. However, even a ""normal"" person can have a day where lights are a bit more bothersome and while we can handle a video game, the intense flashing is pushing it. Turning it off until we feel better is that great option to have. For this, I'm not only thankful, but I'm singing my praises about.Catlateral Damage is an incredibly lighthearted game. You don't have to be completely serious to make a game good. Your objective doesn't have to be serious, either. It's a cat making a mess. You really don't have to improve much on that. With the various backdrops you explored, I was starting to wonder if poor kitty was being rehomed to unknowing owners who weren't prepared for the master mess-maker. You can fill in your own storyline this way, but it really doesn't matter. Perhaps it's funny. Maybe it's a little ""trendy"" because the internet was created for two things and one of them was certainly cat pictures. You may leave the second option up to your imagination because I'm certain you're all smart folks.An almost $10 seems a bit steep to just wreck a house, I'll admit, but if it's your type of game, it's very much worth it. You'll get replayability out of it and then some. Great and safe for your junior spawnling gamers, safe (with adjustments) for those of us with some handicaps, and a good way to blow off some steam if your usual games are making you ragequit. This is my current go-to game."

,Recommended,329860,23965254,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Drakool,"First of all, I wanted to thank the developers for creating such an amazing game, and now let's get into it!If you REALLY love cats then look no further! Catlateral Damage is the perfect game for you, my dear cat lover friend!The game's been created by Chris Chung in honour of his cat Nippy (1997-2014), and thanks to him we, you can now play as one of those furious cats whose owners made the mistake of leaving them home alone.And as I said, they're no normal cats! They were just waiting for the right moment to go on a rampage and knock everything they can knock onto the floor, that meaning all they can find, leaving nothing but a huge mess behind them... and imagine when the owner comes back home and finds his house completely messed up, everything's on the floor, something's even broken and his cat's quietly spleeping in his box... that would drive each and everyone of us crazy, wouldn't it?And that's exactly what YOU have to do! In this awesome first-person cat simulator you play as a cute kitten whose objective is to knock as much as possible right onto the floor, leaving a mess your owner is then supposed to clean up. Forget you're a human! You're cat now! You'll see the world from the perspective of a cat, you'll walk, jump, crouch, think and act like an annoying (but cute!) little kitten whose weapons are his paws, his little mouth and his furry soft body. Aside the main task you'll have to complete to complete the level, under the quest are shown two objects: the one on the left gives extra points when knocked onto the ground, while the right one will give you a free upgrade when a certain amount of it will be destroyed by your little paws.In the levels there are games you can play with to obtain a perk for one of the three categories, which are jump, speed and swat. There are also events, such as free upgrades, glowing red dots, mice, disco, moon gravity, force shield and power outage.Oh, and don't forget about those 267 (have fun ^.^) photos you can find while running through the levels, remember to knock them off the walls or the shelves in order to unlock them. Those photos portrait cats, dogs, and a few other house pets.There are two game modes you can play: Objective Mode and Litterbox Mode:-In Objective mode you're given an amount of time and a definite number of things (such as 190 objects in 5 minutes) you'll have to knock onto the ground before the time runs out. Every game is composed of five levels during which you'll be given different tasks and optional objectives and.. don't tell anyone, but you can also find a christmas tree that will lead you to a special christmas-themed level, a tyrannosaurus that will lead you to the Mewseum where you'll have to destroy objects worth a certain amount of dollars, a shopping cart that will lead you to the Supermarkat where you'll have to destroy a couple of specific products, some kind of cat boxes that will lead you to the Cardboard Box Paradise and finally an object I haven't manage to unlock yet that will lead you straight to the Furightful Lab.- Litterbox Mode is quite different, you don't have time nor an amount of things to destroy, your box is already open, what you're supposed to do here is to knock onto the floor what you want to and then leave whenever you want. In this mode you can select the level you want to play and there'll be no events (I'm an idiot, there ARE events!), you can take all the time you want, no one's telling you to hurry, just: relax, take it eeeaaasy! (I love Mika ^.^)You may be concerned there aren't a lot of levels and it's true, but! they change every time due to the procedural generation of the levels. You surely will play the same level multiple times but it will always have something different since last time you played it. Anyway what I liked the most about this game is the soundtrack. That has to be said, it's just f*cking awesome! You have to love it! It is at your side for all the time you'll be playing, it never bores you and what about those meows you can hear by pressing F? Ahhh so sweet, as soon as I'm done I'm going to pet my little Kitten. The cartoon-based graphic? Lovely, it really fits the game, you don't need anything too sophisticated to make a wonderful game and Catlateral Damage IS a wonderful game!Ok.. I'm tired.. I've been writing for more than an hour.. you know what? I'm almost done, and I also believe you're tired of me already... ok let's end this.Just buy and enjoy this awesome game.End of the story.

I like this game, a lot, I really do, but in its current state and at its current price I just can't fully recommend it. I bought it because I saw JoshJepson play it on YouTube, and it looked like fun... and it is! It really is! But it's just not enough fun and it's definitely not with $10! Thankfully I got it on a 50% off sale... but I still even hesitate to say it's worth $5. With the small amount of content and replayability it has now it's maybe worth $3.What would make it better, and push me to fully recommend it, is if it had more levels, with more objects and special elements, and more cats and maybe if the cats had different special abilities. Most of the varying events that happen and achievements things that you can unlock have little effect on the gameplay and are not very rewarding. Also, another big thing it's missing for me is multiplayer. I would love to be able to play in a map with friends playing other cats helping me knock stuff over, or in a race to see who can destroy the most stuff or whatever.So in short -+ fun-sounding music+ fun idea+ fun to be a cat+ fun!- the fun gets old fast- not enough content to be worth the price- different cats have no special abilities- not much variation in gameplay- no multiplayerIf you really want it, get it on a sale.

Your motives for doing this are announced in the beginning of each level, and are appropriately catty, including such gems as ""My wet food tastes terrible! Those humans will pay!""You're offered two modes of play - Objective and Litterbox. Objective Mode throws you a timer and a certain amount of objects to topple; a single campaign requiring a player to complete 5 objectives - or 5 houses - successfully before the time runs out. You can additionally play with ""cat toys"" (put in quotes because some of these include scratching posts and litterboxes; others are houseplants and toilet paper, which many people do not consider conventional toys for their feline) to earn power-ups that can make you jump higher, move faster, and swipe at objects harder. You're also encouraged to collect cat photos, as doing so unlocks new cats to play as and two achievements!Litterbox Mode, meanwhile, sets you loose in any house you desire to destroy stuff at your leisure.Both modes are subject to randomized ""events"" that occur; these vary vastly, from ""Moon Gravity"" and ""Disco"" to ""Kill the red dots"" and ""Catch the mouse"". Every house is also proceedurally-generated, so there are different objects to wreck every time you play, although the layout of the furniture, as far as I can tell, stays the same. My only beef with the game is that there isn't more of it; there're only a handful of houses to run amok in currently, with four or so interesting add-ons, like the Mewseum and Supermarcat. The game is fun, but since it's so small, that can only go so far; if you're not very bored and very into cats and/or pure destruction, this probably isn't the game for you.TL;DR: This game is so good; the purest cat game you will ever get your hands on.

This is a game that has a Disco Mode... and also has an option on the menu toentirely disable Disco mode forever.The main, timed game is cleverly self-limiting--four timed trials with potential unlock of a special level--so you have a good stopping point and might not end up swatting things off shelves all day.As an extremely casual gamer, one of my criteria is whether a game lets you unlock photos of the devs' kitties. This one does, as well as real cat-based alternate skins.  Sadly, there is no 3rd person view at this time, but otherwise there is excellent cat content throughout."

Chris Chung and Fire Hose Games have done all three of these things in the magnum opus that is Catlateral Damage. For centuries scholars have pondered over our feline friends ""What do they think about while we are away"" ""How do they keep themselves entertained"" and ""Why do they hate me"". Mr Chung has dug deep into the mind of the Felis Catus in search of such answers and revealed them to us throughout each unique handcrafted level ""because they hate us"". Perhaps it was stale water or tasteless food or maybe it was our poor choice in household furnishings, all questions become clear as you play as a simple household feline overcoming overwhelming odds... by wrecking everything in the house With tight controls and an amazing soundtrack the immersion is so ""life like"" you yourself will put off by stale water or a sudden change of diet. In the end you will find that these fuzzy jerks are justified when it comes to venting their rage and in many ways Catlateral Damage is more akin to ""Hatred"" than say Katamari Damacy.

,Recommended,329860,17897623,"Posted: 5 September, 2015",all,Misery,"Well, I only just started on this, as I bought it just a short time ago at random.  But I very much enjoyed what I've played of it so far, so I figured I may as well do a quick review post.If you dont get the drift by looking at the store page or the trailer (how could you NOT get the idea of what it's like by looking at that trailer?), you play as a cat, albeit one who is missing a few screws... well... missing more screws than, ahem, ""normal"" cats are missing anyway (as if cats are ever normal.... not in my experience!)... and one who is very clearly bored, as this cat has decided to SWAT ALL THE THINGS.Which is pretty much what you're doing; in each level, you're simply given a number of objects to knock over, and a time limit in which to do this.  Fail to clear that number, and it's game over, as you'd expect.  You're also given some specific objects to find that can give a bonus, and some that are worth extra in that particular level; the game will point these out to you each time, so make a note of that and keep an eye out for the thing.Everything of course is all filled with physics, which means that stuff is just going to go bouncing all over the place, exactly as you'd expect.  It's worth noting though that the objects have to hit the FLOOR to count; if they land on another piece of furniture, they dont do anything for you.  The game makes it pretty obvious when things have properly connected with the floor.Much of the game uses procedural generation, so you cant just automatically head into a level and already know where the highest scoring spots are; that wouldnt be very interesting and I'm glad the devs didnt do that.  There are also random ""events"" that might happen.  You never know just what these might be.  They could help you, or just confuse.  You'll be running around, like ""Oh hey, here's another book shelf, time to swat these books, swat swat swat, hahaha, swat swat swa- OH GOD DISCO WTF?!?"" and there'll only be confusion remaining.  Or maybe the power in the house will go out.  Or perhaps you're told to go catch a mouse, and if you do so, you'll get a free upgrade item or even something else.  Upgrades are gotten usually by smacking around certain specific cat-related objects (like scratching posts) and will increase an attribute for your cat, like jumping or speed or whatever.  So you definitely want those.There are also bonus levels that can be found in each of the main levels (4 main levels in one run), there's a ""litterbox"" mode where there's no objectives or anything and you just smack things around at your own pace, and about a bazillion cat (and dog?) photos to unlock, and who doesnt like those?  Sad, irritating little jerks, that's who doesnt like those.  There's alot of achievements to get, and many playable cats to unlock as well.Overall, it's a very arcade-y game, since it's fast paced and scoring points is the entire, well, point of it, and it seriously feels ALOT like Katamari, actually; if you liked that series, this is definitely one to try.  Not exactly a difficult game, but as with most score-focused games, the challenge comes from scoring high; not ""beating"" the game.I look forward to playing this quite a bit, it's definitely my sort of thing.But for now, my arm hurts like heck from clicking the blasted mouse so much.  Had to do it though.  Those books wont launch themselves accross the room, after all."

Bonus levels include a museum, supermarket, Christmas tree room and a spooky mad scientist lab.This game allows you to bring out your playful destructive desires to trash the place as the one other animal who has such playful desires.  It is absolutely the most fun you can have.The only people who won't enjoy this game are jaded people who only enjoy games with blood splatters.

Cute premise, but the game is just not much fun.When you jump on a shelf, it's hard to see where you are, so you fall off a LOT, you overshoot jumps frequently, fall under stools or chairs (but you don't know you are under one unless you try to jump) and worst of all, all items must be knocked to the FLOOR to count. So you know them off a high shelf but they fall to a lower shelf, so no score until you knock them down off that lower shelf, plus you should get higher points for knocking around bigger items. Break a monitor or push over an envelope, it still only counts as one item.More of a CATastrophe than being PURRfect, give it a miss (even if you are a cat lover)"

,Recommended,329860,16533024,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Tabascofanatikerin,"""Catlateral Damage"" is a nice little catual (harr harr) game for now and then. You play one of the selectable cats and make a mess in your owner's rooms. You have to throw everything on the floor - plants, pictures on walls, books, TV screens etc. - until the time runs out.The ""Litterbox"" mode however gives you the time you need to vandalize in peace. Inbetween you get nice little extras like faster speed, disco atmosphere or jumping through the air like on the moon for a brief time.The standard controls are fine, you usually play with keys and the mouse (fits since you are a cat - HARR HARR).The entertainment factor is not so big but as I said: okay for now and then. The graphics are simple and pastel-coloured, the music is more bland, happy easy listening music, there are not many sounds (unfortunately).What I miss is the reaction of your owners at the end of every round. You just end the level and the results appear on screen, that's it. I also see a few missed opportunities. If you as the cat can actually turn the faucet on, then why not flooding the room's floor? But things like this are just details.So if you got a few Euros to spend you won't regret trying ""Catlateral Damage"".Just one last thing: I'm not one of the people who get sick by motion-capture movies or games but in this case I can't play much longer than 15, 20 minutes as it makes me feel a little sick in my stomach afterwards due to the graphics. But it's okay since the game is not engaging enough to keep me playing this for hours."

But, have you ever thought: how fun is it to actually just casually drop something down? Yeah, for sure.So, this is basicly it. You are cat and drop items. But hey, what items? and where? There are plenty general locations. Why general? 'Cause every map you play is randomly generated. So unless you save map seed (game gives such an option), or you are really unlucky, you won't see the same map again. So there are few houses, a summer camp house, supermarket, museum, and even holiday map, so called Pawliday den, with christmass tree, and presents and everything Xmass themed.Coming to objects, there are big swords and giant dinosaur skeleton in museum, there are books, TVs, pillows, anything you could expect in regular house.Gamemodes. There is Objective mode, in which you have to reach highest possible score in 4 houses (yet, you can find map tokens there, increasing amount of maps you visit), and Litterbox mode, in which you choose map to play on, and you just throw items down, without time limit, just the way you want.To help you with making mess, there are power-ups, increasing your speed, jump height, and swat power. They are very simple, found in boxes and during events, so there is no point in elaborating.Events I mentioned previously, are random things that happen. One time there is free upgrade, another evil red dot or mouse. There are also some that only affect way you see things, like power outrage or disco. And for more fun, there are moon gravity periods.Except for cat pictures you collect by throwing them on the ground, and few different cat models from which you only see paws, there isn't much more to say. it's just a nice sandbox, with theme so suprisingly good that it's a mystery why nobody thought about it earlier."

If the idea of playing as a cat and knocking things on the floor doesn't appeal to you, don't expect anything more here. Sure, there are things to unlock, half a dozen levels, and a get-the-laser minigame, but at the end of the day you're just a cat pushing cel-shaded objects on the floor.The game's Objective mode can be frustrating but is almost always fair, where you knock down a certain number of objects in either way too little or way too much time; the different time limts set a good overall pace where you don't have to be entirely frantic or bored the whole time. Sandbox mode is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, although perfectionists ought to be careful here as it can be difficult if not impossible to ""complete"" certain levels as there is zero leeway regarding object count and sometimes an object that has fallen on another object will not count toward your total. Although you can collect power-ups in both modes, they are not persistent except immediately between levels in the objective mode, so consider yourself starting from scratch in each session.I really like the collectibles aspect, where a list of everything you've encountered is archived and separated by item type. It would have been nice if you could interact with the objects in this list to view their models, or at least if they were named, but it gives a little more depth to an otherwise simple game."

In the end they did not succeed however and their civilization fell to dust. Fast forward to present day and in all this time, what have we learned? Absolutely nothing, if you think about it.Schroedinger knew this. Clearly it impacted him personally, since his musings on cats was his greatest legacy. He proposed that nothing can be certain when a cat is put into a box, yet if you put a cat in a box (hardly needed for a cat will seek out a box on his own) he will simply stare at you, smugly, as though asking why you as a human have such a hard time understanding quantum theory and the nature of reality. Perhaps the cat has mastered it?Up until now the motives of the common feline have been shrouded in mystery, but thanks to some brilliant computer programmers there might be the first advance in understanding mankind has had since before written history.Be the cat.This simple philisophical proposition combined with modern computing power has given everyone the chance to take a first person glimpse into the every day life of the common house cat. It's taken thousands upon thousands of years to bring technology to the point where this is possible but now the riddle that escaped ancient Egypt might now be within OUR reach to be stroked between the ears or scratched under the chin.It is by no means a complete picture but a breakthrough nonetheless.If you ever wanted to get insight into the engimatic creature known as a house cat, play this game."

An acquired taste, to be sure, but for those of us who have owned cats before, we understand there is a underlying naturalistic beauty in an animal so seemingly driven by carnal spite.Right?Lol no. Just... no. Cats are generally the worst, and if you like them, you're dead on the inside. Thankfully, that's not true if you like Catlateral Damage: that target of admiration, I could understand.Catlateral Damage hones in on the spiteful behaviour of felines and celebrates it by creating a fun little sandbox that harkens back to the likes of Katamari Damacy. The game takes a simple idea of knocking stuff over as a cat for points and executes it well.I found it to be a surprisingly fun distraction. This is the perfect game for when you've had a hard day at work, and you just want to get the rage out of your system by funking up your owners' house for no good reason.It's not super deep, and it's likely not one of longevity, but the game is fun while it lasts.
