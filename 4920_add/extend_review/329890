76561198020532812,Not Recommended,329890,14742166,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,Yasha,"I was quite impressed when I first saw this, although it is in early access the software has a top notch terrian/world editor with a simple and intutive interface. It also has quite a lot of free assets that are reasonable quality. I also like the direction the devs have talked about, they seem to be shooting for a similar set up to rpgmaker in terms of how various editors will work to set up game logic and so forth.However, I later found out that the world editor is 3D Torque (an already released game engine). In other words at the moment this is a stripped down version of 3D Torque (which is free) plus some models. Unfortunately that has severely dented my confidence in the future of this project, since the impressive world editor (which is the only thing that is working) was actually made by someone else.Now the Torque 3D is engine is available under the MIT license so there is nothing illegal about it, but I find it almost unbelievable that the devs have slapped their label/splash screen onto the Torque 3d world editor added a few assets and started selling this as their own work in early access without having finished any of their own ""editors"" for  it.I do hope the devs actually finish the vision they have for the software, but at this point I can't recommend buying software that you can basically download for free from GarageGames. And I can't help but feel somewhat outraged that they are basically selling someone elses work, without even giving credit to programmers that made it."
,Not Recommended,329890,14410142,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,Zen,"I found out about this game\software\tool last week. I saw it come up on the Early Access ""coming soon"" list and was immediately excited. I, like many others, have great interest in creating games and sharing stories and adventures. However, I do not know how to code a game, all the intricate little details, changing values and so on. Because of this, titles like RPG Maker (which I've been playing since RPG Maker 2000 and beyond) have always been so appealing to me.Then, low and behold, a 3D game that boasts that you do not have to make any line of code. Simply open the preferred editor you want and edit via a table, like the databases in the RPG Maker series. All of that sounded great, except, MANY OF THE EDITORS ARE SIMPLY BROKEN AND DO NOT WORK. I will now present a list of which editor works\functions\table comes up compared to how many do not.Object: YesTerrain: YesTerrain Painter: YesMaterial Editor: YesDecal Editor: YesParticle Editor: YesRiver Editor: YesRoad Editor: YesMesh Road Editor: Yes, I think, I don't understand it but at least a box comes up.Forest Editor: Yes, but I cannot spawn a single tree using itMission Area Editor: Yes, though no clue what this even isHere's where things go south quicklyWeather Editor: NoSketch Tool: NoShape Editor: NoAttributes Editor: YesTables Editor: NoClasses Editor: NoSkills Editor: NoItems Editor: NoArmors Editor: NoWeapons Editor: NoAnimations Editor: NoStates Editor: NoSounds Editor: NoTerms Editor: NoFactions Editor: NoActors Editor: NoCreatures Editor: NoEncounters Editor: NoDialog Editor: NoMerchants Editor: NoCrafting System Editor: NoAchievements Editor: NoEvents Editor: NoSo out of 34 ""editors,"" only 12 of them actually serve a function. Now what do I mean by the rest are ""broken?"" Well, nothing happens. When you click on ""Object Editor,"" a table comes up that lets you edit the terrain, create grass, rock, dirt, spawn a few creatures (which most of them have no animations and just slide along the ground in a frozen state), and so on. When clicking on any editor that I listed was broken, completely nothing happens. Now, I was under the understanding that since there's no coding required, you'd make a game using all these editors. But how can you make ANYTHING when all these important editors literally have no function? You can, however, make a map with the terrain editor, which works fine and serves its purpose.To wrap up, I can't put into words how disappointed I am. Yes, I understand this is Alpha. No, I did not expect to start making an actual game so soon after release, especially on the first day. However, I did want to look over all these promised ""editors"" and get a feel of what this program is capable of and is offering. I had my notepads open and ready to start brainstorming about what direction I wanted to go in as a start. However, right now, this is MyTerrain Master. Nothing else.This is the first review I've ever done for a game because I'm that passonate for game making that I want to let everyone know what they're getting into. No possible game can come from this. Not right now anyway. Stay away for now and wait for updates.EDIT: I've actually found 2 more editors, one of them is broken and one of them seems to do something. Social Network Editor is broken and Datablock Editor seems to function.EDIT 2: The developers have finally (after they got some of our money) talked about all the missing features this game currently has, which you can read here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/329890/discussions/0/612823460275740694/I highly suggest you read that post over before you consider buying this. This is shady behavior from developers and a real quick way to get some of their fanbase turned against them."

Don’t be fooled, however; to make something presentable is a daunting task that requires proficiencies in several disciplines.So what does MyRPG do? It cuts out the middle man, the code, and lets you get right to work on making your game. The toolset is clean and impressive; with dozens of hours clocked I have not experienced a bug yet. The engine is well supported by staff answering questions on the forums and updates every few days, either with new assets, bugfixes, or rolling out a new editor. Getting a handle on the controls is no more difficult than taking an hour to watch a tutorial or two, then playing with it yourself on a demo map.Also, if EARLY ACCESS isn’t enough of a hint to you, it’s not complete. What is there is fully functional and fantastic and the rest is quickly on the way, but do NOT be like the other people on here and feign surprise when they were perfectly aware they were purchasing an incomplete product."

The software hasn't been updated in many months, and the creator will not respond to my messages. I understand that this software is still in an Alpha Stage, but be truthful to what you have.The world editors are confusing and complicated, the only easy thing to do is make landscapes. Details about classes and weapons can NOT be updated for your indivual game, everything is preselected, and all of the player models are blurry and look like something from 2007, not to mention the armour looks like a random clash of colour.This software is a HUGE let down, and should be $10, if that. It is no where near the value of $40 and is far from complete, the Developer Progress maps are full of false information, this project needs lots of work."
76561198057159805,Not Recommended,329890,29366750,Posted: 19 January,all,Torbaernus,"Let me first say that I am not a hothead nor a young man (I was born the year JFK was elected president).  I rarely buy EA games because generally the risk outweights the value of the game prior to release.  However, I was really interested in giving MyRPG Master a shot, since it appeared to solve many of the time crunch issues that I face as a developer.However, let me warn anyone else who thinks this would be a reasonably good investment, DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE!Here are the exact reasons why I make such a recommendation.1.  MyRPG Master is really nothing more or nothing less than a commercial (alpha) add-on to Torque 3D, which is by the way completely free and uses the VERY liberal MIT open source licensing agreement.  A lot of the core tools in Torque 3D are similar to MyRPG Master.  The devs of this software have added some very useful RPG tools, but in doing so they made all of the code proprietary and non-open source.  Although this is completely legal in terms of the MIT OS license, it doesn't make many friends.  Furthermore, the devs of MyRPG Master actually blocked (or removed entirely) some very useful native Torque 3D features, such as being able to add animations to your imported DAE 3d models rather than having to buy or make these models with the animations built into the DAE file.  They also did another tricky modification to the original engine by setting the link color of a very important aspect of the engine to the same color as the edior's background, thus you cannot really use that functionality either.  The tool also is not compatible with Torque 3D's base engine from the testing I have been able to do given the way that the devs locked down so much of the scripting.2. English documentation and tutorials is almost non-existent.  Other's have mentioned this as well so I won't belabor the point.  You have to figure out a great deal of things through trial and error as a result.  So instead of saving you time in your game development it actually can take much longer.  Since you cannot access their scripts there is no insider way to figure out how things work by examining the scripts and so forth.3. This last problem is not a result of the way MyRPG Master has been implemented, but rather is a tiny rant on my part concerning the inadequacy of the Steam EA return policy.  Perhaps 2 hrs/2 weeks is sufficient for a relatively uncomplex EA game but for a development tool, two hours is just about enough time to open the tool and get somewhat familiar with the editor interface.  Come now Valve, the Steam community pours millions of dollars into your company, the least that you can do is make a reasonable return policy for those people who are willing to pay a company to do beta testing on their product (an odd concept to me anyway).So as to be fully truthful about MyRPG Master I will say that so long as you are willing to pay for animated models in Collada (DAE) format or are proficient at making such models yourself and don't mind taking the time to do so then this is not a bad tool.  Though if you have that kind of time you probalby would still be better served by downloading the base Torque 3D engine and scripting the tools for your project as needed.The bottom line: If you are a developer and a tool like this appeals to you, save your money and go download  the FREE Torque 3D engine instead."

Not sure if this is added or not but it would be nice to add my own graphics. I plan on making a full game using this engine and also tutorials on each sections of this engine. I will create a few videos on how to start out and what to click on.Also it would be great to allow the users to create there own c++ code and add it to the engine. I know it and could create better things.

If the rest of the editors that are promised work as well as what is currently there, this will be a great product.Obviously, it's still very early in my experience with MyRPG, but right now it reminds me of the Neverwinter Nights 2 Toolset, with one important difference:  From within MyRPG, you can immediately ""play"" (i.e. test) the levels you're building, as you build them.  Great feature.You could certainly take a ""wait and see"" approach, but I bought this for two reasons:1.  To support its development2.  Not having all functionality allows me to focus on what is there, and become well-versed with each capability as it is added.  Might not be a legit reason for all, but it is for me.What might keep you from buying right now:1.  Not all features are present (not a surprise w/ early access)2.  Documentation currently lacking.  There is a small tutorial video, and further documentation has been promised. But, it will eventually need to materialize."

There is limitations to what you can do with it at the moment. If you are willing to work with these limitations and are not expecting to make a full, working game just yet, this is a dream come true. Also, expect that making a game - even a small one - is a LOT of work. I've only scratched the surface with the couple of hours I've put into it so far.But I can see the promise in this. The models and graphics etc. that come with the software are very decent. Some of them are absolutely beautiful, all of them are usable. Map-building is fun, challenging and easy enough to learn. Possibilities are endless.The one big downside for me at the moment is the lack of good tutorials. There are some, but not nearly enough. Learning the software requires a lot of trial and error, experimentation and a bit of luck. So far I've not faced anything that I couldn't figure out if I tried enough, but this requires some patience. If you aren't willing to learn ""the hard way"" maybe you need to wait a bit for tutorials to emerge before you decide whether to buy MyRPG or not.All in all, I do recommend this software and I'm very very excited about it! Can't wait to see how it develops and what will come of my own projects."

They have now made a big post and a simple way to see what is currently included in the MyRPG Alpha, which unfourtinantly didnt exist when i bought the game, but atleast the people that buys the software now knows.The developers are really fast at responding to bugreports, are really helpful in general and are really listening to the people that are going to use their software. As an example, the latest editor is almost done, but before the release, they are asking the software owners to come with new features that we can't live without or really want. This way i can imagine that the software will be great in the future.Check the Steam forums before buying the software and really enjoy a progressing 3D rpg maker where you can actually make a difference!""My early access review will be very easy to write. The Alpha is released with little to no features. Unless you are looking for a RPG terrain editor with a few predefined assets this is a waste of money. I would love to have a refund since the developers stated that alot more was included in the launch of the early access.As of right now, you cannot do anything that would make the game a true RPG experience (Unless you like to kill wandering mobs that don't fight back)"""
