You can also extend your abilities by installing plug-ins.If you're a Vegas user like me, then prepare for a really simplified interface and huge buttons, optimized for touch screens. Of course you would like to bring back small buttons and free more space but i'm afraid that developer doesn't really care about the ability to switch between the old style theme and ""touchy"" one.If you need quick and simple tool for video editing, then buy Movie Studio 13. But if you're looking for complexity and unlimited possibilites, then find something else, like After Effects or even Nuke.P.S. This thing supports OFX (video) and VST (audio) so you can bring your favorite NewBlueFX or Hitfilm plugins and use them."

After a very quick glance this software seems to have everything that I needed from Premiere. Chroma keys, cropping, multiple (up to 20) video tracks and so on. All the basic stuff you need for casual (such as let's play videos or vlogs, or guitar playing videos in my case) editing.The only problem I faced was the confusing UI. But I guess it gets easier once I get used to it. We aren't talking about Reaper level of confusing UI here :d Also, SONY's employees were apparently drunk when making this since they made the UI with touch screen in mind - I mean who in earth edits videos with touch screen? But it's not a big problem, the buttons are just damn huge.So, in conclusion; very good and affordable (especially now that it's -25%) editing software for casual editing. Definitely worth the money.After another quick glance; There are some very-easy-to-follow tutorials that will make the confusing UI a little bit easier to understand. Also, there seems to be some kind of color correction that at least old version of Premiere didn't have. And finally, the playback while editing runs perfectly.Edit; Here's a little video I made using this software. It may or may not answer some questions;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zstaq4kMwW4(please note that I accidentally exported the video using slow famerate which makes it not-so-smooth...)"

There are a variety of different tutorials online/Youtube that can help you accomplish what you need.  I tested out the Trial version before buying, and checked all the features I felt I needed to produce Let's Plays/game video content.  It is by no means a Professional Level video editor, but it also isn't their basic software either, and that should be expected for it's price point.I was fortunate that when Movie Studio 13 Platinum was released on Steam, I was conveniently in the market for software to accomplish what I needed to do.  On top of that, on release it was 25% off, which made the purchase all the more enticing.Before you disregard this program, take a close look at the features it provides that you will need and whether you'll actually need the professional level.  See here for more details:Sony Product comparisonWhile others have complained that the UI elements are larger and that it is geared towards tablets and other touchscreen devices, this hasn't been an issue for me from my own experience.  As I have a dual monitor setup, I can spread my workspace out, so this isn't an issue for me.  What matters is if I can be productive with it.If you need a Professional Level editing software for what you do, you're going to have to pay a Professional Level price.  For my needs, I need something that allows me to make cuts, transitions, title cards, outros, etc, and it does everything I need it to do.Edit: Over the last 2 years of use I have edited and rendered close to 1600 videos for my Youtube gaming Channel, and for my needs, I haven't found a feature I've needed that wasn't available in the software."

As a professional video editor, I highly recommend this program for people who need a program that's good but are on a budget; it's not the BEST thing out there, but it's on par with programs that cost $150 or more (WAY more). It has some minor issues, but they're very easy to find solutions to, and I can guarantee that 90% of crashes people say happen with it are because of their computer, not the program itself.

While this doesn't have as many advanced features as Vegas (for example, you can only have 20 video and 20 audio tracks in Movie Studio while you can have an virtually unlimited amount with Vegas), it does still have enough that you can make a professional-looking video with it.There are a couple of little issues, such as not being able to copy clips from one project and paste them in another, and not being able to have more than one project open so you can work on one video while you're rendering another, but on the whole, this is a really good editing software. I'd recommend this to amateur videomakers who are somewhat serious about editing videos, but not serious enough to drop 600 dollars on Vegas."

That is being unable or finding it highly counterintuitive (at least with the steam version) to merge two projects together. Or even copy and paste clips from one project to another. The only workaround I have seen posted for this was a thread about the software from 2014 that suggested running multiple instances of the program to swap parts of one project into another. However, Steam doesn't seem to allow an easy (Or possible in some cases) method of running two instances of the same program.It's a good program otherwise, but this is a big enough deal for me to put a negative review.

It has 90% of the capability of Vegas for 10% the cost. Allows many tracks to be layered (both video and audio tracks), comes with plenty of free transitions/FX/editing tools, and has most of the rendering capability of the pro software. It's never crashed on me once and I do 30-minute videos in 1080p 60fps recording w/ Dxtory (granted I do have a very good GPU and lots of RAM; I'm assuming most people reading this do as well). I'd highly recommend getting this software over getting a copy of Vegas for ""free"" because you don't have to worry about bugs, compatibility, or downloading it on new hard drives because it's Steam Powered. I'm a professional music producer who owns a recording studio and I've been doing pro audio for almost 10 years, but I'm new to editing video and this is the perfect software for me. Looks like Vegas, feels like Vegas, works like Vegas, teaches you Vegas while you save up for Vegas (if you ever need it), and way cheaper than Vegas. 10/10 from me.Update after many many hours of editing: It does crash on me quite a bit now, for no discernable reason. I've tried just about everything to try and fix it, but it still crashes. I have an i7 4790K, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX 1080. Sometimes lowering the Preview Quality will prevent crashes, but not always. I still recommend this software and love it - but be aware that it may crash on you, so save your project often."

Contrary to popular belief, there aren't that many free video editors out there, and I would not recommend ANY free video editor at this moment...  Spend a bit of money and get a STABLE program that will serve your purposes very well.It supports a ton of different formats up to 4K, which is huge.If you can't find a tutorial on VEGAS Movie Studio 13 Platinum, simply search Sony VEGAS tutorials, because they are very similar and Sony VEGAS is a $300 program.I would highly recommend this before you dive into the full Sony VEGAS programs, and for the price it's quite rediculous how much you can get done.Always remember that it's not the software or hardware that you have, or the price of the software or hardware....  it's the story you have to tell, and story is KING.Definitely watch for sales on this product as they happen quite often, but even for the base price it's value is unprecidented.  On sale I believe I bought this for $25 which was the lowest I've seen it, but very often it's on sale for $49.99 with the pack of other Sony products.  I can't speak for the other Sony products like Sound Forge (which isn't the FULL sound forge either)... but for that price you can't really go wrong.  This has been a very stable program for me and have never had any real issues with it thankfully.  Spend your money on something of value instead of being a cheap♥♥♥♥♥and looking for something for free.  Trust me, I tried just about every free video editor, and some of them were okay, but if you're on Win 10 there's really nothing free that compares with this.  Windows Movie Maker is not what it used to be... but if you used that, this will be easy for you to learn... but not to underestimate this program... it can be as complex as you'd like.  I believe one of the few differences between this and the full Sony VEGAS would be the limited Track numbers you're allowed...  but if you're a good editor, you won't need 100+ video/audio tracks.A final note:  With the Steam Powered edition, you can have this Program on multiple computers allowing you to edit from many different platforms.  This is a huge plus as I use my SSD gaming laptop, but also use my HDD Desktop for different projects.  If I had to buy multiple copies it wouldn't be so bad, for this price, but Steam Powered, THANK YOU!"

In the case of my last two purchases from magix, so far i have found that in veags studio 13 there are no blending modes which are especially useful if you want to add effects like particles and stuff like that. Something similar happened with some audio software by magix that won't allow you to use of 3rd party vst plugins even though the help included states you can. So of course this isn't false advertisement, it's just a shady practice.

After over 24 hours of total usage, I can easily say that I am satisfied with my purchase.Movie Studio 13 is pretty much a watered down, easier to use version of Vegas (it is more advanced than Windows Movie Maker, though). It won't be able to create mind blowing footage; but for simple videos, it's just right for the job. I made multiple videos using this software, the videos turned out looking great for what they were and the process of making them wasn't too stressful.I personally had no technical issues with this software as of yet, but do keep in mind that some people are encountering random crashes.

You need to resize and move the video frame instead of the object itself, so everything you need to do to move that object is reversed. You can't easily stretch objects, either, aside from just making them bigger or smaller.THERE IS NO MASKING HERE! You need Vegas for that, it's on Steam, too. Not a big deal for me, I don't do masking for my videos, so I don't need the premium software for it. MovieStudio will still do greenscreen, though, so you can make custom masks in Paint or something.For me, if my Internet goes down while I'm using MovieStudio, it immediately crashes.

I just got it on the first and it's quite powerful for the price. But I believe I have had enough expierence to say, it's worth it. Although Vegas is the more professional side, Movie Studio offers more than enough features for the amatuer filmographer, and with 20 layers to work with, you should not have to worry about hitting that limit any time soon."

I was so annoyed at that, that I was going to contact Steam for my money back. It's a major problem if video editing software cannot open source files to video edit.However, after spending time with it, it is actually a very good piece of software, codec issues aside. It doesn't lag, the quality of rendering is good, the interface is responsive and reliable. I can probably get around the video codec issues by forcing OpenShot to re-render videos in a format that Sony comprehends, but it's still a shame that free software still in the 21st Century is able to understand file formats that expensive commercial software still does not!All in all, this is very good software and it's made my life a lot easier.

If you have one of the new Nvidia 900 series cards, look elsewhere if hardware acceleration is a must for you.Can't really fault it for much else, apart from being a bit buggy as per usual with Sony software. If they added an option to switch to the old, much more usable interface, I'd have recommended this, but as is, it's a firm stay away as you can find Sony's Movie Studio 12 Platinum for cheaper on Amazon and it's a better package in general."

I think you can in the more expensive versions, but that's a lame thing to put in the more premium versions. I only use it for making my YouTube videos so nothing too professional or big.

If you're rendering videos all the time, the terrible rendering speed really is enough to encourage you to look elsewhere, I know I am.Also, if you install a Sony Vegas trial, it will permanently disable all your audio FX plugin in the paid version of this app until you registry edit to remove your anti-license for them.

However, there are some neat features that you can use if you do your reasearch or play around with it for a bit. Stepping up from Windows Movie Maker, some of the most notable improvements are the edition of several effects, background, and being able to actually see what you're editing on a large screen! Also, there's a copious amount of effects that you can add to footage. This ranges from practical effects like contrast, brightness, color correction, and stabilization (although it sucks imo), to less practical things that you can see for yourself if you get this.Like I said, don't expect this to do everything a high end program will do, but it's pretty good for someone who wants to dabble in video editing.

76561198064388679,Recommended,330070,28471720,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,ZenZone1,"Update Summary July 15, 2017 TL;DRPls note that previous comments / reviews below this section may contain inaccuracies / minor mistakes so this section is the most accurate and superseed earlier comments in other sections pertaining to the same issues / topics.Previous problems i had with my old laptop maybe due to GPU or driver incompatibilities.Interactive tutorial are extensive and covers a lot of features you need to know. They are suprisingly helpful if you know what you're looking for.Bugs or odd behaviour is minimal or non-reproducible - those who have problems with these are probably due to the above mentioned s/w or h/w mismatch.Tiny clickable interface controls can be mitigated with zoom or maximize track function.Totally worth it with bundle discount IMO.Update 1: July 14th, 2017I don't know why i had so many problems in the beginning on my old laptop PC. Re-purchasing this today and trying it out on my new desktop PC gives a totally different experience.Imported file has audioAudio track can be seenLearned how to make watermark transparent by watching several YouTube videos; many do it the hard way when there is a very simple 1-click method. Out of 3 videos i watched, 1 guy did it right.Conversion or rendering takes a reasonable amount of time as to be expectedDidn't try to change options/preference/settings. Works again on 2nd run. BTW my DDR4 RAM is now successfully overclocked to 2800 MHz on Asus BIOS v803 beta; didn't cause any problems so far with any games or software. I thought that might cause some instability issues here but it didn't.If you're the kind who likes to dive-in and try to figure out things for yourself like me then it's not easy to get to grips with Movie Studio, there's a steep learning curve. F1 key help topics are too brief at times and there are insuffucient illustrations in some areas. UI has some functions in very tiny areas so it's kinda like pixel hunting; easy to miss and difficult to spot. At first glance i was like ""Huh! what? How the heck do i do this? Where is this or that? What's it called?"" Fortunately YouTube has many users who already figured out how to do things so you can get up to speed and be productive in reasonable time. More importantly there are interactive tutorials that can guide you step by step in editing your first videoMovie Studio Platinum has 2 modes; Simple and Advanced. I made the mistake of switching to Advanced mode too quickly and got overwhelmed. Beneath the complexity and not so obvious way of doing things lies a wealth of functions i haven't even begun to comprehend. Definitely worth the money spent at 60% off for the whole suite; you get 3 softwares and 1 DLC for the price of one. Plenty of things left waiting to be discovered and understood and that's just one of them. These are full-featured programs with plenty of functions; you'll hardly find anything lacking in them, just maybe different ways of doing things.I'm changing this review to recommended with a score of 8/10.Update 2 July 14th3rd start-up runs fine. Made some minor changes to options. Rendered 1 video and rendering another one now. Noticed that the vertical zoom on the timeline expands or contracts at random as i click on certain functions like switching between simple and advanced UI or adding or removing video tracks. Can't always set the zoom level because the vertical zoom controls sometimes disappears. Horizontal zoom always available. Once the export / rendering process has begun there's no way to pause, only option is to cancel it. Life stll goes on however, your computer is not tied-up. 4th start-up yet to be made - will update on that later.Update 3 July 14th4th start-up no problems after changing some options, only thing i haven't enable is 'Use AMD GPU hardware acceleration"". Figured out how to use most of the editing functions i need so i'm very happy with Vegas Movie Studio. What may be lacking in terms of text effects and/or transition effects isn't missed much. The essentials i need are here and there's more cool stuff to experiment with.Original review below (Irrelevant now due to change of hardware platform)Not worth it; too many problems!Imported file has no audio in previewAudio track cannot be seen nor editedExported file has no audioSimple conversion takes too long; 9 mins 720p avi video 23.976 fps 29365kbps  took nearly twice as long to convert to ~400kbps wmv videoChanging preferences can cause it to not be able to start againDon't know what's the problem with audio; the import or project function supports 48Khz and the sample video in the tutorial can be previewed with audio.Summary of experience1st run ok - made my first conversion (missing audio)- changed GPU to AMD hardware render2nd run CTD right awayPressed Ctrl-Shift on restartWorks again - changed sound device, load video, previewed (still no sound)Restart? won't start - error 126Ctrl-Shift restart? won't start - same error msgRe-install to C: driveSame error msg - 126Damn tired of this, wasted so much time trying to make it workIt came in a bundle for better or worse so if i ask for a refund, the rest would probably go too."
