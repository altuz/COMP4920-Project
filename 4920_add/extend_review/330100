It even has a seperate competitive mode using some specific predefinded missions- of which (<----This guy) currently sits on top of all of them ;P Come get me. (Currently under contest- nice Frice)Customizing your ship is done via an overhead, top down, 2d plane style set-up.Parts are added in line to one another, no overlapping/stacking like in Battleships forever, though there are parts which move that allow some more complicated builds for those interested in such.It has good selection of parts which unlock either via a discovery system or, a fast unlock-all option for looking to jump right in and get to building.Also, this game has one of the best Dev's a community could ever ask for- he's quick to reply on forums, fast to address bugs and puts an honest ear to feedback.Buy the game, if you dont like the genre: buy it anyway and gift it to a friend who does-"

Issues range from developer not thinking (e.g. you cannot quit from hangar menu without first placing down a command center, whereas any other application like Word will allow you to quit without saving), to crashes (genetic algorith drops to 1FPS by the 3rd generation and then crashes) as well as minor annoyances (e.g. the ship in the hanger keeps moving when you use the mouse to move parts around, and the battle camera is so useless that you need to keep one hand on the mouse to keep adjusting the camera unless you enjoy flying blind).All of that could be fixed, but only time will tell. In it's present state, it is very hard to recommend."

Everything else about it is decent (not amazing, but it has plenty of fun moments). I think I've put enough time into it to say I've given it a more-than-fair shot.- Crashes often, for no particular reason. And that's just in normal gameplay, as opposed to the evolution mode where it will consistently crash within the first 10 generations, and most likely much sooner.- Gets stuck on some screens in certain situations (notably, it can't get out of the ship design screen without a command center module, and it's entirely possible to remove some types of command center completely without them reappearing in your inventory, meaning you have to force-quit the game entirely)- Other, smaller stuff, like the fact that you can get a mission to protect a ship, do your damnedest to blow it up yourself and let the enemies do the same, and still succeed in keeping it alive for the requisite amount of time despite your best efforts. Or the camera often centering itself in completely nonsensical places when it's zoomed in. Little weird things like that, irritating things that should have been fixed.Fix it, guys, and I'll be right back to playing it. As it is, I've been firing it up for a short bit every bug fix or patch to see if my issues have cleared up. But my major complaints are still the same as they've been for months now."

,Recommended,330100,20836732,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,Bushi,"Out of all the games I've gotten on Steam so far, this is the first one I've felt like writing a review for, mainly because I see a lot of potential in this one and hope for it to succeed. So keep in mind this is my first review and itisfor an Early Access game.Starting OffThis game is a sandbox through and through, focusing obviously on the construction of a customized ship and then allowing you to test it out within various game modes from a full campaign of sorts where you establish yourself with different factions that each have their focus on research types, a survival mode, random missions and more to come I am sure. Sure, there is no story, save a generic themed enemy that apparently is a threat for some reason, but let's admit that isn't what people play sandbox games for.There is already plenty of modules for making the ship function the way you like to play. Want a gunship? Make it happen. Want a ship that has more versatility in tools and tech? Do it. However, at the current point in the game, it feels like there is very limited uses for many of the different techs already available, and in time I hope to see more reasons and uses for it all.Graphically speaking, it's nothing impressive, but there's plenty of particle effects to keep things flashy enough to keep my attention. I still get the inner satisfaction when I destroy enemy ships to say the least, and the effects of the weapons and other modules feels appropriate for what they are/do. The music does its job at setting the feel for the missions and stuff, but tends to get a little repetitive after awhile and I have begun muting the music to play my own during my long sit down sessions with this game (three in total so far).PositivesExceptional Ship CustomizationBasic, But Helpful Tutorial (With exception of the negative below)Fully Rebindable Controls & Controller SupportA Developer Who Appears Interested In FeedbackNumerous Modes of Play With Challenge For AllNegativesRebindable Controls Do Not Fix Difficult ManeuveringModerate Learning Curve (Knowing which faction to help in the procedurally generated galaxy, and how it applies to your research is something I am still figuring out... could be helpful to explain that in the tutorial.)Neutral Factors(Things I believe will probably get better as development continues)Limited Mission Variety (Currently they could get repetitive for those who prefer variations)Few Reasons to Use Specific Module Types (This might be a personal preference thing)Occasional Bugs (To be expected with Early Access)More Control Options than Buttons on Controllers (I am sure the expected interface with the game is via keyboard and mouse, but the use of a controller is a very nice option when wanting to play casually, and it feels limited when you have to choose what abilities you want to have access to if using the controller.)AssessmentOverall this is a very entertaining experience for me, as I keep spending time trying to tweak my ships to be more streamlined, or trying to upgrade my modules. For an Early Access title, this one is one of few I have felt is worth the asking price, though I happened to find it on sale and became my replacement for another game since I can't play (and have chosen not to) Galactic Civilizations 3. With the level of customization, replayability due to a variety of game types, and the fact that the developer seems to be actively engaged with the playing community and offering frequent updates, I suggest you take a look at this game if it happens to be your cup of tea. Being still in development, it has plenty of potential to become a gem in my library.Personal Verdict8.5 / 10"
,Recommended,330100,29638135,Posted: 1 February,all,Fox,"This game is a fun top down space ship shooter. You can build your vessel from the ground up with modules you collect from winning battles. There are a wide range of modules that suit all play styles. You can design fast, slow, ranged, close-quarters, shielded, stealth, mine-layer, carriers, drones etc.There is a campaign which I guess is what most people play and it it challenging at the start but less so towards the end. Like most games, once you beat the technology curve the missions are still fun, but the outcome is pretty much predictable.This is a single player game so the AI needs to be smart - and it is. It's not perfect but it's effective, considering the AI needs to control any ship of any design so none of it can be scripted.There is an evolution mode where you don't play but watch AI ships fight each other. Winners will evolve into a new ship. You can watch generaton after generation evolve. Strictly for fun, science and interests sake but you can get some very interesting designs if you leave this sim running for a while. Also makes a great display/screen saver.  :)The developer is active and responsive to bugs. New content is being added post-release so the dev is supporting the customer base.There are one or two minor useability issues that I think have been outstanding for a long time that are yet to be addressed but that's not enough reason to avoid this game.I was reluctant to by a single-player top-down shooter but the way you can design a ship from the ground up and blast away at the AI is simply rewarding.  :)"

I figured OK, statistically speaking the reviews can't all be from friends and family. The game was on sale at the time so I took a chance. Am I ever glad I did! I've been playing the game for over a week. Steam says I've logged almost 30 hours in that time... how is that possible?! I work 2 jobs! But then I do the math and yeah... I think I've been playing the game too much.So why is the game so much fun?Weapons feel great!They have weight. I love the way my lasers rip into the hulls of enemy vessels. Missiles, torpedoes, they all FEEL good.Customizability.My battleship has like, 10 different action keys. One to fire lasers, one to fire long range weapons, one to launch my interceptors, one to open/close the main torpedo ports, one to fire the torpedoes, one for emergency hyperspace, etc etc. I sometimes get the keys mixed up and I accidentally hyperspace into an enemy ship when I was trying to turn on the emergency generator. I should really move that keybind to somewhere else.Battles are intense.No matter how awesome your ship gets, you still need to keep your eyes on the smaller enemy ships because they can still hurt you.Constant updates!The developer updated the game at least twice in the week I've had the game.Still, the game isn't perfect:It's Early Access.The game is a work-in-progress, but I've had no crashes except on the first day (but that was because the dev was working on the game). But there is a TON of content.Ships look... not quite like starships.Because it's kinda like lego. If you stick weapon modules onto a drive module and add some ore container boxes... well it's not gonna look pretty. Still, you can build some pretty respectable looking starships. But alot of times your ship is going to look like you just crazy-glued a bunch of ship parts together. Beware my garbage scow!AI isn't perfect.The AI is good enough to put up a decent fight most of the time. But then for no reason it'll hyperspace into an asteroid.So the game is definitely worth the price, full or on sale."

,Recommended,330100,32358074,Posted: 11 June,all,Lord Shaxx,"Note: I edited this review as I realized that a joking tactic just didn't work.BossConstructor is a birds-eye view ship-to-ship combat game, utilizing pretty decent physics, a proper weight system that affects center-of-gravity and ship performance, and a variety of components for the ships themselves.At the center of the game is the ship-building. While initially limited in your available materials, you can salvage modules from opposing ships, obtain them for completing objectives in levels, or buying them from a gambler station or a module trader. Your first ship is almost certainly going to be rather slap-dash. But as you progress through the game, you discover more modules, and more variants to them all.This is the point where some people just stop playing, as they don't like the RNG aspect. However, that aspect doesn't play too much of a role in the game. Your success and failure both depend on your ship and how you built it, and how you use your ship. I'm not saying it's purely the player's fault, as I myself have been sidelined by a torpedo numerous times, or been rammed to oblivion. Just that maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses is key.Rambling about gameplay aside, the game's performance on devices is mixed. On the older HP Notebook Pro that I mostly played this game on, it would run quite well, with occasional freezes that required a force quit via Task Manager. The computer itself had problems running pretty much anything though, including the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, so it was to be expected. On my Macbook Pro, it runs like a dream. On both it was smooth, with lag only appearing on the old HP when hundreds of ore, modules, enemy ships, and projectiles were flooding the screen.Overall it's an enjoyable game to just play for a while, and experimenting in ship construction in the hangar is fun, as is testing those creations out in the skirmish mode. Whether you wanted to be a stealth ship that seeds the area with mines or a factory that produces suicidal drones equipped with torpedoes, a jack-of-all-trades or a nimble speedster or a hulking tank, you can most certainly be that in this game, provided you spend some time discovering those modules you want for them.I recommend this game despite it's faults."

Lots of fun and potential in it for any dignified space shooting ship assembling geekster fan (like me self). For an Early Access game I have to say it's very well executed. Every thing runs smoothly and properly and apart from some labels and feedbak info still missing here and there it is apparent that a lot of care was put into it. It's a lot of fun assembling the amorphous ships and testing them in the 'field' and the set of parts available is quite enjoyable. It should be a very decent and wide scoped game once it leaves alpha/beta stage and comes out into a full fledged game. As of now, even while in Early Access, it is already very playable and worth every cent (and surely hours of fun)."

Because if one thing puts me off its weird controls. But the ships handle perfectly. Change the position of your engine modules and you end up with a different beast.The possibilities in this game are astonishing. Build a replicator ship that spawns carriers who spawn fighters? No problem. Build a melee ship that has triggerable moving spikes to punch out your enemies? No problem. Build a ship that grabs asteroids to hurl them at your victims? No problem (to be fair i haven't build this one but in theory it is possible).This game puts AAA to shame has free content patches and bugs are fixed on a regular basis.

At the current time, I've only tried exploration mode which consists of several dozen mini space battle areas, structured in a story line format. Ship parts are colllected throughout your journey and can be added to your ship, as well as unlocking them for your account. With a good amount of choices for parts and about a dozen or two different qualities for each part, the level of customization is vast. Adding to the part variaty, there is also full key binding customization so you can assign numerous different weapons to different keys to be more strategic with energy use or assign them all to one button to unleash a devastating full barage.That being said, there are some down sides that exist. For one there are constant game crashes between loading screens which can be quite annoying. This problem is greatly alleviated by the autosave frequency which ensures that after a crash, I can easily relaunch and pick up exactly where I was. This could easily be fixed in future patches.Second issue that I've found is that the ships controls can become slightly annoying when an engine is damaged or if your ship isn't completely symmetrical leading to vearing to one side. This can be seen as part of the challenge of the game but it can get a little annoying when half my ship is blown up from a fight and I have to navigate to the end of a level with only one engine located on the right side of the ship. Going stright when your only able to make left turns isn't the least stressful thing. I will say that the sense of accomplishment was pretty nice when I finnaly did make it though.Based on what I've seen so far and what I haven't even tried out yet, I don't see how anyone with less than atleast a few hours of gameplay could give an informed enough review. It's a fun game that has some room for improvement, and based on what I've seen the creators really want to keep improving the game."

76561197971544967,Recommended,330100,33418846,Posted: 9 July,all,Blackblade,"Fun  game.The ship building is by far the strongest part of the game.  If you aren't into that aspect, pass on this game.  There are many components including many weapons, shields, armor, engines and more exotic things (hacking, grappling hooks, etc).  The only real complaint with this part of the game is some components are very poorly explained.  I still don't understand the point of energy chains, for example, even though I finished the game.  The only caveat with ship building is you have to earn the parts through exploration mode (it did look like you could maybe turn that off but I never tried it).  So you may not be able to build your perfect ship and it will take time for you to real use your creativity to make interesting ships.The rest of the game is fun enough but could really use some more polish.  Exploration mode is what I spent most of my time with.  This is a campaign where you have to explore, meet civilations, do missions, buy parts and try and defeat the Von Neuman (the AI bad guys).  It is fun enough but could have been great with some more time.  The missions only have a handful of objectives so you will repeat these many times.  You even get mostly the same missions in enemy controlled regions (with basically two mission type exceptions).  After 10-15 missions you will feel like you've seen everything and just want to get more parts for your ship and get to the end.  Another problem is it is not clear how to stop the enemy expansion.  Early on you get some missions that will slow them down.  Later these mostly go away and for every sector you take from them you lose 1 or more in return.  Even the sectors you take don't seem to change hands and you don't seem to be able to stop the attacks from happening (they are marked on the map).  This definitely needed more explanation / feedback, if nothing else.The other modes are mainly for testing your ship and goofing around.  Skirmish, wave battles, etc.  The exception is evolution mode.  The AI fights itself (without you viewing if you ever want it to complete) and the ships slowly evolve.  Very neat concept but it is too slow and has other problems.  It will sometimes build illegal ships and it seems to only hold 32 ship designs.  Those can get filled fast and you end up losing the more advanced AI designs.  Again maybe there are ways to get around these problems but it is not obvious.  The speed is the worst though.  Small ship designs can resolve in a decent amount of time, large ship designs not at all.  I gave up on that after letting it sit for many hours and only getting through 1 or 2 rounds.In summary, worth your time if you like ship building and can put up with some rough edges and some underwhelming aspects that should have been better.  Probably best to get this when it's on sale.  Would really love to see a sequel with a campaign more along the lines of Star Control 2 or Star Flight."

You explore the world map in a system by system, fighting your way accross the galaxy salvaging parts to create a bigger and better ship to fight an existential threat to the galaxyOne of the things that stood out for me when I was playing BossConstructor is that the game was clearly a labour of love by the developer. It was dripping in character, it was dripping in attention to detail and it was well put together despite it's flaws, I found myself loving the game. But I can't really adequately explain why I found it so engaging.Perhaps it was the roguelike starting conditions, where you choose from a few options that dictate the pace how you approach first the missions. On the other hand it could have been the sandbox nature of this odd little game, letting you choose your path and how you approach each challenge put before you or whether even to do that challenge at all. It could even have been something as simple as being able to share my ships through the steam Workshop, aswell as use my friends and other people's ships to test out ideas and learn how the game's systems work. Maybe it was the storyline, which despite the occasional flaw, drew me in but didn't bog me down in exposition. It was just there, like a sprinkling backdrop of space opera. It, it could even have been just the simple exploration, salvaging, and construction gameplay loop where you take down enemies for new parts and you start out in a little tug boat but by the end of the game you have this massive ship with arrays of guns on swivels with shields and lasers flying in every direction.Regardless of what made me love the game I found myself making decisions from a cost benefit standpoint, but every now and again I saw a system being attacked and I helped it even though it didn’t really serve my strategic goals. That was profound to me. Now... I don't wanna be pretentious over what is essentially a fairly simple, and somewhat silly little space game but I really enjoyed this game and the game spoke to me and I think it’s worth looking at. So at the very least if I can't recommend the game to everyone, I can say it worth looking at and making the decision for yourself especially if you’re into exploration, customization and 2d space combat.I love the game, now that said I do have a couple of things I want to criticise the game on here and the big one that stands out for me like a sore thumb was the ending. I wont spoil it, but I felt it was underwhelming. It was a pretty big let down and it met none of my expectations. Now whether that was my expectations being miscalibrated or the game’s failing I can’t say for certain but I can say I didn’t like how it turned out. I didn’t like the ending. It left a mark on the experience that I kind of have to take imaginary reviewer points away because of it. Another thing was the variety of the content available. Five to Ten hours into the game you’re going to be hitting that “Another Day at the Job” zone where you’ve kind of seen it all before and the game has no surprises left to give you. Which is fine when you consider the scope and scale of the game and it’s development but I feel I would be dishonest by endorsing this game without airing my biggest gripes about it.Now in spite of the that there is still loads to do here. You could easily spend hours, evolving ships in the evolution mode or trying to optimize your times on the challenge levels but those are not the meat of the game.The conclusion of all this is I recommend this game for people who enjoy story lite, rogue lite, space ship building and combat games. If you’re looking to pick up a 15$ or €15 game that ticks all those boxes and get 5, 10 maybe 20 or more hours out of it then this is a good option. If you like the look of the game but you’re unsure, wait til its on sale and big it up at a reduced price. If none of the above sounds good to you, avoid the game, its not for you and ultimately its a niche title in my opinion.I also made some let's play content for the game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX65PTxeYGU&t=565sI do plan on coming back to this game and playing it again once it's fully finished [Still a little bit of development left] and updating this review."
,Recommended,330100,22822415,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Sporkmonger,"Game is still clearly early access and not everything fully works and could still use quite a lot more polish, but it's entirely playable and enjoyable as-is and 100% worth an Early Access purchase if you enjoy the genre.The genetic algorithm mode is particularly neat even if it doesn't work very well. Not really something you see often and I dig that even if it completely freezes my computer like I dunno, 9 times out of 10?Exploration mode is the heart of the game and while it can be a really rough start if you pick a bad starter ship (with no real guidance say, that it's going to be super-hard mode since, oh hey, you just configured a ship with no weapons of any kind) overall, if you make it past the first round or two, it gets really fun. You constantly get to exercise your creativity as new modules and module varients become available to you. I'd say AI is only a challenge if you're outnumbered and surrounded, but that definitely happens and when it does, you may very well have a truly challenging fight on your hands. Most of the time, with any kind of decent tactics to control engagements and a good ship design, fights are pretty easy though. But that also makes it easier to become complacent and get totally surprised when a tactical situation changes suddenly and your gun arcs can't hit something that's picking away at your engines. Engines matter a lot in this game and once a couple are gone, you are all but hosed. I really like having a more tactical shoot-em-up, and I found most of the game design decisions here to result in pretty cool gameplay.My biggest criticism of the game, if I had any would be that the non-combat missions can get a little tedious after you get the same one too many times in a row."
,Recommended,330100,20944933,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,ATX Ferret,"When I was a kid, my friends and I used to play what we called Lego Ships. We basically built spaceships out of Legos, using very loosely defined rules as to what piece did what (Lego-guy-legs with the tops pointed forward were cannons, lights were phasers/lasers, and anything proturding off the back was a thruster), and we'd imagine characters and stories to go with our creations. Our method of fighting was to take our finger and jam it into the other guy's ship, knocking what pieces off that we could. In hindsight, that's not the worst way that one could simulate fighting in space, I guess.Despite your initial primary weapon being space-fireballs (what?), Boss Constructor feels a bit like Lego Ships made into a video game. You cobble together a ship with what you can find, and then you poke the crap out of enemies until stuff falls off. And then you take said stuff and put it on your ship to make it better.As it stands right now, the game is entertaining, if shallow. It absolutely does nothing to justify the RPG tag, so certainly don't buy it expecting a story, because if it's going to have one, it's not there yet. It's neat that the developer is asking people to vote on things like modules and asking for ideas for missions, though I do wonder if that doesn't mean the developer's running out of ideas. The game has been on Steam as an Early Access for over a year, after all, though I certainly have not been involved long enough to know what state the game was in when it was first made available.Whatever you do, don't buy this game expecting a release-quality experience. It's definitely not that. It's stable enough to play (three CTDs in 15 hours isn't bad for early access), and looks to be a great platform on which to build a really good game, but it's far from finished.Music is limited, sound effects are at least decent, and your ship handles like a big, complicated version of the ship you use in Asteroids. If you want maneuverability, or the ability to reverse, or any kind of speed, you have to place thrusters, pointed in the right direction, and enough to counter the weight of your ship. Your ship will continue indefinitely until you fire thrusters pointing the other direction to stop you. It's not nearly so complicated or hard to control as it could be, though, and the controls strike a very, very good balance between realism and playability.I've already got access to nearly every possible module, and everything from here on out seems to be just more punishing versions of what I've already done. I'm disappointed that there are so few modules that are rarer and higher tech, meaning smaller, lighter versions of what you need. I kind of thought that sort of progression was a given in a spaceship building type of game. That's not to say that the concept is absent -- just lacking.I also think the ship construction (which is definitely the core of the game) would benefit from having two or three layers so that you're not so limited in your design by the game being strictly two-dimensional. For instance, the only way to change the direction of a weapon is to put it on an auto-aim joint. As of now, there is no way to put a weapon between but below or above your thrusters, or armor, or anything else, forcing you to either extend the weapon further out than every other part of the ship, or risk (guarantee, really) shooting yourself if an enemy ends up beside you since your weapon will automatically turn to point at it, regardless of what part of your ship is in the way.Everything shield related is pretty goofy as well. You either have this orbiting projectile-blocking thing that will get between you and enemies (meaning you'll always hit it when you shoot) or some peacock-feather-looking extensions that also block your own fire. Maybe the developer just really likes the idea of parts flying off of the ships and, honestly, so do I, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to go about fighting anything remotely hard when I can't shield my weapons.However, if you enjoy the idea of slapping parts off of other spaceships using space-arc-welders and space-fireball-launchers, then stealing those parts because apparently they're really durable but not connected very well, then I don't know of a better game for you. And, hopefully, there's a lot more to come."

Everything is natural, if your ship is heavy and you want ramming little things, this go happen. If you make a ""spear"" with strong modules to ramming in the front, go work. If you make a little ship to be fast, this go happen. Overall the physics, the modules, everything, work very well.Pros:- A good variety of weapons, modules, missions and customization.- I see some comments about not be a ""polished"" game. I cant agree. Is a solid game at moment.- System wise, im playing in OSX with a ""low-mid"" system and the game is very light.- TL:DR: You have a Stellaris galaxy map, and any system you enter, you have a RTS FTL customized by you to destroy the things, rescue people and everything else.Cons (suggestions:)- The lack of in-game customization to some simple controls on the hangar. I play on a notebook without the buttons to rotate the modules.- Sometimes you have problems in indentify allies or enemys in battle. The colors (red/green) are not strong enough- The game need something on galaxy map to identify traders, factions influence more easily.---Overall a nice buy if you want a mix between stellaris and a RTS FTL."

It's exceptionally hard to make your guns able to fire but not easily shot, and your guns can hit your own ship if you move too quickly. Vital blocks for progressing are often never found or available to be bought, and your ship gets increasingly unwieldy trying to keep up with enemies. Many hard missions require fighting waves of enemies, which is almost impossible for most designs as a single enemy with torpedos will destroy you and there might be a dozen total. Since you might end up with a slow ship that can't evade torpedos, it's literally impossible without raw RNG. The quality system for parts is very shallow and in some cases makes a part worse by causing the energy consumption to make it unusable, such as legendary fire rate. Enemy AI is terrible and often gets stuck on asteroids. Mostly-damaged enemies with working rockets can infinitely avoid you if your engines are damaged and make winning almost impossible.On the good side a lot of the modules are very interest and unique and there's a few ways to build ships that I was figuring out, although getting enough missiles or carriers to do this was another matter entirely.All the pieces are here for a great game, but they don't come together. If you like the idea but want better execution, go play Avorion.Also if you hit alt-enter in windowed mode it RESETS ANY MISSIONS while not repairing your ship. I went from 10 dead and 2 crippled enemies in a wave mission to 12 brand new enemies and my ship still 2/3rds dead. What the heck?

In Lunar Flight you have some sophisticated navigational devices to get you to a floating sphere that needs to be ""researched"". Once you get there you have to use your piloting skills to float within the sphere while the sphere is being researched. This requires skill, which you can learn with some diligence. The result is a satisfying 3D experience because the maps in Lunar flight look fantastic compared to any game whereas the maps in Boss Constructor look like crap and the physics feel so right.Have you ever worked on a monitor that is reflecting things from the background into your eyes? Well, that's what every map in Boss Constructor looks like. The planets in the background look like an annoying reflection on your monitor. On a positive note I think I did read that you can turn off backgrounds.I could say more but...To summarize - Boss Constructor as it is now, sucks"

The ship building system is overcomplicated for what you get out of it, and damage to your craft unforgiving, resulting in a situation of whoever takes the first damage loses."

I don't really enjoy 2D space invader shooters, and I was hoping for something with a ""Battleship Craft"" type of vessel design, with 3D blocks to use and modules to place. From some promo art I thought you'd be flying over 3D landscapes, but no.I think the sci-fi font isn't very readable, and defaulting to a tiny windowed mode shouldn't be necessary.The name ""Boss Constructor"" seems odd, too. Are we constructing bosses for 1990s side-scrollers?Seems like the developer is trying hard, and good luck, but it probably isn't my thing."

However...investing hours into the game only to have my save files become randomly corrupted is a pretty significant issue to be having. I have played many other early access games without this particular issue. Until it is addressed it is pretty pointless to play this game as your progress will be randomly wiped when the save gets corrupted.my save right now simply doesn't even load..it just causes the game to crash.Fix this issue developer ASAP...or watch the game sales crash faster than my saves...."

I would probably have liked the game and recommended it, but I can't get past the fact that the game starts up with a survey.  This is shameful.  It's not as bad as an npc trying to sell you DLC, or day one DLC, but it still gets under my skin just enough that I can't enjoy the actual game.  And the actual game is nice.  I wanted more games where you can customize your ship piece by piece and the game does that well.  But that survey at startup just bothers me."

RWR or this.I find more potential, and a significant amount more fun (even in current state), in this game than say... Reassembly.I find the weapons and combat very diverse in this current state, and the amount of strategies I can think of are many.You have choices that You make in combat that may very well make or break Your mission/exploration based on knowing when to retreat so that You don't lose say, all the thrusters/jets on one side of the ship.With the potential this game has, I highly recommend purchasing this game, and supporting it's development.  I don't see how it doesn't have a future as a defining game in this genre."

Some really nice depth, without being overly confusing (although some parts are a little confusing on occasion) the ship building is very intuitive and a lot of fun and exploring and fighting is tense and rewarding.At first I thought it was a little bit expensive for a game of this type but I feel like Im getting value for money due to the depth of the game and the fact it will be expanded. Look forward to seeing this game develop, and for a game in Alpha stages it has been playing smoothly with nothing significantly going wrong or encountering any bugs. Overall I am happy with this game and will play it. Would recommend to anyone looking for this style of game who is willing to take a punt on an early access title."

Options are available in main menu only.- cannot restart mission unless you choose to go back to the main menu-  lack of continuity feeling in Exploration mode. I feel like I'm just going through a number of missions instead of exploring space. My actions doesn't effect anything to the game world.I know that Story Mode will comes soon and it will add some continuity feeling.but I'm not sure if the story mode would have freedom complexity as much as FTL or Convoy."

It felt a bit unfinished from time to time but maybe that's just me.On the other hand it's great if you always wanted to build your own spaceship :DI also found out that it only uses one cpu-core which naturaly leads to lack in big battles. Don't know if that's supposed to be this way.

It doesn't look all that pretty, and due to ships having inertia and ""air resistance"" in space, I was immediately turned off. Eventually, I actually /played/ the game though, and turns out, its pretty fun.The ship customization is very well done. There's a lot of different parts to use, allowing for different playstyles. I went through the campaign with a fireball ship originally, but then thought it would be funny to do it again with a warp-drive ramming ship. Come to find out, I was right. The best part: if played right, that ramming ship is BETTER than my gunship. There's just so much you can do- the only real limitation is your imagination...... And the building field. it starts at 14x14, but can be expanded to 18x18 with some specialty parts. That's pretty big and all, but its still restricting. The strongest, most powerful designs are going to look like Borg cubes because of it. Aside from that, this game is actually pretty fun once you get used to the odd ""space friction"" and ""springboard borders"". If you like designing weaponized ships, this game is worth the buy."
