Pix the Cat doesn't disappoint with it's addictive gameplay and a surprisingly variety of modes that change up the formula enough for each one to feel like a meaty experience. Well worth the money and well worth score chasing!"
76561197993891197,Recommended,330180,20902795,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,CtrlAltDestroy,"This game is like some bizarro version of Pac Man Championship Edition DX+, requiring many of the same skills. It’s also much harder.The goal of each board is to grab all the eggs, then walk over every circle. A chick will hatch out of every egg you touch and start following you, forcing you to play Snake until you can drop them onto the circles and get rid of them. For maximum points, you need to pick up every egg on the board before stepping on a single circle, turning most boards into a tough pathfinding puzzle. The most creative idea at work here is the way you can take portals back to previous levels at any time, which is sometimes required for playing optimally.The biggest difference from Pac-Man, and the reason why this game is so hard, is because of all the sharp turns. There were no sharp turns in Pac-Man: every single turn was made at an intersection, giving you at least one extra moment to plan your turns ahead. Pix the Cat forces you to constantly make sharp turns while running at high speeds and painting huge swaths of the level with intricate space-filling paths if you don’t want to break your combo. As with all puzzle games which attempt to slide you smoothly across a fixed grid (like Chuck’s Challenge, some versions of Boulder Dash, and so on) it can be very difficult to tell when you’re properly “inside” a square and how long you have to make a turn, which is very much an issue here. Furthermore, each board is presented at a different zoom level and Pix is constantly speeding up, making it nearly impossible to judge turns by intuition alone. Your instincts will fail you unless you focus intensely on your every move. It’s very difficult and requires a lot of skill and practice, but fortunately the game was (at least for me) addictive enough that I was inspired to keep trying until I succeeded.The boards are mostly the same every time, except for some small randomized details to mix things up, and you’re given 5 minutes (with no way to earn additional time) to clear as many boards as possible and earn a high score. It’s possible to memorize some basic routes that will work every time, but you’ll have to slightly adapt them depending on how the levels change, and you’ll have to earn speed if you want to progress further before time runs out. While it might seem like a dubious design choice at first to have all of the levels be the same every time, you’ll be thanking the heavens for the consistency if you’re serious about earning high scores and getting those tough achievements. And if you want variety, the game comes with two more level sets of varying difficulties.Aside from the main game, there are also two puzzle modes which honestly could’ve been games by themselves. My favorite is the Nostalgia mode, a series of 70 action-puzzle levels which adorably try to pass off the main character as a Felix the Cat / Mickey Mouse ripoff from the 1930s, complete with a sepia tone filter and authentic old-timey music. The other puzzle mode has you playing through 100 thinking levels, trying to find the optimum solution to each room in the least number of moves. It’s a bit slow compared to the other game modes, but the puzzles are respectable brainteasers with clever solutions. There’s also a multiplayer mode that I haven’t gotten to try, but it looks hilarious.Overall, it’s a worthy, addictive Pac-Man variant with tight (but punishing) gameplay, and it was given far more coats of polish than I honestly would have expected from a game like this. I’d recommend it to any gamer who has the type of determination and OCD that would inspire one to perfect a BIT.TRIP level, but probably not for the casual achievement hunter. I’d give it 20-30 hours of gameplay to 100% depending on how good your reflexes are."

The arcade mode does repeat however does offer fun visuals with quick and responsive and addictive gameplay, while the two other modes do involve good puzzle mechanics and taking a different perspective on things. If you need controller support, avoid, due to the input lag that it seems to have (disconnect your controller entirely, it screws with gameplay with keyboard too). But all in all, a fun arcade style game.For more first impressions and gameplay, check out the video:http://youtu.be/h_KKR2ccP3o"

To my mind, it's a very successful hybrid of Pac Man championship Edition and the good old Snake game. The gamplay is simple, well implemented and requires a high level of skill/accuracy/timing with additional benefit derived from learning the maze layouts. Scores benefit significanlty from flawless execution which further underline the need to perfect technique - again, true to the essence of a traditional arcade game.The menu system is presented logically and the graphics colorful, with the whole experience not being overly 'cute'.The sound (something often overlooked in many games) is excellent and adds significantly to the enjoyment - it's one of the high points of an already extremely fun game.On the down side, it doesn't play particularly well on the 8 way joystick I have in my arcade cabinet. If you're using a joypad or even a keyboard, you should be good to go.Pix the Cat is wholeheartedly recommended, particularly if you see it on-sale or as part of a bundle. Even at full price I'd recommend it if you enjoy an authentic arcade experience. High scores for the win!"
,Recommended,330180,14230171,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,Queen Rabid,"Pix the Cat is very fun. If you like arcade style games you will like this.Arcade mode is impressive. Level design is good and tricky. The ramp up in difficulty is nice though. There are different stages. The beginner stage does well in introducing you to the controls. The Main stage is where it starts to get very tricky.The main stage introduces you to some tougher gameplay. Planning out the fastest route without breaking your combo gets tougher. The unique nesting of the levels inside the stage provides for some shortcuts, if you can find them.Laboratory mode is a nice change of pace from arcade mode. It is more focused on puzzles and you have to complete a stage in as few moves as possible.Arena mode is alright. There are a good amount of stages to choose from. There is standard ammunition to throw at your friends as well as missiles and mines to plant. Rounds are over pretty quickly and this mode could use a little more variety.There are challenges with unlocks. The unlocks are actually prizes worth doing the challenges for. Different announcers are up for grabs, as well as art, new stages and more.Overall this game is worth the money. A good mix of puzzle and twitch reflexes."
,Recommended,330180,21911890,"Posted: 18 March, 2016",all,arleas,"At first glance this game would seem like a direct clone of ""Pac Man Championship edition"".  It even sorta has a similar vibe as that game with the art style.  However, turns out this game is a bit more challenging than Pac Man Championship Edition.First off, you are a cat moving through a maze. You eat eggs which then pop out little duckies that trail behind you.  Your job is to lead the duckies to a ""drop off"" zone without getting trapped by a long string of duckies. So far it's pretty close.  The thing is, each level is nested inside the one before it, so you end the level and a little vortex opens leading you to the next level.  You can even go back to previous levels by going through the same vortex again.  Sometimes you need to do this, and sometimes it just wastes your time.Oh yeah, that was another factor here.  You're on a timer.  The more you play, the faster you go.  The faster you go, the harder it becomes to hit turns accurately (it's a matter of timing) and the more risk you run of being trapped by your tail of duckies like you would in the game Snake.   Another benefit to going faster is that your combo meter goes up which in turn makes your point value for everything go up.Also there's the matter of doing it right the first time.  I mean, you can pick up one or two duckies and immediately drop them off, but you lose the ""perfect"" bonus doing that.  If you die with a long string of duckies behind you, you lose all those duckies (and drop off points) so that you can't get as many points when you finally finish the level.   The best way to win this game is to play it logically and precisely.Even still, there's a timer and ultimately when it runs out the game is over.  There are in-game achievements for getting to certain levels within the time limit as WELL as achievements for hitting a certain score.  I didn't see the steam popup saying I got an achievement though.  It was just an end of level thing that unlocked some artwork and music and other things.Speaking of unlocks, there's a few game modes that aren't available from the start either. You have to hit a certain score to unlock these other game modes. To assist you in this you can use your best score run as a ghost to show you if you're ahead of schedule or behind and if you're following the previous pattern of egg munching or not.The graphics look ok but I'm not a big fan of the art style.  It doesn't get in the way of the gameplay though and I guess it lends some atmosphere to it.  The music is very nice and helps make the menu screen look happy while adding a bit of urgency to the in-game levels.I haven't played this game a ton, but it's got a nice casual ""pick up and play"" feeling that will ensure I'll be able to grab it and go for 10-20 minutes at a time without a big time investment. In my old age I'm finding shorter game sessions to be better for me so that's a plus.  If you're looking for something that you can play for hours on end, I doubt this is the game for you unless you're extremely focused and very competitive.It's a very fun game though, and well worth playing."

It's quirky and interesting and really challenging, and seems to go on long enough to get as hard as you can survive.  It's got more interesting and challenging mechanics (speeding up over time) than either of those games did, too.I was convinced to recommend this game right at the point I unlocked Laboratory mode, which is essentially puzzle mode, but really fun.

I've been addicted to it the past several days, largely owing to the continuous drive of ""I can do better! I know I can!"" For an arcade puzzle-ish game, it's extraordinarily exciting and tense; it's a rush when you're in ""fever time"", and losing it has such a profound sense disappointment, especially in conjunction with the accompanying audio transitions. Oh, and I was further thrilled when I discovered additional game modes, each of which with its own unique motifs that could pass as their own games, yet still maintain the original base mechanics. My only critique is that I wish there were a bit more variety in the stage progression; although there are variations, you do end up learning the same boards.
