,Not Recommended,330270,17639032,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,TheDarkSun,"Alright, I feel that I got the most of this game within my ~6hours of gametime. Let's see why exactly I clicked Not Recommended button.Quick summaryPros:-Fun, fast gameplay with some skill involved-Many heroes to play, all of them have distinctly different abilities-Loot system provides basic customizationCons:-Horrible UI and overall lack of critical information-Poor dificulty curve, areas 1,2 are perfect, 3 is hard as hell and 4,5 are just a breeze. Same with area bosses-Certain areas have extremely repetative gameplay, spawn points allow for easy abuse-Almost no replayability aside from trying new heroBreakdownGameplay:Wave based action with some loot and skill progression. 5 Areas, 5 bosses. Many different heroes to play. Simple and elegant.Loot:You have 5 slots that you can equip dropped items to, there are few stats and around 10 Special Abilities attached to the items themselves. Not much creativity but does the jobClasses:Truly outstanding feature of this game, all classes feel different, have different tactics and MIGHT have a few distinct builds.Hero skills:You have 4 skills (aside from 1 hero who has 7) and you can level them up. This will be very familiar to players of Risk Of Rain. 4 skills, 4 button to press. Usually is goes something like - basic attack, special attack, dodge ability and some sort of an ultimate, although it might vary from hero to hero.UI:Horrible. Well, maybe close to horrible but still really really bad. When you try to compare pieces of equipment you only see stat comparison that is already on the previous item. Example - if your item has no armor but has cooldown reduction and if the new item has armor and has no cooldown reduction it will just show you +33 armor and will not compare non-existent stats. It is REALLY hard to compare items at a glance and you have to constantly switch from item to item to understand if you want to use one or another. Skills APPARENTLY have two different power levels, 1 is before you put 4 points into it and 1 is after. This is NOT mentioned anywhere and seems like a critical piece of information missing. Some skills SEEM to get new abilities with new power level - life steal, health regen etc , but that is also NOT mentioned anywhere, skill descriptions are only visible in tutorial and do not provide enough information. You have a certain level requirements to upgrade skill beyong certain level, but that is badly represented and the only indicator is that they are not hightlighed during the level-up process.Movement:Very floaty, has almost no precision, hard to dodge certain attacks. Hitting flying enemies feels like a roulette as you cannot control angle of attacksMobs:Decent variety, some really cool designs, some (IMHO) horrible decisions on mob power. Area 3 has the most annoying Spearman that is basically harder than any boss of the gameBosses:First 2 bosses are AS COOL AS THEY CAN BE! They are fun to fight, unique and present decent challenge. The rest are boring and super-easy to fight. Seems like the developer ran out of creativity\time to polish themAreas and levels:Hard to say. Some platfroms, some fires, some nice backgrounds. Nothing special, nothing bad.Difficulty:Super-weird. First two levels are nicely balanced and present good challenge. Third Area is just super-hard due to one type of monster who can silence your attacks, slow you down AND teleport to you to punch you. One wrong move and you are dead. Fourth and fifth Areas are easy, I have not died once and never even came close to being in trouble. It seems that the late-game might not be balanced hence the weird difficulty curveReplayability:In my opinion - none. Game is around 3 hours per run, by the end I felt tired and bored. Played a bit of horde mode, got even more tired and bored.Overall:Nice game, but has very little to offer for the price. I would only recommend to buy it of huge sale, around 2-3 dollars just to try it outCheers!"

,Not Recommended,330270,19827145,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Robotlegs,"Pros:- It's fun for a decent while solo, despite its simplicity.- Good variety of heroes to choose from.- Excellent fun when you have friends to play with. (See cons section for details).- Fast paced and can get the blood rushing.- Art style/theme is unique.- Decent music.Cons:- Pretty repetitive.- Netcode is really really bad.- Sometimes your save file will just flat out erase itself for no reason.- Totally improper scaling of enemies. 1st area is too easy, 2nd is only slightly harder, and then 3rd area destroys your face.- Rainer is the only hero worth playing? The others may have interesting themes of mechanics, but they really suck in comparison.- The developer pushes out updates at the speed of smell. I'd wager at this point that the game has been abandoned. If I could have gotten a refund for this, I would. I just gave the game and developers too much faith.- The enemies aren't interesting, and they're either really easy, or unimaginably unfair.- Horde mode is a good idea, but it's capped at the point where you are permanently silenced (unable to use any skills) by enemies and die. Losing regardless of how good you are is a really bad design concept.- Horde leaderboards are plagued by cheaters, and there's no accountability.- Gear ""choices"" aren't really choices, since there's clearly superior equipment that you'll never want to substitute out.- Music is really really really really really really repetitive."

Too rough around the edges for me.Levels are too small to provide much in the way of dynamic fights. Pick the best spot for the character and camp it until the level is over. No incentive to move.Characters aren't super interesting. Their abilities are different, but only a few feel like they really play differently. Everyone has a dash of some kind.Movement doesn't feel very tight. Combined with the rough feel of abilities when moving, I find myself uncomfortable when playing."
,Recommended,330270,17722048,"Posted: 26 August, 2015",all,lolschrauber,"There's not really much to explain about the gameplay that you can't see in the trailers.It's a 2d hack and slash that has monsters attacking in waves. After the last wave you advance to the next stage until you reach the end of an act.You level up and upgrade your skills, you can find and buy gear to increase your stats.Unfortunately, there are no unlockable abilities, only things to unlock are the characters.There are plenty of playable characters to pick from, which all play differently.Sometimes they might seem pretty weak at first, but that gets better as you level up your skills and get some better gear.Difficulty is a little unbalanced, act 1 and 2 are quite easy, 3 is insanely difficult, 4 is really easy and 5 is medium difficulty. You get a boss on the end of each act, but those are not too hard either.There's also an endless survival mode with a leaderboard to play.Can't say anything about the multiplayer part, haven't tried it yet.Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of replay value I think, unless you like to play all the characters.Overall, pretty decent game to kill some time, I really got hooked and was a little disappointed that it feels rather short, so I suggest playing this in small doses.Not related to the actual gameplay, but the developers seem really nice.I originally wrote a negative review because of broken controller support and I was personally contacted by a developer after it was fixed! Now that's some service."

Needs work.Pros:_Excellent characters: If you're a MOBA fan, you're gonna have a good time here. Characters are varied in term of play style and a lot of them are fun to play. 5 are unlocked at the start, with more unlocked as you play the game. Easily the strongest point of the game._Pixel art style: A more personal point than a professional one. I really like pixel art style, this game looks quite nice in that regards._Great boss fights: The bosses are big, bombastic, chalenging and fun to fight against._The actual gameplay: On a minute-to-minute basis, the game is fun, nice control with lots of chaotic fights.Cons:_Terrible level design: The moment leading up to the boss fights are just rooms, each with waves of enemies spawning one wave at a time. It's really really REALLY lazy design. There's nothing to break up the pace either. No puzzles, no platforming. As good as the boss fights are, the levels leading up to them feels more like time sinks than levels._The loot system isn't interesting: Plenty of random loots here, but not all of them are interesting. As a matter of fact, most of them aren't interesting at all. If you're looking for the the kinda loot-generation depth of Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile, you won't find it here._Some characters need balancing: I'm looking at you, Fallen Angel.Overall, you'll like this game if:_You want a cast of well-design, diverse playable characters._You can overlook the overall design and focus on the excellent minute-to-minute gameplay._You dig the art style._You can stomach the levels enough to enjoy the (honestly great) boss fights.The potential here is immense!

Unfortunately the developers did not put enough effort into polishing the gameplay and balancing the difficulty level. There is no real challenge, no penalty for death und no variety. Most enemies can be defeated by mashing a single button. Especially the later bosses are no challenge at all. Many of the player's attacks just automatically target the nearest enemy, so it never really feels like there is actually any skill involved. The loot and the shop system are also a joke. Most of the time I had way to much money but there was nothing better to buy compared to the gear that had already dropped. The only thing the devs got right is the presentation. The music, the graphics, the sound and the animations are really nice. But that is just not enough the save the game. Don't buy!"

The almost three hours I have in this game allowed for 2 complete playtroughs of the available content at the time and it was very easy.

Very excited to see what the dev does with this game. 9/10 first look score.Pros:Ice Witch (character played) Seems well balanced! Hard to come by these days. Games that seem fairly balanced at least.Enemies are very creative and are distinct. Enjoyed learning their traits and how to fight them.Item upgrading is progressive and well paced.Abilities were fun to level and combined nicely with each other AND with item ability procs.Cons:Being a grinder, I felt I should be able to return to previously visited levels. Not the case (yet?).Certain elements of levels seemed unneccesary. I was able to sit in a corner if I felt like it, game didn't really force me to use/dodge elements of the environment.Ability tooltips are a must.Suggestions for the developer:Interactive items on levels (explosive barrels, buttons that activate level things when YOU hit them, etc.)Items that grant set bonusesJump height being a stat, make high jump accessible only areasSecret cubbies on levels with chest/loot/health/etc.Through this dev phase can we please new game+ toons or something >:OThere's always more things to suggest, but that's all I've got for now. I am glad I pre-purchased into this game, If you're on the fence on it and you can afford the $14, my vote would be to do it.TL:DR - Worth donating to the cause, games got it goin' on."

The two exceptions to that are skills and equipment.  You get to choose which skills go up first, which makes things easier, but it feels like inevitable progression.  Most of the equipment isn't interesting, and feels like there are obvious best equipment for each character (which makes it feel like less of a choice and just an obvious assessment).I hope to see more as this game develops."

However, if you wish to tackle this game, you are either going to need some friends to play with (locally or online) or be willing to grind and grind and grind.  That is really the only bad thing I can say about this game, you will have to replay levels just to get your character where he needs to be to make the game fun.  Because of this, at times, it feels like a chore rather than a game.  BUT, that is the only bad thing I have to say about this game.

You can't remap keys and the jump is bound to up stick button which is plain awful. There's also no rumble.The game has only a couple of music tracks which get boring quite fast and plenty of bugs, one which prevents you from starting the game again after you beat it. So you are either forced to start over or wait for fixes.Characters seem very unbalanced in their difficulty as well, with ranged warlocks being easier to play and more powerful overall.While i like the aesthetics and the challenge this game poses, i can't recommend it right now, at least not until that major game breaking bug is fixed."
,Recommended,330270,14936992,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Droucil,"I first thought this would be a game where you would advance from the left to the right of the map killing monsters on the way. But instead its a wave based game, which is just fine aswell. First try I did, it killed me right away. Not knowing the controls very well. But with a little bit of training I got it under control. Feeling smooth to play and very enjoyable aswell. Just played one char so far, but I know for sure that I will be playing a lot more of them.Item customization is pretty good. Having items with bonus skills like your skill Z now also applies 80% less movement speed for 1.5 seconds or 31 fire damage each time you use a skill, etc. The total game time is about 3-4 hours right now for one walkthrough. So playing multiple characters, also unlocking new characters, will extend this game time. It is ofcourse early acces, but most of the content is already released. Maybe next game plus will be added later?Co-op and PvP doesn't seem to work yet for online, there is an online co-op but there are zero rooms. Hopefully this will be better once the game gets more players. I don't see any options for online PvP except for local.

76561198085189433,Recommended,330270,14943334,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Azeal,"I have been waiting for this game for almost a year with some anticipation. Surprisingly this game has been relatively close to what I expected, which isn't common.The art style is - as some people have commented in then forum - quite similar to risk of rain. However it is a little larger (which in my view is more appealing) and the backgrounds have a bit more detail.The campaign mode consists of small maps, each map has waves of enemies to destroy. After several maps you fight a boss, unlock a character and progress to the next stage.As you advance in levels you can level up skill slots, of which you have four, you also collect equipment. Your progress, skill slot level ups, and equipment are save slot bound - leaving you free to switch between characters between any map and maintain your level, gear and progress. This works quite well and alows you to switch to mages that may be advantagious for any given map and prevents you from getting bored of the same old skills.I'm not a huge fan of the campaign mode. That being said in this type of game I generally only do the campaign to unlock maps and characters. The campaign mode isn't boring, and, is at a perfect difficulty. Quite challanging but not offputtingly so. However there are a few skills on some warlocks which when leveled up can be exploited for easy, tedius victories. However given the early access status of the game and the overall balance I imagine this will be addressed quite quickly - or at least by the time the product is finished.The versus maps are appealing and well designed. The warlocks are better balanced for versus mode, however there are some skills that still have some balance issues. Furthermore the warlocks have interesting and creative skills with very different playstyles. Chaging between warlocks makes the combat very different.For those who are sceptical about purchasing early access games I would recommend that this one is worth it. If you have read the description and watched the trailer and think you will enjoy the game, you probably will. The mechanics are well developed, however the content is incomplete. If you are interested in this game solely for single player or co-op campaign you may want to wait for more content, otherwise it is well worth the buy.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM"

At the beginning it allows you to recognize what the game is and how it is played, gathering items and learning some of the ""adventurers"". Later on in chapters, new enemies with additional abilities come out to play, in which you must put your skill to the test for what you have been doing before, it worthless. Nice change of pace and inspired by the game Risk of Rain, another great game I recommend."

The ""Story Mode"" is just a series of wave survival missions set in different levels, probably with bosses, but I'll admit I didn't get very far in the game.I played it with a friend, and the enemies starting out are so difficult that we were immediately discouraged upon reaching the second level.The game is slow paced, enemies take tons of damage to kill, and the sprite animation really isn't all that great.

I am really suprised how much I am enjoying a game, that I just so happened to find wandering around the rpg pages of the steam store. The controls are really responsive allowing for really clutch game play, the boss fights are engaging and always keep you on your toes (took me i think 10 times to beat first boss frustratingly fun), online/local multiplayer which is always a bonus since I play with a small group of guys. Only issue I had with the multiplayer was the lag (It may be because I am playing currently on hotel internet, leaning toward that.) The single player mode kept me playing by itself, and I am the kind of guy who will buy a game and play it for maybe an hour and then drop it. The multiple warlocks really keeps the game fun to and the Tutorial allows you to try out all the warlocks and giving you hints on all there different abilities (aka its not a copy paste tutorial with just basic knowledge, probably because no mouse so you can view tooltips). I would say one thing they could add is while in warlock select I can see what abilities they have I had to make a new profile to view all the other warlocks after i immediatly played in online multiplayer."

There's a few things I think anyone reading this should know before buying.1) The developers mean it when they say they're withholding content until release.  I have completed all of the early access storyline in the first day.2) There is no ""choose an act"" option, at least not yet...This means when you hit a rock, you're stuck until you wiggle your way to freedom.  It can be really frustrating to face content you don't feel prepared for.3) Skills have no description, or at least no easily discernable method of locating.  It's a shame I thought one of the best characters in the game was terrible because I didn't stumble on their synergies until the very end.4) You get to spend skill points, but whatever you allocate to whatever button, say skill 1, is allocated to skill 1 for all other Warlocks.  This is probably the most frustating part of the game...Certain characters definitely excel with more power in certain skills, but you are pretty much forced into adapting to a single character unless you are able to find an overlap or just evenly distribute.5) Items are dull and unclear in purpose until their stats are tremendously higher.6) THIS IS NOT RISK OF RAIN.  There are graphical similarities, but this is in no way a rogue-like.  There is no tension of impending doom.  The game's merit is in testing your ability to manuever in a relatively small arena against a relatively large pack of enemies.  It takes skill, but there is no ""monsoon doomsday clock"" breathing down your neck.7) There is no endless mode or anything othere than PvP and completely restarting once you finish EA...It's kind of tragic to build up your Warlocks only to suddenly be unable to enjoy them.8) Finally, PvP doesn't have an online ""find/host a game"" feature.  Kind of pointless for those without the capacity to couch co-op.All of that said, the game is excellent.  It's rare that I invest time into a game on early access equal to the value paid...And even though I'll have to start over, I'm sure I'll be running through the game with my friends this weekend!"

It is extrememly buggy and makes additional gameplays of it difficult if not impossible unless you create new profiles.My view:The gameplay and the amount of options are excellent. Several heros to choose from and good item drop system. I initially got the game cause it looked like it was a good local co-op, and it was... to a point.Pros.Excellent Game playEasy learning curve to pick up and playWaves get More difficult at each stageMultiple characters and game playsLocal co-op increases difficulty for more playersCons.The interface is terribly done. (After selecting a mode you may have to start the game and select quit to get back to the main menu!)Not often, but some of the levels have acted... buggy. (One levels background was glitching... blinking in and out repeatedly. Only happened once.)If you beat the game with a character in Single or Local Co-op that character can ""infect"" other characters... as I would put it. (explanation: You can choose the level you go to after you beat the game with that character, but when you do local co-op, probably does the same in online co-op, if you select the character who beat the game, your friends character and your character go up against the final boss. Their character is now viewed as either being on the final level against the final boss or is viewed as beating the game and offered the level select next time they are played in single player mode.)If you get this game I would recommend getting it on sale because of most of the interface bugs that make it hard to call 'user friendly'. If you get this game, have fun, good luck, and try not to get frustrated with the interface, and if they make a second one of these games I may still have to get it cause the game play was good, but I hope they fix these issues and make more replayability.Local co-op recommendations:I would also recommend  beating the game with one profile, in single or co-op, so you have all the characters and always loading that profile when you start. Then when your friend joins you to play or if you simpley want to start a new profile with all the characters, go to story and select local multi-player, then load the newly created profile. This will allow your new profile and your local friends new profile to access all the characters through the initial profile (The characters will start at whatever level you had them at, so you won't be on the final boss and they won't be Level O.P.)"

The controlls are fun, the music is epic, and the gameplay is amazing.  I know that they still have some things to fix, but if they fix these things, then it will be an even better game.  1. I completed the campaign (up until the campaign hasn't been made) and i'd like a mode where you can go back to other campaign missions that you have completed.  2. I tried playing with my brother online and it was really laggy.  I would be moving around on my screen but on my brother's screen i was just standing in fire getting hurt.  Fix this please.  3.  An online versus mode would be awesome.  It is kinda hard to hook up 2 keyboards on 1 computer.  If they fix these things then this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played.  Keep up the good work guys."

Story seems nice so far looks like 3 more chapters let in development, which would be nice.Haven't tried the multiplayer yet but the single player has been nice, although some characters are overly complicated  like The Shaman where as, Rainer, The Guardian is really powerful and easy, could probably use some tweaks to characters but overall seems nice and diverse.An addition to the game that woulld be good in my opinion is a sort of endless mode or just stage mode without the story so you can try out some of the characters as there dosent appear to be a way to reset the story progresss and just try them against the base enemies."

You can't select anything with it, there's like 3 different buttons to move left and right, but you can't accept anything. Makes me pretty upset."

I managed to have some free time with my boring life to play this game, and beat the game with each character, so far, it was a great experience since I enjoyed playing Risk of Rain.Pros:Each character has their own unique playstyle, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.Leveling up skills for some characters add different animations / strengths to them.Items are interesting, their stats are randomly generated, but adds some depth to how lucky you can get with your gear if you're greedy to seek better items; the shop helps with this too. The bosses are pretty fun to fight, they're pretty creative since the animation in this game is pretty fluid; can be fast-paced depending on your character/playstyle.Cons:Yes, this game is in its early stages so there are plenty of bugs, for example, some item passives don't stack, character can become bugged easily or glitched and end up at the last boss somehow, etc. This doesn't happen very often, but nonetheless, -it can-. Multiplayer isn't in its best shape... there's hardly any functionality, but i'm sure it will be fixed in the future. Also, the game difficulty itself can be pretty dull, you'll inevitably reach a certain point where you'll just become really strong and beat everything since difficulty won't change, unless you're not lucky with RNG or messed up leveling skills for the character. Skills don't have a tooltip so you won't really know what you're upgrading other than figuring it out with common sense. Bosses are very limited with their capabilities, thus becoming really easy to beat. Some stages of the game can become extremely boring since the spawnrate is really slow. In regards to the melee characters, their attack animation for the Z really screws them over and sets them apart from the ranged character where there's no delay (animation) stopping them. Items are extremely limited to stats. Sure, there are different combinations for passives, randomly generated stats for whatever item, but there's not much diversity in regards to gameplay. It's either you have 1 or 2 of the 6-7 innate passives (which don't stack) for each item.Until they fix these, add difficulties, and other challenges, i'd say 7/10 because like I stated earlier, I see a lot of potential in this game."
