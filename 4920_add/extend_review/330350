What I find strage though is that they didn't change/optimize anything for pc, I won't go into details but the menus are poorly exicuted.After watching a shrot movie, level 1 drops you into the game with no instructions. I pressed all the keys and found ""U"" and ""e"" brings up a basic menu, ""r"" restarts the level, ""space"" and ""x"" ues a jetpack and ""Z"" fires a missile. I didn't even know he could fire until 15 min in and there's no options screen so you can't look over the controls. There's a startup popup box where you can change the controls... In theory. It doesn't actually work, and the keys I described don't show up as bound to anything.As a runner game, the screen will always scroll you right. The gameplay is nice, the levels are well put toghether and while the artwork is appealing, it isn't very defined. I keep crashing into objects look like they're part of the background. It's also not clear which objects damage you, which ones you can blow up and what powerups do. The biggest problem I have is that my jetpack keeps stalling. At first I thought it runs out of fuel but now I think it has to do with how high you are on the screen. An indicator of when I can and can't use it would be nice. This game gives you no information.Every now and then you will get to ditch the jetpack robot and use bigger ships, I found these levels the best. There are 2 chapters with 10 levels each and 4 bonus levels in the game.It is playable and can be fun, but understand the production values are low and no one bothered to put on much polish. While I can't find the mobile version, this is a standard android game. On the android marketplace, the first chapter would typically be free and the rest would be $1. Or free all the way with ads maybe."

76561198018349448,Not Recommended,330350,17762318,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,Korentoth,"tl;dr: Robotex is tough to even play.  It could be better.--Note: There's a ""Classic"" mode and a ""Turbo"" mode.  This review is based on ""Classic.""Robotex is a hybrid of puzzle and shooter.  It presents itself like a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, but earning medals is more like solving a puzzle.  The ""puzzle-shooter hybrid"" was fantastically executed by another game, Ikaruga.  What differences are there between these two games, such that Ikaruga was fantastic and Robotex lackluster?Shmups present a lot of information at once.  Skillful players can filter out the important bits, like where the player hitbox is and what's going to kill you.  Robotex fails to adequately distinguish gameplay elements from fluff.  The background elements blend with the foreground elements so much that it's unclear what is an obstacle and what isn't.  The ""cloud"" enemies are a good example of an important element that's hard to see.  Special effects, such as explosions, are painted on top of all other elements, including lethal projectiles.  Being unable to see what killed you leads to a lot of unfair deaths.Shmups require precision both to dodge and to aim, and precision requires tight controls.  In other words, the player model should react instantly and predictably to my commands.  The controls of Robotex require you to look ahead, which is impossible with these graphics.  Pressing the ""fly"" button builds momentum (until the robot crosses an invisible line, with no indication that the rockets have stopped), after which the robot goes into freefall.  Holding ""fly"" an instant too long or too short can be disastrous, and you may not know which until it's too late.  Aim and movement are combined, so that you can only aim down when you're moving up, and can only aim forward when you're falling.  To aim at an enemy directly ahead, you must fly above it.  The delayed, sometimes unpredictable movement makes Robotex a game of trial and error, rather than a game of skill.An example of a difficult prediction:http://i.imgur.com/eiAUcfn.jpgThe black cloud damages anything underneath it.  Start flying too soon, and you won't land on the rock.  Start flying too late, and you'll hit the cloud.  Let go too soon, and you won't land on the rock.  Let go too late, and you'll hit the ceiling and lose all forward velocity.  By the way, the rock is above the ""invisible line"" where rockets stop working.Any game with a score system challenges the player not only to complete the game, but to complete the game well.  The ""puzzle"" aspect of Robotex is to acquire all the bonus medals.  That means playing each level again and again, figuring out exactly how to approach each enemy and then executing the plan.  Unfortunately, it's hard to see the enemies in the first place, and harder still to perform the plan given these controls.  Shmups are enjoyed for requiring the player to react to the environment while permitting different ways to tackle the challenges presented.  Robotex offers very limited choices, which makes replaying each level routine instead of unique.There are many smaller areas that could be improved.  There could be more variety to the graphical themes of levels.  There could be more variety in pacing, slower sections with fewer enemies contrasted by frenetic sections with many dangers, or static obstacles contrasted with moving dangers.  There could be music.  There are bugs.All in all, Robotex is a game that was worth the nine cents I paid for it.  With some spit-shine, it could be worth up to a dollar.  If you're a game designer, it's an excellent example of what goes wrong when you fail to follow certain shmup tropes."

And no, not just Lucky Star, Naruto and DBZ. I read KHR, reading DGM, Black Butler and Fullmetal. I use the word 'weeb' / 'weeaboo' only to denote 11 year olds who watch one episode of Naruto, buy 50 Naruto merchandise items and can only say 'kawaii', 'desu' and 'baka'.Otaku I use to denote people who actually know who the main character of Naruto is, but spend a whooooole lot of time watching anime / reading manga. Obsessors, but knowlodgeable ones at that.People like me, those who like / love anime but not to a ""OMG NARUTO KAWAII DESU-KA NOTICE ME SENPAI~~~ >3<"" level, I call anime lovers :)I actually asked some palestinian kid my mom knows who the main character of Naruto was. He said he forgot. He then proceeded to get smoked in Naruto knowledge by a 9 - 10 year old."

The game drops you on a selection screen but gives you no indication why you are selecting something and what the difference between those selections is.*Spoiler* On the first level a tree falls on you without any warning (ie. it is not even visible on the screen until it crushes you) and your robot is stuck.

,Recommended,330350,13016423,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,ViperZeroOne,"RobotEx is a mixed bag when it comes to reviewing.  It's not an amazing game, but it's not a bad game either.This is an automatic side-scroller with very little controls, as it was obviously made primarily for a portable platform.  Pressing the spacebar makes you go up, letting go makes you go down.  The only other key is P, which fires your forward rockets.  When you first start the game you're given a controller config screen, which seems to be a bug as the controls are hard-coded into the game so the config screen is somewhat pointless.  Once you figure out that there are only 2 hard-coded buttons your control issues come to an end.  (unless you're one of those spoiled individuals who has to have complete control over their key configs)Starting out with the graphics, they're pretty detailed and very nice to look at.  I'd say right along par with other games in this genre.  My only gripe here is that initially it can be difficult to tell what's going to hurt you and what isn't.  This can lead to a few accidental deaths, but as you have unlimited lives it's really not a huge hinderance to the game.  Once you figure out what things will hurt you it's not too difficult to spot and avoid them.Sound in the game is pretty much whatever is absolutely required.  There isn't really any music but there are action sounds (rockets firing, explosions, etc) that will keep your ears from getting bored.  Again, the sound that's included is well done.The menu was a bit of a mixed bag, as it was obvously developed (again) for a portable system.  You have 3 worlds (colored file folders) to select from on the left and those give you the various levels available (1-1, 1-2, etc.) for you to select.  Clicking on a level begins said level.I'm a pretty intellgent person so figuring out the ""story"" wasn't too difficult for me.  It's presented in the form of cutscene-style video, but as there is no text or voices to the story it's up to you to figure out what's actually happening.  From what I understand, the world has come to an end and a fleet of ships has set off to find a new home.  You are therefore the explorer of these worlds.All in all the game could have been ported a little better for the PC.  It could have included a menu screen showing the keyboard commands (which you now know).  It could have been better fitted to the window.  They could have removed the on-screen button graphics, obviously used by the portable version.  There's a lot they could have done...  That said, I rather enjoy this game as a quick time waster as it doesn't take a lot of time to start and play a level.If you're spoiled with controller support, custom controls, and perfect ports than don't bother with this game.  That said, if you can see past it's rough ported edges then this game is going to be enjoyable for you.  At only $2 I'm certainly gonna recommend it."

It has simple controls, hold space to go up, let go of space to go down and press P to fire. Another issue with the game is that is says it has full audio support for 27 languages. The reason they have full audio support for so many languages is because it has no audio, except music. After getting used to these 2 issues, I started playing the game, only to realise that at some points, stuff would randomly fall on you without any visual que. I found this really frustrating and found it hard to believe that this game even managed to get onto steam. Overall, I would rate this game 1/10. Only buy this to gift to your friends to cause them alot of pain and suffering."

I discovered that Space fires jets which moves you, but you only have control of the thrust, not the direction, P fires rockets ahead of you and E opens the menu (which again gives no indication as to what the options are for). The usual Esc for options doesn't work and there is no controller support.This game looks as though it could have potential, but the complete lack of guidance frustrates and removes any possible enjoyment from the game."
