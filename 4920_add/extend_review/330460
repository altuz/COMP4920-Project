,Recommended,330460,18604411,"Posted: 21 October, 2015",all,Lemodile,"I originally reviewed Celestial Command on 21 October 2015. Since the game is being actively developed and updated, it's only fair that my review reflects that. I will leave my original review below.My opinion hasn't changed: This is a great little game with a ton of potential to grow into something fantastic. The game and the people behind it really deserve to be supported.What has changed in the past 9 months?- Graphics were pretty much overhauled and look even better now.- The game was optimized a bit more, increasing the game's performance. It definitely runs smoother than back in October.- Several important mechanics were added; Notable examples are improved functionalities of NPC space stations, and new modules like the shipyard and hydroponics.- The game now has (partial) translations into several languages. The localization effort is powered almost entirely by the community.- The small CC community now has its own Discord channel! If you're looking into the game and can't decide whether or not to get it, just visit and there will probably be someone to answer any questions you may have.https://discordapp.com/invite/HY4XJaK- Multiplayer performance has increased significantly, but it's not where it's supposed to be just yet.What has not changed?- The devs are still doing a great job communicating with their player base; about updates, ideas, bugs etc. They reply to almost everything, and in a timely manner at that.- The game's core mechanics are mostly the same. It's a slightly simplified space ship building game in a 2d sandbox galaxy where you can pretty much decide for yourself what you want to do with your fragile ship and crew.- Multiplayer still isn't quite stable. It works alright on fast connections and with all users under 200 ping. Otherwise hiccups and lag spikes become disruptive to game play.- Multiplayer still only works through direct IP connections, meaning you have to give people you want to play with your IP. Connections through Steam as well as official servers are planned, but are not here yet.- The game is still very much in early access and I expect that it will stay like that for the forseeable future. There are bugs, anomalies and incomplete features. If you cannot stomach that, do not under any circumstance get lured into any EA title whatsoever. For your own sake ^^----------------Original review from 21 October 2015----------------Give this a try. Perhaps, several tries :-)I'll be honest, your first times playing this will be confusing and possibly even frustrating. As everyone rushes to point out, the game is not finished and in extremely active development (more on that later). Eventually though, you get the hang of how everything works and it will be smooth flying from then on.It may be smart to tick the ""sandbox"" option the first few times so that you can first in peace check out the many options this game gives you, as well as figure out where some of the things you need are hidden.The game at its current stage (version 0.692 just came out as I'm writing this) is simple. You're in command of a space ship and you'd like to, well, not die. Or maybe you do want to die. It's your choice. You start in a reasonably safe orbit around a planet, along with several meteors and two space stations. You can mine the meteors for resources and you can trade with the space stations for food (so your crew doesn't starve). Other than that you're completely free, there's not really a story or objective at this time.About the development: I'm a huge fan of these devs. They are super responsive to anything and everything you post on their Steam page's forums, they actively deal with bugs, discuss ideas and future plans ..and they speak funny English :-) To be frank you'll notice this in the game as well but it's all perfectly understandable.tl;dr? SUPPORT the awesome people working on this game, be a part of the seemingly small community and make a difference in the development of this already very good game with the potential to be AWESOME.Celestial Command is worth it"

76561198237577814,Recommended,330460,18077945,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,davidalangay,"If you've played the excellent SimpleRockets, you are already familiar with terms like gravitational sphere of influence, apogee, perigee, Hoffman transfers, retrograde and prograde burns. If not, you may want to try playing SimpleRockets to give you the basics or read up on the terms online. You will need to know what these mean.To begin, this is an awesome game. You can travel within a solar system using several modes of propulsion. You can orbit planets and go to space stations. You can mine asteroids and shoot at things with a ship of your own design. You can do all of this in sandbox mode (it will give you things you need from a sandbox menu) or not (in which case you better know what you are doing). I really suggest using the sandbox mode until you are comfortable navigating and modifying your spaceship.I haven't tried muliplayer yet but I did start my own instance of a server so I can experiment in. Set a password you will remember so you are the only one to get into your instance. In this mode you are given a ship and are in orbit around a planet randomly spawned. Read the F1 help text carefully as it will get you familiar. Anything you need to build or remove from your ship is done in engineering.  You can build and destroy engines, power sources, solar panels, , reactors, corridors, cargo holds, command decks, struts, fuel tanks, a radar system, various weapons, a grapple hook, and a mining laser.Before you can use the object, it must be either connected to a power source or a tank. That's done easily by dragging and dropping nodes from the source to the object. You can connect multiple objects to a single tank or power source but remember you will empty that source faster if you do. Adding more sources of fuel or power will help, but it will increase the mass of your ship which will make it slower to turn.Moving around a solar system is not a simple manner of pointing your nose at a planet, star or asteriod and then firing your rockets because everything including you is in Newtonian motion. It's like trying to drive a car on ice. You have to kill one direction of motion before attempting to move in a new direction (retrograde burns come to play here) or slow down or speed up at the apogee or perigee points of your orbit. Failure to do this will result in your ship skidding and slidding off course.For a game that is in alpha, it is very stable. The game cost is insanely reasonable and there is a lot of play value provided you get past the learning curve. There's very little tutorial info here about the game to explain all the basics but two guides written and available on Steam will help you get started. If you keep in sandbox mode, experiment with ship design and orbital mechanics, and ask questions in the community area, you should get the hang of it.One  thing I would like to see added as  a feature is the clicking of planets to show info on your approach vector (both tangent and radial). You can do this with asteroids but not planets.A ship editor for creating and modifying a library of ship designs before entering the game would be great as well.Time dialation for up to 8x speed is not enough to see a discernable change in orbits and intrasolar system travel...perhaps 24 would be more appropriate?Buy the game! For 3 cups of coffee you get something that will keep you entertained yet challenged for days."

This isn't your typical arcade/causal nonsense - the game is as sophisticated as the games I was raised on and it takes realistic space to a whole new level.Be advised that the game is still in early development and is nowhere near fully playable. Still, I'm waiting eagerly for updates."

Meaning, probably not many players have this game or know about it.For anyone thinking of buying the game, i'll explain to you why you should.The priceThe price of when buying while it's still early access, is just 7,99 EUR. Not so sure about other currencies. This isn't much. When it's fully released, it will be doubledIf im rightGameplayThe gameplay is very smooth. Especially for an early access title. The amount of things you can do is pretty limited at the moment, but of what the developers have told us, this will be much more fun to play. Don't get me wrong. I'm already enjoying this alot.What im excited about the most, is the amount of updates and the developer-community relationship. The developers actually view the discussions, reviews and questions. And update the game according to what the people want to see.My personal favorite will be multiplayer.And while im at it, will there be planet interactions? Something i would really love to see is being able to inhabit a planet and build al kinds of structures on it. Miners, defence systems, that kind of stuff. And automated transporting between those planets using actual npc ships or something. Gives the player the feeling of power and accomplishment."

We all died during the transaction.10/10 I would try to buy FOOD again.——————Celestial command is an early access game. It is not the same type of early access as Factorio, but it has surely a lot of potential and it is already fun.The game is currently centered around a spaceship that you can modify at your will to navigate in the solar system in search for resources to mine, to sell them to space stations, in exchange for money and food.While the game is currently in a very minimal stage, I believe that the developers have explicitly warm you about it and the game is already fun."
,Recommended,330460,13060530,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,MindlessMe,"At first glance Celestial Command just looks like just another spaceship game, but if you take time to play it you will discover a very well designed sandbox experience. Even though the game is at a very early stage in development a lot of the really important features are there to enjoy.At this stage in development you can free build whatever ship your heart desires. Want to build a small mining ship to collect everything in the solar system, or what about a battleship to kill everything that comes across your path? All of this and much more can be built. The building mechanics themselves are intuitive and easy thanks to a snap in style feature. You can easily see what components will snap in to a given space and if you have any free points left. The only complaint I have to building is the unintuitive linking feature the modules use to become operational. Now, the feature isn’t bad in any right, in fact I love that everything has to be connected to work. My issue is that I have nothing to show me how or what to link in order to activate the module. Of course this issue can be easily fixed with a small tutorial for the game.After playing the game for a while I discovered the physics to be very well done. If you are familiar with any type of realistic orbital mechanics then you will feel right at home. If you are not then it may take some getting used to. The mechanics remind me a lot of Kerbal Space Program and at times Celestial Command feels like a 2D version of it. Of course in my case this is a good thing. The realistic mechanics give the game a welcomed challenge and add another layer of fun and experimentation.The overall design of the game is great from what I have seen up to this point. Although the game is being made in a 2D space the design is crisp and well done. When playing in HD all the textures and models look great. I will definitely look forward to seeing more from the team.Overall I would say development is coming along nicely. Of course you can see that at the time of this review the game has just released. With that being said, even at its current state the game is well worth the price. If you are looking for a fun game in which you truly free build any ship, fly through realistic space physics to kill and mine then what are you waiting for?It should go without saying but this is a review for the current EARLY ACCESS version of the game. If you buy the game it is at your own risk."

The interface is very polished and i can hardly distinguish that it is actually an early_access game.The reason i bought this game is because i loved this genere and wanted to get away from static ship modules and shooting all the way through galaxy. I wanted something that allows me to build what i like and run it in some realistic environment.So i waited and see.There are some good games that lets you do both:KSP,SimpleRockets,Reassembly,Istrolid,etc.But there was always something missing--KSP and SR was good but there was no sense of being in charge. Reassembly and Istrolid was great,too,but there isn't enough realism--void friction slowing you down,etc.In a way this is the game i have being waiting for....forever.The thought of flying real orbits and firing shells at whomever i want while always in charge and ready to send a fleet of starship to my enemy simply blows my mind.But i faltered when i saw it was Early_Access.I have learned my leason through many notorious Early Access titles that they were not to be trusted---NoMan'sSky was just another example of not-responsible developers that ruined their creations for the dollars.So i watched.I waited.And then i saw the devs updating very often(at least more often than Windows Security Essentials) and i saw numorous improvements--correcting Multiplayers, adding community guides,correct speed inherentment......and i saw the devs answering almost anyone in their threads and almost always very polite. That's when i decided to buy the game.I decided that i am going to support this game because of its great concept and encouraging devs. I bought the game. Frankly speaking i wasn't so sure that this is going to be the right investment.My first 10 mins in game made me change my mind immediately.I saw the integration of ship builder with the real time orbits. I saw seamless scrolling between starmap and the individual ships. I saw the extremely tech-looking parts the devs did. and i was overjoyed when my friend got into the game and blow me up.Seriously,this is the coolest thing i have ever seen.This is well worth the 31RMB I've invested.and considering that this game is just starting to be developed, i think i have made a great purchase.Although somebody may think that i have only played 5min or so when i wrote this thing,but the fact is that i ran the game from the installaion folder to save my time.In the process my 5hours play time wan't logged.(and i donnot like steam tempering my saves anyway)All in all, i would like to thank the devs to give us this great game and hope that they will use the money they earned to make the game better.So i do recommend this game."

Here is what i have so farPros:º This game is fun (for at least a few hours untill you completely give up and decide to crash your crew into the sun like i did which is also fun)º The graphics at the moment are nice. no real problem or lag.º I like how you can pretty much make your ship and add stuff like weapons, power sources,  and other miscellanious things to it.º the Keybinding and every thing else works good, so you can change the keys to fit your playstyle (unlike other developers that dont let you keybind or make it impossible to do so because of an unfixable game crash.)º can play with my friends pretty easily, i dont know if it'll be that way in the future though, most steam games started out with easy to make servers, but eventually become tedious and anoying when they start making you port forward, and blahh! blahh! blahh!.Cons:º Their has to be a better or easier way to harvest the space rocks, i often find myself crashing into them and now im at the point where i just play sanbox only and i give myself the ores and all i ever do is fly around in space untill i run into another planet or space rock.º Nothing to do at the moment. Just fly around. and crash ur crew into the sun.º The game gets really super♥♥♥♥♥laggy when i make a really big ship.º And getting from on point to the other is teadious as well, its takes forever to get to my space station.My End resolution:This isnt the type of game that i play for hours and hours at a time, its fun to come back to it and do som ship building in a while but shure needs more development. Non the less it keeps me coming back to build and crash my crew into the sun. so im giving this a thumbs up because its fun in some way and i want other to see this game as a new possibility, and i dont want to discourage the devs, it shure is  a fun game  and it needs to get more developed.

At the momment this is a bare bones space sim with (most) of the merciless physics of space.The negatives (as of November 30th, 2014--keep that in mind and read the changes logs)No storyline. Bad guys look like your ships. Have a basic AI.No missionsNo use for some of the mining resources.No in game tutorial. Read the guides first. Lots of information is missing at the momment or not apparent. I expect that to change.No mercy for the uninitiated. Fuel runs out and you'll be spinning and or zooming off to the great unknown.The good (again as of November 30th)Quick to play space ship sim. Guides are a quick read.Easy to build ships. Again, no tutorial yet but its not too hard to figure out.Physics! Also a curse if you want a action game. Things float away. Explosions send you (or your enemy) zooming away. The more mass you have the more fuel you consume. Fuel is a big deal here. Pesky objects block your solar panels preventing you from powering your defences."

I say this as a fellow developer of a beta product.The official stance towards wikis is that they ""don't like a wiki for games, because they are contains [sic] a lot of spoilers about game features."" [1] and they don't seem interested in prioritizing tutorials because they would ""spend a lot of additional time on any changes, which eventually will slow down the development."" [2] Technically true, but they're vastly overstating the amount of effort theyshouldhave to put forth to produce a wiki or document that goes over basic game mechanics! It simply isn't true that they would have to change everything for every feature because not everything changes with every feature!It's definitely true that afinite and non-zerolevel of effort would be required, but that's just part of sound development practices: documenting the functionality of your product. In the product that I work on for a living, we document our stack, the APIs we produce, individual libraries and classes, as well as protocols and the bigger picturebecause without that information, the barrier to entry for development is just too high.The exact same concepts apply to users playing the game.If they truly are changing every feature enough that they would have to change all of their documentation with every release, they have an entirely different problem altogether: instability and indecision in their development process. I know they don'treallyhave those problems (at least to that degree) because the game appears to be functionally the same month after month from my naive 1.0 hour playtime perspective and changing everything for a release simply doesn't happen. Not here and not for any other game.I know some of you would say that I just need to give the game some time (1 hour is incredibly low, indeed), but it's pretty damn important to provide some help to new users given that Steam now allows refunds, no questions asked, for 14 days with less than 2 hours of playtime. It would beverytelling to see what the refund rate is on a game like this. Don't worry, I'll check back in another two or three months and see if/how the game has progressed. If it looks like it's in a playable state, I'll give it another shot and update my review accordingly.[1]https://steamcommunity.com/app/330460/discussions/0/604941528474257819/[2]http://celestialcommand.com/?p=659"

First 2 minutes I smiled at the visuals and spent 30 Seconds giggling at the planet wracked by lightning storms. The following 6 Minutes. Failing to remember how to pilot a truely physics based starship. The next 5 Mintues were spent grinning like a dope at flying around and synchronising orbit with small Asteroids to mine them. Then I went afk for 7 Minutes. Upon my Return I found Aimmo here. Mining a large asteroid. So I mozzied on over to say hello.He failed to withdraw his right side solar pannel. This coupled with him changing his trajectory. Resulted in a minor collision. Cauzing the loss of his and my, right and left respective, solar pannels. Grief stricken by my companions betrayal. I retaillited. Coming into close range I used the ships limited mining laser to destroy his batterybanks and mining laser. Then I crippled his command module. Still angered I grappled his now crippled star ship. Dragging it away from the mining haunt.I then turned the RCS thrusters to full strength. Quickly accelerating into a whirlwind in space. I then promptly released the grappler. Throwing his mining ship into the asteroid. Debris from his ship rocketed out and collided with mine. Destroying my command module. The last 6 minutes were spent with both of us giggling so hard my side started to hurt and I had to use my inhaler.I love this game and am frantically reccomending it to my other space nerd friends. Please keep up the good work."

I love the spacecraft building aspect of this game but it obviously needs alot more items. I hope this is a dev that will stick with this game and keep working on it.I find the game fun but grow bored reletively quickly I have given it a few tries with each just lasting me an hour or two at which point it grows dull. This is a early access game so it is to be expected. It has grown since I purchased it and that makes me happy.I recommend this game but whether you should purchase it at this stage is difficult to say. If you want to follow the developement then sure but I cant see this game as one to sink hours into yet.

UPDATE: After reading Flaagg's review, I'm going to//  try this again.Even in its current pre-alpha state, gameplay is really very engaging.  It just kept me up until 4am!I would call this a 2D KSP.  But it's also artful, as you can see from some of the screenshots.  Reminds me of Factorio that way.I only recommend this game if you are already familiar with controlling orbits, (maybe if you've landed on the moon with KSP).  It also doesn't hurt if you've watched some of the youtube videos showing people who are hopelessly lost trying to figure out how the game works.  I know that helped me at least.The main gameplay (within 1 hour of picking up the game) is to keep the crew fed.  So landing on space stations is a big priority.  Along the way if you can mine an asteroid and sell some of the ore and use the money to pay for the food, then that's not half bad.  It also doesn't hurt to try to figure out how to optimize the ship to make it more maneuverable and hold more cargo, along with solar panels to recharge the batteries.And landing on the space station -- yeah whoever made those space stations was a complete dufus!  They put the landing ports in between the ship and the solar panels so there's all this maneuvering to try to connect without breaking things in the process!  :)  It's pretty fun and there's NO PAUSE, so it can feel a bit extreme getting the hang of the controls, which I tend to get mixed up (rotate left, rotate right, forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right).  Maybe reassigning the keys would make that more intuitive.You can make a ship very similar to Reassembly, something that handles very much the same way.  This means when the ship is upside-down on the screen, somehow the brain figures out how to reverse steering just like controlling a remote-controlled car.  Except in Reassembly fuel was infinite, and here fuel is finite, and so it requires great attention and planning.In the current state, beware that it's pre-alpha.  But also the flip side is don't miss out.  The experience is worth your time."

You will not get a container for ice so build a large ore container for it.To mine - install a beam structer infront with a mining laser right beside for precision mining and install a grabber on the beam structure to grab astroids.FIND THE ICE FIRST - start mining ice which will go into the large container and install a fuel generator. Install 2 huge fuel tanks for the hydrogen. Transfer the hydrogen to the huge fuel container and connect the oxygen node with the fuel container that once contained hydrogen. this should take care of the fuel as long as you have enough ice.then get solar panels, use them to charge the power storage to be used by the fuel generator and the mining laser.Install 2 - 4 booster rockets (first rocket in the build menu for propulsion) for evasive manuver to either quickly get out another astroid or station's way and to break the gravitational pull caused by planets or just for a speed boost. You can also add more RCS rockets for a increase in speed without spending oxygen for the bigger rockets.Thats pretty much what you need to start with.. weapons and other stuff comes later. Also you need lots of aluminum since that is a very commonly used material to build with."
76561198061321341,Recommended,330460,17769807,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,if it rains,"I had quite a bit of fun with this game and I expect to probably get about 10 hours out of play in its current state. That is however because I enjoy semi-realistic simulations, love orbital mechanics, have a taste for cience fiction, and am generally going through an indecisive phase in terms of entertainment.This game is far from finished but I am cautiously optimistic. I've been burned by titles like Starbound and Towns (early access before steam greenlight) in the past. Naturally I didn't expect much. This game however, is seeing regular updates. It's also changed a lot. Most of the guides are outdated and there seems to be quite a shift in how manufacturing mechanics work.Lets start with what you should expect from this game at the time of writing. There are lovely orbital physics, even thought they feel a bit clunky compared to KSP (which is this game's nearest comparison). The idea of having to collect lots of resources (12 at this time) is actually kind of cool, but again clunky.By clunky I mean the following. So orbital physics works, but as a vetran of KSP I know how imporant it is to know your prograde/retrograde vector (i.e the line that runs at a tangent to your orbit). This isn't difficult to code but is not in the game at all, all intercepts have to be done manually (you get no intercept vector) with lots of tedious course correction which would be fine if fuel wasn't such a massive concern. This leads to resources, to get fuel you need to mine ice, which can then be broken into oxygen and hydrogen by using a fuel maker. This gives you your propulsion, and you will need to carry huge quantities of this fuel to get anywhere significant. On top of these 3 resources you will need at least 1 cargo container for each of the 8 other elements which are commonly used to manufacture components. You'll find yourself frantically managing these containers because once a resource output has filled up the container it dumps it dumps it in another empty  one. This wouldn't be so bad if the same output wasn't also the input for when you want to use that resource to build things. What this leads to is a module being half built and you having to figure out what resource isn't properly connected to allow the build. This can legitimately take 2 to 5 minutes as it's like trying to untangle a pair of earphones. Resource connections being represented as lines that you have to trace to a point.So why do I like this game and why at 3 or so hours will I play it again? Simply, it's a great idea. A bit more casual that KSP in terms of gameplay and realism. It's also fun in different ways. The nearest comparison I can make is that if Celestial Command is to KSP what Terraria is to Minecraft. They're similar but enjoyably different. If you liked KSP but had a hankering to blow a few things up or just chill out and do some silly things like destroy a station with a mining laser, then give Celestial Command a go at some point in the future. If however you're bored of KSP and want a variation on the theme, you'll get about 3-5 hours out of this game.A final note is the game's language. I know the devs aren't native English speakers but it's just lazy. Get someone in to write tooltips for all the modules so they explain themselves properly. Otherwise it's really difficult to get into the game. Hell I'd write the tooltips for a copywriters fee. I want to see this game become a fully fledged product. I want to play it again after the major updates. So devs, if someone you know who speaks English is reading, make a few core tweaks to your resource management, orbital mechanics and your tooltips. It will make the game much more playable and much easier to recommend in it's current state. Also ditch the whole one element for each cargo container, it's just boring."

I wrote my first review back when CC was in pre-alpha, and now that it has just come into alpha it felt a good time to rewrite the review to reflect the changes in the game.The original review had me listing the problems with the game:Insufficient info and not enough tools to aid flying a shipA mess of a transfer systemNo info as to your centre of mass (later pointed out to me by the dev in his response)A lack of a real goal.So I had another go at the game. And I have to say that point 1 has been dealt with by a new RTS mode, that replaces the player actually flying their ship with the fact that your ship will fly itself. Great. Solves all the problems with point one. Except that the autopilot will kamikaze ram through anything it's path to rendevous with something. Once I had to stop it rammning the station I was docking with, another it succesfully rammed a station, destroying the only docking port on the ship and burning up all the fuel.RTS should not mean babysitting all your units so they don't trash everything. There are games where you do that, but they're not RTS's, they're more the kind of free app you get on your phone to pass the time.Number 2 has been dealt with quite well, as the new arcs coming out of the 2D into 3D space can make the mess you call a ship quite easy to understand, so no more gripes there.Number 3, as I already said, the dev responded to. However, the only reason I didn't find the button to view centre of mass (or anything else) was because the game doesn't have an official tutorial as to all of it's buttons.Number 4. Oh dear. So a sandbox game, like Celestial Command, there is no ""aim"" of the game. That I appreciate. I've logged more hours in Minecraft than is healthy and KSP has sucked a good portion of my time, as has Factorio, OpenTTD and Prison Architect. All of these games don't have a main objective, or it is completely tangential to the enjoyment of the game. CC does not have a main objective. And this is the point I failed to address previously, is it's sandbox fun? Will I have fun building something for hours on end, will I reach a point where I can be proud of what I've made? I hate to say it, but no.Building something is either incredibly hard in ""survival mode"" as the player has to mine all the resources, mine enough ice to make fuel to move to mine the resources and then spent time assembling their ship. I found the enjoyment dieing at the ""mining resources"" bit. In sandbox it feels just hollow that I can slap together a ship easily.So yes the developers have made some progress, but if I was given a refund of this game and asked would I buy it again, the answer would be no, as it's not something I can really enjoy. Maybe later, when the game itself is better, but for now I know of several other games in the ""Space Sandbox"" or ""Space RTS"" or ""Space Combat"" genres that do everything CC is trying but better."

It was much harsher but I toned it down a bit in deference to a PM from a Dev.It is nearly June.  Major issues with game play have not been addressed. Tthe Devs appear more intent upon adding content  than  fixing what is broken.  Added content will not make Celestial Command playable.Save your pennies.---(earlier comment follow)--This game had an interesting premise.  Build a space ship & mine the asteroids using simulate somewhat realistic orbital mechanics.  There was a solid single player game in the making.Celestial Command was progressing nicely & becoming a playable game.  Then a couple months the Devs decided to focus all of their attention on multiplayer.Now long standing serious bugs are not being addressed.   Content is no longer being added.  Prior content is left incomplete.If you  purchase CelCom based upon your expectations of the finished product, be willing put  up with some serious playability issues.If the bugs get stomped and this game comes together it should be worh the wait.@Artanni: I think that MP is more important to the devs than it is to the players."

I know it is an Early Access game and therefore no tutorial, but don't expect to be able to orbit, dock or anything straight off, unless you are well versed in orbital mechanics, and you can work  out what the keys do.I will continue to try to play for a while - and wait for updates which improve the game play - but this might be one game which despite havig paid for it, it still gets left on the shelf."

(Alternatively, you can try trading.)It is a complex game, but you will have trouble finding the information you need to play it because the developers think that wikis and other community resources spoil the game content and so they don't want you to have them.

We know it's early access alright? But when your basic tutorial is a mess a whole year after you release in EA, it probably tells us something about your planning.First of all, this is another one of those ""gather resources and survive"" type of games, as if we don't have enoug of those already.Second of all, this is has a HUGE learning cliff, and I'm not talking about the orbital mechanics, which alone would drive off most casual player. I'm talking about the most basic things, like how to even build your ship. To even start building, you need to follow these steps:1) ""right click the eingeering bay"" as the ""tutorial"" tells you1.1) click on every modue because you don't know which is the engineering bay, it's not like the game tells you, maybe when you hove over the part? nope, it doesn't. You just have to click every single module.1.2) find out that none of the modules brings out the engineering bay and start feeling frustrated.1.3) figure out that you need to put crew into your engineering bay, like yea why would I not do that? like isn't it basic game design that anything a player would do anyway, should be automatic?2) press c to bring up the crew panels3) drag a crew into the engineering bay4) now right click the engineering bay5) now you can build things6) find out that the things you build don't do anything because they need to be connected6.1) read that the ""tutorial"" says you need to connect the engines to whatever module6.2) find out that you don't know which part is the engine, because again, it doesn't stell you which part is what, at all.6.3) I see where they're going with this, realistic space ships would have engines like that, but do you really expect normal people to look for engines on the SIDE of a space ship? Wouldn't they loot at the back end? and fall on their face attempting that?6.4) even though you had to drag the crews for the crew panel, you can't drag the connection nodes, yea it sounds minor but subconsciously you expect consistency from a single game so you try to drag the connection nodes and get frustrated because it doesn't do anything.6.5) and it's not a simple left click either, nope that would be too straight forward. You see this time it's right click the nodes you want to connect.7) find out that the mining laser and the power generators they tell you build have no connectors, even though in the tutorial it tells you to connect them to whatever they have to be connected to.7.1) find out that in the ""guide"" section of this game's community page they just tell you to build the mining laser but don't tell you how to use it.7.2) find out that no matter what you do you can't make the modules do anything what so ever.8) refund this game and write a negative review."

The tutorial is stuck with a message ""you may pan the camera by holding the middle mouse button"". Thats nice but my MacBook Pro uses a track pad. I hold two fingers and move them to pan, which works fine, but the damned message wont go away or move the tutorial any further no matter how much I pan! Really? Is there a tutorial for the tutorial?Also the screen flickers between normal and all black frequently like an inconsistent strobe unless I diable the ""Glow effect"" graphics setting.When I selected the aerodynamic space mode, sandbox everything in view was wobbling around making it all very unpleasant to play and extremely difficult to maneuver or really do anything at all. Im pretty disappointed right off the bat. So I say specifically for newer MacBook Pro users that this game is not playable and should be avoided for now.
