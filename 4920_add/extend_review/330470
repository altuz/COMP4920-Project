76561197962563067,Recommended,330470,13935723,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Hayte,"More of a proof of concept than a game, this is a bare bones 3d platformer with a simple twist: you can create temporary platforms underneath you to stop you from falling. Left click drops a green platform and right click drops a blue platform. The green platform is a stepping stone. The blue platform is a springboard that launches you into the air.The levels are small but have a great deal of verticality to them. There are collectables to pick up along the way but the goal is to find and press a sequence of red buttons which will open a gateway to the next level. It plays and feels a bit like Portal sans portal gun mechanics.You can finish Over the Void in well under an hour, with most of that time spent looking down as you tend to fixate on the platforms you create rather than the brilliantly bizaare and colourful environments. You will regularly bump your head on ceilings and floating objects that you never see until they are below you.The game experience generally does not feel structured. The ability to launch yourself into the air with the click of a mouse button precludes the possibility of having platforming puzzles. You never wonder how you can climb your way through a level and your platforming ability is never tested because you can prevent a fall at any time. Whereas Portal felt like a 3d puzzle game, this does not.I adored the aesthetic and the music, despite the platforming mechanics affording you little time and space to appreciate your surroundings. Over the Void works well as a 10 minute distraction every now and then but don't expect anything as substantial as a game or you will be disappointed."

,Recommended,330470,13830345,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Maxmetpt,"ContextOver the Void is more of an atmospheric art piece than a game. You have several levels to explore, with a few game elements to guide you through them. You also have a somewhat free movement to complement it all.Overall, I don't think it succeeds as a game, but is certainly a very nice experience. If you want something to simply jump into and be immersed in, I think this is very good!You'll navigate a very expressionist world, with huge, abstract architecture, all backed up by a very nice and soothing electronic soundtrack. If this sounds good to you, give it a go!I've taken one hour in my first play-through, and about half of that on my second. It's short, but it's the type of platform that you can easily revisit just to relax and look around, if you're into that.PresentationThis is undoubtedly the most important aspect of the game. This is something you play for the audio-visual experience, and not for the challenge or the story. So, how exactly does it compell the player?Well, looking at the screenshots, you can have a very good idea of it. It looks amazing! It uses shape and color in a very unique way, and the scale makes you feel tiny, in a good way. Just moving around feels good, in this game.It's not without its faults, however. I have a relatively small complaint just regarding the visuals:Levels feel a bit inconsistentThe first few levels take a very simplistic stance, but one that makes each level feel very unique and gives off a completely different vibe. Later levels, however, feel a bit toofull, regarding both the colors, geometry, and particles effects. Those levels still look very good, don't get me wrong, but they're not quite as astonishing and the first ones.Regarding themusicandsound-effects, I have a similar perspective. First off, they fit the overall experience very well, and are certainly pleasant to the ear. I'm not into electronic music, for the most part, but I still enjoyed this a great deal. A very nice detail of how the sound ties with the visuals, is the way some of the objects and particle effects pulse with the music, as well as your jumps emit a fitting sound-effect. Neatly done, so far.I do have a problem with the sound design, however. While it may seem very minor, I think it makes a big impact on the experience, but is also easily fixed.Pausing in the musics breaks the flow of the gameBoth upon dying, and finishing a level, the music completely stops. In a game about immersing yourself in the levels it creates an unwelcome dissonance, in my opinion. When you die, the music of the level simply restarts. When finishing a level, the music stops, and a new song starts on the next nevel, which loads very fast, without a loading screen (a way of loading that would contribute to the immersion, if not for the music).There are as many games that fall into this as there are those who overcome this issue. FTL, the Bit Trip Series, Thomas Was Alone, and even Super Meat Boy are but examples of how to do it well. Making music flow continuously is fairly easy to do and does wonders to the game, in my opinion!Regardless of the issues that I point out, I think that the game is definitely worth playing for the presentation alone. It's not perfect, but I find it unique, and more games are certainly welcome to improve this style.General StructureNow, I'll look at Over the Void as a game. As I said, the you go through various level, all with the same objective: opening the void to progress to the next level. You do it by pressing buttons throughout the stages. There's no story or objectives for you to complete, necessarily, and each level is self-contained.You also have a counter on the top right of the screen, with x/50. This refers to several Orbs spread around the levels (in this case, not self-contained). They serve absolutely no purpose that I saw, aside from being yet another way of guiding you through the beautiful levels. I've also ended up with 51/50.As far as I can see, the game elements are very artificial, serving as a vehicle for the player to look at the environment. Take that as you will.Another issue (which isn't crucial, but would have benefitted the game if it had been done differently) is the lack of an ending altogether. I realize that there's no build-up to it, per se, but the last level simply leads to the credits screen without any kind of aknowledgement of the player's actions. I would have enjoyed something like what Antichamber did, even. Just a small animated section, some little detail aboutThe Void. There's nothing. It's fine, but the addition would make it more charming, in my opinion.Movement and General GameplayNow that you have an idea of what to do, here's how to do it.You can walk, jump (pretty high) and create 2 types of platforms: solid, and bouncy. These platforms disappear as you go away from them, or when you press K to destroy them all. Basically, you simply place these platforms in front, or under you, and you go everywhere you want. The game's gravity isn't too strong, giving the player more liberty.It also features more vertical gameplay than horizontal. About 95% of the time, you'll be moving through your own platforms, rather than using the game's structures.Aside from this, there are 2 hazards, so to speak. One, is air bubbles that push you up, slowly, and the other is downwards wind, to push you down strongly.It tries a bit too hard to be considered a gamePersonally, these 2 shouldn't be there at all. Yet another ""game element"" that doesn't seem to have been thought out from the beginning, but as a way of making Over the Void a ""game"". The biggest problem I have with it, is the way it tries to feel more like a game, but being rather unsuccessful. You die when you go off the limits of the level (sometimes too high, altough it's rare, as you're mostly confined), or going into the void (or water) below you. The air bubbles serve more as an aid, and are there to change up your movement feeling. The wind, is there to kill you, and increase the challenge. However, this challenge comes more as an annoyance, as it doesn't add to the overall experience. You'll simply have to use your platforms to go around it... Meh.How the level design could have gone hand in hand with the art...As I've said, the game elements feel forced. But there was a way of taking the strong point of games AND the twisted architecture and make it into one cohesive experience.This is a 3D platformer. And some parts of the levels work pretty well for you player to walk around and jump from one point to another (although not for anything significant - you can jump around a bit, but it never leads anywhere). But since you always have access to platforms, it's much easier to navigate that way. With more work and thought put into it, you could use the twisting architecture as platforms, and have the player work through it to reach a given button. There, it would be easier to integrate the hazards into the level design, and have it fit well. Some parts the player would float to reach higher places, while trying to avoid the strong winds.That would require a whole redesign of a game, which isn't to be expected, of course. Just brainstorming, here.Constantly looking down is also a downside to it. Exploration and Navigation are almost mutually exclusive.Aside from these, the games works well, for me most part. It has a few technical issues like getting stuck between platforms, some visual clipping, the game not responding after you Alt-Tab, and also a major lag issue in the second level (only).These are all easy to ignore, though, in favor of the beautiful environments! This review may seem too negative, but I enjoyed it a lot! Please, take it as constructive criticism. Try it!"
,Recommended,330470,13553603,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Cyril,"There were a few reviews saying that this is more of an art gallery of sorts than a game, and I disagree. The purpose of this being a game is to put you in this strange, foreign world, and having an objective keeps you are juuust long enough to appreciate the scenery without dragging things out too long. It's a very short experience, yes, and perhaps $5 for less than an hour of wandering may put people off, but I think it was worth experience, certainly. My only gripe is that having a failure state at all is a bit counter-productive, especially in the last area with one certain button that's kind of a pain ti get without dying... but ehh, I did enjoy this in the end, yes. I think it's a good length for the concept too, else it might start to drag given even a few more stages."

For QWERTY users, you can change ZQSD to WASD in the launcher, but not the game itself. This guarantees that most people will have to relaunch the game immediately after starting it for the first time. Sorry France, nobody else uses AZERTY.The mechanics are a little poorly explained, but hop around a bit and you'll figure it out. Left click to create a floating green platform to stand on (boring!) or right click to create a floating blue bounce pad and fly over the titular void (weeeeeeeeee). Platforms vanish a few seconds after being created if you're not standing on them, keeping the void uncluttered but allowing you to stand still when you want to. But why would you want to? Given how much fun bouncing is compared to standing still, I switched those controls around too, and I recommend it.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find glowy red things. Turn the glowy red circles green by rubbing up on them, and pick up the glowy red sprite clouds as some kind of completion collectible. Turn all the buttons green in a given area to open the gate to the next one. Simple, but kinda fun in a relaxing way.Overall, a nice little exploration/platformer game."

,Not Recommended,330470,20201715,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Peril,"This game has a very pretty landscape to look at and some pleasing music, but I was mostly looking down at my feet. Why, you may ask. That is because the landscapes are very wide-open and you have to place platforms under yourself in order to navigate. I feel that this aspect soils the whole experience since you are looking at a boring platform more than you are the scenery. There were also some strange design choices such as what looks like rain forcing you down with incredible force, leaving you unable to recover from barely scraping it. I must say, however, that having the player locate buttons in order to open the level exit is a clever idea for getting the player to actually look around the landscape. But as I said before, you're mostly looking at your feet.Overall, this game was not worth what I paid and could have been done much better."
,Not Recommended,330470,19294297,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Shawnecy,"Over The Void is a pretty game with nice music, however I feel it falls a bit short in some critical game categories. You're basically navigating a 3D envirionment from a first person perspective with little concept of your own bounding box, although that's rarely an issue. The platform spawning mechanic really doesn't seem to offer anything engaging in terms of gameplay; it seems to only exist to provide some kind of challenge to the audience to meet the minimal definition of a game. If it was replaced with 3D navigation flying controls, there'd be little left to the game (fly to each button, then fly to exit) which seems to highlight the fact the bulk of the experience here is really just looking around and listening. That'd be acceptable, but even the pretty graphics are limited to strict untextured polygon and partical effects. The detail, where it exists, is on a geometric level. Perhaps this is more engaging with a VR headset or while on mind-altering drugs, but it failed to capture and hold my interest. I'd be reluctant to recommend this game to anyone in its current state. 5/10."
,Recommended,330470,24817089,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Pogo,"Giving this a positive vote because there is no neutral option and I don't think it deserves a negative, despite its flaws.Gameplay-wise, the premise is fairly straightforward. Each zone has a number of red buttons and a locked exit door. Navigate yourself close enough to the red buttons to activate them (causing them to change color). Once the buttons have all been pressed, the door is unlocked and you can move to the next zone.Movement is fairly typical: 4 directions + jump (though for some reason the default keys are QZSD?? I had to exit the game to change them). Most of the zones have no floor and if you fall through the bottom you will respawn at the beginning of the stage. You have the ability to place temporary platforms in front of you (or whichever direction the camera is pointing). The standard platforms are green, but you can also place blue platforms which act as a trampoline. Cool idea, but the most efficient way to move around is to point your camera down and keep dropping trampolines directly under your feet until you get where you need to go.Based on the trailer and the game description, I was expecting something different. Parts of the trailer appear as though the player is flying freely, and the frequent mention of ""wandering"" suggested that there would be more open exploration. The reality is that each zone is a boxed-in area. If there are no visible walls, moving too far from the play area will count as a fall and you'll respawn. Each area is effectively a solid sculpture. You can climb on the solid forms you find throughout each zone, but they'll also get in your way as you try to bound around on your platforms.I experienced some problems during my playthrough, and I don't know if they're common. Occasionally I would hear the chirp of success when I reached a button, but when I turned to look directly at the button, I saw that it was still red. Pressing it again changed the color but didn't activate the sound. Additionally, in several levels, I found myself flung downward at great speed and barely caught myself from hitting the bottom. I'm not sure if this was the result of my bumping an object that I couldn't see or if there was a downward current in place with no visual cues (unlikely, since after catching myself I could generally ascend without difficulty). Either way, it was very frustrating.Ultimately, I think this game is trying to do 2 directly opposing things. It's very closed and linear but bills itself as a wandering experience. It features narrow platforming and falling death as a primary obstacle but wants to be ""relaxing"" exploration.I think it would be a good idea for the dev to explore these ideas separately. Make one game with fall danger, linear progression, and precision platforming. Make another game with massive expansive areas (not necessarily unobstructed), free exploration and high mobility. Thinking about stuff like Grow Home (especially in the late game), Antichamber, and Proteus for inspiration here."

You collect bits of... polygon fire(?) and you activate hidden buttons that open some sort of black-wormhole that takes you to the next area.Over The Void is like Kairo because they are both first-person exploration (walking sim(?)) games; they both strain your brain.Over The Void is like SickBrick (and a number of other games) because there are messages written on the walls/the environments.I made it through three levels and, when I got to the last button, the platform didn't place (or did but I was falling too fast to catch it) and I fell to my death. Reload, find I have to do all of that level again. I had to quit and sit for a minute:The draw of the game is definitely the ""universes"" you travel through. The only mechanics in the game are jumping and placing platforms. Some of the music is okay, some is barely tolerable (looping often). It's an indie game, so you know there's a ("")deeper meaning("") behind it all. It's cheap (I got it while 75% off). I had fun in my short time with it.EDIT: Except for one level, they get progressively more...awesome, th'only word I can think of - so, too, does the music become more and more suited to the areas. Each level has that bit of floating text (the name of the level) - I might just be too enthralled with it, but at times, with that music, them visuals seem to convey not so much a story but just projection of sentiments (the rainy level and ""get high,"" especially).MrNinjaSquirrel says ""It's interactivity that feels forced, shoved in as a means to give you some objective to take on beyond admiring the world around you and perhaps to attempt to hide the complete lack of any context or narrative for what exactly is going on.""I say this isn't necessarily wrong. What with there only being the most base of mechanics, dev could have either made the game more complex or just made an animation. For whatever reason, the game is as it is; I can dig it. If Over The Void was simply an animation, I doubt I'd be drawn to it. I can appreciate that the game is just ""JumpPlaceJumpPlaceJumpPlaceSTOPAdmire...DropPlaceCollectibleJumpPlaceAdmire...JumpPlaceJumpHit-ButtonJumpPlaceSTOPAdmire..."" because the visuals are that entertaining (...y-yeah). There are messages in the architecture and the architecture itself ("")tells a story("")(again, like Kairo); what sort of complex story-telling needs to accompany you while you're hopping about these impossible places? I think any sort of story(which has been hinted at in aforementioned placed quips)would probably just sour the experience; ""Oh, I'm literally jumping from black hole to black hole, collecting bits of my soul (polygon fire) that was dispersed because Sun God (IDK, the logo looks like that) was upset with me? Meh, that feels tacked on. I just enjoyed exploring...""Reverie says ""The biggest problem is that the platforms place in front of your view, not under your character.

You're also frequently trying to hit buttons you can't see because you have to be looking down to place platforms. The placement issue really wrecks the game, and it's a shame.""It seems that once you place a platform, any movement will cause it to disintegrate. You can, however, move the mouse to look around while on a platform. So yeah, this is a valid criticism in that the platform placement could have been designed to work differently. If they were placed directly underneath you, though, then the game would BE nothing but a walking simulator that had you going up and down stairs (as it were). As it is, you're jumping and climbing about an abstract world (lol so more immersive). Perhaps the game should have been more honest about what it is instead of apparently hiding behind the illusion of ""legit video game"" (i.e. puzzle platformer) because of the ("")shoddy("") platform-placement; again, I just find the play-areas alluring, *shrug*.I recommend this game but can see that it's not for everyone.EDIT: That people struggle to give this particular game leniency for sometimes iffy controls (in doing actions) makes me sad... That I enjoy the game as much as I do calls into question how reliable my assessment of it is."

It is a walking simulator. Which is fine. I love walking simulators. But if you're looking for anything more than ""get from point A to point B with nothing hindering you by the broken physics"", then this is not what you should be playing.The environments are cool. The method of traversal would be great if it wasn't so broken. Everything about the game is an utter disappointment.All of the levels are fairly open and the goal is to travel around collecting widgets and pressing buttons. You can place a platform you stand on with LMB and place a platform that boosts you up with RMB. Unfortunately, the platform physics sometimes fail and you'll either fall through a platform or get stuck in one of them (you can clear platforms and do it again, but it's annoying).The biggest problem is that the platforms place in front of your view, not under your character. This means that there are all of these gorgeous, expansive environments that you have to travel while staring at your feet. You're also frequently trying to hit buttons you can't see because you have to be looking down to place platforms. The placement issue really wrecks the game, and it's a shame.So while the environments in this game might be nice looking, if you want to see them, just watch a playthrough on YouTube. If you actually want a walking sim where the exploration feels good, there are way, way better alternatives. That said, the problems in this game are fixable (and probably not that hard to fix). If that happens, I would probably recommend this at sale prices.One other warning: If you are a Dvorak user, do not rebind WASD on to Dvorak mapping. The ""o"" button in the game is hard bound to release control of the mouse. This means that every time you move backwards, your ability to look or place platforms is lost until you press ""o"" again. Why such a function exists at all is beyond me."

Instead of relying on well performed jumps, you're able to place a platform below you to catch you fall. This allows for levels you've never seen the like of before, with some pretty colors.That being said, the game is far to easy. There's no limit to how many platforms you can place and one platform is basically a trampoline so you're just left rocketing off trying to get to the buttons as fast as you can, which isn't fast enough. They're most often very easy to find and get to, with just a matter of how long it takes to get there. There's also orbs to collect, but those too are often easy to find and get to.The real challenge in this game is the physics. You move around just fine (albeit a little slow) but the way you interact with the world is pretty bad. Often buttons will turn green only to turn red when you walk away. The buttons will sound like they've been pressed when they haven't been. The buttons will not make any sounds when they do get pressed. What looks like rain plummets you to your death.

Each level is unique and for $0.49 during the Winter 2016 Sale, I feel like I got a deal. I played right through, no stopping, and it took me about two hours. I still had time to stop and appreciate the environment as well.The game is just tragically short. Also, each level plays by a different set of game rules. So some action that will ""kill"" you in one level doesn't do it in another level. I also would have liked seamless transitions between levels and the game would have felt completely continuous. However, I could see how people would want to get to a stopping point."

The only reasons I wouldn't recommend this game is sometimes the buttons have weird hit detection but not to bad, and the heads level can be a little laggy trying to hit the buttons. Again, not bad, would recommend."

Instead of meditative, the music is annoying and repetitve, and alll you do is fight the game's horrible mechanics and scenario, so you don't fall in the abyss and have to look for the buttons that open the door to the next level all over again. Hell, I even got stuck on the ceiling and had to restart...So, to sum it up, listen to the negative reviews and don't waste your time with this game (even if it's free)!"

But be warned, the games does glitch at times, when your life depends on laying down that one platform it will leave you hanging high and dry. This happened to me 3-4 times shortly followed by mass clicking to save my sorry butt.As well be warned those that have vertigo or agoriphobia, this game will trigger those. I played through the majority of the game on the edge of my seat. A few level made me want to exit the game it was almost that bad. Otherwise this is a fascinating game of exploration and use of space."

,Not Recommended,330470,16157650,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,Double Uppercut,"I normally will complain about games when the shortness of the main campaign ends up being less than three hours. And yet, Over the Void's main levels (all orbs included! I even found the secret jellyfish on the last level) took me one minute short of an hour to complete. I wouldn't complain about this so heavily, but the game seems to be overcompensating... a lot. The designs, while pretty, tend to try to distract from the fact that there's very little going on. Find the buttons, find the orbs, go through the portal. It tries to push for this ""exploration"" idea, but the levels are so small there isn't really much to explore, nor not as much incentive- besides the orbs (which are laughably easy to find). Besides, most of the time you could've spent exploring was spent looking directly down, since that's the only way you can create platforms for yourself. I have a strange feeling the protagonist has a stiff neck, from looking down all the time. I will say, at the very least, it's fun to show a friend when you have nothing else to play- or something to waste a free 59 minutes on, if you've got a couple cents jingle in your Steam account wallet."
