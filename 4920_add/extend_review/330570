This is not a future review of what the game could be, it is a review of the game as it stands in Early Access.The good- The world and presentation was great. Art, sound, noises, all fantastic and add to the overall mood.- Multiplayer works, which is not always the case.  No clue if it was cross-platform as I am not even sure what other platforms are supported.- No tutorial. Dropped in to an unknown world not knowing how to do things makes things get real, real fast. Added to the horror aspect of the game.- Perspective. Sat nav view of me and the rotating map is something I have never seen done before.The bad- No tutorial. The other side of this beast, no clue I had filters or could access a map. Still not even sure what the filters were for.- Lack of variety in gameplay. The gameplay loop is run to an area, pickup something, shoot monsters/bugs. Rinse and repeat.- Long open areas between waypoints. There is nothing to do between waypoints execpt run away from monsters.- Noct monsters. There isn't a point to engage with them if they aren't attacking me or if they aren't surrounding a waypoint.The Ugly- Crashes. After two hours I had crashed the game three times. If I can't play your game I can't help you.- Controller support not listed on the Steam Store page. I honestly almost didn't by this twin stick shooter because it didn't list it on the store page. When I went into the controls I noticed it mentioned X360 controller mapping.- After about 30-45 minutes I had seen everything the game has had to offer. Plain in simple after two hours of repeating the same content 3 times, I have no drive to return to the game.Bottom line: It feels like it needs 6 more months of work in-oder for me to be able to sell it to a friend for multiplayer. There just isn't a enough meat on the bone at this stage for it to be fun and engaging gameplay."

Rich survival mechanics include instant death on contact with terrifying NPCs that can walk through objects, melee attacks by other players, and bullets - manage your entirely immobile food and health meters with food and health pickups which will often pop into existence on a timer in front of you, and drink liters of water to jog a few steps.The 'narrative' is a set of three or four long-distance walking objectives with brief, short-sentence dialog between the player and a radio voice consisting of mostly meaningless ""go here push button"" ""why?"" ""because I told you to"". If you don't mess around, it offers a scintillating 20~30 minutes of markers to walk to.In its current state,it's a nice proof of concept. It has a beautiful ambient soundtrack. It would make a nice deathmatch sandbox if it was smaller, and a great survival sandbox with some more content and some actual use for food and health. The spinning FLIR camera point of view is disorienting and fun.I hope they make a game on it some day."
,Not Recommended,330570,22029923,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,Narit,"NOTE: I do not recommend the game in its CURRENT FORM. It has a great deal of potential and could be a really cool, intersting unique game down the line.But as for right now, it's very barebones. There is less than 30 minutes of fairly generic post apoc story (took me 23 minutes), after which you are told ""There's no more objectives, just wander around and survive/find survivors). The map is a pretty good size, compounded on by a slow move speed. There are basic survival needs (food, water, etc) but all that they seem to do is allow you to sprint for a short time. Food was fairly common but water was not. Didn't really seem to mater either way, the 1 water resource I found replenished about 15 seconds of sprint and then I was thirsty again.The combat is pretty functional, standard twin stick shooter controls. Various weapons, grenades, a melee, etc. Not sure what the weapon variety did, due to the biggest issue I had. There wasn't really any reason to shoot. The day time is empty of enemies (I'm assuming other players will be the threat then, but there's no MP yet), and the night time is slightly more populated by monsters, but I never saw more than 1 or 2 per night. They were about as slow as the player is non-sprinting, plus they didn't just beeline for the player, they zigzaged and wandered, so  it was very easy to out run them. Night didn't even seem to last very long, maybe 1/4th the length of day. The only time I felt even slightly threatened was the scripted death right at the start. Even a part during the story where the guy on the comms says &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ get out of there now!"" I just walked out of the building without sprinting, and only saw an enemy on the edge of the flashlight that didnt even seem to be chasing me. The design of the monsters I saw were cool, ranging from giant spiders to smaller caterpiler looking things.TL;DR dont buy it, but keep tabs on it. Lots of potential."

,Not Recommended,330570,28665636,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Carnivore Angel,"God I wish there was a 'neutral' option.This game has always had incredibly strong visual and audio design - it is one of the most eerie and tense things I have ever touched.  My primary issue is that I don't like the new direction the game is taking.Back when Noct first launched into early access, 'XMIT' was a cold, detached, and manipulative voice on the radio, dangling the promise of weapons and medical supplies ahead of desperate survivors in exchange for their assistance in completing tasks toward some mysterious greater good.  The exchanges between XMIT and various survivors were, in my opinion, the highlight of the experience, accentuating the stark, cold brutality of a world falling apart, and the concept of XMIT never changing as they watch countless survivors die on their watch is one of my favourite ideas in gaming to date.Unfortunately, since the recent attempts to overhaul the game, everything I just described is gone.  There's no sense of permenance between deaths - you spawn, XMIT's bland, neutered dialogue plays, you forage until you die, there's a score screen, then the world resets and you start over.  I get that this reworked version is still in an extremely early state, and I'm willing to keep an open mind as it progresses, but I can't in good conscience give this game a positive vote given my favourite part has been cut.  I may change this review in the future as this new version is fleshed out, but I will always miss what's gone."
,Not Recommended,330570,22990859,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,SlySwine,"I enjoyed being scared out of my pants with monsters that literally pop out of nowhere. Aside from that, the the strategy necessary to survive is simpleton and bland. The playing field is closed-ended, and there is really nowhere to go. There's no direction or real goal other than hoarding resources (they regenerate randomly in the buildings after a few minutes, and monsters don't go in buildings), shooting down or avoiding monsters, or walking around the same-'ol island you cannot get off. There are usually no servers to play with others when I'm on, but even when there are others to play with, where do I go?Oh yeah, med-kits are basically worthless because all the monsters appear to kill you instantly.A few suggestions:*Stop all the one-hit kills. Add a health counter that affects the survivor negatively the lower the health is. This also makes med-kits useful.*Add a leveling system, a profession system, or a skill tree that allows you customize your character and play. I appreciate the rogue-like aspect of starting from scratch, and skills could be randomized and only under control of the player after spawning, not before, to force players to adapt.*Scavenging. This is a SURVIVAL-horror game, and many times the resource regeneration does not give you food or water that you need to run. This is not ""Do Not Starve"", but the only ""surviving"" is hiding in buildings and running away.*Balance the monster encounters and resources so that there is more action. Yes, suspense is best served when there is time between encounters, but too much time between encounters means it is boring. Why aren't there monsters in the forests, only in cities?*Add AI survivors or NPCs where you can trade inventory for items you need.*Give me more information about what I am holding. How many grenades do I really have? How many bullets can my mag hold? How many mags do I have? How long can I run? How much water do I have? How thirsty am I? How do I know one rifle is better than another? These do not have to be your standard dials, but give me more than ""OK"" or ""LOW'.*Finally, a journal, scraps of paper, or some other way to gather information on monsters, locations, equipment, skills, story line, history of the ancient evil, etc.Sorry, I cannot recommend this quite yet. I will probably put it on the shelf and pick it back up when there is another update, or until the final release comes out."

,Recommended,330570,21050235,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Dr. Rockso M.D.,"Reminds me heavily of Teleglitch, only b&w infrared. Interesting spin.(Thought this might have been the same devs as Teleglitch, as the resemblance is uncanny.)Looks like it plays, and it currently plays decent - they've incorporated an interesting 'continued-replay' as the core design, so maybe they continue to add in features that compliment and add more depth to the game, (hopefully not just lazily stop at the clever replayability mechanic of the game).Wonder what features the devs might add before release to really make this game a hit.(Still in Early Access, so looking forward to what this promising title will have to offer.)"
,Recommended,330570,23796902,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,Sparwulf,"If there's one thing I've learned about game devs, is that they can come in many shapes and forms. Especially with these E.A. titles, some devs are decent, coughing up an update every now and then without any feedback or news for their game's community. Some devs are flat out crooks that started out decent but are now just in it for the money. <Cough> H1Z1 <cough>.Here is a dev that is HONEST. I became a backer for Noct's kickstarter campaign way back when. True, it felt gimmicky and was just selling the concept, not a real game. And because of that, I got very skeptical especially five months after the game was released and still no major updates.But c3sk has won me back with his latest update. It reminded me that game devs are human beings too. c3sk has a job, he spends only his nighttime off hours working HARD on making Noct something great.And not to mention, when you comment or make a post in the community hub that refers to c3sk, c3sk ACTUALLY responds. And in world record time! This is a dev who cares; about making this game, about the people who play it, and thinking of what it could be in the future.This isn't so much a review as it is my perspective on c3sk, the man behind Noct. You won't get a more interactive dev with any other game.This is a dev I stand by. I don't care if it takes six more months before another major update. Granted I'll be playing other things. But with a dev like c3sk, I know that some day I will check back on Noct to find out the next drastic change or two. And it'll just get me even more excited for the full release of Noct."
,Recommended,330570,21496695,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,The one true Potatoe,"NOCT is by far one of my new indie favourites. Why? Because never have I seen a game with this special style of gameplay.Lets dwelve into itEARLY ACCESS REVIEWPlayability/Core game - 5/10So sincethis is an early access game, bugs are bound to happen. However, so far I havent seen any, given my low playtime. The game is meant to be played online, and sadly, there seem no current servers open, so you are left with aproximatly 30 minutes of generic story, which i'll get to in a minute. The controls are easy to master, and the mouse feels acurate. The visuals does not blend into each other, and its easy to see where you go.Graphics - 7/10So you are looking down on your playable character from orbit, via an infared camera. Everything is black and white, and it helps add a sense of suspense in the game. The amount of pixels are not incredibly high, but it is easily overlooked, since you consentrate less on visuals, and more on the sound.Combat - 6/10As you progress in the story, you are constantly attacked by Nocturnals (And players) and you have a decent set of weapons to obtain, including you SMG's, riffles, pistols, and grenades. Each type has about two or three different weapons, but besides the pistol and grenade, you feel like their strength is somewhat the same, with riffles having slightly more range and damage, though this could save you life. Did I mention the enemies are terrifying and will kill you in one hit? Well they are, and can. Dont try clubber them with your bat. Trust me on this.Mechanics - 7/10You have a set of very basic needs. Water, food, and health. These can be replenished by optaining items hidden in houses, but this poses a greater threat than you might imagine. First of all, you cannot see inside a house till you are inside, so be careul of ambushes, but you cannot look out while inside. This has caused a lot of death to me as i managed to find something nice, and instantly get killed by a Nocturnal in the doorframe. Good scary moments.The game features a text based chat, with the text howering above your head, so only people who can see you, can ""hear"" you. There is NO voice chat, and I hope it stays this way, since you get paranoid with people.Scares - 4/10This might just be my opinion, but the scares are minimum in the game. I discussed the house moments a line ago, but thats as close to scares as you get. You do however feel slightly scared of running into the Nocturnals, as you have a very limited supply of ammunition, and it takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bullets to take one of the big guys down. But again this might just be my opinion.Story - 3/10As stated, so far there is only 30 minutes of singleplayer campain, but thats perfectly fine, though i still score it low. Its one of your generic ""Fetch"" quests where you are tasked to go to one end of the map, to get an item to the other-other end of the map, and so on. The developer has spread out a nice amount of things to make it not so repetetive, and it helps a bit, but not a lot. Again, this is supposed to be multiplayer, not singleplayer.Sound - 8/10NOCT does a lot right on this point, and for good reason. It has very little music, and that is good! You feel like you are helping an actual person around, and seeing it via Infared. The ambience is low and humming, but you can still hear cracks, gunshots (drumbeats) scittering and so on. Not a lot more can be said, but it works REALLY well.The final score - 8/10Overall NOCT is a good game, and despite it being early access, and to my knowledge only has one Dev, its well made, is special, and needs more love. Play it is my advice, since it has such a low cost. And most importantly, get friends along, and start your own little server, and see if your trust in each other is big enough."

I guess quests didn't completed yet. You don't have to complete the objects. It ends after 3,4 missions, and after that, your job is just 'survive'.Multiplay, I threatened my friend to buy this so we can play this together, it seems each player start in random places, so you just have to wish that you can find another survivor. Well we did meet since that overwatch guy gave him a same mission.There's really few things you can do in this game. yet.

There are few games that deliver this amount of atmosphere and just pure suspensewith so little tools. Everything in this game makes it probably one of the best survival horror games to be released this year.Sure right now we only have a tiny sliver of the actual game and you can beat it in probably under a hour depending on how you play, it still gives us already a great idea of what the game might become once it gets its full release in January.Though where I think this game really will shine is when you play this game with some friends kinda like Left 4 Dead or Nazi Zombies from CoD. Its one of those games that could make for a very fun friday night with some friends.+ Atmosphere+ Soundtrack+ Multiplayer+ Unique take on 2DThe BadSure this game has some good things but there are surely also some bad things right?Yes and no, most of the problems I had so far with this game are already being addressed by the developers.I had frequent and irregular crashes, but when checking the forum over here on steam i saw that the devs areactively trying to tackle all these issues already, which shows this just isn't one of those release without any progress after they get your money.So far the story is a bit too short for my liking, I played it below in my video for the first time in about 30 minutes, I know its still in early access and that the game will get more content down the line but still its pretty annoying to be playing the game and to hit a point where there is just without any heads up no content anymore. Again this is something I'm sure will get fixed.Also another thing that really annoyed me was how there was no real tutorial, a lot of things you will need to find yourself. like the controller support. It never said i could use my controller until i saw the settings for it in the settings menu.- Crashes- Short story mode- No tutorialEnd VerdictSo far I would give this game a 6-7/10 which will probably rise up in the future with more content being added, because that's where the game really slacks right now, the multiplayer is just not enough to keep someone busy for more then a hour, two at most.Bellow is a video with my first experience of the game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0njPorbJM8"

You can't see the monsters, but they can see you. You are weak, they are strong. This game takes away the generic survival feel where if you're good, you will survive. That's not the case inNOCT. You need to work together to survive, but sometimes that isn't enough. Sometimes you just have to run to survive.MultiplayerAs I said earilier, this isn't really a thing right now since you can't host dedicated servers, but you can host temporary servers while you play multiplayer, or join a temporary server.

76561197961259997,Recommended,330570,21964824,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,Beast Machine,"There is a solid foundation for a cool little game here, but I can't recommend it in its current state.You begin as a random survivor in a dark, apocalyptic world, who stumbles accross a GPS/communications device. The survivor is contacted by a stranger known only by his communication code, ""XMIT"". XMIT gives you a series of objectives, making vague statements about saving humanity. If your current survivor dies, XMIT contacts a new survivor, failing to mention that his instructions may have led directly to the previous guy's death. Who is this stranger? Can he be trusted? Does he really want to save humanity?This early tutorial section, which poses these questions and draws the player into the game world, is awesome. Unfortunately it is also over way too soon. The game pretty much ends here.After completing XMIT's objectives, you're told to keep yourself alive. and find more survivors. Survival gameplay consists mostly of checking buildings for different weapons and more ammunition. You can also find meds/food/water, but missing these items only seems to result in minor inconvenience rather than outright death. Lacking water means you can't sprint, and lacking food results in slower movement speed overall (I think). Moving slower doesn't massively impact your ability to fend off the creatures, so ammunition is your biggest limitation, but during my playtime I never managed to run out of it.There's a solid variety of firearms which are split into three categories: Pistols, Rifles, and SMGs. Ammunition packs are unrealistically split into these vague categories. So your AK47 takes the same ammo as all the various Colt firearms you can find. There may be differences in damage each firearm is capable of dishing out, but if there is, it's not obvious. I found myself using whatever weapon I had the most ammunition for at any given time, and no matter what I had managed to scrounge up, it was always powerful enough to deal with the threats I encountered.Over the course of my admittedly pretty short playtime (just under an hour as of this writing), I was only attacked by four different types of enemies, two of which could be killed in one hit via melee. I discovered no NPC survivors.Pretty soon I found myself wondering where the sense of danger was, what I was supposed to do exactly. This game is, after all, billed as survival horror. But survival is a non-issue and the game world seems to hold nothing of interest by itself.Which leads me to my next point. The game is obviously supposed to be played online (the description page on Steam flat out says as much). But like most indie games with an online component, the player-base is non-existent, and expecting that to change, ever, would be unrealistic. So for the most part we are stuck with whatever content single player has to offer.I could write most of these gripes off as a byproduct of the game still being in Early Access, but the developer has also made the statement, ""most of the content already integrated into the game"". I hope this is just referring most very basic gameplay elements, because that's really all we've got currently, and it isn't enough to carry Noct right now at its asking price of $10 or even half that if you catch it on sale.Pros:+Atmosphere.+Simple, but incredibly effective audio design.+Amazing soundtrack.+Lots of potential. I'd love to see the gameplay expanded with random missions from XMIT, which can be accepted or ignored with varying consequences.Cons:-ALMOST NO GAMEPLAY CONTENT (as of 3/21/2016, anyway)Bottom Line:Ultimately, there just isn't enough content in Noct at the time of this writing for it to deserve a full recommendation. With that said, it still merits a very weak thumbs up as there is a lot of potential here and I hope this project doesn't get abandoned. Also the soundtrack is already completed, and it's pretty phenomenal.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZodtpxHeL5c"

The controls are simple and responsive, the creatures are spooky on the occasions when they appear, and all around it feels nice to play. The major drawback at present is that there isn't much _play._ There's very little to do, and only a bit more to see.

My english is not that well.This game has undescribable potential to be a very good survival game, and not only that, but one that I have been looking for.With my short time played, I can judge it from what I seen.The devs say it is a ""2D top-down multiplayer survival horror game that blends arcade combat with RPG survival elements""Well the aracd-ic combat is true. And the RPG type elements are something they should have, but on the DL.What I mean is, the game should be ruthless. It should not tell you the exp you get every kill you get, and if it was true to the RPG title they have, then it should be worth toward useful skills, such as use less water or-I read what the devs are doing with the new inventory system and I can say thats exactly what this game needs. Base building is already close to being very good as well.Apart from the average bunker in the ground, I want items.Maybe put a chest to store the things I have in my new inventory. Or maybe saving a gun for my friend? or storing rations? Who knows. With this inventory update, the devs should bring back the food and water metre they had earlier. And keep the stamina bar. Sprinting should not be ""drain water"" or whatever they have. It should merely be a thing to drain from occasionally and not have it constantly drain. I truly wanted this game to go more into what they called a "" Muliplayer, survival horror game"" I really really want to see stress on the survival aspect and not just an arcade type of survival.  This game has the potential to be that.Next I think that the countdown to the ""death of all humans time"" should not be every 5 minutes. If resurce scavenging is a thing, and if ever base building would be a thing, I can only imagine it not to be enough time to feed yourself and your bases needs. I want it to be more like you have a base to return to. I feel the count down should be with IN GAME DAYS. Which should absolutly be a thing. Most of my crits of this game is just ideas Im thinking up as I type. I say let there be a day and night system and every so often days, an entire day of swarm where you can choose weither or not to go out or not. And with day and night, Beds come, skip the night. There is so much potential to NOT be an arcadic survival game as it is. And I highly dissagree with it acting like one.Simply put, I want it to be a "" 'REALISTiC' 2D top-down multiplayer survival horror game that DOESN'T blends arcade combat with RPG survival elements."" I want to see a real type survival game. I want to find my melee weapon, and not have it given to me. I want to find my guns and I want to craft. And this game. Is so close to being that game.With the combat system, I dont find it arcadic, apart from the melee. The guns do as guns do and technicanlly so does the bat or stick or whatever.ButAvfall ingen tid. Let the devs do what they envisioned with the game. But thats my two cents.Overall. Very great game. Even now. And I have gotten many of my friends to purchase and play with me. Not much, but still. A purchase is a purchase. No?This is a good gameBut it's potential to be better. Even Greater."

Devolver is proving that they're willing to put money into polishing/delivering concepts that are stylish and enjoyable.The atmosphere in this game is awesome, very dark and involved. Personally I dig the overhead, infrared camera style of gameplay, but it won't be for everyone. The music in this game is contemplative, moody, dark, and thoughtful...not unlike Boards of Canada's more minimalistic stuff.Gameplay is tight in terms of movement, but I must say that in terms of aiming the controls are a bit sensitive. Please bear in mind though that I'm using a mouse and keyboard, and turning down the DPI did help somewhat. While the combat is fairly intuitive, there will be some cheap deaths experienced immediately after leaving a building.It is important to note though that cheap deaths these days are often just a sign that we're all being spoiled by games that are way too easy.

Reminds me a little of project zomboid in that sources are limited and in how the players view is limited to where he/she is facing. It has a interesting art style but is overly taxing on old low end hardware even at 720p (i3/AMD6400HD). It doesn't look like it should be either, but effects are no doubt the offender. If you own a old PC beware of this, everyone else its a non issue. Still it looks like it should run on a potato.Good+ Interesting single/multiplayer survival horror+ Good sense of danger+ Interesting monsters+ Still under developmentBad- Little player base- £6.99- Basic idea nailed down well but 30 mins of gameplay and you've seen it all.Recommend IF on sale, and or more meat is added to them bones."

,Not Recommended,330570,21481387,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Dewgong,"This is a negative review, so most likely you'll be hitting not recommended simply because the sheer idea of someone finding issues in a game tickles your butt hole, this is a review on the current state of the game and will be updated.There's not much to say, the game world is empty so far, theres nothing but blocky houses full of nothing and pickups inside. The enemies are not threatening at all once you learn how to deal with them. Oh, and don't forget the atrocious pvp.It's also not scary, not remotely so, the reviews really misled me into thinking this game was frightening, but this ended up being not at all scary and more a just boring walking simulator. Unless you're scared by seeing the same three or four generic monsters slide along at you over and over, you're not going to get scared.And it really isn't hard, where did that implication come from? The monsters are easily killed with a single magazine of a rifle, and ammo is abundant, like in every house there is a gun and all the supplies you can hold. After about five minutes of gameplay, I couldn't die unless the game bugged. And that's only because I figured out the controls by that point.Don't bother playing online, I set up a server and it filled with 12 year olds DM-ing in a specific town, the monsters are not a threat at all but players just shoot on sight, and melee is instant death so the best strategy is to just run at them and mash your attack. I see zero reasons to play this online, co-op is pointless and any server with random people just becomes a bad case of shoot-on-sight. That problem has killed plenty of open-world multiplayer survival games, there's no interaction between players, it just becomes a boring run of finding people named ""Player"" or random numbers and watching them shoot at you the second you come into vision. It's not fun and honestly just makes the multiplayer feel like a bad alternative to single player, but there's not much to do regardless.The monsters are intimidating at first, but quickly become boring to come across, any threat is instantly nulled by a giant acknowledgement by your character that an enemy is nearby, and even then as long as you keep your distance it's hard to die, except when enemies spawn on top of you, this happened several times. I even returned to the site of my death to see if they could have come from anywhere, but unless enemies can fall from the sky they managed to simply spawn on top of me, killing me instantly with no time to react, I barely processed what happened, keep in mind this happened twice and it was outdoors, so I didn't just get jumped.There is barely an aspect of survival, everything is easy unless you run into a player, monsters will only kill you if you ignore the warning signs and let them phase through, err, ""break"" through the wall to kill you. You can kill pretty much everything with how abundant ammo is, I never once had to resort to melee on smaller enemies. Enemies just kill you in one hit, blanking the screen out, which is, not very interesting but not bad I guess. The prospect of fear in this game was lost pretty quickly, as enemies became nothing more than small deterrents that were easily removed, and running into players just ended up with me trying to avoid them. So multiplayer just turns the game into a mediocre pvp freeforall with occasional monsters.There really needs to be more content, even if this is an early access title, I've learned from experience that doesn't always mean it's going to get better. In it's current state, it's a rather empty singleplayer, or if you so choose, a topdown Rust, with all the PK intact.I'd like to see enemies be more threatening, the world be more populated and with reasons to survive, and have multiplayer improved, as right now it's abysmal to do anything online. Honestly the pvp adds nothing but nuisance."

The graphics and mood are really well done, but you also find your character bumping into invisible walls and boundaries at times, and the scratchiness of the overall look can make it tough to realize you're not actually moving anywhere for a second or two. Biggest problem is with combat though. the monsters are all giant, all invisible until they're within an inch or two of you, and all kill you instantly and permanently if they even lightly brush up against you. Right now I have a room full of like 7 corpses, all the weapons, a quest item, and one big monster. I re-spawn, go back to get the guns and quest items, and am instantly killed by the giant monster. How many shots would I have to get off to take it down? Have I even shot it yet? Have I even fired at it? the game's not entirely clear about any of that.It's the first monster I've encountered. There don't appear to be any smaller ones, or way to test out how the gun works, if it works at all. There's a lot of uncertainty, like being partially blind and deaf, and absolutely zero learning curve.I've gone back at it for a half hour or so now because the atmosphere is so well done, but to be honest, I'm not an unintelligent person or an inexperienced gamer, but I have absolutely no idea if I'm making any progress or not, and that's a pretty serious design problem.
