Not that ""Depth"" is bad, it's a good game.  But this...this is a truly nerve-wracking nightmare of marauding sharks.It proceeds at much more realistic speeds than ""Depth"", and also looks better.  The feeling of actually diving is much more realistic as well.  The game is rock stable and highly immersive even in Early Access; from the rhythmic sound of your regulator as you breathe to the gorgeous underwater scenery, to the outstanding modeling and animation of the sharks.There are plenty of maps, and a number of different game options including a single player mode.  Multiplayer is up and running.One of the best bargains on Steam.  Highly recommended.   Grab it now because once people start discovering this title, the price will likely go up.  This is going to be very popular, and it desrves to be.Lighthouse Games has truly produced an underwater masterpiece."

So the ""feature"" works. I think that this ""feature"" is Steam API abuse, social engineering, false advertising and, ultimately, a scam. This reminds me of spam bots that try and make you click a link. Other indie developers on Steam struggle to promote their games, but none of them uses such ""features"", at least to my knowing. They try and get reviews from some indie magazines, YouTubers etc, but they don't lure new players with social engineering.

There was an old Russian sub, and it gave me the willies.As I swam, I saw shapes in the darkness. Big ones. I start to panic.Rocks. They were rocks.One thing they don't teach you in training: it's quiet down there. You see, they train us all at once, so we get used to the noise.But it's quiet. So quiet, you can hear your heartbeat. And your thoughts echo in your head. But you can't speak; you've got scuba gear on, and furthermore, if you speak, you know that THEY will hear you.Then I saw moving shapes. No, scratch that; I HEARD them way before I saw them. When everything is still, the tinest movement is audible.They were indistinct, far away. I didn't dare move; I just watched.Manta Rays. Two kind old Mantas, out for a swim. I relaxed.And then I felt something pass me.It was monstrous. Its skin was black and scarred with harpoon-marks and shark-tooth scars. Its shadow blocked out the distant, indistinct, iridescent sun.A shark.I raised my harpoon gun confidently, despite my terror; this thing was HUGE, but that meant it was a big target.I dodged it, effortlessly; it was big, lethargic, and not-too-aggressive. I killed it.Something darted between my legs. I could feel my heartbeat begin to race; like an infernal pump in my ears. Thump thump, thump thump, thump thump.It bit me. I blinked and reeled from the pain, spinning to see what had attacked me.It was a Mako.And it wasn't alone.I began to swim up. That's when I learned it.I'm afraid of heights. I'm afraid of submarines. I'm afraid of big, indistinct shapes in the distance of that savage, silent deep.And I'm afraid of sharks.I neared the surface and saw the magnitude of my predicament; Six Makos and a Tiger shark had followed me, circling gleefully. They could taste my blood.I screamed. I begged the sky for help.But the sky has no reach in the Deep. That's Death's dominion."

They just lurk in the shadows waiting for the right moment to strike. Stopping the sharks from getting too close is only half the challenge, you also have to watch out for everyone else on the map because it's deathmatch which means every man for himself. And if that wasn't hard enough you have to watch your oxygen supply because when it gets low you have to go and find the oxygen supply and there's only one in the map.The graphics are not the best and some of the sharks look a bit off but overall this is a good cheap game that just hasn't been realised yet I hope it gets popular eventually!"

Though 'Stranded deep' and 'Depth' have tried to recreate the AI of sharks, this game by far gives the most realistic depiction of shark behaviour in a video game. The Great White (one of a number of shark species) will bump, bite or tear you to pieces. The beauty is the sharks have random attack patterns. Thus you could be swimming alongside one and it won't bother you until you aggravate it. However at other times the shark will straight out attack you. The attention to detail is impressive and the audio design really makes you feel as though you are about o be guzzled by a man-eater. There are currently 4 maps, which even include a submerged New York metropolis with prowling Great White sharks. If your interested in underwater games and wish to battle it out online with fellow divers or shark AI (players will be able to assume the identity of a shark soon) then this game is for you. As it stands in its Beta format I'd give this game a 9.2 as it brings a refreshing level of realism to animal AI and the combat is very well done. You will die a lot, but a global ranking system is in place to keep you coming back into the abyss where nature's apex predator awaits you."

This is a multiplayer focused game and it's tumbleweeds everywhere, 100% barren, no-one is playing it, you can spend countless, fruitless minutes waiting for someone to join you in a game with no luck. And the single player portion is a joke and a bad one at that, as of right now it's just the survival mode which is just wave after wave of 2 or 3 not-so-smart sharks roaming around and that's it, really, nothing more than a badly disguised training mode. There are no bots, no other divers to shoot or compete with and no other modes, so it gets tiring and boring super fast. The few maps there are somewhat decent in the graphics department, especially the interesting Tsunami one featuring a flooded piece of Manhattan, but since the action is nowhere to be found you just explore them in a few mins and then you've seen everything there is to the game. The rest of the maps are pretty empty and small except for usually two big objects like say a sunken boat and a WWII bomber or some anti-ship mines floating around, not much to get excited about.If you're looking for some underwater action, get Depth instead or wait for a full release of this game before trying it out, till then... don't even bother. The most worrying thing with this title is that the description in the Steam page says it's BETA when there's not much content to begin with, it is playable for the little it has and I didn't encounter any issues while I played like some have complained but gameplay wise, again, there's just almost nothing to enjoy and what little there is it'll have to be by yourself, not anyone's idea of fun."

The Deathmatch part of it is basically non existant playerbase wise unless you can round up some buddies to play with, although the survival gamemode more than makes up for the value of the game. Thier is just something very satisfying about killing sharks with a harpoon. The maps are quite small with only 2 different sharks on each map. Their are leaderboards in which you can compete with your friends or see how you rank globally. It is not about how many waves you can kill rather than how many sharks you can take down as the game has a point system with the multiplayer going up as time goes on and the match ends when you either die or survive the full 10 mins. Survival is playable with friends and can be a lot of fun especially for the $5 the game costs, which is the main reason I will recommend it as I believe you get enough value and quality for your money.Game Showcase-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZw5BPaxiM"

Beautiful environments and the sharks look great. That being said...there's really nothing to do. I've only located two weapons at this point to utilize. There's no map, or anyway to differentiate where you really are in the environment. You swim to far in a single direction and it directs you back to the action....But what action is there? It's difficult to locate your opponents and the sharks do nothing but swim about lazily even when you attack them. Overall it's pretty much a pointless game at this point. Has a lot of potential if they add to it. But right now I could not possibly recommend it to anyone even with the $5 price point."

,Not Recommended,330580,30684862,Posted: 23 March,all,Strange,"As it stands, Shark Attack Deathmatch 2 doesn’t quite cut the mustard when you compare it to Depth. There are various problems that plague this game in its current state, which include a distinct lack of gameplay modes, very few players on the servers, and a fairly basic and unimaginative execution of the underwater first-person shooter genre.The main issue was that having played Depth – a game of almost unimaginable tension that is created and maintained with a clever combination of high-quality sound effects, intelligent map design, and graphics that truly reflect the claustrophobic nature of the murky depths of the ocean floor – this game struggles to compete against it. Though the underwater graphics look great, the scenery itself is rather bland and the environments too well-lit to create any sense of mystery or instil the fear of the unknown in the way that Depth manages with ease. It may be worth waiting for the game’s full roster of features to become available, but its lack of maps, game modes, players, tension, and distinguishing features make this one of the lower-intensity shark attack games here that are on the market right now."

When you die, you lose points, when you get kills, you gain points. If you are playing deathmatch, those points allow you to rank up. If you are playing survival (which can also be co-op), you can use it to try to beat your high score.Different sharks are worth different points because some take more hits and/or bite harder. On online deathmatch, the focus is killing each other for points, along with sharks coming to kill you. However, you can toggle sharks on or off in deathmatch. Deathmatch lobbies allow 2-8 players.The gameplay and graphics are beautiful, but it will has one fatal flaw. Almost no one plays it.There are never any available online games. You have to host them yourself, and if you are lucky, another player joins. This really deteriorates from the idea that this is supposed to be a competitive FPS against other players.In all, I enjoy this game.

I have 24 cores, well really what I have is 24 threads spread over 12 real cores of which those 12 real cores are split to two separate physical processor dies of 6 cores each.I run a dual processor XEON workstation.In order to get this game and subnautica to play correctly i have to go into task manager details and set core affinity for this games .exe file. I set it to the first 4 cores. It works about the same with 3 cores but not with 2 cores. So there you have it.It's odd that all my other games run fine but the 2 water games I play need to be told to only use 3 or 4 cores. I have even split the 4 cores in between the 2 different physical cpu's to each run 2 cores for the game and surprisingly ran just as good as when the 4 cores were on the same die.That was striking as you'd expect a difference when the data does not have to travel so far in between physical dies.I am one of the 0.01% who game on a xeon so i guess it's whatever.

76561198247618924,Recommended,330580,30473467,Posted: 12 March,all,KaijuGroupy,"I haven't really written a review before, but I hope this helps the developers or at least anyone who might be interested in purchasing this game. I remember playing a little of the original game back on the Xbox 360 as an Xbox Live Indie Game. I remember it being one of the better looking Xbox Indie games, but I also remember gameplay being just alright overall. I really liked the concept of an FPS where you fight sharks in some manner and then Depth came out. I recently started playing that as well and in short I'm really satisfied with it. It's probably the best shark game we'll ever get or at least from a multiplayer standpoint. That being said what do I think of this sequel now that Depth is already established you may ask. Well to be honest for $3 I really enjoyed it. No I don't think it's nearly as good as Depth, but it doesn't need to be. However if it does turn out to be better than Depth or just as good later on then I would be more than happy to praise this game and recommend it to whomever I can.VISUALS: Right now, I believe the developers have created a very stable foundation to build upon. Visually the game looks very appealing. Definitely a vast improvement over the first game. Perhaps it may not have the best graphics, but many of the animals' character models are in a way realistically  animated and rendered nicely. The divers not so much. The controls are smooth. Many of the physics like shooting a speargun or swimming as a shark feel quite natural and easy to get used to.THE MULTIPLAYER: The main DEATHMATCH MODE is fun for a little while. It is basically divers vs divers with some npc sharks thrown in to attack the players as they kill each other. I do like how you can get points by killing sharks, but you get more points by killing players. However I hope you'll be able to kill more animals than just sharks in future updates, but only lethal animals should give the players points if they kill them.For me the best mode is the PREDATOR MODE which is very similar to Megalodon Hunt in Depth. First divers start the match by killing each other. The first diver to kill someone gets to become a Great White Shark until another player kills them and then they become the shark. Depth definitely has the better shark gameplay, but this game does cleverly separate it's gameplay style by having a first person view from within the shark's mouth instead of it being third person like it is in Depth. This is very similar to playing as an Alien in the AVP games. A very cool concept which also limits the player's vision as the shark. This is a good thing however. In my opinion the shark is overpowered enough as it is already. It's able to kill a player with just 2 heavy bite attacks. Don't get me wrong, the shark should be overpowered. The problem I have is the shark is like a giant bullet sponge or spear sponge in this case. It takes a lot of hits to kill the shark and by the time you kill it you've probably died like 14 times. To fix this, divers should start off with the chaingun instead of the speargun. Then replace all the chaingun pickups on the map with more ammo or flash grenades. This way divers will only die 4 or 5 times and have the chance to go on a man eating rampage themselves before the match ends. Often times one decent shark player will be the shark the whole match with an overwhelming victory. I mean it's easier to kill a player as a giant 40ft Megalodon in Depth than it is to kill a player as a 25ft Great White in this game. For me it was at least.Lastly then there's SURVIVOR MODE, which has divers hunting as many NPC sharks as they can before the timer runs out. Sometimes sharks will attack you or sometimes they just ignore you unless you attack them. I like how the sharks are sometimes aggressive in Deathmatch Mode, but for Survivor Mode in my opinion all the sharks should constantly be trying to eat you. Then you progressively wipe out each wave from there. Survivor Mode feels less like a survivor/survival/horde mode and more like a miniature timed underwater hunting simulator. It isn't bad by any means, but that is what it feels currently at least.OVERALL FIRST IMPRESSIONS: For $3 I easily got my money's worth out of this title and more. Right now perhaps it's not the next Depth, but it could be or something bigger. I'm really curious to see where the developers decide to go from here and very much look forward to it. I would love to see new playable sharks, more indigenous animals, more weapons, and definitely more game modes whether it's polishing the existing ones or creating all new ones. Maybe throw in a Megalodon, Dunkleosteus, and maybe even a crocodile or two. Somewhat joking, but maybe even a Sharktopus. If you're looking for a good time with your friends involving sharks or you just want to scare someone with a phobia of sharks and Depth is too expensive this is a pretty good alternative."

I personally like the one of an underwater New York City which even includes a statue of liberty. The graphics are good, better than Depth, there I said it.I personally find that the single player mode becomes boring very quickly therefore I think this game’s success will ultimately depend on the multiplayer mode (death match). The game currently has a very low player base meaning most of the time you will find no servers to join. You can create your own but on most occasions I have had nobody else join. I really hope that more people join this early access game as I cannot see myself returning to it if single player mode is my only option.One small suggestion; I think they should add the option of being able to kill the other sea creatures.

Visuals are excellent and doe's immerse the player in an underwater environment well, the audio futher cements the experiance. The current maps are a fair size for this type of deathmatch shooter. Game mechanics seem strong, and the shooting (especially player vs player) is great fun, at times frustrating to land that killer blow. The maps are set out so that you need to collect O2, weapons, and other useful items. This allows for nice little ambush's to occur. The shark mode is interesting and fun to play as well. Good fun to play with a few friend's in Deathmatch and in the co-op mode. All in all a well done game, only lacking in player base thus far. And so far the developers have been genuinely interested in player feedback, and are open to it so as to further drive the vision they have for it. So what have you got to lose give it a go.Aris"

Haven't played co-op yet because my friends are lame and haven't bought it yet (see the above-listed con, and it's parenthetical injunction), but the single player is both fun and sufficiently challenging that while it isn't a mainstay, it's worth trying every so often.- Predator Mode - HOLY FREAKING CRAP it's amazing.  One of you player the Great White and commands the other sharks.  Your goal is to eat as many divers as possible before being killed.  Whoever kills you becomes the Great White, and thus it cycles, except that while the divers are trying to kill the shark, they are also sniping and potshotting each other to make sure no one else gets the shark.Great game, very enjoyable, only con is the server population, and you can help fix that by buying it.

I would love to have another awesome shark game to play around with.  But I don't recommend this one in the state it's in.  I'm hoping it'll improve over time.First of all I would like to point out the irritating, unprofessional matters.  I suppose the developers are just sensitive.  But there is literally a thread stickied in the forums labelled ""this or depth.""  That in itself is a recipe for disaster.  Like the developers are encouraging flaming -- which is the only thing that comes out of threads like that.  I find it unprofessional and frankly, disappointing.  That's not the worst thing though.  If you go into the main menu after launching SADM2, there is a button you can press that will send out messages to 10 people on your friendlist, without your permission, asking them to play the game.  That right there just pisses me off.  That is completely unprofessional and a♥♥♥♥♥♥move for advertisement.Moving on.  While I haven't played much, I think I've played enough.  Had some friends help me learn, wasn't too hard to pick up.  Unfortunately the gameplay right off the bat was exceedingly boring.  I swam around a town for about 5 minutes, saw a few AI sharks here and there, but never saw the Great White player or any other divers.  It was really slow gameplay, and I never had any sense of fear, or being hunted.  I finally found a chain gun, and soon after found the shark, shot everything I had, then got eaten.  Not really sure where the exciting part was supposed to be in all of that.  It's not like I had any chance of getting away from the shark, you just shoot and hope it dies before it eats you, and that only lasts about 20 seconds.  And if it does get you, you just respawn and do the same thing.We moved on to another gamemode.  It was divers vs divers, with a shark AI.  I was very disappointed about the AI.  You can easily dodge its attack, then go to its tail and stab it.  Then it swims away, comes back and you repeat.  It's not even worth wasting your ammo on it.  The diver vs diver gameplay was pretty fun for a little while.  It was fun having to predict where the diver would be and lead the shot, since the spears travel so slowly.  But it did become boring after a while with such a small selection of weapons, and the shark AI was just a nuisance that interrupted us every now and then.  It actually became frustrating when my friends started using the knife.  There is no sense of distance in this game when it comes to CQC.  If they look 10 feet away from you, they will still be able to knife you to death.  That, combined with the great effectiveness of the knife makes it a really annoying weapon.  Why do you even need the spear gun?  Easier to just dodge someones spears and then stab them.Finally, the graphics and ambiance.  The textures and ambient creatures are really nice.  There's a large variety of fish which really makes the game feel alive.  I'm just not a fan of the disorienting water effects.  It makes me feel like I'm a drunk diver.  It'd probably give me nausia if I played it too long, which is really rare for me.  The sounds are also disappointing.  The breathing is very immersion-breaking, and it sounds very stock.  Otherwise, nice job in the visuals.That's all from me.  But... I just want to put this out there.  Look around at all these reviews.  Look at their hours.  90% of these people have just 2 hours in the game, and have never returned.  Doesn't that say something in itself?"

Shark Attack Deathmatch 2 is a rather lackluster underwater FPS that becomes dull quickly.The game takes place entirely in the ocean, which is a welcome change since not many games have this setting. Initially, this creates a tense and fearful atmosphere; which is then shortly nullified when you realize how easy it is to kill sharks, even moreso after the radar update that allows you to see all enemies at all times. You strafe around them or swim up to dodge the pattern of attack every single one has; which is to charge at you in a straight line. Afterwards, you shoot them in the rear with one of two projectile weapons available. Repeat this only twice for littler ones, and maybe six or seven on larger ones.Three game modes are offered; Survival, FFA, and Predator. Survival can be played alone or with one online partner, and consists of a 15 minute session of killing as many sharks as possible. As stated earlier, the AI is a bore and this gamemode is ultimately passable. FFA is slightly more exciting, seeing as you not only have to fight sharks but also enemy divers. However, this also becomes uninteresting after a short time, because there's not much to PvP combat besides who can lead their shots better. Movement and item control matter very little, and take note the online population is almost nonexistent as well. Initially predator mode didn't work, but recently it functioned as planned. This is the game mode I had the most fun with, seeing as the bland AI issue is somewhat remedied with one player being able to use the shark. However, there are very little people playing, so a proper 4 diver team against one shark is hard to come by.The graphics and visuals are actually quite nice for an early access title, but that does not excuse the rest of the game. There's also a decent variety in sharks, but sadly they all have the same behavior so they feel like model swaps more than anything. As far as the musical department goes, the title screen theme is a royalty free track I've heard before (This is the only example I can find as of right now:www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ-oHpoamUM), and the other only piece of music that plays is a generic Jaws-esque ""horror"" track when a shark is hunting you.Compared to the first game, there are more maps, enemies, weapons, as well as diver customization, but overall the game doesn't stand very well on its own with such a basic combat formula. As of now with 7 hours into it, I feel as if I've already exhausted this game and more. I would imagine people who dislike replaying would get an hour or two maximum out of this. I highly recommend buying this on at least a 50% sale if you absolutely have to own this title, for whatever reason that may be.8/2/16 edit: Developer contacted me and Predator mode worked"

The premise is simple, hunt other players while you are battling in beautiful, shark infested waters. Everything from the sound, to the gorgeous ocean visuals, ambient aquatic life, and the highly detailed sharks makes you feel like you are actually diving beneath the sea.The map layouts are fantastic, with plenty of unique areas to find and explore. At one point you may be swimming through seaweed, the next through a crashed WWII bomber, and then find yourself near the carcass of a giant whale. It is hard to not just want to explore and look at the visuals, but alas you need to turn your attention to those pesky divers and their harpoon guns.I can't find anything negative to say about this game except for a couple things such as a selectable radar and a choice for whether sharks net you points, would be nice. It is surprisingly optimized and complete for being an Early Access game. My friends and I hop on this game almost nightly and making a private server could not be easier. Keep up the good work devs! You are headed in the right direction.Early Access Verdict: Buy this game now! It is worth every penny of the extremely small asking price.

You also have to be aware of your oxygen level so you can't afford to be complacent. There's a variety of weapons, and the maps are varied enough that they can cater to any kind of play style; be it gorilla tactics, straight out hunter, or sneaking up behind an enemy player. Customisation of your character adds a personal touch, and the Devs are active and take on board your feedback (something that's very lacking nowadays).There's alternate game types, including the option to play as a shark.

,Recommended,330580,17665451,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,{SSQRL} Lumpo!,"Fun game with a ton of promise. Pretty much the only downside to this game currently is a lack of a solid player base. If you enjoy Depth, you'll definitely enjoy this game. Currently only has 2 game modes, TDM and a coop Survival Mode, and more modes are planned.Pros:SharksThe sharks are well coded and add a lot of tension to the traditional TDM fare. Always fun when the music spikes in letting you know a shark is hunting you, as you start frantically scanning the murky blue for the predator. Sharks don't always attack you, they're always there, but not necessarily always an enemy.Projectiles are incredibly satisfyingConsidering you're shooting spears through water, you need to lead your targets a lot. This makes one on one fights sort of like a dance, as you both try and hit and out maneuver each other. This leads to there seldom being what could be described as a ""cheap kill."" Kills are earned, and are always satisfying when you nail a partifularly tough shot on an oppenent. Players looking for a shooter that requires some skill to excell will not be dissapointed here.Graphics are superbNot much to elaborate on. While an early access game in content, it definitely doesn't look like one. Levels are detailed, models are nice, and the lighting is great. If you find yourself wishing Depth did a better job capturing the look and feel of being underwater, you should be happy here.Fantastic Developer SupportThis is a big one. This game is being developed by 2 people who are very passionate about this game. They are always looking for player feedback and will respond to any questions or suggestions you have. If you're having trouble finding someone to play with, just ask JonesJonesie one of the developers and he'll gladly play some rounds with you. My interactions with the developers of this game foster a lot of faith in that they will do whatever it takes to make this a good game that people enjoy. It's clear they will continue to support this game well into the future, this is their baby.Cons:Lack of player baseDespite how much good there is in this little game, this is presently a pretty huge con. I tend to pop in whenever I sit down on my computer and seldom is there a game currently going (which is why my play time is low, just not for lack of trying), and I've yet to be able to play a round with a full room. Hopefully, this won't be a problem in the long run, as it is a fun game when you can get a few people together and have at it underwater.Weapon Variety/CustomizationIf the ability to tune and customize your characters gear to your liking is going to make or break a game for you then this might not be the best time to jump into this game. More gear and weapons are planned, but at present there are only 2 guns (which are well done and satisfying in their own right). It does make the game fun in that it's a level playing field, but it does lead something to be desired in the way of variety. This will likely be remedied as development continues.For the price, this is a great little game that deserves a much larger player base. Hopefully this game catches on and the community can thrive as it deserves."

In my opinion if you like games where you enjoy seeing how long you can last against endless waves of enemies. This game maybe for you. It has moments when you're super excited because you're doing so well. Then you have moments you're raging because A Great White comes up from behind you and destroys your world. It's early access so there are some things that need to be fixed like the biting distance. Sometimes the shark will be a good distance from you yet he still gets a good chuck out of you.

One of the devs went out of his way to personally help me with the issued i have had. However this does mean the game did have issues. Upon installation, i left settings at default. The game ran beautifully at 60fps during the title screen, character creation screen, and main menu. Sadly, the framerate dropped TO 2-3 frames a second. The dev previously mentioned reached out to me. Somehow, before I could consult with the dev, the problem was resolved. However i strongly appreciate the outreach from the devs.NOW THE ACTUAL REVIEWThe game looks beautiful. The controls feel natural. The AI is fair and the gameplay is thrilling.There isn't too much more to say about this game, but if you gather a couple buddies you're guaranteed a good time.8/10CONS-few problems, those that exist are very problematic-not too hot on the full price. I bought this on sale and the price i paid was more than fair.

The swimmers must fight against sharks and swimmers up to 4 players.Request for future updates;Rename the game to only Shark Attack in Steam, think the 'Deathmatch' title might scare some players away thinking its only deathmatch mode (that what I thought).Predator mode should get ability to turn on coop so players don't necessary need to kill each other."

For an Early Access it game it runs quite smoothly. It is basically an underwater FPS with sharks that roam around and kill you!At the moment there is a survival game mode and Deathmatch on the multiplayer mode. More modes will be unlocked later on such as Team Deathmatch,Capture the flag and Be the Shark mode.Weapons at the moment only include two. A one shot harpoon and a automatic harpoon. Yet again more weapons will be introduced at a later date.The best part for me is the tense battles you have with your opponents. Both of you firing your harpoons, flying past each other both praying that your spear will hit and kill them! Then all of a sudden a shark may come out of knowhere and tear you to shreds!

Early acces at £5 and thought its well worth a try. Being a scuba diver these lads really got it right in regards to weight/movement/visuals etc. Maybe try and get some ""floating particles"" inside the wrecks etc will add more realism i think. Other creatures look nice and the shark physics are excellent! Enjoyed so far in survival mode but needs more players for multiplayer as not had a game available yet. Be good to see this one progress. Like the oxygen idea makes it more intense. Be good to see blood linger in th ewater a while longer like a cloud and have other sharks attrack to it - possibly have a blood cartridge pickup to distract sharks etc? Lots of ideas for this game. Nice to suport indi devs too. I'm new in the indie app industry and my debut app just came out on apple/android called: blast off bob. Check it out if you're into indie space/astronaut games.

,Recommended,330580,20009742,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,SAY10,"I just picked this game up during the Winter Sale 2015 for $2.50 USD. I already play a game similar in effort to this, called ""Depth"" which I'm sure many people here know exists, and this game is markedly different as of right now but not in a bad way.It's cheap, for one. $2.50 for a game that's still in development is a steal. It's Early Access, so you get to play this game as it evolves into what the developer envisions. The developer regularly interacts and posts replies to community hub posts in regard to the game and questions about it all the time. Go to the community hub and look for yourself... that's pretty nice if you ask me. It shows that the developer is both open to feedback and also probably enjoys helping others enjoy what I'm sure will shape up to be a good game.Depth is largely finished by now, with the developers just adding more content and DLC here and there like tie-ins and new maps. This game, though, is not. Don't expect it to be. It's very basic and rudimentary at this point - it's humans, who move slowly in these underwater conditions, surviving against waves of sharks rolling in from the outer reaches of the map. It's not exactly a ""jumpy"" game but it doesn't need to be right now.I hope this game turns out really well. I don't regret buying it, especially for what I paid, I don't mind supporting developers' efforts to make the game they wanna make, all I ask in return for purchasing is that they finish the game and they make it something cool. This has the potential to be something cool. They've already brought in a co-op survival mode and will be adding an adversary mode soon that lets you control the shark(s) on the map.It isn't as gorgeous as the new Star Wars game, and it isn't boring like stupid little ""retro"" 8-bit indie games, but it's a niche game. It's a deathmatch game with SHARKS vs HUMANS. It likely won't get millions of players as a player base in the future but I don't care if it does or doesn't, I only care about whether the game keeps getting better or not and so far it seems like it'll continue to grow and become something of its own.Pick it up if you can get it for a cheap price like I did, cause I know some people avoid Early Access games out of fear or distrust.Maybe my review will help someone, maybe it won't. I like the game either way, and I wish it luck cause there really aren't enough DIFFERENT types of shooters out there. The world doesn't need another ♥♥♥♥ing military sim shoot 'em up like Call of Duty anymore."

I see them coming, I know it's inevitable, but it still makes me screech and freak out when they do!The only thing I could ask for is a no shark mode. Or maybe even a find the shark mode? Like there's one big, elusive shark and you're supposed to spend your time gathering ammo and oxygen and try to find the thing and then kill it before it kills you once engage? I don't know. I figure it's a stupid thing to ask for a no sharks or docile sharks mode in a game literally callled SHARK ATTACK, but the scenery in the mutliple layouts options this game has is so beautiful and I love the wild life, it would be so awesome to just be able to relax and explore it.Either way, highly recommended, can't wait to see what any additions might have in store, but awesome game as is."

I realized these guys have not abbandoned this game and they still working on it. This game has potential and it looks really promising, so now these people need to reclaim back their playerbase. I even got 4 damn game keys from a game developer (lol) ! And yeah I shared the keys on forums and I hope player community will grow. If the devs havent abandoned this game, then players shouldnt abandon either. Keep up the good work and we're waiting for future updates ! :)The game has nice graphics, nice maps and it creates a great atmosphere with the feeling that there are sharks circling somewhere around you and may attack you out of nowhere. However the game lacks contents like more weapons, or some kind of skill system, or level system that would give you some stats benefit, it lacks more shark types, maybe bigger explorable maps at least for singleplayer. This game is great for killing time if you have nothing else to do for couple hours but thats about it. You gonna become bored pretty fast with it, and the most imporant thing that should be mentioned is that the multiplayer game is DEAD. Forums are dead, there have been like 400 reviews over almost 9 months. You join an empty game and you get that feeling as if this product has been abandoned not only by players but also by the developers. I'll be glad to change my review into positive if something changes in the future, but for now I don't recommend this game to anyone, unless it's on sale. Basically you'll just buy a singleplayer game with nothing else to do just sit in a corner, shoot sharks with 2 harpoons and wait for time to pass."

Hopefully these will be added in the future.Co-op survival is fun but not many people play it.Once the devs saw my last review they reached out to me they are nice and respectable people.And that brings us to the last part. The game has great graphics and good under water physics. They also wanted a game that was origonal and not the same ol shark games. They definety did just that the game is worth way more than its worth.

It has a lot of potential, just lacking in content, variety in gamemodes, more customization, and player base. It almost feels like a campaign mission in an older COD game.

It has more depth than any game I have ever played and is certain to become the next youtube hit! Lighthouse Games have always had the reputation of being one of the top AAA developers and once again they have proven themselves! Shark Attack Deathmatch 2 has a gripping story and some of the best writing I have ever seen in a game, blowing classics like The Last of Us and any telltale game out of the park. There is a multitude of shark themed choices to choose from throughout the game all of which will impact what kind of characters you meet a long the way. The game has 7 endings, all of which are well thought out and incredibly enjoyable to achieve. I don't think a game has ever made me cry as much as Shark Attack Deathmatch 2, The amount of depth and thought that has gone into the ove 120hr long campaign really shows. Many developers often recieve criticism for open world games however this game nails it and provides a vibrant, fun filled world with a ludicrus amount of quests, tasks, and fish to do and meet.Visually, Shark Attack Deathmatch 2 is on par with games like The Witcher 3. You can see every single piece of detail on the sharks, from his scars to his deep blue eyes. This game is truly beautiful and the colour pallete brings every piece of sea life and plant life to the forefront!This game is certain to be the next hit and I can not recommend it enough. Defiinitely get it before it goes out of early access as this game is a once in a lifetime opportunity and must be gotten. :-) 10/10"

After playing for a few minutes, I can already tell there isn't much point of revisiting this one. Fairly one sided gameplay with the scales being tipped in favor of the predators far too much.As for realism this game has beautiful graphics (while you can look around before dying at the hands of or should I say 'teeth' of some player controled terminator with fins.)Sharks of different species unrealistically pack together. Such as blacktip and great whites. With how much damage it takes to kill one shark you start wondering if they found a sunken ship that had both Quad Damage, and the Invulnerability sphere.The lack of an effective startup weapon only leaves me to believe that every diver in the game is psychotic. Better to have made a game about hunting lions with a olive fork.Before you say ""You can get other weapons"" yes, there are other weapons you can pick up, but, only if you can get to them before losing an appendage to serrated teeth or the air in your supply (""'tank'? Might as well be a inflated trash bag with a straw.) running out in three to four minutes.No spectator mode so you can't get a sense of how to play before offering yourself up as chum. Single player has no real goal except to survive as long as possible before dying either from lack of air or being ""Murdered by a shark, although it's not really ""murder"". Maybe you'll actually get to kill a great white before running so low on ammo you can't kill a sea slug with whats left.Overall this game looks great but needs ALOT of work. I wouldn't suggest buying it unless it's on sale or that they patch it to even out the game play.Of course this is just my opinion. Yu may buy it anyway and think it's great, but it's your risk."

Jonesjones or something?Anyways, back on topic.I'll give this game a moderate score. Nothing negative I wouldn't expect, you know? Nothing ground-breaking, and not fully developed like Depth, but it's a start.First topic, first impression.I started out with a random lobby, because I didn't mind where it began. Within seconds, I was in a lobby. Brownie point.So I see the sharks, minding their own business. It was a Great White, actually. To be honest... It was intimidating, yes, but not spooky like snorkelling chills I usually get when I'm next to a trash can of teeth and death. It just lumbered around aimlessly, even when I shot it. It was like punching one of those aluminum baloons in wal-mart; it's attack was so slow that there was absolutely no way it could deal damage. I knifed it to death with jonesjones watching lol.Then I see that someone died, and checked out the game size. It was just the two of us, plus jones. Jones basically just popping around here and there like anyone would do in their own made world. I felt a ping of envy there.""Deathmatch"" seemed so unfair due to the fact there's a gattling gun box sitting in the open that can be defended easily by a guy with a gattling gun. I felt bad for the other player, so I just stopped the massacre and declared a truce. He obliged, then we just jammed out to ""Ocean Man"" while pretending we were riding the ♥♥♥♥ing great white.I mentioned it to jones that the AI needed improvement, and reccommended he play ""Stranded Deep"" to get that creepy vibe that game gave you when you were being stalked. He said he'd check it out.  I also mentioned that there isn't a ""turn your head, then your spear follows you"" type thing you would be more likely to do, but I'm sure they may implement that later?  Also, a panicked reloading animation would be nice.  I just imagine the diver swinging his head around to view the environment before even having the gun near ready to shoot, then take like 3 seconds to actually prep a decent shot.He left immediately after, so I left as well. I checked out all the lobbies, and it turned out that the other guy and I were the only players on. Nobody is playing this game? That sucks. Reviews seem decent.So I decided to take his advice and play ""Survival.""This is where I could see the negative sides of the AI, big time.First one I noticed were no indications of where things were. I panicked trying to find the ammo box.Secondly, the sharks don't have a sense of tactics. They just lumber in circles around you until they hope to catch you by surprise, which includes basically swimming slowly and biting too soon, which causes you to just Disney bounce off of their nose. I may have played with that for a few minutes.Thirdly. Makos are pretty much the only thing that make me check my surroundings, since they just charge you head on.Fourth, the sharks don't follow you that easily. For a guy wearing flippers, you are RIDICULOUSLY fast, faster than anything in the game I've crossed. I mean, I've fed makos, and those f*ckers can disappear with your arm before you know what time it is.My over-all score for a new game.........................7.5/10Art is nice, could use some work, AI is sloppy but can be fixed, and for a 2-man dev group, I'm impressed. I'll keep this one on my list to keep an eye on.Until then, I'm going to go back to SD for a bit and see how well I do against the land-shark glitches."

But there was one thing that people keept saying in their reviews that I did not think all the way through, which is mutiplayer is next to nothing in terms of being active. On top of that, gameplay is not that worth it, including modes for mutiplayer. And the PVP is quite difficult. The only pro to this game to be honest, is it's graphics. Either then that, gameplayer is not what I thought. If they put more into this, then maybe i'd play it. I only wish I did not wait so long to try getting a refund for what little I did pay for it."

You can of course going around killing sharks for points to try to avoid PvP, but maps are kinda small, so good luck with that.   2 servers are usually up, and you'll probably find a game almost full (8 max).  Imagine being in a home aquarium with up to 8 players and the goal is to swim around shooting each other for 20 minutes.  That replay factor is up to you.Starting gear:You get a knife and a 1 shot spear gun.  You can find another one, which is basically an ammo refill, or a gun that will shoot some a little faster.  There is also a health to pick up, and oxygen that needs replenishing.At this state, I would not recommend.  I hope to see some improvements and will boot this game from time to time."
