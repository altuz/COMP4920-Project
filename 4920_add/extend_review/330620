I had an hour before I had to leave for work, so I thought I'd give it a go. Over an hour later, I casually looked at the clock and grabbed my coat and RAN out the door, racing in traffic to get to work on time before I was late. Barely made it with a few seconds to spare. I'm normally a guy who shows up early just because better safe than sorry.So I would say this game is pretty spot on. Think of a group of raiders, in any game you could play. World of Warcraft, Ever Quest, Final Fantasy Online - just to name a few. Then, take that group, and think of them as real people (we all know that you picture some guy playing a chick character just to stare at pixel booty all day) - Not to say they aren't, but the perception of most people is to look at who they are, and assume everyone else is a robot or just some random nobody.This game is full of comedy - Everything from ""Killalot talks about his political views"" to a person ""Afking in the middle of combat to check his email"" - And will remind you of what really happens. I love when I tell a tank to take over agro, and the tank (who is better geared and more able to do so) cannot pull agro off the first tank. I love when a mage just happens for wander into creature range and gets attacked wildly. I love when the healers forget to heal because they think a tank is good, and start to dps, letting the poor tank die because the fight required a focused heal at specific times. Just like in real MMOs.This game is easily one of the more addictive games, and as my first day playing, it has already caused me to come close to being late to work AND caused me to rush home just to try to see how far I can make it after the fact."

It's been interesting to get into the mindset of a kind of manegement position for these ""raids"" rather than being able to control anybody's actions directly. This game has so far been full of funny moments (when a healer alt tabs right before finishing a big heal is great).I have a couple of critisisms though.Switching tanks mid-fight seems so difficult as to not even be worth the effort. One of my warriors has one extra piece of gear over my secondary tank and that seems to be enough for him to take aggro on every creature even if he isn't attacking it.Only being able to make one command in a turn can get really brutal when things go wrong (if more than one player decides to switch roles, for example). It would be nice to be able to do more in a given turn even if it was only sometimes.I'd like to see more flavor in the combat log, more classes, more raid abilaties, more everything I guess. I'm excited to see if this game continues to grow after release.This game is more than worth the price of entry and I will be spending a lot more time with it in the future."

,Recommended,330620,13365708,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,redp,"It's A Wipe is worth the money for the nostalgia factor, but most of the game feels relatively spartan in features or gameplay. Generally, the game consists of managing a sitcom-version of a guild raiding party in an indirect fashion with breaks in between; additional characters or other amusing features that one think to find in a game about managing a guild are absent.Further, the game is quickly over -- there seems to be only 7-8 raids -- and some of the mechanics really need some work, particularly infighting over loot. This can make the game frustrating and the game itself seems to have relatively little replayability; which is odd given that the overall concept of the game, if developed, could provide for a fascinating guild management game.The problem with that is that the game not developed sufficiently; it is, as stated, feature light.With that said, it's five dollars and I had trouble not liking it. For that price you get what you might expect. I would tepidly recommend the game and hope the developer fleshes out the features of it.Pros:-Interesting concept.-Nostalgia.-Humor is good.-Good framework for a game; seems easily developed.Cons:-Relatively thin in gameplay depth; feature light.-Sometimes frustrating.-Sometimes boring in some fights; cannot manage one's own character.-The UI is really very ugly."

,Recommended,330620,13339609,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,Bimble,"Fun game for the price.  Battles require thought after the early dungeons are out of the way, and keeping everyone happy about loot is a bit of a challenge.  Your raid's strength grows noticeably over time, and some of the character actions can be amusingly nostalgic if you've ever raided in an MMO (like someone going link dead, or a mage deciding to tank).  MMO experience can help you get a handle on strategy quickly, but I don't think it's a requirement to enjoy the game.The character quirks don't impact the gameplay too much, so luck isn't a huge factor.  Fights boil down to managing the raid strategy (like DPS, healing, and tanking priorities) and figuring out boss patterns.  I'm impressed by how well the game simulates the raid management experience (""WHY DID YOU DRINK THAT POTION INSTEAD OF HEALING THE TANK?!?"") without getting bogged down in micromanagement.  Fights can drag on at times, but hey, they're raids.  They do that.It would be great if characters had more personality, or if raid groups could be bigger, or if character abilities were more varied.  For the price, though, those aren't complaints - just wishes for a DLC/sequel someday."

I have enjoyed every hour I've spent on this game.The developer is great about listening to the community, fixing bugs as they're found in a timely manner.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND not reading a guide before playing, since a major part of the gameplay is figuring out each boss' mechanics on your own.Essentially, IAW is a puzzle with multiple solutions. Which raiders you recruit, your group's class spread, balancing loot distribution, everything plays a part in your success, and there isn't a single 'right' answer. Do you take two rogues for higher damage, but knowing morale might suffer from loot disputes? Do you take two wizards, knowing they'll deal high damage, but have trouble swapping targets? Do you take a bard for the buffs or replace them with a different class?I've played through the game with a lot of different spreads. Once with three warriors, once with only one, sometimes I take a bard, sometimes I don't. Once I took two druids, even. It's all about figuring out how the group will interact and doing what you can to keep things balanced.Plus the humor is great. It's amusing even if you don't get the references, but is pretty great if you do.So microwave a burrito, turn on voice chat and grab the rum: It's time to go raiding."

You can make plans on how you want to deal with the boss that turn, but your tank might tab out to read his email or your healer might decide he wants to tank.A varity of things can happen while your raiding and you also have to keep your raiders happy else they will leave you to join another guild including with any loot you happen to have gave them in past runs.Overall it is a great game for it's price but I'd recommend playing it while watching a movie or playing another game as it is fairly slow and your raiders are doing all the work you just give them the command on what to do."

Sure its not going for any graphical awards, but its quirky and reminicent of an age of Pc gaming when it was at its finest.I've played WoW and messed around with other MMO's but never really had to time or commitment to put into actually raiding with other people, this game gives me a taster of this experience with none of the hasle. Despite what other people may say I think the game does have replayabilty, not only because of the increasing difficulties but also because there are several ways and raid composits that the player can employ to defeat raids.I sincerly hope the developers of this wonderful game continue to produce new content, including other members to recruit and new raids to explore. I will certainly be keeping my eyes peeled, and I hope others will be too in supporting the game.I have but one quivel with the game, and that is the text font and the lack of guidance in the tutorial - that being said I got to grips with it easy enough, I just think it could do with a little more highlighting the things that are happening or forcing you to use some of the many raid commands to change tactics or healing targets during a raid.Right, now I'm going to go see if i can stop Medic from spouting his political views whilst I'm raiding!"

The game is so poorly put together that it hurts to play. The whole experience begs to be excused by the fact that it's a ""joke game"", But the joke stops being funny after the first fight, then there is only frustration left. If I got paid 10$ every hour for playing this, I would say no in a heartbeat. If it was free, I would feel robbed. Paying for it? I will regret it forever. Give it a miss, folks.The whole premise of leading a guild is also flawed. This game only focuses on the annoying parts of leading a guild. There is no feeling of achievement after completing a raid, just a list of items to distribute, none of which have any appearance or or quality indication on them. At the end of a raid, all you get is some numbers that you give to a member of the raid, and all the others get mad, which removes the want for more gear. There is no reason to wish for progression because the reward is just more grief.Besides getting the feel of the position of raid leader completely wrong, the game is also relentlessly boring. There is no automization whatsoever, like there would be in a good raid group. If a raid is easy, the raid leader does nothing. here, no matter how easy the boss/trash you're at is, you still have to command every single goddamn turn, which means you just sit there for 10 minutes clicking the same 2 buttons after you know you've allready won. Even turning up the combat speed to ""ludicrous"" it is still slow as balls, every turn taking way longer than it should. It all adds up to being incredibly boring.If the game nailed the essence of leading a raid, the responsibility, the challenge, the strategic overview needed, and the amazing feeling of accomplishment after finally downing a boss, this would have been a really interesting experience. As it stands though, it's all just annoying.TL;DR: It's boring and lame and it sucks. do not buy"

My ""thing"" was to take a bunch of ragtag newbs, start them at the bottom, and see how far they could get if organized properly. I was quite successful and built several ""uber"" guilds this way.This game doesn't quite capture that experience. The main things it is shorn of are cameraderie and discipline, which also happen to be the key human elements to making a successful guild.In this game, every person who doesn't get a drop that they could potentially use gets upset about it every time. In my guilds, anyone who behaved that way got shown the door, swiftly and unceremoniously.In this game, no matter what you do, some of your raiders wander off and do stupid things with surprising frequency. In my guilds, anyone who proved to be a loose cannon - you guessed it - got shown the door.The rules were that on raid time I expected soldiers, and people could be as loose as they pleased outside of raids, but while the group was together everyone had to have the utmost respect for everyone else's time.In this game I couldn't show anybody the door, because the roster of available players was so limited, and all those players came with the same flaws, so replacing someone doesn't help.Nor could you give specific advice to any players to make them better.Nor can you make a long term plan for individual players' development (a key reason why I was successful as a GM) so they didn't freak out when a usable drop went to someone else.In this game, nobody is ever happy to see a drop go to someone else; at best, they are neutral. In the real thing, good players are very happy to watch the guild as a whole improve even if their own character doesn't see new pixels every raid.In this game, your numbers go up but your raiders don't actually get better at raiding. In the real deal, the more people practice the faster and sharper they get.There are a lot of other facets of GMing that this game doesn't bother to capture at all, but are important factors in the real thing. Players taking extended breaks then coming back. Dealing with groups of friends whose primary loyalty is to each other so they become a package deal. Husband/wife pairs and the impact of marital dynamics on the group. The child prodigies who despite being much younger than other players are so talented that you can't pass them up as raiders. There are a wide variety of player archetypes but only a tiny few are represented in this game, and even then they do not differ that much from each other. The game makes feeble attempts at modeling some of this but it's really half-hearted and not at all realistic.As a MMO guild/raid leader, player availability was often the biggest challenge - who out of our key players can't make this raid? How do I substitute/adapt to those players missing? Do I need to find another player of the same class to replace a needed character ability, even if I'm taking a chance on someone new, or can I substitute with other classes from among more trusted players? If our best isn't available, do I aim for a lesser raid to bring others up to speed?The absence of that factor is important, because it impacts other decisions. Do I stack my main tank first or distribute more evenly? Do I give the best loot to the best players, or the ones who show up most often, or the ones I expect to be around for the longest period of time, or just to the people who play the best on that particular raid? Each priority creates a different incentive to players, and players in turn react in a wide variety of ways to each type of incentive.So... let me wrap this up. What this game is, is a good *prototype* of a guild management game. It's a prototype that needs to be developed by people with experience managing guilds, needs to have a much much deeper and more varied pool of players to work with, needs models of player development (including self-development), needs models of ""real life"" impact on player availability and guild dynamics, and other elements that, without which, you aren't really getting a good simulation of the real thing.This game should give you a few hours of enjoyment as you figure it out and before you realize how sharp the limitations are. If that's enough for your few bucks, go for it.In the end I cannot recommend the game as I think it fails its main mission of simulating what it is like to run a raiding guild. Wish rather than an explicit thumbs down I could give it a thumb kind of wagging to the side hoping to go up but lacking the willpower."

Here's hoping for someone picking up on this and making something that actually looks like the various MMOs out there.

Healers heal, tanks tank, dps do damage.Then you get a bit of micromanagement to do.Sometimes raidmembers switch roles and you need to yell at them.Somtimes raidmembers stand in fire and you need at them.Sometimes the melee walk into the backline and you need to yell at them.Sometimes the tank gets low and you need to yell at the healers to keep them up (which works, unlike in World of Warcraft).Maybe a fight is too rough, so you go back to an older dungeon to gear up.Later the fights get complexer. You'll need to pay attention to mechanics and macro manage your raid as well as micro manage your raid at the same time.I find it enjoyable and considering it's price tag I'd recomend waiting for a sale."

It's clunky, slow, and the UI is frustrating most of the time. My guild mates get demoralized all the time for no reason. I guess that may be intentional, but I've never enountered anyone that becomes more unhappy with a guild for no reason other than time goes by in my raiding days. I dunno, I think I just don't like the way it was implemented.If the developer takes this idea and moves it to an engine that doesn't suck, and improves the general gameplay and UI in a sequel, this would be a great game and I'd be one of the first to buy it. Oh, and also gives us different raid size options like 10/25/40, that would be awesome."

It has a cool concept, but the inability to plan for fight phases makes the entire point of the game moot.

Good ♥♥♥♥ing luck keeping your healer from raging for not getting it.

Refunded.Taking the night off gives everyone a point of morale.  I would think if you had seriously dedicated players this would cause a morale drop.Talking to one person for the night increases morale for that one person, but decreases more morale when you add up the penalties for all other characters.  And I didn't recruit any drama queens either, based on character descriptions.Lots of useless raid commands you will never use, that are there just as a joke.Switch Tank command doesn't seem to do anything when I use it.  If it takes time or a dice roll, there is no indication.  Just nothing happens, and the tank who I wanted to switch out is mowed down.After 20 minutes, obviously long-term strategy is to take 2 each of warriors, clerics, druids, wizards, thieves.  You can then alternate drops and hopefully keep people happy.  Take a nights off when you have to, to give +1 morale to everyone.Game is too boring to continue playing.  What little enjoyment can be had from this game, is eclipsed by the enjoyment that can be had by playing a better game."

I remember during my MMORPG days (long behind me) watching the chat while frustrated people waited for the cleric or tank to return from picking up fast food, or the absolute rage that would occur when someone with a terrible connection went link dead in the middle of a boss fight. This game tries to simulate that, but it does so poorly. For example, when Healzaur's cat walks across the keyboard, they miss a turn. When Sir Killzalot runs out to get a burrito, he misses a turn. When MagicMan goes link dead, he misses a turn. That's it, that's all that happens, when it would be easy to have each event do something differently. Cat walks across keyboard? Hit/Heal/Attack wrong monster/player. Leaving for a burrito? Takes longer than a few minutes, that should be a few turns right there. Goes link dead? Leaves the raid indefinitely, but dosn't take any damage. That's the raiding I remember, but sadly this game dosn't even take it that far.The social aspects are also lacking. When Burninator and Sing-a-long discuss politics, it should have an effect on their morale, but it does nothing. It's just pointless flavor text that reminds me it could do something, but doesn't, especially given the odd morale system in this game. The fact that your guildies are selfish arses when it comes to handing out loot is a plus, but will sometimes leave you scratching when your head when taking something for guild funds does nothing for player morale, but giving an item to a player its best suited for causes a drop in morale across the board. Then there are the times when people are feeling neglected, even when you just spent the whole night talking to them, and everyone else is getting upset you won't talk to them, like you're the only conversationalist on the planet or something.Again, I'm not someone who cares about graphics, and the game is worth about what is being asked for it, but if your looking to recapture that sense of leading a guild to disaster because raiders and responsibility rarely mix, you sadly won't find it here."
,Recommended,330620,13732046,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Carcino,"Pros:- A great way to learn some fundamentals of running a guild. Places you in charge of distributing loot, recruiting new members, and leading your guild through progressively harder fights that will cause you to wipe if you don't adapt your strategy,- You will appreciate how the game is presented and the references shown if you happen to play MMOs (especially World of Warcraft).- The price tag. At $4.99 you can't really go wrong. You can purchase the game merely for nostalgia purposes and still feel satisfied.Cons:- The classes that characters are presented in It's A Wipe feel somewhat restricted and specialized. While this makes the game easier to play and manage it can make playing the game seem too simple (If you're a Rogue you can only single target damage. If you're a Mage you can only AoE damage, ect.)-  While the overview for each guild mates' personality and needs is a nice feature, the social interaction amoung guild mates is lacking.There is no interpersonal aspect between the guild master and his guild mates other then some reoccuring flavor text that happens during the raid itself. The social part of managing a guild is just as important, if not more important, then the raiding itself. Having a relationship and knowing each guildie is something that simply can not be done through the automated skip sequences shown in game.Overall the game for me personally has been a great return on my purchase. Its a wonderful time passer as it doesn't require you to stare at the screen. You can do other things while it plays in the background without fear of messing up too bad (for the most part). I would love to see a more fleshed out game (with a more fleshed out price tag to compensate) that had more complexity. The game has very strong potential as a starting point for a much more involved adventure/manager/socialsim game.Tl;drThe game is priced appropriately for the content it contains. Although features may seem lacking and it can be repetitive at times, it is a must have purchase for anyone who has Raided in MMOs and wants a light hearted, nostalgic strategy game to play on the side."

I didnt use any type of bad words or offense. Instead of talking to me to try to solve the issue, they have just permanently banned me with the comment: ""idiocy"". I am really surprised about how its possible these type of  people are managing a game and a support forum with such actions, without worrying about their users and game bugs.Im sorry but now I am going to develop the same game in pure HTML5 for free for all, with a lot more features. Next time they will think two times before abusing its power with a non sense ban for a customer who just wanted to know a way to fix an issue.By the way, about the game, I really like it and the idea behind it and I think it would be worth it if there were real support with clever people which really helps its users. The game concept is good, and however the graphics are a bit clunky or poor, they feel nice for what it is, a game made from an independant game studio. The Menu however is one of the worst part of the game and you feel totally lost once you begin the game. The musik is also horrible and repetitive and I ended up disabling it and listening to my own. The characters balance is good, however it needs some tweaks for some classes and bosses.
