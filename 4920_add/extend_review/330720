This is not random and its based on lot of factors - Electronic Warfare in the area, available HQ units, C3 lines between subordinate units and their commanders and etc.Scenarios scale varies from company to brigade scale operations on map sized 20x20 kilometrs divided by ~500 meters hexes.FC:RS modeled lot of cold war advanced weapon systems including US M1 Abrams, Bradley IFVs, UK Chieftan, Warrior IFV along with Soviet T-80s and Hinds.Game also features artillery weapons like mortars and SP Guns with diffirent munition like HE, Smoke, minlets and ICBM, chemical and even nuclear arms.Really worth to say that developers are working hard on game, for example Players Edition which is currently available on Steam is a result of great work between Developer team and community. Even today game continue to become better and better.Hope this short list will help you to decide if this game worth your moneys.RUS:Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm это одна из тех уникальных игр, в которые я играю почти всегда, рядом с  играми серии Combat Mission, The Operational Art of War III, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations и играми AGEod.FC:RS это микс между TOAW III и Combat Mission в сеттинге холодной войны, как раз в тот момент, когда она переста(в игре) быть такой уж холодной.Игра имеет много интересных реализаций, например наряду с огромным кол-вом военной техники игра предлагает интерсный гибридный режим WEGO(OODA Loop) тайминг ходов в котором основан на возможности стороны отдавать приказы - в результате этого бывают ситуации, когда одна сторона может отдавать приказы каждые 10 минут, а вторая каждые 20, тем самым время реакции первой стороны на ситуацию заметно меньше второй, что в свою очередь ведет, при правильном применении, к своевременной реакции на изменения на поле боя и к победе. Циклы командования не рандомны, а основаны на многих факторах, включая РЭБ, доступность штабов, существование линии командования между подчиненными и штабами и т.д.Размеры сценариев варьируются от ротного уровня до уровня бригады на картах размером 20 на 20 км, разделенных 500 метровыми гексами.Игра моделирует много современных боевых систем, включая М1 Абрамс, БМП Бредли, Чифтаны, Варриоры на стороне НАТО и Т-80, Ми-24 на стороне Советов.Так же в игре представлены различные артиллерийские системы начиная от минометов и заканчивая самоходными гаубицами имеющие немалый арсенал боеприпасов - ОФ, дымовые, мины, кластерные, химические и даже ядерные заряды.Стоит упомянуть и то, что разработчики совсем не забыли про игру, например Player's Edition, который уже сразу доступен в стиме это результат огромной работы разработчиком вместе с комьюнити.Игра продолжает развиваться и совершенствоваться.Надеюсь это маленькое ревью поможет вам с выбором - стоит ли эта игра ваших денег."

This was a disappointment simply because the UI performs too poorly. I have no patience to struggle through a terrible UI to find what might be a good game...though it really didn't seem all that good.  About 90 minutes into this I was so frustrated I quit. The prices for this game is way too high. I feel robbed.------------------------------------------Update-----------------------------------------I now have over 35 hours logged in this game. I've read the manual, I've completed the tutorial, and completed several small scenarios. I am willing to curtail some of my negative comments, in that once you learn the nuances of the strange user interface there is a game with a great deal of depth underneath. The UI performs well in small scenarios, but on large scenarios I find it sluggish and difficult to use trying to scroll around on the map, which I still find terribly frustrating.I no longer feel robbed, but I can't say that this game will become one of my favorites. The program itself is a challenge not so much the game."

76561197983797429,Recommended,330720,13242538,"Posted: 5 December, 2014",all,spurious956,"Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm is a somewhat unconventional but very welcome gem of a hex&counter wargame.The twist it has going for it over so many wargames of this type is a very tight focus on what you command, limited capability to command (organization and electronic warfare interference), and most interestingly the variable turn length, which alters as the game progresses due to the influence of various factors, lose a few commander units and watch it rocket right up. Commands are issued at the start of each turns, and then the results play out themselves. Units also do not instantly react to your inputs either, and take time to begin doing what you order them to, and may be delayed not by just enemy action lowering their readiness levels but by roads getting clogged with traffic if you try and push too many units at once down a certain path or their commander's being too distant and the units worn down from extended battling.The focus on regiment level command is something that could not really be replicated on tabletop in the same way, as it’s a very hands-off approach. Units, once set on their path, will use their own abilities to locate and attack enemies. What helps this is that much of the numbers are hidden (though they are viewable if you wish to check things) and so you’re not getting a face-full of dice rolls thrown up every time something happens, but rather audio cues, arrows indicating exchanges of fire, and explosions for artillery and counting off casualties, which all lends greatly to the atmosphere and sense that you are attempting to control the chaos of a battle in your favour.Speaking of which, the atmosphere for the game is a kind of intense tension. With fog of war in place as intended (there’s an option to remove it as well as the limited orders per turn) contact with enemies is often fleeting unless a real slugging match is taking place or you've managed to secure good positioning for recon elements; an essential part of not getting surprised by a full companies of tanks and infantry barreling down a road towards you. The tension is a constant as you sit and watch a turn play out, making mental notes of enemy positions to direct artillery to and hoping your plan was good enough, or that you can adapt it in time to exploit an opening or counter a move.When it comes to the armies themselves you do get the best results by playing them to their general doctrine. Brits cannot (most of the time) be used in fast armoured counter attacks like the West Germans, who in turn cannot normally successfully emulate the Soviets and send massive stabbing attacks of armour and mechanized infantry, shrugging casualties to envelop and breach their target objective’s defences. Whilst many scenarios as they come feature relatively high quality Guards units of Soviets with a myriad of BMP-2s and T-80BVs in their arsenals, a huge mass of equipment sporadically appears and can be used in creating your own scenarios.Overall the game sticks well to it's intended style without getting confused or overwhelming you with mechanics, and produces some great battles and challenging campaigns."

To me it has been refreshing to get to command troops on platoon level involving actual battlefield tactics instead of the usual take on division level strategy. It also seems fairly realistic in many respects as far as I can tell. Maybe the command execution delays seem a bit lengthy in some cases, but I'm under the impression that the developers are actively not only fixing bugs but also paying attention to balance and realism.I'm usually a cheapskate who buys games only on hefty discount, but in case of this game I made an exception and spent a bit more to support this kind of game development.

76561198061773358,Not Recommended,330720,19254936,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,Filane,"Having played Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm for 22+ hours, I think I can't recommend this game to war game / TBS fans because the game suffers from some serious gameplay issues. My complaints about this game are all related to the gameplay mechanics and the AI. Although the graphics, the UI, and the sound effects are just mediocre, they're still acceptable to me. As a strategy fanboy, I care about gameplay and AI the most.1) The Achilles Heel of FC:RS is that it's actually a turn-based *tower defense* game, *not* a war game. It's a tower defense game because of 2 reasons.First and foremost, you *cannot* order a combat unit to attack a specific enemy target in the game. In any tower defense game, you can only position turrets at particular locations. It's up to the turrets' AI to determine which enemies to attack. In FC:RS, the gameplay mechanics are the same. You can put combat units at strategic locations and issue different defensive orders to them (e.g., Hold, Screen, and Resupply). However, that's all you can do. It's up to the friendly AIs to determine which enemy units they want to attack. If you want your AT (Anti-Tank) unit to attack a T-80 unit, sorry, you can't. Your AT unit may decide to attack the T-80 unit. But it may also decide to attack another LAV (Light-Armored Vehicle) unit instead. You have *NO* control over which enemies your units choose to attack. It's just like a tower defense game in which combats between turrets and their enemies are 100% decided by the AIs. The only thing you can control is the positioning of your combat units. Sounds boring then, doesn't it? Yes, after 22 hours of playtime, I'm already very bored of such over-simplistic gameplay.There's a unit command called ""Assault"", but it's just basically a *movement* order giving a combat unit better accuracy while it's on the move. It does *NOT* allow you to order the unit to target a specific enemy. Once the aforementioned unit reaches the final destination, it's up to the AI to determine which enemy to attack.I really wish there was an ""Attack / Target"" command for each combat unit in the game. Any enemy targeted by this command would be the top attack priority of my combat unit. If, for any reason (e.g., enemy having moved out of my unit's line-of-sight, or my unit's weapons unsuitable for attacking the enemy), the chosen enemy isn't a legitimate target anymore, the friendly AI will then decide which enemy should be the appropriate target. ALL of the RTS and TBS titles (from the classic Harpoon series to the recent Wargame series by Eugen Systems) have allowed the players to choose enemy targets and to formulate their own offensive strategies. Unfortunately, you can't devise your own offensive strategy in this game. Every attack move is decided by the AI. It's just 100% tower defense in nature.I don't understand...I'm supposed to play the commander's role in this game. Why ain't I allowed to order my combat units to attack specific enemy targets? This is just totally unrealistic at all.How would you feel if Xcom didn't give you any ability to order  your troopers to target any specific alien enemy? A game with zero tactical depth and variety.The second reason why FC:RS is a tower defense game is because the enemy AI is really stupid. They just charge at your units in a straight line without considering terrain effects and potential threats. If your unit is next to a forest and a plain tile, don't worry, the enemy AI would usually choose to move to the plain tile and attack you from there. Instead of using tanks, the AI opponent would sometimes use infantries, AAs (Anti-Air), ATs and even utility vehicles as the frontline units. This is just the same as the enemy AI in any tower defense game: advancing towards the player's turrets in a straight line without any strategy involved.2) Another shortcoming of FC:RS is the poor documentation of damage calculation. There're several types of damage in this game: AP, HEAT, Area and AD. However, neither the game manual nor the tutorial explains how damage is calculated when a unit successfully attacks / hits an enemy target. E.g., what's the formula for calculating the damage when a Challenger successfully hits a T-80? Is it [(AP+HEAT) / 2] - Armour Value? And what's the formula for calculating damage inflicted upon an infantry unit? Also, how about air units? Sorry, damage calculation is always a mystery in this game.3) My last complaint about FC:RS is that weapons' accuracy values are *NOT* displayed in-game. Yes, every weapon used by each combat unit has an accuracy value. However, when you open the unit information panels, you can never find the accuracy values. Based on the official forum's posts, you need to read a mod's guide called ""The Poor Mans Mod Guide"" to learn how to crack some game files in order to view the accuracy values. Seriously, why doesn't the developer just do all players a favour and have the accuracy values shown *in-game*? Without knowing the accuracy potential of my combat units, how can I formulate my assault strategy?Conclusion:Game score: 6 / 10To me, the severest issue of FC:RS is the lack of an ""Attack / Target"" command for the combat units. This basically turns this war game into a turn-based tower defense title. Players have to *blindly* follow the AI's attack decisions and this significantly undermines the tactical depth of the game. I've never written such a lengthy game review, but the gameplay mechanics of FC:RS are just very disappointing. A TBS game based on the cold war / modern warfare setting has always been my dream game. I think that's why I have so much to complain.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lastest update:Developer responsiveness: 10 / 10Several days after my review was posted, the developers of FC:RS provided me with some detailed updates on the changes and improvements they'll make for the next FC title (i.e., FC: Southern Storm). They actually discussed the issues mentioned in this review and they planned to implement significant changes to the next game engine (e.g., several new assault mechanics will be introduced to give players more control over their units' attack decisions). I really appreciate their responsiveness and consideration for the players. Also, they're bold enough to take constructive criticisms and think of new ideas to improve the game series further. The video game industry needs more developers like them who truly respect and listen to the players. I'd like to thank the developers Cap'n Darwin and Iron Mike Golf for taking their precious time to share their thoughts with me.PS: Please read the comment section for the developers' detailed replies and my responses. They're too long to be included in this review. If you're interested in the future development of the FC series, you shoud definitely read the developers' comments."

And all of it very good. From what I can see the units have the correct structure, and do what they had been stated at the time, and in previous books.The ability to make maps, and restructure units, formations and organizations is good.The supply system is great, it has many nice factors that I like. Fire support, and computer free movement of units is very nice.The Campaigns and Scenarios are about what you would expect. The representation of British, West Germany, and the US is nice.The lack of Warsaw Pack members is a little disappointing, then again in truth they are the same as Russian just older. In truth the east German troops had better training, and the Equipment was better maintained. This is more or the the case with the rest of the eastern forces with some better and some worse.What should be clear is that the US Weapons Had been dramatically underrated in just about all categories, as well as the post draft troops, and the Russian weapons Highly over rated in every way, added to the fact that Training was little more then how to point the pointy end, wear the uniform, and even those very few with maps could not read them.These things should have been corrected , and inputted into updates along with new maps, today's issues locations, forces, and potential real system of tomorrow (not the fake Soviet T-12/14 that is total BS).Some other detractors is the fact that so little has been invested in, and from helping uses make new maps, Campaigns and Scenarios, and these items from users. And those off things like that Battle of Bull Run etc.Yes you can use user modification, and they provide for that with an easy selection, but making the modifications is a real pain. WinMBT is much more easyer to do these things even in the free version. Flashpoint Campaigns Red Storm has a much better look, and a much nicer way to do modifications to current maps/Scenarios.Overall I give it a 3 ½ thumbs up out of a five, and that's a winning rating for anything now a days.I will point out that I am a former Army grunt, tanker, and MI trooper, have seen and or used many of these weapons.A great game with even better potential that does work!

The T-80s you face are usually easy to knock out but at times you get surprised when a company of T-80s, on the move, fire a bunch of ATGMs from four kilometers and knock out two M1A1s dug in, in 90% cover. The same applies to artillery and the AI russian artillery is really the hammer of God. It responds in seconds and eats dug in tanks and infantery as a snack. The russian helicopters are condensed evil which is nearly impossible to knock out of the sky with you SAMs. I´m also a bit surprised at how much better the M1A1 is compared to the T80 in all other aspects than the ATGM.As Russian you somehow seem to lose the chopper and artillery God mode and it isn´t unusual that your hinds get knocked down from stray shots from infantery. It´s more difficult to get your artillery to knock out the NATO tanks.Problems to both sides is the unclear priority of fire from your units. It isn´t on rare occasions you sit and scratch your head  and wonder why your tank platoon decides to fire on the two recon vehicles two and a half kilometers away instead of the two charging tank companies five hundred meters away who are in the open and clearly charging your dug in position. The same applies to your artillery if you use the staff controll.The most annoying glitch is when you have your units in screen mode. Your recon don´t move and your land units can screen right out in an open field, towards known enemies instead of moving in cover, away from the enemy. I´m not sure if soldiers in the eighties really were that suicidal or if it´s a programming thing.I would also like to be able to tell my recon units to stay hidden. In my army days recon units observed. In this game recon units, maybe two light APCs love to open fire on a company of T-80s rolling by. The result is obvious.Despite these issues I like the game. I can recommend it to everyone liking a tactical simulator in a military setting.

So for me there is a whole lot of reminiscing in the game.But apart from that you a great ""what if"". There seems to be a never-ending horde of Russian tanks and other vehicles, coming through somewhere, and you have to stop them. Every one of your own losses hurts - and the NATO concept in Germany does not allow you to yield any ground. It's do or die.If you are interested in war games and this period of time, this is a must buy.The one major con I have encountered so far is the victory condition calculations - they seem quite arbitrary to me. Going up against a major force I nearly stopped them cold. Turned out to be a 54% score -  a Contested Battle.

Do they have attack choppers? Where is the main tank force going to attach? How do I position my troops for optimum efficiency against the enemy? Did I cover my flanks?All those are questions that you as yourself each mission. And it's great. It makes you think, plan, consider multiple options and try to make do with what you have. Because another aspect that makes the game shine, is that it shows that nothing works perfectly in war. Comms will get broken, unit will panic or will be unable to fullfil orders and the whole situation will go south after several minutes. And that is how combat is. There is no hand holding here, no tactical tips in the briefing, you have what you have and try to make the best out of it. But even when the whole situation get completely out of control, your forces get decimated and you begin to doubt your judgment, sometimes, it still works out, you hold your positions, bruised and battered, but the enemy starts retreating. And this is the ultimate satisfaction in strategy games and in Flashpoin Campaigns, it's more rewarding than in anything else.If you like turn-bases, hes-based games, you need to get this. If you like realistic depiction of modern combat, you need to get this. If you like the late Cold War era strategy games, you need to get this.A solid 9/10. The best hex-based strategy ever created. Not flawless, but best one so far."

Perhaps it's the closest a wargame can come to the simulation of a chain of command with all its difficulties and delays (jammed radios, difficult communication etc.). [Edit: This sentence was written before I discovered Command Ops 2, which does it much better!]But I am not completely convinced of the way it's done. In my opinion the delays are too big. The orders I give need endlessly long to execute; it's often impossible to retreat before being overrun by the enemy, even if you see him coming a long time before. I don't know if it's realistic that a handful of tanks need half an hour or more after (!) receiving the order to begin driving a few hundred meters...And why does the unit loses its defensive/dug in-status immediately after receiving the order to move, although it has not yet begun to move?But apart from that, it's still a pretty good game. Just needs a little bit of fine tuning in my opinion."

The thing to remember about this game is that just like in real life, the commander doesn't have a Gods-eye view of everything. You get contact reports as they come  in, and acting on them on any larger level takes time. A platoon of Abrams will react to Soviet armor on its own, yes, but if you want to counterattack, depending on the situation, expect it to take a bit of time to get the basic plan worked out and orders passed down to the units involved. The game invisibly abstracts all of the fog and confusion that comes with modern  warfare, frankly, I think they did a pretty darn good job. This game seems to fill a void between a division-level game like Hearts of Iron 3, and a company-level game like the Combat Mission series (not on steam, but highly reccomended.).Basically, if you want a challenging game that gives you map-on-a-table awareness on a realistic delay that can brutally punish mistakes and reward skillful planning and execution, I'd definately look into it. If you're not sure about the hex based system, get it on sale. It's one of the few that covers this time period that even tries to be realistic."

,Recommended,330720,13128252,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,40s & Blunts,"Rating: A+This is a serious wargame. None of that fake crap that people like to call wargames but are really wussy arcade RTS chump simulators. Flashpoint Campaigns has hexes and counters and orders and turns. All of the classic components of something designed by and for true grognards.It is my first PC ""hardcore"" wargame, and after nearly a dozen hours, it's a pretty neat game. Most wargames and PC strategy games still focus around manouvre and ordering each of your units with razor-like accuracy, with each tank and squad and platoon responded to and executing your will without delay and without question. Flashpoint Campaigns isn't like that. It focuses on the hair-pulling, hypertension-inducing hell that is being helpless while you watch your men, each devoted to his nation and its cause (even if its cause is stupid) really trying their best to carry out your moronic plans only to be cut down at once by enemy fire. Confusion and lack of cohesian are the killers on this battlefield. Each turn you give orders and then click the button to play the turn out, where your guys, in accelerated time, spend the next 15 minutes to an hour on their own, trying their best to get things done. Only when the turn is up and the alotted time has passed are you allowed to give new orders and react to the situation. And the more chaotic things get and the more torn up and splintered your force gets, the longer the turn takes to playout before you can react with orders, meaning that you can end up giving orders every 40 minutes whil your opponent is able to give orders ever 15, which leads to very interesting, very asymmetrical and very unique gameplay. And if you play with the optional rule limiting the number of orders you can give per turn--something I recommend for increased realism and increased stress--things can only get more jacked up if you don't have a solid plan and the flexibility to ammend that plan when needed.There is a lot of Cold War tech to play with, and battles move extremely fast and are extremely bloody once contact is made. The graphics are clear and attractive and have a pretty striped-down, utilitarian feel to them, which works but if someone needs to actually _see_ a tank model to have a good time playing war, you might want to look elsewhere.The AI seems smart as hell, and you can go toe-to-toe with it across numerous individual scenarios and four separate campaigns where you keep your forces between battles. I haven't actually tried the campaigns yet, but I am excited at the prospect. I just want to hold off until I can go through a battle without getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me first."

If they beat me it is only because of their numbers not strategy.  Soviet force are like 5 to 1 to NATO and they just move through the main road to attack.  The soviet AI has no strategy at all.  They do hide in forest, town, and all just move down the main road.  I look like playing tower defence game than a war game.2.  There is not enough command varieties.  I need to control the direction of a tactical retreat.  I do not want my forces to retreat from forest to an open area (it always happen).  I want my troops to blow the bridge and move back.  Not stay on the same hex until end of my turn so I can give new command.   Just more details in unit control please.3.  Too many short form not explain in manual.  For example, what is RA, IL, NBC?  Can it be written in complete form so I do not need to browse the manual all the times and still cannot find it.  Or make the manual more complete.4.  Since there is a long delay before the troops response to my commands there is very little I can do when♥♥♥♥♥♥happens.  It become clear that the setup phase is over important while between turns there is not much you can do (even limit command function turn off).  It become like wild guessing game unless fog of war is turn off during the setup phase.  Like gambling.Other than that the game again is good.

Submitting orders and watching things play out is great, and the tension that builds from waiting for your next order cycle is palpable. Reading the manual, the level of detail in what is modeled and taken into account seems to be quite high, which is a good thing, though I at times I wish more information was relayed to the player (has the unit received the order? Is it still planning it's movement or is it stuck for some reason? etc).The use of hexes and unit-level control requirements is an obvious departure from Panther's Command Ops series, which remains one of my favorites on account of its superb AI, but these differences are what makes FCRS a worthy title to enjoy alongside Command Ops because it's not trying to directly compete in the same space.I haven't tried PBEM or PBEM++ yet, but anticipate that the turn based nature of the game may make it easier to maintain an ongoing game with someone than CommOps, whose realtime pausable system means both players need to be in the hotseat at the same time.All in all, I'm very impressed from what I've seen so far!"

But, compared to other wargames, it's not the nitty gritty details of mechanics or equipment that it focuses on simulating (yet it does both well), it's the communications and chaos of combat. This, combined with the WEGO turn system, provides some pretty spectacular and unique gameplay.Nothing is more nervewracking that pressing the ""start"" button after issuing what orders you can, always far too few, and hoping for the next sixteen minutes (or far, far longer) that nothing drastic happens. Nothing is more of a relief when your troops somehow work through you plan in ways you didn't expect and save the day. Nothing is more depressing that looking at a clock that states the next orders phase is over forty minutes away as T-80 tanks form up to punch through your forces.The turn-based system is based on the real military philosphy of the OODA loop. It models the chaos of military operations perfectly. This, combined with a smart AI (that tries to model how actual troops would behave, think dwarf fortress-esque) and a well crafted modelling of units, logistics and terrain, means for extremely solid gameplay, albeit with a high learning curve.I really wish more games used this system, it just feels right.Also, the game has play-by-email, something so small to write about, but really appreciated."

The game does good job presenting confusion of the battle field and inherit friction in chain of command. While Flashpoint Campaigns seems to be I-Go-You-Go - style of game, the battles are actually fought in sort of real time and paused when it's players turn to give orders. Electronic countermeasures and confusion in chain of command limit the amount of orders you can give in one go, so player needs to choose wisely and plan ahead. Every command generates radio traffic and if you don't keep HQ units on the move, opposing force's artillery will make a short work of them."
