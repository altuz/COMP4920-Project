,Recommended,330830,13082431,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Tetsujin,"It's not exactly Walking Dead, and it's not exactly Borderlands. But if you enjoy one or both of those, you should love this game. It still keeps in a lot of Borderlands elements (inventory, loot, humor, etc.), while still playing like the familiar Telltale point-and-click adventure.The first episode offers a lot (about 2 1/2 hours if you look around), and you're immediately latched to the characters. You know about everyone's motives about the second they show up, and know if you like them or not. The writing is still Borderlands-style, so you may get more for your mileage if you're familiar with the series, but it's very well done. It's not full of boner jokes (yet), but there's still the silly stuff in there. The game relies a bit more on the inventory like Sam & Max than Walking Dead (still no combining items again, though) ie. Fiona's character uses cash that can directly influence conversation, whereas Rhys's lets him scan things to let you learn more about the world, and sometimes find items. Which works well from being based on a game centered on loot.All-in-all -- it's humorous, well-writ, suspenseful, and most of all - good. If you're hesitant in any way, you could pick up on a sale, but as a fan of Telltale and Borderlands it was worth every dollar. And I'm sure even non-fans would enjoy the ride this game gives you."

,Recommended,330830,14803856,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Praxis-[CE],"I suppose that to the completely uninitiated, Tales from the Borderlands plays out like an action-comedy caper film set in unfamiliar surroundings, but to those who already love the Borderlands games, it feels a bit like coming home. I really love the way Telltale designed the opening sequence, menu screens, and opening credits in the style of the Borderlands games, so from the very start this is exactly how the game feels.The artwork from the Borderlands series is a great fit for the Telltale format, and allows the setting to blend seamlessly into the graphic novel-style artwork Telltale uses to render its stories. The music of Borderlands is pretty distinctive too, and the team did a fantastic job of incorporating that into the story as well (in the case of the episode one boss, quite literally).The story is very fast paced, with a lot of twists and turns and flashbacks. With two protagonists — a Hyperion corporate lackey and a Pandoran thief — you also quite literally get parts of the same story playing out a little differently from two perspectives. Narratively, it reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction with the perspective jumps, as well as the rapid-fire pacing and snappy dialogue.The action sequences are amazing (if not completely plausible) and really keep you engaged with the story. The dialogue is hilarious, and it was fun picking some of the wittier options and seeing how the scene played out. The voice acting is great too, though I did find it extremely odd at times to have conversations with some of Pandora's bandits and psychos.If you're the impatient type, you might want to wait until all the episodes come out before buying the season, as it looks like they're going to be spaced a few months apart. I plan to update my review as the episodes are released, but so far I really love the story and the characters. I can't wait to see ""cameo"" appearances by some of the other vault hunters and NPCs from the Borderlands games, and I also can't wait to see what happens with the new characters Tales From the Borderlands has introduced."

But I firgured since this review was getting more views I might as well redo this whole thing. So here it goes:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tales of the Borderlands is a choice-driven adventure game (in Telltale's signature format) in which you play as either Rhys, a Hyperion employee with big dreams and Finoa, a local con-woman ready to make her biggest con yet, taking place after the events of Borderlands 2.In the first episode Rhys's promotion and all chances of moving up in the company are ruined when a rival steps in and becomes his new boss. Rhys then comes up with a plan to get back at them by stealing the vault key, an alien aritfact capable of unlocking great wealth and power, which led to his rivals promotion from right under their nose. With the help of his two best friends, Vaughn and Yvette, he makes his way to possibly the most dangerous planet in the galaxy, Pandora. Meanwhile, Finoa in her home town of Hollow Point on Pandora is preparing for her greatest con yet. Helping her she has her sister Sasha and their mentor/foster father Felix. Events unfold and the two must work together to discover a treasure of epic proportions!People who have played any of Telltale's games will know what to expect in terms of gameplay. Small areas to navigate in which you look and interact with the enviroment with simple puzzles along with lots of cutscenes with many quick time events.Needless to say, the game's main focus is on it's storytelling which it does very well. People who have not had the pleasure of playing any of the first two Borderlands games might get lost in terms of the lore (as well as a few jokes) but it is not needed as the game does a good job on focusing more on the central premise of the story. People who are familar with the Borderlands games will enjoying getting to see Pandora from a whole different view point (rather than just running around shooting everything). There are plenty of humour to be found in the writing even if you are not a fan and action cutscenes that are throughly entertaining!So in summary: If you are fan of Telltale's adventure games then this is basically the same thing you are used only in a lighter setting and I highly recommend."

They might have reached mainstream success with drama but to me they're at their best when they do comedy. Tales from the Borderlands is the same kind of choice base narrative you're used from them but this time around you don't feel sick from the choices you made. I feel they did a nice job of capturing the spirit of Pandora while adding their own brand of more sophisticated humor.

TellTale hits the jackpot by continuing to dominate in their very own created genre. I haven't played the original Borderland games, but luckily you won't miss out if you haven't been to Pandora before. Just one suggestion from me, wait for all chapters to come out, then play it (otherwise by the time the next chapter comes out, you'll forget some minor details about the plot and you will miss out on story development).And when you play it, play the whole game in one go. Don't restart the chapters one by one to see how the story will go if you choose differently - you will be disappointed!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433465399http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=615069238Unlocked all achievements!"

If you are a fan of the Borderlands series because of how much stuff you could shoot, then don't bother looking in this direction. The amount of stuff you get to shoot is very limited, and while you do get to kill stuff, its not like in the three other games in the series.There is another note I must mention here. You MUST have played at least Borderlands and Borderlands 2 to understand this game. There are a lot of references to the two games, and they pretty much rest on the fact that you have played the two other games. So if you are just a fan of Telltalegames and enjoy their format of games, then this fits the same category, but ONLY if you have knowledge of the Borderlands series, and I mean proper knowledge, otherwise you are more than likely going to be complaining about not understand things.Last but not least, due to the fact this game was worked on by the proper creators of Borderlands, along with Telltalegames, they got things right. They got things awesome, killer funny kind of right. Which means, they got things Borderlands right."

I was skeptical of this game from the start ...""how would telltales style work with a FPS game like Borderlands?""Well.. they make it work!you play as two ""average"" characters on Pandora. Who are on one struggling adventure to earn money.The classic Borderlands 1 - 2 humour is there perfectly, and it never feels forced. I garuantee something will make you laugh.Ontop of that, telltale manages to go the extra mile to capture every little bit of borderlands. From the weapon selection menu thingies when they turn up in game, to the main menu and even the auto save icon. It all fluids perfectly and is amazing.I reccomend this from the bottom of my heart.EDIT For EPISODE 2: Episode 2 was a veerrrry long wait, but it was worth it. It's main focus seems to be character development. Vaughn will probably become a more likeable character for people who disliked him in the first episode, while your opinion on other characters may change. Including Jack who, for the most part seems very hard to judge in this game. The intro for episode 2 is one of my favourites I've ever seen for a borderlands game and telltale game in general, and also is one of my current favourite songs for the borderlands and telltale series of games..Longstory short: Full of alot of jokes, in-jokes and self-jokes that made episode 1 create and expands upon that for an awesome episode. Is a little less QTE heavy this time though, so keep that in mind"

Not only did the plot sit nicely as a side-story/sequel to the franchise plot, the two main protagonists - Rhys and Fiona, allowed player to explore unique perspectives from the ""evil"" Hyperion corporation and as a Pandora native.The game itself is humorous, filled with crazy moment that meld seemlessly into the crazy backdrop of Borderlands. The meeting of Rhys and Fiona for instance, which was re-told as recollections from Rhys and then Fiona perspectives, allow players to unfold the truth of the tale in a entertaining fashion, like how Pulp Fiction unfolded the the somewhat puzzling opening scene with Ringo and Yolanda, with the scene Jules (and bathroom-bound Vincent) in their ""transition"" period at the end of the movie.The confrontation scenes across all three epidsodes (thus far) were largely whimsical, befitting of protagonists. Yet, they are always filled with comedic moments or funny narratives that make these confrontation feel more like action sequence in a comedic movie. The final confrontation in episode 3 for instance featured some of the best moments - such as Fiona fending off two bounty hunters while hanging upside down and Rhys travelling at high speed on his legless loader bot, which felt like watching Charlie Chaplin or Indiana Jones in action.Entertainment aside, Tales from the Borderlands highlighted the innate problem with Telltale games. There isn't much gameplay to speak of, other than quick-time action. Most choices and exploration are pretty close to pointless, like how your choices and exploration wouldn't matter in any linear games (e.g. Final Fantasy, Left for Dead, etc.) other than to uncover easter eggs (alternative dialogue, narratives, skins etc.). Consequently, the game felt really short and unsatisfying, making the interval between episodic release more painful than usual. It's a blessing however, knowing that I could clear all three episodes in five fun-filled hours again before episode 4. Can't wait...For lovers of Borderlands, don't be despair with the absence of CL4P-TP. Tales is littered with other familiars like the vault hunters (Zer0, Brick, Mordecai and Athena) and NPCs (Scooter and Handsome Jack), not merely as fan-service, but were involved in pushing the story forward.Bottomline: Tales from the Borderlands is an excellent piece of work thus far (after three episodes), that should bring out a chuckle or two."

,Recommended,330830,18833122,"Posted: 2 November, 2015",all,Aussiedroid,"What immediately setsTales from the Borderlands (TftB)apart from its predecessors, is the fast paced & frequent action sequences. Much of the game feels like it is a rollercoaster ride, with the polish of a Hollywood blockbuster. It is evident from these sequences that Telltale have come a long way in creating ever more complex scenes to immerse the player.TftBis a tale of two. Uniquely, the narrative has introduced two protagonists, Rhys(the ‘company man’ but deep down good guy)& Fiona(the seasoned hustler/con artist). As you progress through the story, you frequently get to replay the same ‘scene’ from each of their perspectives. This is creatively woven together with an over-arching storyline & flashbacks. Although it does jump around quite a bit it remained easy to keep track due to the well-crafted story & dialog. I think it was a bold move from a story-telling perspective but this spin works surprisingly well.The chemistry between Rhys & Fiona makes for some great verbal jousting, often bickering like an old married couple arguing semantics with some witty banter. The jokes come thick & fast between all the characters interactions, many of which had me laughing so hard! The bro-tastic scene was terrific & some of the other embellishment ‘dream’ scenes were hilarious! It’s not only in the dialog that holds comedic value, but also in the physical comedy that ensues throughout, from the clever facial expressions to the crazy antics in the all-out action scenes.All of the characters introduced through the episodes were memorable, great personalities & well voice acted.Hugo Vasquezwas one of my favs, voiced by Patrick Warburton,(can’t help but seeing Vasquez as Joe Swanson's evil twin!)along with the ever-so-adorableGortys; it’s certainly not hard to become fond of the characters you encounter.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545959976I found myself with many ‘WOW’ moments like you see above, that just were begging for a screenshot to be taken! The world is saturated with colour & rich in detail, with many scenes(& camera angles)used providing something interesting or hidden to discover(if you look closely). I expect there is more Easter Eggs I didn’t even noticenotbeing a player of the originalBorderlands series. Rhys has cyborg implants to add another layer to what you can see in the world, which also introduces a number of other gameplay elements that I won’t spoil for you. :)My leisurely play though took around 10 hours for the 5 episodes with no real technical issues to report. I did see a couple of minor texture popping issues & the odd clipping issues but neither lasted long enough to detracted from the experience.Only two really minor improvement suggestions I have is thatTftB, unlike many games, does not pause the game when wireless controller loses connection or has dead batteries. With timing a big factor by design it would be nice if it was better supported for those that do not have a keyboard handy(Hail, to all the Couch Commanders!)to pause automatically so none of those precious seconds are lost.Secondly, there are scenes using a new, more ‘fighting style-esque’ multi direction responses. The response time of the game was slow when having to hit multiple directions or buttons, often resulting in having to hit them several times before they register.I did really enjoy the more complex fighting/action sequences overall; it felt at times like a 21st century version of aDragon’s LairorSpace Acegame! Just wish it was harder! After seeing what was accomplished in the action scenes here, I would love to see a pure action game from Telltale in the future with a stronger focus on timing & precision.My minor gripes aside, there is really is nothing to fault in this excellent action adventure game(So very glad I didn’t have to wait between episodes to complete this time). I enjoyed this one so much I played through the last 4 chapters in the same day.I didn’t want the rollercoaster to stop!I laughed, I had fun ..

I bought this game on the recommendation of a few online reviewers such as TotalBiscuit and was not expecting it to be my favorite of the Telltale games since The Walking Dead Season One. I absolutely love everything about the game from the top notch voice talent (newcomers Troy Baker, Nolan North, and Laura Bailey may just have great things ahead of them if they ever get discovered) to fantastic musical choices (no, it's not dubstep).The story starts fairly simple. A jerky company man named Rhys (you) and con woman Fiona (also you) work together and against each other for the prize of 10 million dollars. Obviously, it's not quite as simple as that, but all the twists and turns are the meat of the game and I won't spoil anything further. The writing is excellent and unlike Telltale's other three major franchises (Walking Dead, Fables, and Game of Thrones) it's heavy on humor despite being firmly targeted towards a mature audience.I honestly can't recommend this one enough. Even people who dislike Borderlands may enjoy it because the setting of Pandora is so interesting even when removed from the shoot and loot mechanics of the franchise."

I could go for another round to see a different situation.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it?YES.Almost 9400 hands up vs 80.A few words about this game? It's for me, their best game. Telltale Games, you really made an amazing game here.Do you have to play Borderlands or Borderlands 2 to enjoy this one? No, but it would be better, because it's the continuation of the story and you are launched into it.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923237806Graphics:The game, like it's brothers, has it's limitations, do not expect awesome animations or movements, because this is a point and click game. It's kind of a cartoon mixed with western plus futuristic ambience. As I always say, a picture really does paint a thousand words so... take a look into some screenshots or gameplay videos you can find around.Music:Really good. Besides the main ost, each chapter has it's own opening and ending song, from different authors and you gonna want to listen them over and over... so here you have a link to a web where you will be able to do it.https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/3pmfbn/tales_from_the_borderlands_soundtrack/http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=926905639Story:Ok, I'm not sure where to start or what to tell... I think that if you don't know anything about the story, it would be the best for you but if you insist...There are 5 chapters (standart for Telltale Games) but each one of those chapters are really superb. This is the first time I have wanted to repeat them to see another choice. You will start being kidnaped and the story will be you telling your past to your kidnaper, a really misterious man hiding behind a mask.For real, this is the BEST part of the game and the ending is really EPIC. If you are reading this and you play it.. you will remember my words, for sure.Gameplay:It's a point and click game. Well yes, you can use a gamepad and you will walk and run with keys but the essence is that, a point and click game with 3rd person view. The hilarious part of the game is that you will see objets to read the description from the point of view of the character you are playing at the moment. In action moments, you have to use movements and press keys in order to do the correct movement. If you fail you eventualy die.Negative point:Well, it's a Telltale Game. You have the ""fake"" feeling that your choices really change the ending. In this case, you change some minor things and at the end your decisions do really change things, because it could be that you won't get .... ok, I can't do spoilers but yes... in this game Telltale really did their best to give us options.After finish this game I have the uncontrollable wish to play Borderland and Borderlands 2... so I presume that a subliminal and malicious code has to be inside the game to force us to go for a crazy run into Pandora as Vault Hunters!!!

A few really exciting scenes, but a couple of annoying quicktime events (Like every episodic game).Episode 2: A few new characters are introduced, including Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2. He turns out to be one of the funnier parts of this episode and also one of the more important choices you have to make involves him. Overall, not quite as good as Ep.1, but still very good and funny.Episode 3: The best episode yet. By far the most action and most character development out of any episode. You begin to see certain relationships take turns you'd never thought of at first and probably the best character in the whole game ""Gortys"" is introduced. It ends at quite an intense spot and I can't wait to see where it goes next.Episode 4: Probably the funniest episode in the entire game so far. A lot more of Gortys which is a good thing, and a crazy cliffhanger. Not quite as good as Episode 3, but still really good and probably my second favourite.UPDATE:Episode 5: The final episode in this series has just decided it... Tales From The Borderlands is my favourite game of 2015 which is impressive considering how much i love Fallout. I never expected for such a funny game, that I would become so attached to these characters and I really am sad that it's over.

The Borderlands of Pandora were told to contain mysterious alien treasure troves filled with advanced technology and incredible power. Vaults, the people called them... and to seek one out was to earn you the title of Vault Hunter... at least by me. You could say Handsome Jack was one such explorer, though his methods could be seen as... somewhat unsporting. He ran the corporation Hyperion... and died trying to claim Pandora as his own. History's attention is fickle, my friends. It will remember those pirates like Handsome Jack but forget the adventurers who risk it all for less... ah, obvious rewards. Stories - legends - those are much better at getting at the real spirit of things. Stories remember both sides of the tale.'Marcos the opening of Tales from the borderlandsWho can forget the first they played Borderlands, a desolate, post apocalyptic landscape filled with uniquely interesting characters, humorous dialog, and more loot than you could shake a stick at.  I remember going on my first mission.  Stepping off the bus driven by our favorite arms dealer Marcus Kincaid, running into CL4P-TP better known as Claptrap and a few minutes later we're knee deep in bullets, psycho's wanting to use us as a meat bicycle, and a budding adventure.  Who would have guessed our first amazing adventure through Pandora would spawn a sequel and a prequel even an MMO.. (short lived and restricted to Russia but a Borderlands game none the less)  Any Borderlands fan is foaming at the mouth just waiting to soak up more Borderlands content, come on gearbox why must you make us suffer... well to ease our pain slightly Gearbox partnered up with Telltale games to create a masterpiece in story telling.  The combined effort of Telltales amazing story telling and easy game-play, fused with Gearbox's hilarious one liners, make for a gamers dream come true known as Tales from the Borderlands..The GameplayMy review will contain some spoilers for Borderlands 2 and the Prequel, just be forewarned!!!!!I'm serious, don't keep reading if you don't want those games ruined for you!!!!!Last chance!!!!  CATCH-A-RIDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEThe StoryTales from the borderlands picks up after the events of Borderlands 2, Handsome Jack is dead, and Hyperion is going through some changes.  You start the game as Rhy's,  a Hyperion middle manager, on his way towards getting a well earned and deserved promotion.  Together with his friend Vaughn the pair jovially joke about what Rhy's will do now that Rhy's will be in a position of power..  Upon reaching the bosses office and heading inside, a strange and disappointing thing happens..  The boss is dead, and a man known as Vasquez has been promoted...   BAD NEWS, since Vasquez is not a fan of Rhy's, in fact the two can't stand each other, it's not long before Vasquez informs Rhy's that his promotion will still happen, but it's not what he expected... Instead Rhy's is ""promoted"" ahem ""demoted"" to vice janitor..   After Vasquez informs Rhy's of this terrible news Vasquez receives a call which will change everyone's lives forever.  A vault key (Borderland fans will know just how valuable and important vault keys are... if you aren't a fan of borderlands, just know it's pretty friggin important..)  is being offered for 10 million dollars, hearing this information Rhy's knows what he needs to do almost immediately and sets out on his adventure to steal the vault key, undermine Vasquez and gain the power he knows he rightfully deserves..   Although for any of that to work Rhy's needs to enlist the help of his two best friends, Vaughn and Yvette.  The grand adventure is about to begin.GameplayTales offers you the chance to play two different stories, Rhy's the above mentioned Hyperion stooge, and Fiona the con-women, the game will fluctuate between these two perspectives fairly often and sometimes while the both of them are on screen at the same time, paying attention to the dialogue choices is very important as occasionally you'll be playing one of the characters but have to choose what the other will say.  The Telltale experience has remained fairly similar across every game they've released since The Walking Dead, Tales is no different, a point and click interface interlaced with the ability to move your character around, interact with various objects and talk with teammates.  If you've played one Telltale game you've played them all, the one aspect which sets them apart are the stories, of which Tales tells a very compelling story.   The puzzles aren't very difficult, and most of the action takes place in the form of quick time events.  Typical fair for Telltale games.Pro'sGearbox humorFamiliar charactersFamiliar settingsBest Telltale story since The Walking Dead season 1Fairly lengthy episodes, compared to recent TellTale releasesCon'sVarious issues with saving choices which are present in every Telltale gameIssues with button registration on QTE events..RecommendationIn order to enjoy Tales from the Borderlands, a person doesn't need to have played any of the Borderlands games to enjoy the content, but with that said, if you've never played any of the games you'll totally miss a ton of the inside jokes and many of the best moments may be lost because you simply don't have the backstory necessary to full grasp what's going on.  As for whether or not I'd recommend the game, I'll say that I highly recommend Tales.  For fans of Borderlands it's a must have, amazing story driven game play,  a continuation of the Borderlands storyline.  The game is officially licensed by Gearbox so it's canon and moves alone the story, setting the gamer up for the third game which should come soon.So you're not a fan of Borderlands the games, then I'd ask if you enjoy Telltale games, even without having played any of the original games, you can still enjoy the game, it's Telltale at it's finest, great robust story, amazing voice acting, and graphics which are awesome.. Lets not forget the music, as TellTale games always manages to fit three or four amazing songs in each season of their game.  So if you like Telltale games, you'll love this one.. You should pick it up now without fail, the sooner you get it, the sooner you'll be able to hop back on Pandora and kick some bandit butt..."

The complete season is already available since the last episode was released a month ago. As the name implies, the events of this game occur in the universe of the Borderlands series, being chronological situated after Borderlands 2 events. In it you take control of not one, but two highly charismatic characters - Rhys and Fiona - embarking in an adventure filled with humor, living up to this acclaimed series.This game uses the same winning formula of the last games released by Telltale. As such, this is a game focused on the story, so there is not much to discuss gameplay-wise. The game mechanics are very identical to the rest of Telltale games, with several dialogue choices that influence the story. At first it will seem that the different choices will all have the same outcome, but at the end they will actually have a special meaning, something that I liked a lot. Quick-Time Events (QTEs) are once more present, working like a charm in the action sections, but it still feels like its little in terms of gameplay. Its also important to refer the addiction of two pretty interesting new mechanics. The first one is Fiona being able to loot money. With that money you can buy many customization items, as in the other games of this series. Playing as Rhys, you have a Cybernetic Eye which allows you to analyze several objects, providing lots of laughs since those objects have delicious descriptions. Obviously this is an extremely linear game, but it has some exploration sections once in a while, being extremely limited though.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543022481In the games made by Telltale, the story its the most important aspect to me and in this game they really nailed it. When I first heard about this game I though it would be a simple cash-in using the name of the Borderlands series. However, it ended being a really good surprise. The characters are excellent and the chemistry between some of them almost achieves perfection. Besides the characters made by Telltale, there are some familiar faces from the previous games who fit like a charm in the story, like Zer0, Brick and Mordecai for example. The comedy in this game is another of its strong points. Few games will give you as many laughs as this one. Most of the dialogs are very well done and overall the story is very good, with some great twists and a pretty good ending too. Although focusing on comedy, the game has its share of dramatic sequences too, with an exceptional balance between comedy and drama.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539736177In terms of visuals, this game has the distinctive cel-shading of the Borderlands series, which does the job like a charm in this game. The majority of the animations look good but some of the characters body movements still leave much to desire. The performance is also great since the graphical resources of this game are not ""heavy"" at all, so you will not have problems running this game.Longevity wise, it is pretty good for a game like this. I took about 9 hours to complete, while being completety stuck to the screen every time I played because of how good this game is (lots of moments of pure action).In the sound department, another win. The soundtrack is amazing! It complements this universe in a perfect way. Something that I liked a lot were the opening credits of each episode, all with different songs in it, being all absolutely awesome! The voice acting is also out of this world. An impressive cast that has great names like Troy Baker (Rhys), Laura Bailey (Fiona), Nolan North (August) and Ashley Johnson (Gortys). Patrick Warburton, best known for giving voice to Joe Swanson in the Tv Show ""Family Guy"" is also present in the game, giving voice to the character Hugo Vasquez.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=541188831SummaryPros:F***ing hilarious!Many scenes of pure action and adrenalineCharacters who you care forExcellent use of the Borderlands universeSpectacular job in the sound departmentCons:Once more, QTEs dominate the gameplaySome animations are a bit datedMy personal score:9.0/10Few games are funnier than this one! With frenetic action, awesome characters, exceptional soundtrack and voice acting and a great story, this game puts the standard for comedy games in a very high level. A must-have for those who want to laugh like a crazy man and recommended not only for those who played a game from the Borderlands series, as for those who never played.----------------------------Análise em Português no siteeyeoctane.org/ Portuguese Review ineyeoctane.org:http://www.eyeoctane.org/analise-tales-from-the-borderlands/"

Another great installment from the developer we know and love Telltale Games. But don't let the title fool you. This is not your regular Borderlands game; It just have the title, humor, and the backstory of the franchise. It's a brand new game with a completely different genre and story taking place in a completely different universe story-wise. A game by Telltale Games is a point-and-click adventure game designed to be enjoyed with a enthralling single player story and character development. A dialogue driven story where your choices have enormous consequences. One thing I can assure you is that Gearbox has no influence over Telltale Games and make games in such different ways that it's not even humanly possible to try to compare the two. In my personal opinion, I suspect that Telltale Games will do something brilliant with the title that Gearbox has not yet succeeded and thus far with Zer0 Sum the odds are really good. They can take any title and story and turn it into a game with extremely satisfying results.I didn't buy this game because it is titled Borderlands - I got it because it is labeled Telltale Games. So should you buy Tales from the Borderlands? Borderlands fan or not I guarantee you it will be worth every penny. I've never been much for Borderlands and never really had the time to play the predecessors, but I had the time of my life the two hours the first episode lasted. It is a standalone experience from Borderlands as we know it."

In this case, nothing, in fact it turned out better than everyone expected. A story in the Borderlands setting, matching the tone and expanding on the lore, this game is one that stands out for many, even those who aren't big fans of the point&click. A narrative like the one in Tales from the Borderlands is not one you could find in most games. It dares to be original, it dares to be humorous no matter what and it dares to change to a darker tone in key moments. Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll stare, most times you'll be relaxed. This game consists of 5 entertaining episodes, which tell a story in a fair pace.Looking at the game-play mechanics, it follows the TellTale formula: lines of dialogue with limited time to choose, walking, pointing&clicking and the QTE's. Doesn't sound like anything special, but it's in those moments you realize how charming the game is. QTE's consist of awesome and often times humorous moments, dialogue choices are comprehensive and they can even extend to being choices of how you approach things, which garner different reaction for the rest of the game.I'd like to say graphics are ageless due to their art-style, but while characters scale nicely with the resolution, there are some low texture environments, however their blended well with the rest(most of the time it's either rocky grounds or a wall with high quality posters). There are plenty of breathtaking views on the way, but personally I was too focused on the story to take my time. There are options to click for better views on certain things, which also come with one liners from the current protagonist.Where the game truly shines is the story. 4 and a half of the episodes are narrated by the protagonists, which sometimes can lead to hyperbolous situations, quickly interrupted however. There are two protagonist, Rhys ""The Salary Man"" and Fiona ""The Con Artist"". The former works on Hyperion, dreaming day and night about owning the place and the latter is pulling a big score. The build up is quick, as halfway through the first episode, they cross paths and so does the story begin.  Having certain characters from past video games with the same old Borderlands end game of hunting for a vault and a narrative that was seriously worked on to not be serious, you have yourself a fine taste comedy that's blended in with a survival motif, obvious character development, that all leads to the sensation of completing a game you've enjoyed. The cast of characters is pretty extensive, from the young and ""cutely"" innocent to killers that looks like their inside rot is growing to the outside, just like you'd expect in Borderlands.  In direct proportionality with the character development, the tone gets darker, reaching the pinnacle in the last episode, where even the intro is different. However, in the second half, they get back to a more lighter tone since the gang is back together, however it's not the comedy it was before, as they face the grand threat, which as a substitute for the funny lines it had motivational ones and awesome moments, balancing the first half in order to maintain the more light-heartet tone of the series.  I won't give spoilers, but here are a few lines from the end which best describe the narrative:""What a roller-coaster of emotions!"" ""It was intense!"" ""Man if it wasn't for the smell of rotting carcass, this hug would be perfect!"" ""OK, that's more like it, I was worried for a second that it would be one of those sad stories that you'd have to pull some depressing meaning out of. No thank you!""Those lines are on point. Don't judge the writing though, it's just a casual moment.One thing to add is that you don't need to have played any of the previous Borderlands games. While I imagine old fans would have their thrills seeing some of the NPCs and Vault Hunters in the story, new comers will have the right introductions to said characters, if not better ones.If you want to have a good time, find out how loud you can laugh and expand your list of fictional characters you'll never forget, you can pick this game up. Full price, on sale that's up to you really. It's worth both and note, there won't be any future seasons, but it might be the game you'll replay once in a while, just out of pure enjoyment."

As with other Telltale games, this is not a focus on gameplay, but rather an interactive story.This game at the time when I played it last year was just what I needed. It's a game that pulls you along a story and mostly tries to make you feel like you're still part of that story while playing as the two main characters, but this is a more hands-off game than the average video game. If you've played other games from this developer, you already understand entirely.The new cast fits pretty well inside of the Borderlands universe, especially the main characters who combine the standard Borderlands wackeyness with a sly frenemy plot. The universe is used well here, both for the serious lore and backstory, but also when the game just wants to have fun and do ridiculous and hilarious-but-!@#$ed-up things (sometimes at the same time). It thematically fits well within the style set by Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel.The plot itself doesn't revolve around something off-to-the-side either; it detirmines the fate of a lot of central and prominent parts in the Borderlands universe, especially relating to 2 and Pre-Sequel (with much of the cast from both returning in cameos). Quite a few outcomes for quite a few big things are settled with the two protagonists right at the center, and the characters themselves develop in a nice and sufficient way during these events (you know, the standard ""we're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to each other but now we're less♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to each other"" ordeal of plot - it's presented well here though!)There are different choices to make, different eyeballs to scoop out with a fork, and different elemental ammo types to fire out of your cologne bottle-sized pistol. There's quicktime events too, which can be an upside or a downside depending on who you ask. Personally I thought that even though it's its own narrative and that's the focus, it does a good job of making you feel like you're still part of it and inside of it, which is a step up from a movie.Either if you like the Borderlands universe a lot, or just want something with a good story to get engrossed in the characters and take your mind off of things (or both, like me) then this is a really good title to pick up!"

I felt like I had a lot more control over my choices than in the first one. Once again, the characters from previous games (Athena, Scooter, Springs, and Handsome Jack) all felt really natural- and I feel like they were used decently well.

One thing I do not like (but this goes for TellTale Games in general) is that it is episodic and by that I mean we have to wait for the other episodes to come out, I know they want to release the game now and have the people have fun with it now but I would rather play all 5 episodes now then one now and another in 3-4 months.The story is fun and the game is very funny, I saw myself laughing quite a few times during the game while I was playing.Now other then what I said at the first paragraph these are my problems with the game:First off they say that your choice matters, however the game starts with the whole ""This is the future and they are just retelling the past"" kind of plot, meaning that no matter what you say/do you are going to end up at that part, and while sure people prefere having one destination and would rather pick how they get there, at least keep it a suprise guys. Second off some of the choices I felt really had no impact, while minor ones I can understand there were some that felt major that in the end didnt actually mean much.The game is great if your looking for a story if your a fan of shooting dont get this game, if your a fan of Borderlands I recommend you get it, it is fun and charming even if it has flaws in areas.8/10"
,Recommended,330830,28810375,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Biscuitkzh,"After a long time spent simply being fascinated by the ""Make your own choices"" kind of games and dying to try one, I finally got the chance to put my hands on this tiny jewel.Ever since The Walking Dead episodes came out years ago, I've always been interested in the Telltale Games, and I was very happy to experience Tales From The Borderlands to give these guys' products a shot.With tons of hours under my belt spent on every Borderlands game, with mostly all the DLC's and whatnot, my expectations were quite high. And in complete honesty, I was not disappointed.Tales From The Borderlands truly has pretty much all those elements that might have made you fall in love with the original franchise.Same ol' sense of humour, puns, priceless dialogues, unforgettable characters, those amazing Pandora skies, tiny psychos, ferocious skags, and a main quest that keeps getting delayed because, ya know, the bad guys never sleep.We all know how it works when they try to make something new out of an existing game. We're always expecting the tragic result around the corner. (With good reasons, usually)But not this time. Not with this game. Not once throughout the whole experience you will stop and think ""Man, they just milkin it"". Tales From The Borderlands is plain and simple a pleasant and welcomed addition to the Borderlands universe we've presumably already been part of.The new characters, together with their stories and their backgrounds, are all quite charming. Whether they're the heroes or the enemies, in a way or another they're gonna hit somewhere there right in your feelings.The plot is quite in the classic Borderlands style. There's some clichés, but it's overall enjoyable and interesting. Although some parts of the story are going to be decided by what the player wants, the game doesn't lack surprise elements and unexpected events, which keeps it captivating and riveting, and always leaves you wanting to know more.As for the soundtrack, needless to say it's a real treat for those who have played Borderlands before. A huge part of the game features the same musics and themes as the original one. A fight sequence against bandits with music from Borderlands 2 in the backgroud? Sign me the F up.So, if you're looking at a Telltale Games series, you probably already have a general idea of what the gameplay is like. Obviously the cool thing about this kinda game, is that you get to make choices. Whether it's just a badass cool line you want your character to say, or a life-or-death decision, it's all in your hands. This means that it's not your regular videogame, but rather a movie-ish, interactive experience. In fact, there is quite a few quick time events that will require your attention at several points as well. And you should probably keep your fingers ready because in some occasions these QTE can become pretty tense, and pressing the right keys at the right time might just become a slightly more articulated process than you would expect from this kind of game.Generally speaking, this game is like icing on the cake for the Borderlands veterans. So many of the features just bring you back to your old, dear Pandora. The attention that was put into the details is just astonishing. Crates open with that same exact sound effect you'd hear when you looked for loot in your games, the characters use the same items you'd pick up and shoot with the same guns you'd find lying around after a fight, just to mention a few.These things and many more, which a real Vault Hunter will surely notice, truly take you back to the atmosphere you've loved and experienced with the original Borderlands games, just this time you're going on a new adventure.The one thing I have to criticise, is the impossibility to change language. Unless you're ready to change your whole system default language, you're going to have every dialogue in English, while all the rest that's written anywhere in the game is gonna be in the language that is set on your computer.Because of the dialogues being in English anyway, you still get to have a pretty cool experience with the game. But I personally believe that in the translation a lot of meaning and side concepts get lost or left behind, which is pretty sad.Despite this, frankly I can't say that the game loses any particular value. A bit of an annoyance, but it's still completely worth it.Hopefully Telltale Games will repent and fix the mistake for the next series.If you've played the Borderlands games over and over, and you miss that unique world, this game is your chance to jump back into everything you've loved before, from a new and enjoyable point of view.I could go on, but I won't. But I could.Have fun, kiddos."

Eventually, I snagged this on an impulse-buy during a sale and had it backlogged for a while, until for some odd reason I decided to pick this back up purely from boredom.I expected the worst... and my god, was I wrong.  They did a brilliant job here and this is unquestionably one of Telltales best.  They actually made the Borderlands universe far more compelling and interesting then I'd ever have guessed.  Not to mention the fantastic job they did on the characters, along with great cameos that don't feel in any way forced or fan-servicey.  The story is simply epic, and the writing was genuinely very well done with maybe only a couple moments of sappyness (apparently, the lead writer of BL2 only had a minor role here).As long as you enjoy Telltale games in general, you simply can't go wrong with getting this."

Telltale transforms it to a narrative driven, episodic point-and-click adventure.I was never fan of the game series before. But Telltale converted me with their terrific writing of characters and dialogue. World of Pandora has never been this interesting and fun! The story itself, isn't that remarkable. It's told by two characters, both controlled by the player. What shines in the writing is the hilarious dialogue. Characters have great personalities and are very memorable. Some characters are new and others have been introduced earlier in the series. Besides some familiar characters, there are other nods to the games too.This is the best looking game by Telltale so far and It's also faithul to the style of Gearbox's games. Every episode has an awesome intro sequence that sets the mood for the game, it's accompanied by a great soundtrack. None of the five episodes felt filler at all and the last episode especially holds up. You get to see how your choices mattered and the familiar quick time events bring on a twist almost like Street Fighter style.Tales from the Borderlands is a welcomed change of pace for Telltale, their other recent games have all been so dark and gritty. This takes them back to the tone of Monkey Island and Sam and Max games. But no puzzle solving this time either.[Score: 89]"

Voice acting is superb. Writing is good as well.Unlike in other TT Games, here we play as two characters, who tell the same story. That creates a funny situations where actions of one character affect the events when it comes for the other character to tell his or her part, or when one of our characters lying and we hear ""the truth"" from the other character.Took me about 2,5 hours to complete the first episode, so figure. I would say ~15 hours tops when it all comes out.Crappy Borderlands textures - check.Strange for a TT game, but there's no puzzles. At all.

Maybe it will change in the second episode, but they did such a good job of simple QTEs, that I'm not worried even if there's not gonna be any puzzles ahead.

Through genuinely witty and funny dialogue, they manage to make every character endearing and likeable in their own flawed way. Even the robot characters have far more personality than the vast majority of characters found in other video games! They take existing well-loved characters in the Borderlands universe (such as Handsome Jack, Athena and Scooter) and build them up with far more depth than they had in the main games in the series. And the original characters are just as well-formed (with the likes of Gortys, Loader Bot, Fiona, Sasha, Rhys, Vaughn, Vasquez etc.) all earning their place as some of my favourite fictional characters of all time - not just those found in video games. The story balances light-hearted moments of comic relief with scenes of great emotional weight expertly. A single scene can manage to elicit laugh-out-loud moments and at the same time watery eyes - and it all blends so well. The characters are not only incredibly well-realised (bravo to the talented voice actors, writers and animators) but also enjoy meaningful character development that drives the plot forward throughout the tale. All of this is aided by an amazing collection of licensed songs, that make each opening credits scene a pure joy to experience (in tandem with their brilliant choreography that fits the music so well).Tales from the Borderlands earns its place as my new favourite amongst TellTale's portfolio (I never thought The Walking Dead seasons could be topped).

When you hear the opening/ending song of each Episode, you'll never stop singing them ( Episode 4's To the Top is the best!) The rest of the music is very good too, even some battle themes from Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel come back.The gameplay is very simple, it's just some walking, point-and-clicking and quick-timing but it fits the overall calm atmosphere of the game (compared to other Borderlands games) and the story, since Rhys and Fiona aren't badass Vault Hunters, they can't enter into some place guns blazing, it just wouldn't make sense.Graphics are the same as the other Borderlands game, cel-shading with not very high textures and it's very cool.Replayability is also a thing, with a ton of choices to make, you're bound to give the game another try in order to see the different outcomes (just don't expect plot changing decisions, most of them are medium to small changes)Overall the game is one of the best experiences you'll get from a modern story-driven videogame with a rich story and memorable characters. I give it a 10/10PS: The only con that I can find is that you can't ship Rhys and Fiona! The game only allows you to ship Rhys and Sasha, which sucks! Sasha should be with August and Fiona with Rhys!! Sorry for my rant... :)"

The first Borderlands game really had no appeal to me. I liked the silliness and the off-the-wall humor, but the lack of a story made the game absolutely uninteresting to me. Borderlands 2 was a decent game, the mechanics were solid and there was a storyline that I could get a little invested in, but for several reasons I just could never bring myself to fully finishing the game. It's not that there is anything inherently wrong with the game that I can point out, it just didn't really ""do it"" for me.That being said, I think that Tales from the Borderlands is what the Borderlands series should have always been. With a focus on dark humor and story, I find myself much more involved in the game as well as appreciating the brand of humor that helped to make the original games so popular. TTG did a wonderful job capturing the spirit of the original FPS's, while at the same time making the story their own.If you like the other TTG products, I would say this game is for you, but you probably already knew that. For everyone who has never bought a TTG game, I would say that Tales from the Borderlands is incredibly worth it. If you were to buy any game they've made, this should be the one. As with all of their games, replay value is incredibly high, and for only 25 dollars, less than half the cost of larger-profile games, you will get the same if not more enjoyment.I've already played the first chapter through 3 times, and I can't wait to see where the next chapters take us."

While it's likely mostly linear in the major points (not that I've done multiple playthroughs with different decisions to see how much things *can* vary) -- it is rather well done, making sense in a bizarre setting full of funny nonsense and with a cast of interesting characters.  There's humor, tension, and quite a bit of tenderness, blended together in a way that simply *just works*.I certainly would look forward to seeing Fiona and Rhys once more, heh.In terms of gameplay, it's the expected combination of occasional walk-around-and-examine bits of old-school adventure games, timed dialogue (enough time to scan the options and pick how you think the character would choose , but you generally shouldn't over-analyze), and quick-time event sequences for action.  The QTEs tend to be pretty generous and you don't need the reflexes and precision of a fighting-game expert.I did experiment with using the Steam Controller for a bit, but went back to mouse/keyboard as some of the action sequences do benefit from being able to accurately and quickly move the cursor to particular places, and I don't have a lot of practice using game controllers."

And now, where to begin...Tales from the borderlands is a great story for fans of the telltale and/or borderlands games,its plot fits right in with the whole borderlands series, it's GREAT.Sadly I can't tell you much about the story because that would spoil the entire plot, which is the best part of the game.So no more of that.What I CAN tell you is that the game takes place after the events of borderlands 2 so if you're interested about more of that I definfately think you should give this a try.Even though the gameplay side of TftB is mostly point-and-click adventure with some quick time events thrown in, the large amount of choices and how they effect the story is a definately a huge part of the experience and I'm sure to replay it again just to see what happens with all the other options.The amount of time you need to finish the game is about 10 hours SO you may think its not worth the money, that's up to you, but I think it's definitely got the replay value so you should keep that in mind.I give this game an 8\10 and I would definitely play it againThank you for reading this and I hope it helps."

(the timer is innacurate, I was on pause for way too long haha.)Pros:-Game is funny as hell-The choices are personalized-You get attached to the characters.-Borderland feeling is there for sure.- :Dzero.Cons:-Controls sometimes are not as responsive as I would like.-mashing buttons never been fun and never will.-Looking around is limit useless. Just go on with the story. But this is only for the first part I guess.-Short. I completed this first part in nearly 1 hours. I suggest to pick this on sale as it does not worth 30$ for part of a game. Seriously.All in all, the game is really amazing. I love borderland and this is just a perfect sequel. Maybe I would suggest to play with a remote. The mouse pointer can turn invisible sometimes making quick decisions complicated.Can't wait to play all the chapters straight.10/10 is hype as ♥♥♥♥!//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Update 1:Episode 2 was cool. We learn more about the story. We feel the weight of our actions from season 1.""Kiss the sky"" is one my new favorite songs.Lot of places to explore with little reward. Still, a lot of plot twist.it was okay. I devoured it so I guess it was pretty good.9/10Story is very confusing. Interesting but confusing...//////////////////////////////////Update 3:Ok now I am on the middle line.Half of me loved some new twist to the game, the other half is very desappointed.Pro:-Precedents items are FINALLY useful. (Inventory is still useless to look at tho...)-A bit more dynamic. Gives you more shooting occasions.-A person DIE (The ones who played knows)-Making you regret certain choices because you feel like betraying someone.Cons (and there is more than pros....)-That's it? Was that any kind of devloppement to the story?-New characters? Yay. Would be nice if they had more personality.-What are those glitches? Frame skips, texture lag, scenery which loses focus. Lot and lot of rough rendering.-I laughed once. Thanks little robot.-You have 3 choices, each of them leadinga t the same place. Do we still have any impact on the story?There was a few moments where you have to do something... but doing nothing is not an option. You will simply remain there indefinetly. Waiting. Expecting a second choice.>Press the button. (But it looks suspicious...) Look around... no other options... WHY DID I HAVE THE OPTION IN THE FIRST PLACE? MAKE IT PART OF THE ANIMATED SCENE!-I just feel like I watched a long cutscene where I had to press buttons sometimes.-Still have the button mashing problem. Why so many button mashing occasions? It's not fun.conclusion of chapter 3:We can notice a few improvements. Sadly, these improvements are buried under many more little problems. I did not enjoy the time spent on this chapter as much as on the other ones. The decisions have no impact on the game. Which basically kills the idea behind this kind of game.6/10cute cutscene.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4.I know I skipped one chapter because I felt I would have bashed it way too much. I was not happy.As for chapter 5. I feel like I played a whole new game. so...let's go with pro and cons.Pros:-Neon Genesis Evangelion simulator 2015-FINGER GUNS pew pew pew pew-Choose a team of elites (or not)-some good story devloppement ...I guess.-Fuuuu♥♥♥♥♥♥is dead.-epic loot.Cons:-Might as well make a movie. Choices are still limit useless. Not much impact beside some details that you might not care about at all. A lot of situations you are given control and yet.... you wonder what was it for? Did you really need to do that single clic?could it not be part of the video (same as chapter 3.)-This could have been a whole different game. New characters. new gameplay. I wouldn'T have seen the difference.-Weird loopholes. Characters desapears and appears back again later. No reason given. Moments you can swear something tragic happens and yet... nothing too bad as the character comes back pretty well. (Sasha mostly and Athena)-It feels as if they rushed so many parts of the story. I know they had a short window to come up with the chapters (people urged for the chapters to come faster). They got what they asked for. Unfinished material. Plenty plot holes and the finale is out without much explanations.I give chapter 4-5 together a mark of 6/10SOOOIn conclusion.Yes I still recommand this game. I recommand it only to borderland players. The whole game is filled with insides about borderland games. You'd miss half the jokes without some knowledge of the lore.Idon't recommand it if you follow telltales games only. This is probably one of their worst if not the worst.It really makes me sad since it was the one I anticipated the most.it began as something I was so hyped about. I was so happy about a sequel of borderland that felt different and yet, this anticipation has never been met.I give the whole set a 7/10too much water. No but seriously. This game could have been better. Pay for it in sale. Get it and play all episodes straight. Don't expect anything spectacular. Just enjoy the ride while it last."

,Recommended,330830,13511957,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,Tundra Scorpion,"When I heard Telltale was making one of their episodic installment point and click adventures based off Borderlands, I entered a phase of skepticisim. Borderlands has a quick-paced and in-your-face type of humor that I feel Telltale couldn't replicate, seeing as they work better with steady and controlled pacing for their storytelling. However, I got over it since I'm a Borderlands fan and I have great respect for Telltale's writing and in-depth storytelling.So what do I think of Tales from the Borderlands?Slapped my low expectations right in the face and delivered a hell of an experience.For Telltale games, this is a pretty big step forward. Not telling their story from one but two points of view in an intertwining narrative that is fun to play through, gripping the players attention, full of action and great characters all ending off on a very fast-paced and intense climax, and that's just episode one.Compared to some of their previous releases, Telltale ups the experience with fresh new interfaces and options for the player to get the most out of their time spent. Two characters telling the same story (and bickering about the facts, which is pretty entertaining) about greed, distrust and betrayal. I can't exactly say much about the story since this is a point and click adventure game, which has its primary focus on the story. So revealing too much about it would spoil a good chunk of the game. However, I can say that the camera angles are well done, the action sequences are fast-paced and very fun even if you don't have alot of control and the characters all have well-written personalities and believable motivations. They even got that one guy to do a voice, what was his name? He's in a lot of stuff and I'm too lazy to look up on IMBD for his name but you'll know who I'm talking about when you hear it.Now this game was pretty gosh-durn good, a well-written story set in the Borderlands universe with plenty to keep fans of the series giggling. But there are some issues I'm sensing here. The animations, good god are they stiff. Action scenes have movement patterns similar to cut-budget stopmotion and facial motions are stiff and limited. I know there is a valid reason for this, it's because the Telltale Tool is really outdated, archaic even. The company is making a lot of good things in recent years, I don't even have to say what a success The Walking Dead Season One was, so why don't they put some budget into a new, improved and modern game engine? I'm not talking about 100% realism but something to give their visual storytelling a better payoff to the player. Just my opinion, they could be working on something like that for all I know.Secondly, and this is a general criticism to Telltale themselves, not directly related to this game so go ahead and skim this paragraph over if you're not interested in what I have to say: You got these amazing writers who have created gem after gem with Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, why are they always piggybacking off the popularity of others? Why don't they make something completely original? I have faith in them, I was once a snide skeptic of their capabilities but Telltale has proven me wrong time and time again, and have earned my respect. So I would love to see them put their effort into creating something new and entirely Telltale, something that people will look at and think ""Telltale Games"", not ""Telltale Games in association with:"". I think they could do it, and if anybody who works at Telltale is reading this: I'M SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A WORTHLESS CYNIC! PLEASE CREATE SOMETHING AMAZING AND ORIGINAL! I BELIEVE IN YOU!Another issue I have with the game is the pacing. I've mentioned earlier that Telltale and Borderlands have starkly conflicting approaches to their dialogue, and it shows. The game lacks the quick-slap entertainment of Borderlands and feels more held back by Telltale's controlled pace. There are a lot of moments where I can tell it was Telltale who made this with prolonged silent moments, following their formula and reducing the value and charm of Borderlands that we've come to expect with a Borderlands title. But that can be considered by some to be a minor nitpick at best, especially seeing how the game has done a very nice job of accomplishing what it set out to do.So all that's out of the way. To sum up Tales from the Borderlands: It follows the Telltale formula and adds some creative new ideas into it that make the game stand out in comparison to their other works. If you're a fan of Telltale, Borderlands or both I'd definitely recommend giving this game a run. You won't be disappointed."

This Episodic Series explains the Story well, so it's not necessary to have played the previous Games if they aren't your style of Game.The Dialog choices were great, and there weren't really any choices that you didn't want to choose, which could add onto the Replayability just to see the reactions.I do have to say though, that I really enjoyed the Story. It was full of Comedy, Action, and even some Emotional scenes. The Game has very little walking in it like some other Episodic Games, with most of it being Dialog Choices, and Quick Time Events.Personally, I thought the Quick Time Events were over done in parts, but that is probably due to my dislike for them. I'm all for Directional Movements, but have little like for repetively pressing a single button over and over [which you'll do a lot].The only thing I thought could have had some improvement, was during the Conversations, after your selection 90% of the time the Animations weren't seamless and would ""skip"". Apart from that, it was a solid Game with plenty of laughs.Genre- EpisodicGame Elements- Player Choice- Quick Time EventsAverage Playthrough- 12 HoursLiked- Great Story- Comedy- Good Voice Acting- Fitting Music- Player Choice- Nice VisualsDisliked- Animations weren't seamless"

However, if you like TTG's style of games where it's almost like a TV show or movie but you get to make the decisions you should enjoy this game. The storyline is good with a creative way of telling the story and interesting plot developments along the way, which is what I've come to expect from TTG. Granted there aren't many interactions but I found it enjoyable to just go along for the ride. The humour in this is also really good and in keeping with the other borderlands games. I'm looking forward to the next episodes coming out, however I'm pretty sure I've already screwed myself over in the choices I've made (probably shouldn't have wasted that bullet, I bet it will be more important later)."

As the stakes and characters develop the game grips you and actually evokes more than a little emotional involvement with it all. It also maintains the comedy while still eliciting emotional involvement, which is not something I initially thought they could do with such an over the top setting.Also have to compliment each episodes opening credits, they knock each and everyone out of the park.Suffice it to say you should get this game.

It might be revolutionary in its genre (a title I reserve for such games as Rome: Total War, BioShock, and Mass Effect 2), in that it's a story-based game that really is good enough to be a movie.

Tales from the Borderlands is an episodic video game based on the Borderlands series. The game is quite impressive with it's ridiculous humour and unique characters that grow on you throughout each episode. It's a great balance between action and comedy.Because of this, it's set far apart from most of Telltale's games that prove to be ""subpar"" in comparison. Two things that really stood out to me and that I absolutely LOVED was the intro sequences and the soundtrack. Everything is choreographed really well and has it's own place. I've never had so much fun playing a game before. I'd totally recommend it to anyone who asks.Even not being a fan of the previous Borderlands games I still throughly enjoyed Telltale's spin on it.

Well, ok, it is a lot like watching a movie, but the stories are so damn amusing I have to play them. Especially, a Borderlands one. If you haven't played Borderlands before, it is just full of humor and making awkward/sad scenes hilarious and relatable. There's some serious air gun action going on in this game.

One might argue that your choices didn't matter very much in this game, but the last episode had a lot of stuff that was different based on your previous actions.The thing I liked the most about this game is the absolutely amazing intros they made. Borderlands is very well known for godlike intros and songs, but this game beats all previous titles. TTG really tried to capture the spirit of the previous games, and they did one hell of a job. It's always a risky move to introduce completely new characters when there are already a lot of loved characters in the game, but TTG is an absolute beast when it comes to character development. Since this is the direct sequel to Borderlands 2 and (hopefully) the follow-up to Borderlands 3, you shouldn't miss this adventure.

This game has taken that title by miles.   Tales from the Borderlands is both one of the most heartfelt and the funniest story to come out of Telltale, and manages to maintain the style of the main Borderlands games while having a far better story and much more realistic dialogue.  The characters in this game are far more relatable than any of the previous protagonists, and you will probably care far more about them because of it, especially in the moments when Telltale pulls their signature 'everything went wrong' moments out.  But through all the drama it maintains a generally lighthearted tone, with lots of laughs from both physical humour and great writing.  It also has the two best action scenes in any game of this genre.  I won't go into details for fear of ruining the surprises, but believe me that you'll know them when you see them.This is a must play whether you care about the main series of Borderlands or not.  If you've never played the originals, they're good games in their own right, but a wiki summary of the series will be enough for you to get a great experience out of this one.

The story has the exact amount of humour, blood, gore and action that sets the tone perfectly for the world of Pandora. The characters are also all really well defined, even from an early stage. The contrast between Fiona and Sasha's experience versus Rhys' and Vaughn's Hyperion knowledge helps the two differing casts clash in a good way that doesn't detract from either side. Even the music they use shares a similar theme with the franchise, having a lot of fun and action packed themes to it.

Gone is the MMO style grind and static worlds. Gone are the endless memes in place of actual characters.  Instead we have two grounded main characters with actual arcs and flaws and so on. The episodes will run you about 2-3 hours a pop, and now that it's all out, it makes more sense to buy it all in one package. Telltale has mastered the art of the perfect tease: I couldn't imagine what people must have gone through with months between the original episodes.There are a fair number of flaws though. The animations for the human characters are often quite stiff and robotic. You can tell that they were simply relying on pre-existing sets for those. The more idiosyncratic characters, likethe rolling adorable robot Gortyshave livelier, more nuanced animations, precisely because they couldn't rely on existing resources. A few times, I had to reset in the middle of often quite dramatic turns because the music cut out. And a lot of the characters still suffer from the Borderlands staple of the 'same voice' where, young or old, feeble or strong, everyone occasionally slips into the voice of an 18 year old hipster. It can often be quite jarring and spoils a few good moments, but I would say the meat of the story is strong enough to pull the narrative through.The two main characters, Rhys and Fiona, play differently enough to keep the variety up. Telltale have enough restraint to trim the story enough to keep you invested while not overstaying their welcome. They pull out exactly when the gimmicks become tiresome, and the final send off switches up the QTEs in a big way, enough to make it not a big chore.A game like this really makes me wish for a more nuanced rating system. There's no doubt that, at full price, some might balk given the length of this game and some of its flaws. In my view, it runs a solid 8/10, and is more than worth your time if on sale. It stands as a solid title with writing that shines through despite Telltale's mechanical laziness. I hope that, if anything, Gearbox takes some lessons forward from this; mainly to stop writing everything like an 18 year old scene kid and, crucially, to SHOW with actions and emotion rather than tell through some quest giver or other trite mechanic.But who am I kidding, right?8/10orLoaderbot is my waifu out of 1010But buy it on sale though"

Loud, obnoxious characters spouting random nonsense for the randomness of it? No thanks. But luckily, most of the universe is just a backdrop for the original story.There are some refreshingly great characters. But the biggest pro of this game is how it keeps you on your toes. The game manages to throw something unexpected at you quite often. This results in an interesting experience, since you rarely see the next direction of the story coming.There are of course the standard modern Telltale issues with this game. The biggest of these issues being the claim that your choices matter. But this merely results in one or two altered lines of dialogue directly, of a bit later in the story.In the end, I'd say this game is on par with The Wolf Among Us, but below The Walking Dead: Season 1. It outshines the rest of the uninspired story-driven games Telltale now ♥♥♥♥♥ out now on a regular basis."

The adventure spin-off itself contains great elements of scene, humor, violence, and characters.The game presents strong characters and development even tons of supported characters will play major roles in storyline regardless on your decisions. I do love Fiona and Rhys. They’re funny and conflicted many times, but they have self-interest and purpose on their goals which add different taste on story.Each dialogue and decision is well-crafted and written which can lead you to an unexpected outcome. Thanks to Telltale games for implementation on great storytelling, twisted plots, and how it fits well in Borderlands’ universe.The action scenes mostly involve on pressing direction button and short quick-time events. It’s fast and full of chaos. It’s actually pretty fun to watch although some are unnecessary and overused.However, I feel like the last episode is bit rushed in term of tight sequence. There is not much difference on choosing Vault team. Also, I’m trying to get close to point of interesting and the cutscene just interrupt when player reach certain area. The placement of script sometimes ruins player self-exploration. I also expect Fiona’s cash could play more roles on choices and inventory system could be manually used for purpose.Tales from The Borderlands becomes one of my great Pandora tour. Not because of its title, but it has mixed feelings of experience and unforgettable taste of what Borderlands should be."

This is not true, Tales from the Borderlands has a very big impact on the universe which becomes quite clear in episodes 4 and 5.One other point that should be brought up is the fact that the episodes took a while to release and I think It's quite bad to see that the only reasons people have been giving this game bad reviews was because they...1.Don't like point and click adventure games but bought this one and are now criticizing it because it IS A POINT AND CLICK ADVENTURE GAME (These people are really stupid, 2 seconds of research and you would have found that out)2.They don't like the artstyle, which again 2 seconds of research and you would have found the artstyle from the previous games or seen the trailer for this one3.The episodes took too long to be released, which is not the games fault it's the developers fault, so people shouldn't write bad reviews about something that is not the games fault and will become completely irrelevant once the full game is released.Episode Ratings:Episode 1:AMAZINGEpisode 2:Very goodEpisode 3:Very goodEpisode 4:goodEpisode 5:AMAZINGFinal Verdict:Artstyle: 97/100 - Couple of texture glitches brought it downSound/music: 100/100 - No words for how good the music and voice acting was in this gameCharacters: 95/100 - Very few characters I didn't like or I felt had problemsStory: 98/100 - You can't predict the masked manEngine/Optimization: 80/100 - The Telltale engine still needs alot of workScore: 94/100"

This adventure sure was a thrilling one with a tonne of interesting and colourful characters, particularly seeing how some of them grow and change throughout the story and each one having motivations of their own, which makes them seem like real people. There's a lot they managed to pack into this 10-hour epic journey - silliness, thrills, emotional moments, and a tonne of laughs and jokes. It does a really decent job taking you on an emotional rollercoaster and getting invested in the characters and the outcome of their lives.The game is set in the Borderlands universe, but I don't think it's necessary to have played previous Borderlands games, since the story here is its own and follows its own characters for the most part, though having played at least some of the Borderlands games or DLCs might make you appreciate some things more whilst playing this game.I really enjoyed the story-telling in this game. Firstly because it had two leading protagonists, and the point of view would often change between them, so we'd see the experiences of both of them, particularly when they'd split up. Another thing I really enjoyed was the fact that it wasn't cliche or predictable, and that's always a pleasant experience, when a story can surprise you instead of you going ""yep, I've seen that coming"", and it sure has managed to surprise me a number of times with the direction it went.As with most Telltale games, there are elements of choice and consequence present in this game. Though the main story outcomes would largely be the same, some decisions sure seem to change a few things around. The rest of the gameplay mainly involves interacting with the environment, quick time events, and choosing dialogue options in conversations. So it's not too hard or complex. Just a lovely story for you to enjoy and participate in. The episodes are all pretty meaty too, especially the 5th episode which seemed to be almost as long as two different episodes. Beautiful art style, music, and voice acting too.Really don't have anything to criticise aside from maybe suspension of disbelief pushing it too far in some instances, such as characters not being in a full space suit whilst crawling outside the ship in freezing open space, or a few very lucky escapes in action scenes. But otherwise, this game is a real thrill and enjoyment. Highly recommended for fans of interactive stories."

The story is fun and quirky and has very solid pacing. Telltale did a great job with embodying the Borderlands world, with its violent nature into the genre they so very well known for. The Borderlands humor is there as one would expect it but it is used in moderation and for the better in my opinion.On the technical side the game runs well except for the very rare occasional audio bug (which might be a personal problem) where the dialogue would overlap a word and then continue as normal. This didn't cause and de-synch issues or lag otherwise.After playing the Pre-sequel earlier this year, the Borderlands formula has gotten a bit stale for me.

,Recommended,330830,15044030,"Posted: 25 March, 2015",all,ButterySmooth14FPS,"This review is for season 1. I highly recommend that all fans of Borderlands-brand humor play this game. Tales from the Borderlands is just as hilarious as Borderlands 2 at its best, and both protagonists are as funny as they are likable. For the most part, the story is told in a sequence of flashbacks that revolve around a central objective: The Gortys Project. As you progress towards uncovering more of what got Rhys and Fiona into their present conundrum, you will encounter many staple Borderlands characters, and these encounters are often hilarious or otherwise memorable in some way.Rhys, a Hyperion employee, has a gimmick that allows him to scan and hack various objects throughout the game, and much of the text-based humor is provided in this way. The other protagonist is Fiona, a con artist with a massive bounty on her head. She is able to loot crates, and much of her gameplay involves attempting to smooth talk her way out of multiple encounters, with the assistance of her sister Sasha. The dialogue and voice acting are top-notch, which is imperative to the delivery of the game's humour. The art style and aesthetic is exactly what you would expect from the Borderlands series.Not only are the main and returning characters great, but nearly all of the new supporting cast completely fit in with the Borderlands style and humor you'd expect of the series. One of my favourite side characters is the highly passive-aggressive Loader Bot, who refuses to forgive and forget about my order to have him self-destruct earlier in the game. My biggest gripe with the game revolves around the lack of importance in a number of the decisions you make. Oftentimes, the outcomes will be the same no matter what choice is made. In one particularly egregious example, I constantly reacted negatively and antagonistically towards a certain character - the exact opposite to how a friend played the game - yet we both ended up with the same conclusion involving this character. This 'illusion of choice' was quite disappointing. That aside, the character interactions are a consistent game strength and the story will capture and retain your attention throughout. Quite welcomely, in Tales of the Borderlands we see the glorious return of the greatest character in the series' history -Hail to the King, baby."

And a small note that before Tales From the Borderlands I haven’t played a single Telltales game that is like Tales From the Borderlands or The Walking Dead(which I will review somewhere in the future).You view the story perspective from 2 characters the middle manager from the biggest space company in the galaxy: Hyperion’s own Rhys and the Pandoran con-artist from hollow point: Fiona.the whole game consists of 5 episodes in which the story will develop in its own way as you make critical choices that actual choices but it all starts with this: Rhys is looking for Fiona to talk out what happened during the story (in which you decide what happens there) and Rhys gets captured by a stranger with a Hyperion shotgun, and while Rhys is getting dragged through the wastelands of the Borderlands of Pandora Rhys tells the stranger (and the player) how it all started.The presentation is as borderlands as it can be, the presentation in the same way as Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel has been made in terms of art style, the voice-acting is for the most part perfect making the characters feel like they are more than just video game characters, the only issue I have with it is Zer0’s voice-acting. In the first episode Zer0 sum he has the same voice actor as he had back in borderlands 2 (Mike Turner) but in episode 5 he has a noticeable different  less husky, more formal-sounding voice.The Music soundtracks are a blessing to the ears with Jungle – Busy Earnin’ as my personal favorite(I was listening to this song on repeat while making this review) .In my final conclusion this game is a must play for every borderlands fan just for its fair share of humor, emotional moments and badass moments of complete awesomeness. You most NOT watch this game on YouTube since you most likely will disagree with the choices the Let’s Player will make, so you should rather play this game yourself than watch it.Have fun with the game and see you all next time"

This game has all the action a story telling game in the borderlands universe needs.I admit I have made some ""questionable"" choices in the game that I've regretted (not as much as mass effect) but that is the part of the fun in the game, creating choices that question your morals, decision making skills and ability to think laterally is what I love from this game.

,Recommended,330830,16673799,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,Renbot,"[Currently reviewed up to Episode 3]I'm going to be honest: this is probably my favorite Telltale  game.  Yeah, I said it.   It's not because I'm a fan of the Borderlands series, which admitedly hasn't had the best of story telling, but rather because this game has managed to make me want to learn more about Pandora and all of it's stories.It has everything you'd expect from a quality Telltale game series, with a lot of the weird/funny bits that come from the Borderlands series.  It's a very unlikely match but I think that's one of the many reasons it succeeds.Episode 1 was a fantastic introduction that made me realize that this was going to be a keeper of a series, and it had everything I could ask for.   Episode 2 was a little slower, but it introduces more character development and begins to tie the story into the greater Borderlands mythos.   Episode 3 went back to being more action packed, while also giving us a lot of fan favorite appearances from previous characters, and tying the story more into the Borderlands mythos while also introducing new characters that, dare I say are even more compelling than the older and more established ones.As a Telltale game, this is more or less what you might expect.  Perhaps even more, if you came into this game with mixed or skeptical feelings on the IP.  I have to say, as a fan of Telltale I think one of the reasons I love this probably the most out of anything they've put is that it puts a refreshing shift of mood from their normal style.  The Walking Dead, Wolf Among us and Game of Thrones are all great and quality stuff, but they always had that somber, depressing or even painful atmosphere.  Dark and gritty is great, realistic is good, and tension is nice.   Tales from the Borderland is almost on the entirely different end of the spectrum.  Wacky (but not in a lol so randumb way), funny, charming with it's own sense of dark humor that you'd expect from Borderlands, it's very refreshing to see this in a sea of debbie downer moods.  Variety is the spice of life, after all.The only negatives I have to say so far are the usual stuff you might see in Telltale games; an aging engine that is showing it's age more and more with every game, with so-so animations at times and weird little bugs that can annoy you if you've been a veteran of Telltale and have seen them in multiple games.   It's more of a nitpick, but I do hope that they can pump out a new, or at least vastly improved engine soon.   Tales is a little better about it, but when the stuff starts to show, boy does it show.   Oh, and the wait times for new episodes.   If you're one of the types that like to wait until all of the episodes are out, you're going to probably be waiting for a while; this entry is one of the worst offenders of making you wait so far.   However, that can't ultimately pull away from how highly I recommend this game.As a bonus, don't be afraid to play if you've never played Borderlands or even remember the story from the Borderlands games; this game does a fairly good job of keeping you up to speed, and while some background knowledge is appreciated and rewarded (especially for long-time fans of the series), it isn't essential in the slightest.Oh, and I should have 6 more hours played but Steam bugged out for whatever reason with my Episode 1 playthroughs.Pros:+ Well written characters and story+ Exciting+ Genuinely funny at times+ Great voice acting+ Nails the Borderlands aesthetic in art and overall feel+ Memorable moments+ A refreshing direction from the usual Telltale game+ Did I mention that I love the characters?Negatives- Falls into the general pitfalls of Telltale games- So-so combat parts- The occasional wonky animation/bug- The incredible wait time between EpisodesBuy this now if you like Telltale games, story games, Borderlands games or just having a fun time.   You won't be disappointed.   Expect to wait on the complete package for a while longer, though."

The game (as: The walking dead season 1,2 and The wolf among us which i've played before this one) is like a movie, in which you decide what to say and what to do, constantly knowing that everything will have consequences in the current or next episodes.Unlike The walking dead though, this game has a lot of action situations, where you have to fight back bandits and psychos, with a lot of bad*ss moves of counter attacks. It sure does keep high the interest in the next episodes.If you liked playing Borderlands 1, 2 and the pre-sequel for its stupidity and bad*sstitude to approach things, then you're definetly going to love this one.""

I grabbed this game during a sale and was happy I did.  This is not your typical FPS Borderlands game keep in mind, but I does give you that Borderlands feel and some really cool back sotries for those who have played throughout the series.  I was very skeptical at first due to some reviews, but I personally never really go off of what other people think entirely.  After playing through my first time I could hardly wait to do my second play through to see how changing my answers would impact the stories and outcomes.  It's like many games of this style in that category, what you choose has impacts even on people dying and choosing characters for end game boss.  I will most likely be playing through this many times as well as replaying all the Borderlands series themselves.  Can't wait to see the next one.  The graphics are Borderlands style and in my opinion good as I like those types.  The sound is great.  The story, is how you choose and always changing.  The content is mature and not just entertaining and will most often leave you smiling or with a literal ""lol"".  Keep an open mind and give it a try.  Good luck and keep Vault Hunting!

,Recommended,330830,21953988,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Mummy,"I liked Borderlands and I liked TWD. So this was kind of an obvious choice for me, I was sceptical at first though, couldn't imagine what kind of a story could be told on Pandora TellTale style. As it turned out, I really loved it. You take control of two main characters, A gal named Fiona and a guy called Rhys. Both come from completely different worlds and carry some heavy baggage with them. You'll get to make dialog and story choices for the both of them while considering their unique points of view, which is pretty cool and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I don't wanna spoil the story and there isn't really a way to explain it in a short way, let's just say it's about vault hunting (duuh), there's mind blowing plot twists and robots and you get very close to banging! Identical gameplay to other TT games - quicktime events and dialog timers. Rarely puzzles.What I liked:- The humor! I laughed at every other scene, it clicked very well with both my mature and immature senses of humor. And no, I didn't mind the memes, I think they fit the borderlands kind of a world pretty fine. Maybe I'm too old to find them cool and I don't give a damn.- The characters. They're interesting and likable, I enjoyed watching their stories as much as simply watching them ;) You will meet new people and some old friends.- The music, not only licenced songs, also the ambience music really brought my goose bumps up. Opening intros were something I looked forward to much like with the original Borderlands games.- The story is pretty amazing and nicely paced. Not once I found myself bored of nothing happening or confused from too much action.- The illusion of choice, still works pretty well in my opinion. I understand why the choices cannot have real impact because that would mean creating 20+ games for the price of one. There are exceptions though, see in the did not like section.What I did not like:- Save system, sometimes I made a rash dialog decision or forgot to collect items and wanted to reload, not without replaying the last 10 minutes though.- Some dialog responses made no sense, especially characters' reactions to my being silent. As I sometimes honor the old saying ""talking is silver, silence is golden"", I chose to remain silent, especially with the fallen antagonist. To my surprise, nobody really minds and Rhys/Fiona kind of continue their animations and face expressions just with closed mouths. Maybe it's just me but I'd be super weirded out if somebody kept quiet in a 1on1 conversation with me.- The forced romance. Don't get me wrong, I liked Sasha. But since the first moment I only had eyes for Fiona and I felt like a jackass telling Sasha to ""screw off"" all the time as it wouldn't stop shoving convenient situations up my throat only with her.- Bleeping and replacing the F-bomb. I know this is nitpicking, but COME ON! Is one word really that much of a deal?This game obviously isn't for everybody. It's mostly an interactive movie and I think it's worth it if you're into that at least a little. Sorry I can't give the highest score since I did find some flaws, but that did not stop me from replaying it many times and now recommending it to you with the count of9/10!"

,Recommended,330830,13822418,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Tom Cruise,"This is an amazing game. This of course still follows the usual TellTale gameplay. This means you better like QTEs and the movie-game style that they use. This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone, but that's how it is made.The story follows something unique to the Borderlands universe, so it might be best to have a general knowledge of the Borderlands universe-though I feel like only people who have played the Borderlands are going to play this. If you don't play Borderlands you can still enjoy the game, but it might (the story) be confusing a bit in some parts.The way they inplement rarity and the loot system are really good. I wasn't sure at first how they were going to implement these things but they have done a really good job. There are little loot crates or hidden things which contain money, and then you pick up. There are also some chances where you can buy items (pr pick up items) of different rarity. I hope they will use this system a lot. (You could give the opportunity for someone who has saved a lot of money the chance to get something for only someone who has saved all their money; or someone who bought rare loot could have the chance to sell or use it, and only they would really have the opportunity to.)As of episode one I am already really enjoying the story as of now. I've laughed a couple times or had a big smile because of how awesome some of the moments were. The characters are very memorable (IMO), and are well done. My only issue currently is that TellTale is updating as much as they said (4-8 weeks) and they have already given Game of Thrones an episode 2, even though TFTB came before it, which kind-of shows where they are putting their time. Other than that it is a great game so far, and if you like any other TellTale game and Borderlands than without a doubt you will love this game..."

No matter how complicated it is - there's always one. And telling stories is TellTale's speciality. Combine their narrative with a wide and colourful Borderlands universe and you will have this game which you won't be able to forget for some time. Hell, some scenes still haunt me every day.You will meet a lot of familiar characters from other games in the series and new ones as well.In Tales from the Borderlands you have two main characters... and two version of one intense story. A con artist who trick people for a living and a Hyperion company man who wants to be like Handsome Jack. You may ask: what is the reason they're in the same story? The answer is simple. Every Borderlands games starts... with a Vault. Possibly the last remaining Vault on Pandora. What lies inside it? An Iridian monstrosity? A lot of loot? Jimmy Jenkins?

Not only it’s a pure Borderlands fun without the repetitive shooting routine but since those remaining Borderlandisms are now in the spotlight, they’ve achieved new level of vividness. Facial expressions, visuals, storyline, soundtrack and all.It keeps the same old attributes: psychos, bandits, vault hunters, beautiful weapons but now you’re “simple” Pandoran / Hyperion clerk witnessing all the madness from the side and fights are kinda tricky for you. Quick-Time Events demonstrate that perfectly.New characters are lovable: eccentric as always, a bit cyber- and steampunky. Trademark humor and everything but some jokes and cameo appearances will require previous BL experience to get the most out of them.I personally enjoyed it the same way I’m enjoying shows like American Dad & South Park to say the least.

There are also a lot of connections to the already existing Borderlands universe and tons of appearances of known characters. The game provides a lot of action and humor and in my opinion it's one of the best Telltale games up until now.EDIT: I finished playing all 5 episodes, and this - for me -  is the best game of 2015.

This is probably one of my favorite games now.You make the choices, you play as two characters, Rhys and Fiona, you get to see their relationship change between them and their friends. And also,Handsome Jack is here too.And also, you get to see Borderlands 1, Pre Sequel and 2 characters. How amazing is that ?

Tales from Borderlands is their absolute best work as of yet, by far. I really went into it not expecting a lot, I didn't see how a choose-your-own adventure game in Borderlands universe would fair but I gave it a chance. What seperates it from their other work since The Walking Dead is that this game brings back comedy to their stories. But at the same time the characters are written well enough to where you connect to them and grow attached to them. There is a subtle amount of drama to it to give the storyline some seriousness. They honestly did a better story in the universe of Borderlands than Gearbox ever did. I'm anxiously awaiting a Season 2 of this to see what they could conjure up with Rhys and Fiona."

From start to finish, I've never felt that any episode was used for fillers. Every one of them always had something epic and kept the adrenaline running. It was an emotional, stupid, ridiculous, awesome, crazy, weird, painful, destructive, horrifying, bloody, funny and satisfying experience. The story wasn't rushed even with the small number of episodes, the characters that were made for you to love and hate did their job specifically well and the most important part, the choices actually matter! Even the smallest detail can change some outcomes. Everything was detailed and the fact that this game had big changes to the canon story made it even more enjoyable! They made sure to have the spirit of Borderlands in check every moment of the game. If you played Borderlands, buying this game is a must. IF you're a fan though, not having this game would be criminal. I absolutely loved every moment of Tales from the Borderlands and honestly, I can't wait for both Gearboxes' and TellTales' next game to be released.Great job to both developers for making great games overall. In my opinion, this game would be a 10/10.Pros-Great story-Choices that affect many situations and outcomes-Keeps the spirit of Borderlands alive-Every episode adds something to the story-Good pacing of the story-Great musicCons-Glitchy animation from time to time-Loading at very important points of the story that ruins the immersion-Quite a few Ex-Machinastl;dr Great game for a Borderlands player and a perfect game for a fan of the Borderlands series."

Say what you like about it, I personally loved Tales from the Borderlands.The cell-shaded graphics are here but without the fast paced action as the first person shooter variety which is much to my relief (the regular variety gave me motionsickness and a headache after a while of play time).Much of the dialogue is hilarious and the plot is quite enrapturing. But it's definitely the characters that I love the most.The banter is the most amusing and ties in great with the story. Of course you have your character cameos from 1, 2 and the Pre-sequel too but they're brief and mostly just there for comedy relief and plot elements.I know this review is mostly incredibly vague, but seeming as story drives most of this game, giving it away is pretty much going to ruin any experience you'll have yourself. For me, I loved the story, characters and going through the outcomes to see what changes. It was a rollercoaster of emotions going through it the first time absolutely blind and the second time was only slightly easier but still as bad as the first.

This has, in my opinion, paid dividends and made Tales from the Borderlands without a doubt my favorite Telltale game yet. The story is compelling and the trademark Borderlands humor that fans of the series know and love was captured perfectly by this game. However, most importantly, the characters are phenomenal; the superb voice acting and writing resulted in colorful, well-defined and highly memorable characters that the player can feel connected to. The choices you make affect the story, but have more of an effect on the way in which the characters interact with one another, which is why the character development was so important; decision making is the core mechanic of this style of game, and the fact that Telltale got me to care about the characters was what made me care about the decisions I made and how they affected everyone else.  The decisions can be difficult at times, but the dark and stressful nature associated with the decisions in other Telltale Games such as the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones has been toned down considerably, which is one of the largest strengths of the game. It resulted in more multi-faceted and entertaining characters and, most importantly of all, it resulted in Tales from the Borderlands, moreso than any other Telltale game I have played, being about what video games were supposed to be about in the first place: having fun. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the story, world, and humor of the Borderlands games, but also to anybody who enjoys story-driven video games. Without experience in the Borderlands universe, some of the characters and references may be unfamilar, but the core story and the new characters created solely for this game are phenomenal and well worth your time."

It was full of awesome humor, great story, and as with most Telltale games, the choices really matters, and it's scenes made you care for even the smallest characters. I was constantly thinking what could've happened if I chose differently. The major scenes did in some cases feel a bit silly, but in a good, epic way.The gameplay is the most important of it all in this kind of game. It was awesome, and i can't recommend this enough! The game felt really long since i pulled an all-nighter and barely noticed that I skipped out on both dinner and sleep. One powerful element in this game is the humor. That was the most important part for me since it has the exact humor I enjoy the most. The expressions in peoples faces and the sarcasms, they never end! Although it was really funny, it also nailed the sad moments and you really question your choices, making you really feel for the characters. I bought this game in the summer sale, and I thought it should be worth at least the discounted prize it had, since it's a telltale title, and man, the quality! Easily worth every penny i spent! I would be able to feel satisfied over my purchase even if it had cost over 50 bucks.The graphics are of course neither good nor bad, since it has the cartoon artstyle, and it's hard to tell good graphics apart from the bad in those cases.I didn't really focus on the sounds, sounded just like it should've, but the music is another story. They managed to nail every chapter and compelling moments with the perfect music for both atmosphere and feeling.I am definitley replaying this since the ending can be one of very many possibilities, and what happens in the beginning can make a very different outcome in the end.A contender for the best game i've ever played.

You've got comedy, romance, drama and 2 main characters that are extremely well written.This game has more twists than a testicular tortion surgery, and literally every one of them had me on the edge of my seat. They're fairly predictable twists too, I called alot of them before they happened, but I cared so much about all of the characters in the game and the story that I was just totally engrossed in them.I usually don't like Borderland's humour, especially Anthony Burch's newfound cuck/feminist humour, but this game had so many moments that had me smiling or giggling at things, and the finger gun scene from episode 4 had me in tears laughing.I suggest to you guys on my friends list to get the game instead of watching some fuqboi like me let's play it on youtube. Pick it up in the Halloween sales or the Christmas sales, christ, even sell your kidney to get this game.

That said, lack of choice isn't much of an issue because the story is quite solid.

This is the perfect game for Borderlands fans and just people who like hilarious jokes and really weird things. The things of which are usually kept in the background in Borderlands games because of the time being dedicated to trillions of guns and shooting increasingly huge monsters in the face is here used to expand the universe and make everything about Borderlands better.For an exampel. I was supposed to strange some bandit. I suck at clicking the right buttons. So i failed. Of course i did. But instead of just retrying it, like each and every other game would when you fail. The bandit cheered me on. Telling me ""you can do it! i believe in you"". It was hilarious and i think it is what shows the soul of this game.Yes Tell-Tale games are nothing but quick time events and walking around. And answearing a question here and there. But this formula is perfectly put to use in Tales from The Borderlands.I give this game a 9-10.The graphics are beautifully cell shaded, Borderlands style. It brings back fond memories.The voice actors are great. The dude from The Emperors New Groove is the badguy! That alone makes it worth buying!The gameplay in itself is a bit lacking. I know i know, but honestly i can look over that just because of the fantastic rest of the freaking game!This game is the most fun, unique and weird Tell-Tale game i have played in years.The Walking Dead brings the feels.The Wolf Among Us Brings the mysteries and the weirdJurassic Park brings the Nope lets forget that one!But Tales From The Borderlands brings the hilarity, the fun, the weird. It is a completely open world. It expands upon Pandora, Hyperion and everything else. I cant wait to get back to it and play the rest. I. Love. This. Game.It it worth 23 euro? Well i dont really know. For me it is. I got it on sale. And i would say if it is on sale. GET ON THE SPOTIf not. Are you a Borderland fan? Then yes, do you enjoy Tell-Tales style? Then yes.This game is Ducking fantastic.And they actually swear. This game has balls. It goes all the way. And you get a whole load of content for a very low price.Buy or not buy.

And the story is really the great thing about this - it just works, no two ways about it, and I can't say more than that without spoiling things.The only downsides I can think of are only four save slots, and the months between episodes.

The writing is so good!There's less down time than in other Telltale games, and there's a currency mechanic that's a little under-cooked.

I was wrong.Telltale Games has really gone above and beyond in creating a story and characters that are dynamic, likable (yes, even Jack), and that I actually care about.  It is one thing to replicate the hilariousness of theBorderlandsgames--Telltale does that quite well--but to actually inject some depth beneath those humorous layers is what really impresses me about Telltale's take on the series.I enjoyed Telltale'sThe Wolf Among Us, but in many ways I found myself not caring about the eventual outcomes of my decisions.  InTales from the Borderlands, I did find myself regretting decisions, wishing I could go back and set things right.  The fact that a game set in theBorderlandsuniverse can conjure up a feeling like regret tells you that Telltale did an impressive job in adding depth to an otherwise comic book set of games.Even if you don't like the story-heavy/gameplay-light genre of games,Tales from the Borderlandsis definitely worth checking out.  Although you might have a hard time going to play the vanillaBorderlandstitles afterwards (this game will make you want to)--as Telltale does such a good job with everything.  And I say this with great affection for the traditionalBorderlandsgames--this one is just that good.Oh, and one last thing that's worth noting--the music (both original and licensed) is AWESOME."

The game goes something like this you have the prefixed story line from point A to point B, and you have the chance to choose how you gonna get there, well that would be nice if my choices  would get different results, but if you get to point B ( after 2 walkthroughs ) and you get the same result then thats not my choice its a scam. This is not for all the choices you make, but like 80% of them are prefixed so whatever you choose the result is the same, meaning end result is the same the difference would be the path. If you crossing the street and you do it in a straight line or at an angle the end is you`re across and there was a small difference.BUT THERE IS A HUGE BUT, this type of prefixed thingy with giving a player a choice but it gives you nothing in return might be the thing that the developers were going for, it might be one of the best trolls in gaming, afterall this is Borderlands and trolling with off the chart puns is a totally normal day. If this is the case this is a HUGE positive side, cause it makes you enjoy the game after you complete it even more, one of those momments where you realize you failed and you`re just laughing.So let's go to the usual charts:+ ITS BORDELANDS+ Amazing music choice, the soundtracks are spot on+ The story is amazing, and by amazing I mean it has everything that a good story needs, action, commedy, hero play, puns, trolling, drama....etc+ Intro comics style with Marcus talking are a great touch+ Puns and movie references   MINOR SPOILER ALERTCome with me if you want to leave!+ Different choices give different dialogue which in most cases was a great choice to make+ Cartoonish graphics+ Replayability- Yeah yeah i said graphics were good, well they are but since this game came after Borderlands 2 it should have similar or better graphics, and to me it looks a bit downgraded- Choices you make have small impact or none, this is compared on two walkthroughs where I went with a different path- Inconsistency with the story, this happens with few choices you can make and game continues ignoring your choice, MAJOR SPOILER ALERTin the early stages you get to choose whether to make your loaderbot suicide or flee, if you choose suicide he`s still alive but with no explanation on how he managed to be still alive after blowing up, at least if the devs imputed a cutscene where the loaderbot uploaded his AI into an empy unit it would make somewhat sense but as it is now the game basically ignores your choice- Replayability, cause its limited to only 1 , the major choices that give ""impact"" to the story are limited to A/B choiceMy verdict even with all the negatives this game has is still a high number 7/10.I really enjoyed the game even with its quirks.Not worth the full price thou, the negatives are too great in my opinion to get it to that pedestal but on discount its a great pickup.RECCOMENDED"

Just like any Telltale game, your choices affect how the story is tailored and delivered. Unlike previous Telltale titles, Tales from the Borderlands lets you play with two protagonists, Rhys, a Hyperion ‘suit’ with dreams of being the next Handsome Jack, and Fiona, a Pandoran con artist looking to score her biggest ever swindle. As you progress throughout the story, you'll be switching from Rhys and Fiona. The two protagonists have their own unique skill that sets them apart as individual characters.Tales from the Borderlands properly portrays the Borderlands atmosphere. From the presentation of the unforgiving wastelands of Pandora to the humor and comedy expressed by the characters, even someone who hasn't even played Borderlands can totally relate and appreciate the game. It's awesome soundtrack pumps up the atmosphere with life. The voice acting is very good that you could actually feel the transition of emotions from drama, action and comedy. The characters are also very likable as each one has their own personality and that as a certain character continues to develop, their presence just becomes more vital as you go deeper into the story.As for the gameplay, it's a classic Telltale gameplay with times that you'll be choosing how you want to respond, there will also be times that you'll be given a decision that has consquences and a big load of Quick Time Events. Compared from the previous TellTale titles, Telltale did a new style of QTE on this one with multiple buttons that pop out during certain specific points in the game and not just one button to mash.My Personal Rating:Story/Plot: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Music: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Overall: 9/10I recommend this game to big fans of Telltale games and to those who love games with a great and solid storyline. Though your choices affect only the flow of the story and not the ending, Tales from the Borderlands is must play for its masterful combination of drama, comedy and action. If a game's story really matters to you, then this is the game for you! Let the Tales from the Borderlands be heard!"

Also featuring the returning characters with the same voice actors from previous games in the main Borderlands series, including badass Vault Hunters Zer0 and Athena becoming allies with you and also featuring psychopath Handsome Jack, who wants to become your friend (or is that so?).This story feels so unexpected in a way when playing through, depending on different choices you will make. I feel like I wouldn't even stop playing it. Nice action, breathtaking humour and all the fun stuff. I love this game so damn much!WARNING: Yes, yes, yes. There are going to be a lot of blood, gore, brutal killing and creepy faces, so beware.Just seriously. The best Telltale game ever made. It is like no other Telltale games. Maybe except The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Still, this game totally deserves this: 10/10What a game!"

I'm talking about mainly in the other games if you choose to save someone, it really doesn't matter because they'll just go ahead and die later on anyway and the endings are the same no matter the choices you make(except for the final choice in TWD S2).But this game was really cheap in the Winter sale and I love the borderlands franchise so i went ahead and played it.I was pleasantly surprised.My favourite Telltale game of all time for multiple reasons:It isn't some background story like the Game of Thrones game, it will actually shape the future of the Borderlands games.The game never takes itself seriously even during the really emotional moments.The intros to each episode are really good and set the tone for each installment.Had the most unexcepted WTF plot twist in anything ever.Your choices throughout the entire game, including episodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and how much money you've spent will change the finale, which does not disappoint.Personally, my favourite episode was 4 because of the epic finger gun fight and the intro music.Luckily, the ending left it open for a sequel however it might be a while before we get one as they're working on like 4 other games.If you are waiting for another borderlands game or are thinking about which telltale game to buy, get this game."

76561198056428949,Recommended,330830,27757647,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,SpookGayScout 👻,"Review contains spoilersThis game really suffers from what I assume is lack of money and company interest in the game vs the other projects Telltale had running at the time (The Game of Thrones game and the Minecraft Story Mode game). It could have really benefited from a longer development time and maybe the addition of more episodes instead of the standard five.The writing towards the end felt very rushed. If you're playing Rhys like a good guy who loves his new Pandoran friends and can't stand Jack, then the ending probably feels like it plays out just fine. Telltale no doubt had this route as their ideal player path. But it's a choice game and so not all players went this route and you need to keep that in mind when designing your game. The merging of the paths feels like an OOC character shift in the fifth episode if you're not playing Rhys in this ideal path. He becomes good-guy Rhys no matter how you’ve played him. Fiona on the other hand is the pivot character, so baring a few things her character stays mostly consistent throughout and isn’t as affected by the path merge.I played Rhys like the corporate scumbag that he is at heart. He wants to be the boss and, if the Eridium mine deal Vaughn mentions in episode one is anything to go by, isn't afraid to do some dubious♥♥♥♥♥♥to get there. It's his dream to be CEO (just like Handsome Jack) and I wanted to give it to him. So I played him nice to the Pandoran crew, but ultimately driven for personal gain and trusted Jack. The scene in episode four when Rhys can choose to rule Hyperion and it's announced over the loudspeaker is one of my fave moments because he's just so damn happy. I wish I could leave him in that scene forever. Seriously, play it that way and look at his face. It's precious.This all goes out the window though when the writers decide Jack is an idiot who thinks it's a good idea to betray and kill Rhys. Jack's character is driven by betrayal, and reacts negatively when betrayed by people he's learned to trust. Borderlands the Pre-Sequel tells us as much. He's also smart, and knows that any copy made of himself would not in a million years agree to being anything but Number One. So an army of Jack's wouldn't work. You'd just have a death match for Jack superiority. But I digress. If you've trusted him through the whole game why in the world would he all of a sudden turn around and betray Rhys? To betray someone who is putting all their trust in him without being betrayed first isn’t how his character works. And it makes zero sense for him to even try and use Rhys as a skin suit when he could just upload himself into the robot as it is like Loader Bot does later on. There is literally zero need for the endoskeleton conflict other than poor writing as a way to get Rhys off Helios and get the gang back together. There are tons of fans who've come up with much more cleaver alternatives that would stay more true to Jack's character while still getting the gang back together on Pandora and not breaking character for either path.The way they bring the paths together with Fiona is a little strange as well. She’s upset about the vault key deal, that she set up, and blames it for her life going to♥♥♥♥♥♥ That makes zero sense for either path and feels out of place.One thing that Telltale games have always done that grates me the wrong way is that they have a character or several characters that they just assume you're going to be buddy-buddy with. And if you like that character than it's totally chill and you'll have a great time. But if you don't, then the railroad train you're on seems very very obvious. Kenny from The Walking Dead was my first experience with this. In TFTBL this is not so much a character as it is a romance.I absolutely HATE the romance option in this game. And it’s because it’s not so much an option as it is a continuous nudge. A lot of players liked this addition if the end slides are anything to go by, but if you're like me and didn't, then the constant nudging, the forced ""hey pick the flower for the pretty girl"" scene and related scenes from the Atlas dome, and Rhys getting flustered over Sasha in episode five without player input had me rolling my eyes hardcore.It feels especially off-putting when you consider the game is in the Borderlands universe; a universe known for being pretty inclusive for non-straight identities. To have another option in addition to Sasha, maybe Vaughn for example since the two have history, then the romance addition wouldn’t have been so grating. It would feel like a proper choice.Just let me be gay in your games, Telltale, it's not that hard.Despite how I feel about episode five's writing it contains what I think is one of the best scenes Telltale has ever made. The scene where you confront Jack in the wreckage of Helios and have to dismember yourself to save your life is both beautiful and horrifying in a way that left me speechless. Body horror is one of those things that usually squicks me out, but the way it's handled in this scene was perfect and really shows that, despite being portrayed as a wimp most of the game, Rhys is much stronger than he looks and I really liked that. Whichever cinematic artist was in charge of that scene deserves a raise.The art style for the Borderlands game plays very well with Telltale's comic book look and I like the new character and set designs. The engine is showing its age, though, especially during action sequences.So in conclusion despite my many problems with the game, it's a fun game with enjoyable characters and more engaging choices than I’ve seen in previous Telltale games. It’s earned a spot on my personal fave games and I loved it so much I bought it on both the PC and PS4. It’s worth both your time and your money. Would definitely recommend."

Tales from the Borderlands was overall an amazing game with perfect premiere and finale episodes. As someone who played all previous games in the Borderlands franchise (Borderlands, Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel) and really loved them all and played many other Telltale games (both seasons The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones and Minecraft: Story Mode), the combination between the two was spectacular for me. Some of the things I really liked about the Borderlands franchise is the rich story and characters and the amazing world, and having them all in a Telltale game is amazing. The writing, the humor, the story, the soundtrack (the main theme is amazing, and it's orchestral version is even more amazing) and music effects, the design, the decisions, the action- everything was just amazing. While I do think that episodes 2-4 had their highs and lows, I think that the first and fifth (finale) episodes were just perfect. I personally really hope that Telltale will decide to make a second season of Tales from the Borderlands and I personally cannot wait for it to come out.

The romance between Athena and Janey Springs does not feel forced at all and feels organic! This game is definitely worth paying for, whatever price it's listed at.

,Recommended,330830,18594900,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"The best and worst thing I can say about this game is it's another TellTale game. But one that returns to its humorous roots while also having a satisfying story too.The Tell-Tales of A Tell-TaleLet's not delude ourselves with modern TellTale games: ALL of your choices are cosmetic or result in having some characters around towards the end. Or they result in some small variation of the narrative.Sure, you can influence some characters' later interactions. But the game is not about your choices and you should not buy this game expecting another choice-simulator. All your decisions are cosmetic (the money system, the dialogue, the characters' perception of your actions, and one ending with minor variations of all the above).Another thing is that you will be watching and listening a lot more than playing the game. If you do not like the direction TellTale has been heading lately with less gameplay (no, QTEs are not a substitute for puzzles and exploration), then this game will not be for you.If, however, you're looking for something different in recent TT games besides how you play, then this game might be for you. It does just enough to be interesting to TT fans and familiar to Borderlands players to enjoy the game as well.""Smile, What's the Use in Crying?""Where as most TT games emphasize the outcomes of what you do in the game, Tales from the Borderlands emphasizes how you experience the game. The game does this through its two main protagonists--a con-artist and a salaryman shill who isn't above lying as well.Having two main protagonists should be a dead-give away that your actions are not important. Actions for one character may not immediately agree with the other (especially when one person tells the story in their own flamboyant manner).This aspect becomes important, for gameplay reasons, when you have one character telling the story of what had happened to the Stranger. Exageration of details is the narrative/gameplay strength of this TT game as you are in control of how much each character lies.Each episode usually begins with a recap or The Stranger asking you to continue on with the story. The game fades in and out of the game's past and the present-time, and the lies influences what the other protagonist thinks of your decisions.These options are not always open-ended. They are scripted, and after Ep 3 the exageration of the details and alternative angles of the story is dropped completely. (Again, very little choices in this game.) But the gimmick was interesting enough to change up the TT formula, even just a little.It's the game's humor that seals the deal for why you should play this game.It's Not Memes, Not EverythingIf you are like me, I can barely stand the Borderlands' series memes humor and references. Thankfully under TellTale's division, the humor is given variation, as well as stupid jokes and gags that make me smile still.You have self-aware comedy with wonderful timing. Cameos of characters. Jokes about tropes. In-game jokes, both that are so bad and so good. Smart jokes. Meta-jokes at TellTale's expense. Some dark comedy, some ""oh god it's adorable"" jokes.There is so much more that I can't even begin to think of. It makes the jokes that I would otherwise despise tolerable. At a minimum, I cracked a smile at every joke. Sometimes I hated myself for smiling.So many of the new characters that TellTale introduces integrate so perfectly with the Borderlands licence that I had a hard time seperating the characters that were simply cameos from fresh-faces. And not just the people you encounter, the robots too. (I will never look at Loader Bots the same way  when I play BL 2.).And with a licence like Borderlands and a world like Pandora, the combination of TellTale's best capabilities for storytelling and humor come together beautifully.Most of the time.Okay, so it's not all perfect.Midgame CrisisUnfortunately, the game shifts in tone as much as its source material. For the middle of the game it stays on the serious spectrum of Borderlands than its humorous apperances.Episodes 1 and 2 are really memorable with lots of characters, jokes and 4th Wall events to vary up your playthrough. Even when the game gets serious or stupidly violent, it's all with a quirky sense of self-awareness. Somewhere at the end of Ep 2 and the start of Ep 3, however, the game becomes a serious drama with some laughs in-between.Episode 3 and 4, also, are much linear than the earlier episodes as well as being a mood-killer. The experience can possibly ruin the game for some people who wanted a good time throughout the whole game. It started to remind me of Walking Dead S2 and The Wolf Among Us.However, Ep 5 returns to what makes Episode 1 and 2 special. Still, it's very linear in its storytelling.The only problem I have with the finale is that it walks this awkward line between seriousness and humor that I don't think is smoothly executed. (I seem to be alone in this opinion if you check my thread post.)But, thankfully, the game remembers to keep on smiling in the end, and for that I am happy. If you were worried that the game becomes too serious, worry not; TellTale will leave you smiling.A Tale of Two Con-Jobs and All SmilesThis game is a refreshing change, and for what it's worth you'll get around a 10 to 12 hour playthrough. (Especially if you like to wander around for all the extra lore bits.)Despite how much I love this game, I think this is the last TT game I'll purchase for some time.TellTale has burnt me with its continued scarcity of gameplay mechanics, and the only reason I, and probably you, buy their titles now is because of the source material, not for creating new adventure game experiences in a modern age.I bought this game because I thought the humor and the storytelling variation might change things up for TellTale, but I don't see anything in their future to top what they've achieved here.Here's hoping that I'm proven wrong. I was already wrong once for thinking TellTale couldn't make a Borderlands game.Pros:Takes the memes galore humor of Borderlands and gives it more variety of humor. Some smart, some dumb, some absurd, some self-deprication (even at TT themselves).TONS of lore from all the games, and even cameos of a lot of the series' characters.Lots of action scenes to keep you engaged with the story.Exaggerated story-telling.New characters that fit well into the established lore.Loader Bot, Dumpy & Gortys, the best robots ever.The free skins added to the Pre-Sequel.NO... Wait.... What? It can't be... Noooooooooooooooooo!SpoilerCons:It's a Tell-Tale game, for good and for bad.Pseudo-cinematic experience: You wanna grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride, but then you have to keep touching your remote with greasy fingers.Pointless cosmetic choices; money system, weapon options and inconsequential outcomes.Exaggeration can get old after a while. You wonder why the Stranger doesn't cap someone's kneecaps to knock it off.Some characters feel like they overstay their welcome.Plot feels too much like, ""Oh, we need to go venture over there to find X"", ambush, fight sequence, then go off to find another area that we'll set up to do the same thing for the next episode.Epsidoes 3 and 4 are HEAVILY plot-focused/serious, while Episode 5 tries to bring in the humorous charm of the first two episodes."

Despite having completely different backgrounds, their fates become intertwined. The story begins in media res, as they are both captured by a masked individual, who then asks them about their stories in relation to a mysterious Gortys project. This results in an unreliable narration, with some hilarious and over the top incidents, as Rhys and Fiona sometimes describe the same event in a very different light.The gameplay is very similar to recent Telltale Games such as The Walking Dead. It's a blend of a point and click, and an adventure game, with the main focus being on the story and how you shape it by the choices you make, instead of puzzles. The voice acting is top notch, which isn't surprising taking in account the veteran voice cast. Also, all known Borderlands characters have the same voice actors as in the main games. The soundtrack is on par with everything else, with the opening tracks for each episode being nothing short of amazing.While not being a Borderlands fan nor an expert, which surely made me lose some references, I was still able to enjoy the story very much. It's well paced and filled with good and intelligent humor, but it also has some tense and sad moments. The ending was very satisfying and fulfilling, which is starting to become a rarity nowadays. Also as a bonus, the story is considered canon by Gearbox, so it will have an impact on future games.For me, Tales from the Borderlands is one of Telltales' finest games to date and I hugely recommend it!"

,Recommended,330830,16698863,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,TFX | Neo,"Borderlands is a series that puts heavy focus upon the whole ""shooting and looting"" thing, so some people might imagine that taking all that away would leave an uninteresting, empty husk of a game. This might be the case if the story and writing were on par with the rest of the Borderlands series, but trust me; it isn't. It's brilliant.It plays similarly to most other Telltale games--limited time dialogue choices with a scattering of QTEs and adventure game elements, which are nothing special by themselves. So, Tales from the Borderlands relies entirely on a great story to make it work. And I can assure you, it deilvers.Despite the fact that Gearbox have handed over the keys to Telltale on this one, it hasn't lost its soul. In my opinion, the writing is exponentially better than any Borderlands game to date! It still contains the same sort of wacky humor that BL fans know and love, but it doesn't feel like it's trying so hard to be funny and seems much more well done. Not only that, but playing as a non-vault hunter who, although capable, has reason to be afraid of all the insanity on Pandora, shows the Borderlands universe in a new light. I absolutely love it.I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you're a fan of the Borderlands series and have enjoyed the stories in the previous games, Tales from the Borderlands is a no-brainer. If you're not familiar with the Borderlands series, it's still a great game in its own right--however, since it contains major spoilers to the ending of Borderlands 2, I would recommend picking that up first."

Happened to Lego games and I believe the same fate may be coming to the Telltale Games. I bought and finished the Walking Dead before, even though I'm not a fan of comic book or TV series, just got intrested after I played it for an hour or so at my friend's X360. I bought and finished The Wolf Among Us, because it seemed intresting in the trailer and was advertised as another TT game with similar mechanics.Now I'm playing Tales from the Borderlands not because I'm a big fan of Borderlands. I would be, because the atmosphere in the game is so cool, but single player is quite boring and I'm about the only gamer in the society of people I know. And random online partys are just speedrunning through the game, which is really not my style. Also I kinda suck at fast paced FPS, lol.TftB looked interesting enough and I'm cool with cell-shading, but man... It's first and the last TT game I bought before every episode was finished. Waiting for episode two took ages. I was madly checking online to look for any news, found the release date, came back that day to find it was postponed. I ended up pretty much abandonig this game, came back to it couple weeks ago and discovered to have it updated to episode IV. Had to replay the first one though, to refresh my memory. And it is ALMOST A YEAR since the first episode. That is some serious waiting, fellas.However, the game is sweet. It was really nice to discover, that Telltale Games are evolving and they really polished the cell-shading graphics and managed to preserve the Borderlands spirit in it. Well, I guess as Borderlands is cell-shaded as well it wasn't that hard, but it is still a really decent job. And I'm really impressed with the directing, as those are very cinematic games so it's really important. Every episode has really cool intro and it's just fun to watch. I will also praise a neat writing, that also captures the spirit of original Borderlands and it's full of exaggerated, dark humour. The story works very well in that universe and the game (as well as two others mentioned at the begining) lives up to developer's name.The rest is mostly typical Telltale game, which is mostly dialogue-based, but appart from the other adventure games, you have limited time to choose an answer and the characters remember what you said. Well, honestly, playing the first Tt Game title I tought it will have bigger impact on the story, but still it is a nice step ahead from other adventure games.But since the studio is using the same mechanics in every title it is not fresh anymore, that's why I will take a big break from these games for a while. At this point the only interest comes from the story. Game is fun and nice, but outside new tale it doesn't have anything fresh or amazing to show. It is a bit more dynamic than the previous titles, there are more QTEs and they are much more polished and are performing really well. It is clear, that developers are putting much work into each episode to make it great, but they gotta put something fresh in to boost the interest.Also the waiting time. Well I payed £17.09 for it and I had to wait a year to accomplish it. And episode V is still not out, so I have to abandon the game for a while again. Of course the price is low, but I advise anyone to buy Telltale Game titles after the release the last episode. Especially now, because as far as I know, they are making couple of games at the same time and that may be the real reason of time slips. And the total playthrough time is around 10 hours. With Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us I bought complete games with every episode finished, so I didn't have that problem. Now it's like some intaller bar that shows estimated time, but it freezes sometimes and then shows it will take couple weeks longer.Don't get this review wrong. It is fun. The story is well written, the humour is entertaining, the graphics are cool and it's just plain fun. Telltale Game is doing a great job. It is me - I need a break, unless they come up with something new and fresh. Or finished.7/10"

While I did enjoy the story in the pre-sequel the game itself was more about loot than story. This is the polar opposite, all story, and I find that really more what I was looking for.Building upon the story of three highly successful games, we no longer have to farm for loots. Instead we have a narrative for real fans of the series, bringing back our most loved characters in both comedy and drama while introducing a few new ones. While this Telltale Games 'game' is more of a television series than an actual game, it actually is more moving than many series I've watched.It's very short but hilarious and fun.

As for the graphics it fits perfectly, telltale likes to use your lower res cartoony style graphics which actually is a huge benefit for Borderlands because of it's cell shaded art style. Because of these factors coinciding the game actually looks very very pretty which I believe is another visceral aspect when talking about a point and click adventure game.

This isn't an action game.  There are quicktime events, but they're manageable.  I always felt like I had plenty of time to perform the maneuver, and being that I'm 44, I ain't as quick as I once was.The characters are enjoyable, and I like them and care about what happens to them.  The dialog options are funny, and never punish you too much for choosing the funniest but least recommendable reply.I only have two complaints about this game:1.  I kinda felt it would have been better to have FEWER Borderlands/Borderlands 2 characters in the game.  Sometimes it reminded me of those 80s sitcoms that would bring celebrities onto the show, and have smarmy moments when everybody would fall all over themselves because ""Oh, look!  A celebrity!""It's a fan service.  I get that.  But I felt it distracted from the story a bit.  I would have rather they stayed with all original characters and just had maybe one or two characters from the games.I didn't mind Handsome Jack because you can never get too much Handsome Jack.  He's the awesomest character ever ... though I admit he's not QUITE as funny here as in BL2.I also didn't mind Athena because I haven't played The Pre-Sequel, so I didn't feel it was too much.2.  Second complaint:  I sometimes had the feeling that although ""[Insert character name] will remember what you said."", that my choices and dialogs didn't really matter to the plot.  It changed minor things, or it affected the next line of dialog, but I kept getting the feeling that no matter what I decided to do, the outcome wasn't going to change much.This is a gripe I had with Walking Dead.  TWD was an amazing game (not to mention 'amazingly depressing'), but it was a minor flaw that I never felt I had a big impact on the plot.I realize that's very hard to do, but it would have been cool to feel I had more control.I won't really know for certain until I play again, but it would be nice.But these are quibbles.  I'd give this game a 95/100 just because the story and characters are just so entertaining!"

Telltale has never really had the focus on gameplay so you have to discount that mechanically its the same tried and true formula, that basically works for something this narratively focused.  However, that design choice has begun to feel formulaic, and has frankly bored me out of finishing some of the telltale games I've bought.  But within the borderlands universe you have the option of not being so grim, and kinda just have a good time in an insane universe.  I've never laughed as hard as I have while playing a game probably ever.  Never would I thought I would have shouted ""DUMPY"" at the top of my lungs while playing a point and click adventure.

Honestly, I do not recommend this game to anyone who wants a game with awesome gameplay but I would instead recommend this game to a person who is a Borderlands or is interested one of the best stories every told in video gaming. The story of this game was really amazing as it made players make tough decisions that actually made a huge impact on the story however there were sometimes where the story would drag on and get uninteresting. The gameplay in this is like every other telltale game a standard point and click but, we don't play a telltale game for it's gameplay but instead it's master crafted story. For the 13 dollars I spent on this game during the steam sale I would say it's money well spent. All in all I highly recommend this game and if you are a Borderlands fan this is a must buy.

It follows the same gameplay pattern first seen on The Walking Dead game with over the top presentation and a very well written and very funny story. It has plenty of QTEs, almost no items to grab and no open world exploration besides the rails of the scene being played.. Graphics 8.5/10 - The graphics in this game are very close to the style used on The Walking Dead, therefore it is good, not great. I give this game one extra point due to its great over the top presentation.. Audio 10/10 - The audio is simply great. The music clearly matches the scenes in play and what a great soundtrack this game has. The voice-over work is algo very good.. Gameplay 8/10 - The usual telltale gameplay. Expect next to zero inventory items and puzzles, little exploration and lots of QTE. Do not get me wrong, I like this type of gameplay for a change. This game gets an extra point due to its ""death"" scenes. Truly funny.. Story 10/10 - Intriguing well crafted story. This is usually where the greatest telltale strength lies. This game is no exception. Lots of misteries, chases, funny heroes and NPCs. I really laugh out loud from time to time playing this game.. Overall 9/10 - I believe this game to be the best game from telltale. If you like the games they make, this one is no-brainer. If you are in doubt, give it a try.

BORDERLANDS, and made it BORING.But I completed that first chapter, and gave it some months... then I returned to it for Episode 2, and I'm glad I did.Don't get me wrong, it fixed almost NOTHING of what I disliked, but it started giving more stuff that I did like.To me, by far the best part wasInteracting with Handsome Jack, that was GOLD, that was what motivated me and arguably what softened my heart to the rest of the game.Sure, most jokes were pathetic, and thatGortys robot, ♥♥♥♥ it to hell.But, again, as I kept playing, I increasingly had more fun, I found good jokes more often and was more involved with it, with sticking to whatever I wanted Rhys and Fiona to be like, and in the end I am glad I played it, it is by no means a masterpiece, and any of the real Borderlands games are way better, but it was a lot of fun.Does this positive review seem like a negative one? that's cause that is my closing idea of this game, it was better than it deserved to be, like, it deserved to SUCK based on what I felt about Episode 1, but it didn't, and I am glad that I played it, even if I am probably never gonna play it again.I do not think that anyone that made it to the end can say that they HATE this game, but I definetly can't say that I LOVE it either, even if I'm still kinda emotional and hyped about that ending.Take this review as you may, and give it a shot if it's on discount and you are a huge fan of Borderlands wanting to see just a little bit more out of that world (Until Borderlands 3 comes, if ever)."

Besides the occasional piece here and a quicktime moment there, there isn't much. And that's okay. They obviously didn't feel the need for puzzles in the game. Other than that, it's your usual Telltales stuff. Nothing bad.Music: The score is pretty great when you hear it. It has nice little memorable tunes all over. But the real fun is the licensened stuff they add in every episode, and it's great. They kept that good ol' Borderlands tradition, and for this game, went with some 70's/80's homage synth pop. All the tunes are pretty great, and ""To the Top"" and ""Busy Earnin'"" seem to be my favorite of the bunch.Graphics: Originally, this game didn't look too great. And that was fine. I mean, in a game with hundreds of different diolougue and animation options, that's pretty accepted. However, I seem to find with every new episode release, the models and textures appear more refined and overall just better looking.Story (no spoilers): Writing this right after playing episode 4... Wow. Just wow. This is some of the best writing, characters, and plot Telltale let alone Borderlands has ever seen. Your choices matter more than ever, even in the first episode. I haven't been this in love or involved in a game's story since Bioshock Infinite. When they weren't creating new characters, we were seeing different sides of already beloved Borderlands characters. It still of course, keeps that Borderlands charm and even sneeks in quite a few referances to past games, especially Pre-Sequel. Any Borderlands or Telltale fan would love this. If your both, then well, this is even more of a treat.I might be a little bias because I love Borderlands so much, but I honest to god can't find anything I don't like about this game. As a Borderlands fan since the sequel, I love this game. I haven't played many Telltale games before, but after this, I will have. Absoshootly recommend."

The graphics aren't anything different than other Telltale games, but match up perfectly to the normal Borderlands games, and so it feels incredibly real.What really shines in this is not so much the story, which is very good, but the characters. Every one is memorable and will make you invested, and seeing them become closer and stronger is an incredible experience.

This game may be the closest I've ever felt to being in an interactive movie which is a crazy level of immersion. There's great music throughout the game but in particular it really completes a lot of the cutscenes and makes it resonate with you.Oh, and it's funny! Having grown up on games like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, this is something that's really important to me. Tales has had me laughing plenty both at the dialogue and at events in the game.There also seems to be a lot of divergent storytelling, I've not actually replayed it yet so I can't confirm but from my initial playthrough it feels you could get quite a different expereicnce depending on your actions.If you have any interest in Borderlands, Telltale or just adventure games, you should seriously consider getting this game.

Even tough all the praise I gave this game, that one point, even tough its just a tiny thing but still, that one point goes off from the fact that sometimes when I was going to make a choise, the cursor was so small and it blended so easily to the background that sometimes I had hard time finding it, which really made decision making hard, because half the time that was given me to think I used to finding my cursor.Thankfully that small minus part only affected my gameplay VERY slightly, Tales from the Borderlands is a great game, and you should definetly buy it!"

,Recommended,330830,18603839,"Posted: 21 October, 2015",all,ShadowRFox,"Telltale did it again. They took a good story and made a great game out of it. tales from the Borderlands take place after the events of Borderland 2 and dip in to some event from Borderland the Presequel. So if you haven't played any of the Borderland games you'll find yourself missing a lot of the jokes and humor.Gameplay: Typical point and click advernture where you go from set to set interacting with the various items and environment to progress the story along. You'll also be presented with choices that can have a ranging effect whether other characters will trust your character to even if a character live or die.These choices are the game real strong point. Sometime a choice may see really obvious but may have horrible consequences later on and other choices can just leave you screwed no matter which option you choose. This is Telltale real strong point with their adventure game. They always bring such hard choices to the table.Final Comment: Honestly this is a fun game and any fan of the Borderland franchise will love this. Although those new to the Borderland series will find themselves not recognizing returing characters and missing some of the humor, they shouldn't let that keep them from having a lot of fun with this game. Before this game came out I wasn't really sure if I would get a Borderland 3 if one was released. Now I find myself hoping for it to be released soon."

The new people you meet are as insane as you would expect them to be, but still are plausible characters - by Borderlands standards. The intros and outros are spoken by Marcus and even the interface looks like a long-time friend. The music by Emerson-Johnson takes its inspiration from the original games' intros as well as the games itselves and underlines the story tweaks expertly. And last but not least you have to love the voice acting.The story takes you to new and old places on Pandora and Helios and takes every possible and impossible turn.

,Recommended,330830,18663949,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,EnduringBeta,"If you've played a Borderlands game or two (or more) and you enjoyed the story as much as the combat, then this TellTale experience is just for you.Tales from the Borderlands fleshes out corners of Pandora and its people in satisfying ways. The two main characters are Rhys, a dissatisfied Hyperion employee up on a space station, and Fiona, a smart con artist scraping by on the surface. I came to value them and other new characters just as much as I did the established ones from other games I met along the way.What's nice about TftB is that its story matters. Big changes happen, and I can certainly imagine these new characters showing up in important roles or especially playable main characters in future main titles. Influencing and witnessing the development of both this game's plot and the narrative that transcends an individual game is really rewarding.The game has a fantastic sense of humor and style in all the right places. Much like the main Borderlands games, each episode's title sequence begins with a visually stunning montage and a killer soundtrack that just oozes cool. The writing is often hilariously brilliant and frequently irreverant. It's self-aware, gets caught in amusing circles, and manages to be sincerely touching and dramatic.You'll note I haven't said much about the mechanics or controls, because as a TellTale game, that's not really much of a feature. You make dialog decisions with Fiona and Rhys throughout the game, which allow you to explore characters and take on situations partly in a way you choose. Quick-time events often occur, requiring you to avoid danger and engage in combat. None of this is very hard, because that's not the point. Some triumphant moments feel great, and some commands and choices are difficult to execute because of what they're asking you to do. Sometimes the mechanics are unexpectedly clever, as well.The game rewards picking things that make sense and paying attention. Rarely is there no dialog choice that you'd actually want to say, and then silence is just perfect! What you say influences how people will treat you going forward, which makes for a surprise if you tell off someone you thought would die who comes back...!The only drawbacks to this game are technical. Sometimes the animation is a little clunky or stutters, and the limitations of the TellTale engine compared to Borderlands' is noticeable, but not distracting. You get used to it.The voice acting is great, the writing is great, and the story is funny and has weight. It's everything you want from a Borderlands game without the combat."

,Recommended,330830,18669018,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,Bizargh,"Full Season Review (No Spoilers)(Moments after the playthrough)WHAT. AN. ADVENTURE!From the moment Gearbox Software gave Telltale Games the materials & tools to build something with theirBorderlandsuniverse, Telltale Games has done nothing but turn it into gold as the Season progressed. And in doing so, they've not only outdone Gearbox's previous work regarding the narrative aspect (Something they've gone on record to say Telltale Games were able, free & equipped to do so, and by gracious rarity, they were so right!), but I believe they've outdone themselves!It's a ""choice 'n' click"" in the same vein as their series ofThe Walking Deadthat broadcast their name far & wide to those that never heard of their previous pursuits & successes, but more or less a bringing together of Telltale's more humour-oriented heritage of graphic-adventures such asSam & Max,Tales of Monkey Island&Back to the Future(All I've yet to dive into myself) and their post-Walking Dead pursuits of engaging & mature experiences such asThe Wolf Among Us&Game of Thrones(The former I'm still trying to make time for), and here comesTales from the Borderlands, the perfect opportunity to blend them both!Unfortunately, I am not able to find many words to speak of the game that do not potentially spoil this interactive narrative experience, but I'll go with this:Telltale has been able to refine their formula of timed conversation decisions & quicktime action events to a point that they have been able to keep you surprised in numerous ways, and might be if not the first game to display the QTE as a mechanic in an undeniably positive light, then the game to provide the best examples of them in practice! And with a few new quirks added in to keep with theBorderlandstheme, such as an inventory whose contents can possibly matter across the season or a wallet of hard-to-acquire cash can lead to some cosmetic decisions that'll stick across a player's season playthrough.And as for characters, I can safely tell you, Telltale Games creates yet another utterly brilliant cast of their own and even gives an uncanny amount of love to a number of returning faces from theBorderlandsgames that gave them an opportunity to shine brighter than before!Being one familiar & having enjoyed theBorderlandsgames already (More of the story & humour than the lootin' 'n' raidin' type, even if the humour typically is referencially reliant), I had an advantage when it came to jumping into this tale, but the extra context definitely isn't a necessity, as despite taking place in the aftermath of the events ofBorderlands 2, you'll be exploring Pandora with a fresh pair of eyes & meeting many new faces in this shining star of a spin-off.There have been many games I've played that have left me in outrageous laughter, breathlessness, disgust, awe, sobbing & tears, or even brought on a cringe or any mixture of the previous. But Telltale was able to accomplish this not only across the season, but even make me experience all of these feelings in the time-frame of a single episode. A rare rollar-coaster ride of a video game I boarded, that much I can give it! And unlike a much more emotionally harrowing experience one often may have withThe Walking Dead, this one I simply can't wait to jump back on & go for it again!If you're a fan of the story, characters and/or world of theBorderlandsgames, this is a very strongly recommended title as Telltale Games may have provided the best place to enjoy them, and set a high bar for Gearbox to meet in developing futureBorderlandstitles.If you are one whom enjoys the interactive narrative experiences of the likes of Telltale Games' creations, I can safely assure you that you cannot go wrong with this one!If you are looking for a story that will take you on an adventure, than this game may be noThe Witcher,The Elder Scrolls,FalloutorMass Effect, but it's still got one on offer, and this one has been one of the better ones I've been able to make time for in a good while!"

The characters are perfect, the humour is genuinely hilarious, and the story’s engaging. Most surprising of all, though, are the feels: for all its gratuitous action and comic violence, TFTBL is a game with a huge heart and a lot of emotion.-Faithful to Borderlands (somehow): Despite the total absence of first-person gunplay, the game does an amazing job staying true to the Borderlands spirit. Telltale resisted the urge to water TFTBL down into a generic sci-fi, but equally they knew when to rein it in just a little.-It's got style: From the voice acting to the comic-style graphics, the presentation is first rate. It’s not perfect (one or two animations are a little off), but it’s damn close. Be sure to check out the community 'guides' for the game's soundtrack.-Fantastic story: Did I mention the story’s bloody amazing? The Loader Bot sidekick has more charm and bad-assitude than the main characters of most other games; the jokes don’t just elicit the occasional chuckle, but actual out-loud laughs. Also, as an added bonus, the ending doesn’t suck balls – Broken Age, I’m looking at you when I say that.CONS:-Limited gameplay: Like other Telltale offerings, it plays out more like an interactive comic than a proper game. There’s little (if any) gaming skill required, so it’s not for everyone.-Prior knowledge helps: There are a few cameo appearances and in-jokes you might not get if you haven’t played Borderlands before. It’s not too bad, but at the very least, you may want to watch the trailers for the other BL games, so that you can at least recognise the guest appearances.-Maybe a tiny bit short?: Weighing in at 10-12 hours for a single play-through, it’s not all that long… which is a shame, because those hours are an unmitigated joy to play.FULL REVIEW:It’s hard to say this without sounding gushy and insincere, but screw it: this is actually one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had. I went in with profound scepticism, suspecting that TFTBL was just a last-ditch attempt to cash in on a flagging franchise. Now, it’s the game I want non-gamers to play, so that they realise that it can be every bit as clever, emotional, and engrossing as other mediums.Plot-wise, TFTBL centres on the interlocking stories of two opposites: Fiona, a local con-artist looking to escape her hardship through ever bigger scams, and Rhys, a suit in the employ of the painfully amoral Hyperion mega-corporation. As you’ve probably gleamed from the trailer, the two meet to exchange a suitcase of money for a prized Vault key – a priceless artefact used to unlock alien technology – but neither of them are prepared for the commotion they stir up. In true Borderlands fashion, everything goes spectacularly wrong when a band of psychotic bandits show up, and things only get worse from there. Rhys and his accomplice are hopelessly unprepared for the planet’s everything-wants-to-kill-you-all-the-time lifestyle; Fiona and her crew are completely out of their depth when the planet’s bigger, deadlier powerbrokers start getting involved.It sounds like a typical underdog story, but TFTBL is anything but: after three games of playing as the nigh-invincible Vault Hunters, Fiona and Rhys offer a clever, refreshing perspective on how normal(ish) people struggle in the insane and violent world of Borderlands. In fact, engaging as the story is, it’s the characters that really make TFTBL shine. The two lead protagonists are charismatic but endearingly flawed, and they’re backed up by a cast of truly unforgettable NPCs – even the disposable NPCs are hugely personable, treated to top-notch voice acting and the trademark Borderland’s freeze-frame intro. Even the clichés are done with such heart and gusto that it’s impossible not to grin the whole time.Telltale and Gearbox have remained surprising faithful to the Borderlands we all know and love (well, occasionally enjoyed), but equally they’ve known when to tone things down just a notch or two: the fart jokes are gone, but the mayhem and irrepressible madness of Borderlands is left intact. Similarly, the visuals and lore are unmistakably Borderlands in origin, but at its heart, TFTBL is an adventure game. You’ll point and click at things, pick up items to solve simplistic puzzles, and navigate dialogue trees… but it’s not just a matter of game mechanics. TFTBL also feels like an adventure: from the steel halls of Hyperion’s headquarters to underground shanty towns, an arctic Garden of Eden to a bandit dubstep motor/murder rally, the game spans a huge range of vivid, vibrant locations. In fact, TFTBL goes a long, long way towards enriching the lore of the Borderlands setting, giving a sense of life to the various locations which, until now, were only a background to mindlessly slaughter bandits against.It’s not a perfect game, though. For those of you who haven’t played a Telltale production before, here’s a word of warning: you don’t get much gameplay in your… um… game. 90% of player inputs centre on picking dialogue options or steering your character through some fairly straightforward puzzle sections, and barring a few quick time events, it’s near impossible outright fail. This isn’t a game that’ll ever test your skill: instead, it plays out like a movie where the viewer directs the major decisions of the lead protagonists.It’s also catered towards people who already played the Borderlands series… which is odd, because the previous BL installments have been the complete opposite of a story rich adventure game. In its defence, most of the main characters are completely original, but there are a few references and plot twists that require prior knowledge. At the very least, I’d recommend watching the trailers for the other games: if you don’t know the main heroes and villains from BL2, there’s one revelation in particular that’ll probably be lost on you. Thankfully, everything else is fairly forgivable, provided you’re not too sensitive about missing one or two in-jokes.All up, it’ll probably take around 11 hours to complete the season, which is a fraction too short by most gaming standards (but about right for a TV series, I guess). The trade-off is that TFTBL forgoes all the usual padding and grinding: it never feels like it’s wasting your time with pointless filler material, and no one scene overstays its welcome, so there’s a hell of a lot of story crammed in to those dozen or so hours. What’s more, there’s a decent chance you’ll want to do a second playthrough at some stage, if only to explore the different decisions that characters can make… or even just because it was so great the first time.These flaws aside, TFTBL is still an exemplar of the Telltale's genre, and one of the best games that’s been offered in a long time. It’s got explosions, emotion, and one of the best soundtracks around. It’s got characters that’ll rival any other game or TV series in popular culture. It’s got a finger-gun battle between Rhys and the shadowy legions of Hyperion’s accountancy department. Buy TFTBL, because it’s the new standard against which all other adventure games are measured.CLOSING REMARKS:After a couple of near-misses with The Walking Dead and the Wolf Among Us, Telltale’s formula finally gets it right, and the result is a must-play for any Borderland’s fan. Hell, even if you’re not a BL fan, add it to the wishlist and pick it up on sale. There’s a damn good reason why all the user reviews are so positive.10/10 (no, really)"

Some characters make cameos from the Borderlands games (BL1 and Pre-sequel) which may be confusing if you haven't played either, but anything relevant to the plot is self-contained.tl;dr This is an amazing game with lots of love put into it.

I thought that there was no way that they could pull it off, despite how much I enjoyed their Walking Dead. So, during the 2015 Christmas Sale, I bought the whole season because I craved more Telltale and I wasn't expecting much. Then they completly blew me the **** away. I am so glad that I was so very, very wrong about this game.I started to realize that I loved this near-perfect, if not perfect, game once I finished the entire season. I cared about every character, the soundtrack was phenomenal, and it was hilarious. Really, this was one hell of a ride, and Telltale was the crazy conductor that was clearly having as much fun as I was. They so brilliantly used the wonderful, yet brutal world that Gearbox and 2K has crafted, and even expanded it in ways that this can be seen as much more than a spin-off.In addition, I was suprised that my choices mattered in some ways that I never suspected, and it truly made it feel like my  very own story on Pandora. Furthermore, my relationships with characters changed in ways that felt natural and well-written. You know why? That's because Telltale can really tell a tale, guys.I'm also glad that I'm not the only one that came out of this adventure proclaiming that this is Telltale Games' best one yet.

Instead of putting so much pressure on making choices matter (only to have people die anyway, like in The Walking Dead), Borderlands is upfront that choices are mostly about customization, like what weapons to use, or clothes to wear, or insults to say, or companions to bring along for the ride.

Not so in TFTB, the plot is full of twists that will keep you guessing until the very end.For newcomers, TFTB is a perfect entry point to the series to see what the Borderlands world is all about. Series veterans will find a love letter to everything great about Borderlands, full of references to past games and beloved characters."

,Recommended,330830,20259285,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Nico,"Tales from the borderlands is a laugh aloud cinematic experience. It isn't that much of a 'game' more of a movie that you can change and effect scenes. You play as the two main characters Rhys, the Hyperion desk jockey looking to be the next handsome Jack and Fiona the con artist . The characters interactions are fabulous and will have you laughing. There are many many characters you get to meet and you enjoy every single one of them. There are twists and turns I gurantee you will not see coming. Voice acting is also really good. The game has some super gross moments in it which are hillarious .At times it feels like your choices don't matter and that gets frustrating especially when you choose to be the good guy but you get forced to be the bad guy and everyone leaves you to die but in the end there was to much positive to outweigh the bad . In the corporate world of Hyperion on Helix you settle differences with finger gun fights. You get to have a finger gun fight with 60 guys. I mean c'mon bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.You will be laughing the whole way threw. 9/10"

,Recommended,330830,20278380,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,HuntedStar,"Tales of the Borderlands had been tempting to buy since release - whilst I never really enjoyed the Borderlands games and gave up on them quickly, I had thoroughly enjoyed other Telltale games (Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones) and so finally bit the bullet when the game was on sale. Of the many games I've bought in Steam sales (many of which remain unplayed), this is almost certainly the one I'd recommend the most.Positive points:-Plot: The plot of the game follows the story of an ambitious employee of the hated Hyperion corporation and a young con-woman looking to make big money. Throughout the story, constant plot-twists kept me on edge, trying to determine who I could trust and who I could betray. It always felt like things were so close to going right, but victory was just out of reach, and this made the game almost impossible to put down.-Characters: I couldn't name a single character I disliked. Whilst some characters felt a little stereotyped, everyone was interesting and had their own motivations. In particular, mention goes out to Vasquez, Scooter and a certain holographic madman, all of whom were very memorable characters. Of course, not everyone makes it to the end of the story, but every death felt sad and it was easy to build attachments to many of the characters, even feeling sympathy with many of the villains.-Soundtrack: I rarely pay much attention to the soundtrack of games, but this one really stuck out to me. The songs used really seemed to fit the world they were in, adding to the impression of the huge world, an epic adventure, and the overall setting. The Episode 4 Intro Credits were one of my highlights of the game, simply because the music seemed to fit the scene so well.-Humour: If there was one thing I adored about this game, it was the humour. Despite feeling like an adventure of epic proportions, there was almost always (except for a few seriously emotional moments) a light-hearted feeling to it. The number of references to popular culture I could pick out (and assuredly the many I missed), as well as the characters' querks, their relationships and their dialogue. I found myself constantly laughing throughout the game, which is something I can't recall any other game inspiring, yet the humour didn't take away from the game at all.Negative points:-Choices: Playing through the game for the first time, it feels like a lot of the choices you make are huge, game-changing decisions. However, having looked online at the consequences of alternative choices, it seems like much of the game plays out the same way regardless of what you pick - very few characters fates appear to have been determinant and many of the choices you make are primarily cosmetic. The game's money system (which is only present on one of the characters) felt like an odd inclusion which didn't really fit like it particularly fit the game (though looking back I did enjoy the ability to customise character and vehicle appearances). Whilst the importance of choices may be similar in other Telltale games, I noticed it particularly in this game, though admittedly not so much during actual gameplay.Overall:Quite unexpectedly, I fell in love with a game I had thought would be simply a way to waste a few hours. It will almost certainly encourage me to return to the Borderlands world (though no promises on staying there long). Regardless, Telltale have created a game which far outscores their others (at least for me), and given me many gaming memories I doubt I shall be forgetting any time soon. The game isn't all that long (took me 14 hours with a few restarts on chapters where I found myself unhappy with my choices), but every minute is a laugh-filled emotional rollercoaster which keeps you hooked from the catchy start to the fulfilling ending. A must-buy, particularly in the sales."

Instead, Borderlands characters make fun of you, or your character comments on his/her stupidity himself in a way that is always fresh and fun and manages to drive the plot. As per usual of the franchise, there are pop culture references out the♥♥♥♥♥and none of them feel forced in a bad way.

Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 1 got me interested in this game because Borderlands 1 certainly didn't. The first three episodes made me laugh harder than most comedies do but then the fourth and fifth episodes brought some much needed weight to the story.

Silly characters. I haven't played beyond the first play through so I don't know how much of the story is affected by your choices, but there is a part of the end where some major choices play a factor. All 5 chapters are out, so if you managed to get this game on sale, every penny is well spent. Even worth the full price in my opinion."
,Recommended,330830,18832864,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Big Buff Cheeto Puff,"Telltale Games does it again.TL;DR: This is their best story since Season 1 of The Walking Dead. Final recommendation: pick this up at full price as soon as you can. You don't need any prior Borderlands knowledge to enjoy this story.Story:As someone that hasn't played any of the Borderlands games (save for about 10 hours or so in BL2), I was kind of scared going into this that I wouldn't understand anything. There are a few little references here and there, but a complete Borderlands novice like myself was able to grasp everything and fully enjoy the story.You follow the story of Rhys, a Hyperion company man looking to screw over a higher up who screwed you over, and you also play as Fiona, a Pandoran-born con artist that's always looking for the next big deal that'll set her, her sister, and their con-artist mentor up for life. Without giving away much of the story, you end up making new friends and enemies from both Hyperion and Pandora, your little ragtag group of friends up in a race for a Vault against bandits and corporations alike.Critically speaking, there is actually quite a bit of character development here, especially with the way you can control the way your characters develop. Are you a cold-hearted, callous, and overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kinda guy? There's dialogue options for that. Do you want to create more enemies than friends? Go right ahead. Your choices in this actually effect how everyone reacts to you, and Telltale has masterfully worked choice into this story. Because of the development of the characters, you'll definitely get attached to them. When a character dies that was kind-hearted and didn't deserve to die, or one that you particularly liked, you'll feel really sad. I actually cried in the finale. Real tears.Oh, and did I mention humor? There's TONS of it. And it's very tastefully done; many a time was I laughing out loud.Gameplay:The standard point-and-click adventure that is Telltale's trademark. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The quicktime elements are smooth, and while they aren't particularly challenging, they're definitely fun.What I hated:Uh, there's no Season 2 of Tales from the Borderlands announced. That's literally it. I honestly can't think of any negatives to this game.Final recommendation:110% worth every penny at full price. Pick. It. Up."

Probably the best implementation of the standard Telltale adventure game formula, it still struggles with illusory choices at times. This isn't necessarily a problem, because while the storyline remains generally linear, the choices made do matter when it comes to establishing the personality and relationships between the characters.The writing is fantastic, the soundtrack is absolutely perfect, and it manages to maintain it's energy and humor throughout the whole ride. Clocking in around ten hours, its like a fantastic TV show more than a game, but it's well worth the price. I can definitely see myself revisiting this game again in the future unlike past Telltale titles. I can only hope that a Season 2 is eventually made to give us more of Rhys, Fiona, and the true star of the show LOADERBOT."

Tales from the Borderlands is an ongoing episodic point-and-click video game based on the Borderlands series. Through the five episodes you encounter mind boggling decisions, mass violence, jokes and much more to meet your full satisfaction. You play as two main protagonists; Rhys, a Hyperion employee on the Hyperion space base and Fiona,  a con artist on Pandora with your main objective being, well opening another vault...From excellent music choices to start of each episode to cameos from previous personalities from all three of the Borderland games you grasp the nostalgic feel of the good old days of binge playing these games like I did. With season one wrapping up with *SPOILER*..............................our main protagonists unlocking the hidden treasure of the vault and disappearing into thin air, this is to remain bugging the fans of the series and constantly checking on the updates so when we can get the countdown for season 2 all prime and ready.

It introduced some familiar faces, some seen in a different light and really added a whole 'nother layer to the universe, especially with exploring Hyperion and Atlus more.

I never finished Back to the Future and Game of Thrones. As of the date writing this post, their last game is Batman and my feelings over it is mixed.For that reason, I have always ignored Tales from the Borderlands. I kept telling myself that Telltale games are getting tired and Borderlands games doesnt really hold a decent story at all. I only got motivated to buy this game because of the winter sales offer and curiosity.But oh boy, this game really goes beyond your expectations. It has one of the best characters Telltale has ever done. The set pieces, funny dialoug, the world, sense of adventure, and voice acting are all of excellent quality. Sure, the engine graphically is showing its age and some of the gameplay mechanics are starting to be annoying such as inconsistency of the character's movement speed, inventory management and lack of puzzle solving.In any case, this game is one of the best Telltale has done, along with the first Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.

Contains QTEs, Feelings, and really good music.Tales from the Borderlands is pretty typical in gameplay for a Telltale game. You walk around a space and interact with characters, solving simple puzzles and making dialogue choices in a limited time frame along with completing any more complicated action through  a quick time event. Overall, I don't consider the gameplay to be the biggest draw.The best part of this game is the story and the characters who occupy it. Borderlands games have you stepping into the shoes of competent, superpowered, and heavily damaged characters who proceed to shoot and loot their way through an entire planet, In Tales, you end up playing two sides of a story from characters who might as well have been 'little people' in a traditional Borderlands game, but their stories engage you, and they feel like a part of this world.The scenario is simple. Its a western/confidance game/heist/comedy with everyone looking to get out ahead and off the hellscape that is Pandora. As the stakes get higher and the things the characters are asked to accomplish get more outlandish, the humor and drama rise accordingly. I have never laughed as often playing a game, and the the shift from laugh out loud to utter seriousness keeps you on your toes and kept me engaged.There are multiple ways to play through the scenarios, with a little variability on the way to the ending, but I enjoy replaying this game even if I'm making the same choices.And I'm going to give a final thought on the music. Each episode is opened by a song accompanying the intro that gets better and better as it goes on. Episode 4's intro is my favorite."

I mean, a Telltale Borderlands game? come on.I was so wrong.This game rocks your socks off. It is one of the most fun ""games"" I ever... watched. It isn't even really a ""game"" in the traditional sense, it's more like an interactive movie, a journey full of over the top Borderlands humor and wonderful characters. The protagonists aren't your usual badass vault hunters, they are pretty much just regular people who happen to experience the adventure of their lives. As the awesome story unfolds before you, you really begin to sympathize with them. During 11 hours of ""gameplay"" (though it felt much longer) the main characters and their friends navigate through all kinds of trouble, fun and... sadness. Yes, this game features a few really emotional, outright heartbreaking scenes that almost made me cry. On the other hand some of the scenes are so much fun and over the top that they'll keep you laughing for hours, like the finger gunfight scene on Helios, which is probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen.Tales From The Borderlands is a masterpiece and it is one of those games that leave you really sad when it's over. I hope some of the characters will appear in future Borderlands games. I'm especially fond of Fiona, would love to see her as a playable character in Borderlands 3.Despite its short length, Tales From The Borderlands is one of the best games of the series and I recommend it to pretty much anyone.

This is not what you were looking for.This is a point-and-click adventure game. Lots of talking, lots of quick-time-events, and no combat to speak of.It's definitely fun to experience the Borderlands universe in a different way, but if you've recently played any of the other games you will find it very unfulfilling if you were hoping for another FPS.By its own merits however; It is well executed, funny, and essentially enjoyable - if a little slow at the start."

Telltale knocked it out of the park, nailing the comedy fans want, while keeping it a compelling, serious story. The chemistry between the characters is fantastic, which shouldn't be a surprise with the talented voice acting cast (Nolan North, Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey), along with some familiar faces from past games. Also a nice change of pace for Borderlands fans, this being a story-driven experience and not a shooting game, as it's nice to just focus on characters without the loot grind the series sometimes feels like.So yea, if you like Borderlands and can stand to not be shooting things for a couple hours, its a must-have. If you liked past Telltale games but have no connection to the Borderlands series though, I'm not entirely sure how much you'll get out of it, as it very much relies on knowing the past games/characters. It'd definitley be fun, but certain moments may not carry the same weight with no memory of past experiences with the characters on screen."

I believe Telltale hasn't produced a proper graphical adventure since the third season of Sam & Max.What tales is is an interactive movie. And at that, it excels.It doesn't have lots of gameplay, since most of your time is spent either watching stuff unfold, choosing dialogue choices, or answering quicktime events (and there are tons of those), but the story it tells is a beautiful one and easily the best I have experienced in a Telltale game. So if you're on the fence about this game, do be warned that you'll mostly get a long movie where you get to make the odd choice. Also, be warned that this one long movie has a better script than most of the stuff Hollywood churns out each year."

You don't need to be fan of Borderlands, but it adds to the humor and some of the excitement. Some of the tightest and funniest writing I have seen in awhile, not just compared to video games  with this style but also movies and tv shows. They captured the feel of Borderlands while bringing it to another level. The fast past quips is a welcome change from the constant drama that sometimes overwhelms me with Telltale games, but the rarity of emotional parts and the attachment formed from the funny parts oddly gave the dramatic parts more weight. I highly suggest this game, and even if you don't play it you should at least check out a playthrough without commentary."

Borderland's story kicked up when the second game came out with the main villian being the leader of a company named Hyperion, Handsome Jack. His goal is to find the Vault and to awaken the monster within it, The Warrior. Whilst doing that, he is there to remake Pandora into a world he dreams and not the savage planet it is. However four Vault Hunters, Axton, Zer0, Salavador and Maya defeated the masked man which they end up taking his life. So it seemed...Tales from the Borderlands take place on Panadora after Jack's defeat which makes this the last game in the serise [Borderlands, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2 and Tales from the Borderlands]. However unlike most Telltale games you take the role of not one but two main characters.Fiona:A Con-Artist who has grown up on the bandit ridden planet Pandora, with her sister Sasha and their father figure Felix. She takes deals seriously and her personality is professional and caring to the ones she loves.Rhys:Is a Hyperion worker who was currently demotted to trash duty by his new boss, Vasquez, which he wanted to what he desvered. He and his partners Vaughn and Yvette team up to help Rhys by ratting out that Vasquez buying a Vault Key. His character is funny and he is your typically geek character which I love!The story follows the two teaming up despite their differences. Players are put into both characters shoes, choosing to hate or stick together the two. Telltale is well known for making players grow attached to their characters and stories which they did espically in this. If your a person who loves story based games this is most recommended espically! Trust me your will feel so many emotions in this game it isn't funny, well the game will make you laugh."

Sure, it's fun, less buggy and true to the Borderlands series. Made me shed few tears here and there. But that's all to it. Like a checklist they included what makes their games great. Unfortunately, it lacks soul. Most of the time I didn't care what choice I would make - there are lots of them but with little to no context. Telltale should stop doing that good/bad type of characters - usually people just pick one type and stick to it. That makes most of the options pointless, cause you're are not going to go breaking bad in the middle of the season and that leave you with only one option to choose. The only ""challenge"" is to find what letter did they assigned to your prefered style option. It would be easier just to assign good options to X, bad to B, neutral to A and you could just go on without moving your finger. Making the outcome mostly the same for all of them does not help either. There is no places to explore - or if there it is you are limited to some casual go from from here to there in an empty environment - it wouldn't make difference if they just made it a cut scene. You could barely interact with other characters - no time to know them or even care what happens. It's like FIFA for choice based games - no innovation, just stick to  the formula and go with  the little effort as possible. I don't care if one episode has 50 or just two choices - if I can't remember the name of any of the secondary characters, then it's just bland. I haven't played GoT or Minecraft yet, but I really hope they are not the same shallow clones of this type of formula. Verdict: go play this game if you are TTG fan, but don't get surprised if you get disappointed."

Borderlands was such an incredibly fun game from start to finish (see my review for “Borderlands 2”), so when I found out that the developer Telltale Games had released an episodic adventure game with the same decision-making flavour as some of my top games in the past couple of years (see my reviews for “The Wolf Among Us” and “Game of Thrones”), I was ecstatic. Tales from the Borderlands did not disappoint.+ Outstanding voice acting, well-written plot & character development, fabulous soundtrack, hilarious one-liners (literal ‘lol’ moments) with very dark undertones, and captivating title and finale sequences in each chapter. And let’s not forget the absolutely most epic gun battle of all time… and not a single shot was fired.

,Recommended,330830,19544111,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Rye Roen,"If you’d prefer a video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFrhl9TuXtwNow, I’m not a very big fan of comedies. I don’t really like the idea of a movie or video game story, that only exists to make you laugh. On the surface, Tales seems like it’s just that. But underneath the superbly written layer of humour, is, a host of charming characters, and surprisingly dark, and tender moments. Sure, the engine still has those moments where it just seems to seize up and snap like an old hard drive, and for much of the game the choices don’t matter, it carries with it the same luggage that other Telltale games do, but there’s so much it does that separates it from it’s siblings.<h1> Presentation </h1>The art-style is borderlands-y, which seems to be Telltale’s forte recently. I personally think it looks great, but I know that there are people out there who are tired of Telltale’s comic book look. The thing about the presentation that has blown me away this time though, is the creative direction they have taken with the cinematography. You’ll notice the camera whizzing around, sections of slow-motion, and the action is captured extremely well. The designs of the characters are distinct and unique, and the environments lend themselves into that. Where the presentation falls flat is on the technical side of things. On the console I know that there are some frame-drops in areas, and on both the console and PC, the engine tends to run quite poorly. There’s a lot of stuttering in places, and while this isn’t presentation related,; I heard there were some save file losses for people on PC.The score is fantastic, there’s awesome licensed music to go with the wonderful episode intros, very little not to love.<h1> Plot </h1>I mentioned that choices don’t really matter. Like any other Telltale game, they don’t affect the way the overall plot pans out. That said, really more than any other Telltale game before it, I felt like I got the best payoff from the sum of my actions. In the fifth episode, there is a particular moment where some of your choices can open up options that change the way the moments leading up to the ending pan out. That sounds like an odd way of putting it, but I’m dancing around spoilers here. Your choices will not change the ending, but they affect enough elements in the final episode to make you feel like your experience was fairly unique. Other than the final episode, though, your choices are there only to make you feel like you have control over the action when, in reality, you really don’t.But if we’re talking about the plot when it comes to the set story? Incredible. There is very little for me to criticise here. One thing that may have detracted from the stakes, is the fact the story is being told by the two main characters. It means that there is very little to worry about when it comes to them, because you know that, somehow or another, they will survive. Granted, this restriction isn’t placed on any of the other characters, so they certainly could be killed off. The thing is, the story being told this way is so integral, in my opinion, to the curve of the narrative, that the lack of dread for the two main characters was a worthwhile sacrifice.But overall the plot is extremely engaging. Parts of it can be predictable, but then again there were moments I didn’t see coming at all. It ends conclusively with some hints of a sequel, but satisfying none-the-less. Most importantly though, near the end the thing that the characters were fighting for resonated with me entirely. At the end of the game I felt so in line with the characters and their motivations, that I felt myself cheer on the inside for them to win. That’s a really difficult thing to do, and the only other time that Telltale did this for a lot of people was in the first season of The Walking Dead, when Clementine was your motivation, and many many people could get behind that.It’s an extremely powerful thing, when you agree relentlessly with what the characters of a story are doing.<h1> Characters </h1>And of course, the characters need to be incredible in order to form that kind of a connection between the player and the walking pixels on screen. Every single character in Tales is extremely likeable. Some are better than others of course, but even the most boring characters in Tales have charm to them. And I think it’s the humour. I think it’s the way the characters act with one another, and the fact that the writing is so good I found myself in stitches, that really makes it feel like you're hanging out with an old group of friends when you play this game. And so, when one of them is in trouble, you as the player feel entirely emotionally invested in saving those characters.The two weakest characters are the two main characters that you play as. I also think the next weakest are their respective sidekicks. It’s interesting that the characters closest to the player felt the least interesting and compelling to me. They’re not bad characters, and they do interesting things and say funny stuff [STOP], but pale when comparing them to the huge number of colourful side-characters. The four core characters just lack the distinctness of the others. That said, I want to mention again that they are still very much likable, but their character types aren’t massively fresh.When it comes to the side characters, who are introduced slowly as the story progresses, it’s impossible to accurately convey how wonderful they are without experiencing it for yourself. And even more than that, many of the characters I am labeling “side-characters” become increasingly more important as the game goes on, so calling them just side characters is kind of hard to justify.<h1> Verdict </h1>Frankly, this is one of the best games of the year, and that’s saying a lot because 2015 has been an insanely good year for gaming. And even more so, the more I think about it the more it becomes one of my favourite games of all time, and one of my favourite stories of all time. The criticisms I have brought up in this review, while valid and certainly true, took a long time for me to come up with. I really really love this game and I urge you to play it if you value a good story. And this is coming from someone who openly says that he doesn’t like comedies, because Tales is so much more than that. It’s drama first, comedy second and action third.So, if you threatened to gouge out my eye and realise I wasn’t really dead, I’d absolutely recommend this game, 100%."

I didn't like the Walking Dead, it bored me and I found all the characters to be mopey and kinda devoid of any personality besides what terrible thing happened to them. I know it was a zombie apocalypse and stuff but there was just nothing I found enjoyable about listening to any of the dialogue. The Wolf Among Us was a definite improvement, but I still didn't love it.Tales From the Borderlands is so much better I don't even know how to express it. If you like Borderlands then even better, I think this does more with the world than any of the main franchise has done so far, every line is brilliant, every character is full of personality and quirks and I found myself already attached to them partway through the first episode.  The story is completely wild, and while occassionally predictable, never in a way that bores you, it's always more of a, ""YES THIS IS HAPPENING,"" as opposed to, ""pfft called that.""But even when the storyline gets predictable, the action sequences save it. That's something that Telltale has never had before, and it adds a lot. Telltale games are basically interactive movies, and that's fine but when 90% of it is dialogue, it gets a bit tiresome. Tales spices that up with some ridiculous setpieces, set to aways fantastic music, making it an absolute joy to watch. For once, I didn't care that I couldn't participate in a certain sequence, just because it was so much fun watching the insanity on screen happen. There's more action packed into the first episode of this, than the entirety of their other series'.100% recommended, if you don't mind the default Telltale style, this is a must own.

This game has a lot of humor and the story is really nice and intriguing to play, in my opinion. Also since it isn't an FPS-game like the other Borderlands-games it has a slower pace and you get to explore Pandora through a different point of view which is really exciting because you get to actually explore it in a more personal way and you are able to at times take your own time to explore.

There were always parts of the other games that ruined the experience such as poor animation synced with strange dialogue, comically goofy action, decisions that are obviously meaningless... I get it, it's nearly impossible to program so many branches for a game, but the point is to at least build a strong illusion of choice. For the most part the games do this adequately, but TFTB really blows the rest out of the water. For one, there are multiple endings in that your final party can vary greatly. It adds replayability. The dialogue fits perfectly in the universe as do the characters. You can really empathize with the all of the characters, even the bad ones just because of how well they're written.

The only thing the Borderlands series itself has been missing is a down-to-earth story. Tales from the Borderlands fixes that. Way more than any game from the main series, I felt as if this game was not only more realistic, but that my actions carried some kind of weight and consequence. Like I had to think and work for every step of the way, despite the fact that I really didn't do anything. It was an incredibly good story, and my favorite from Telltale Games. The gameplay itself was lackluster, but I was okay with it because of the incredible writing and plot that went into this game. I highly, HIGHLY recommend it."

76561197969417125,Recommended,330830,18836206,"Posted: 2 November, 2015",all,G00N3R,"Tales From The Borderlands is another excellent game developed by Telltale. If you've played their other recent games such as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, you have a pretty good idea what to expect. They stick closely to the established formula which has proven so successful, but this time the adventure takes place in the world created by Gearbox's Borderlands first person shooter series. As a fan of both Telltale's games and Borderlands, this was a perfect match for me, and I loved every minute.The story is well written and very entertaining. They make great use of the Borderlands IP, featuring appearances from supporting characters such as Scooter, Zer0 and Athena, and building off the events of those games. The main gameplay mechanic involves making dialogue choices during conversations with NPCs, but an important change for TFTB is that the player controls two characters - a Hyperion employee called Rhys, and a con artist living on Pandora called Fiona. This allows the story to be told in an interesting way, as you can see events from different perspectives, and I had fun with Rhys' and Fiona's different personalities and conflicting motivations.Telltale also perfectly captured Borderlands' wacky, over the top sense of humour. I haven't laughed so much at a game for quite some time. All of the voice acting is outstanding, but the two leads, Troy Baker (Bioshock Infinite) and Laura Bailey (Skyrim Dawnguard) deserve a special mention. The one complaint that I was going to make about the story is that, compared to TWD and TWAU there didn't seem to be any really important choices to make (there are some choices, but no critical life or death situations that I would have to think really hard about, and then beat myself up afterwards wondering if I'd made the right call) ... however the last part of episode 5 does give a fun pay off for all these small choices, so ultimately I'm okay with it. Although it would be nice if we could lose the constant ""[character name] will remember that"" messages in the top corner of the screen every time the player makes a dialogue choice because its a) obvious and b) annoying.Combat is QTE based, but at least its the forgiving kind where you get several seconds to press the correct button. And it felt like combat scenes were longer, more complex and more visually exciting than TWD or TWAU. Puzzles are extremely basic, whatever object you need to progress is always in the same room as the puzzle itself. I'm a bit conflicted about this aspect of the gameplay. A deeper combat or puzzle solving mechanic might make the next game even more awesome, but it might also interrupt the flow of the story. The total running time for the 5 episodes is just over 10 hours, which makes TFTB significantly longer than TWD season 2 and TWAU, and I didn't encounter any bugs.Tales From The Borderlands is easily one of the best games of 2015 and it gets a strong recommendation from me. This is an essential purchase for anybody who likes a good story."

(The clue is kinda in the name of the company: Telltale)The game plays so well into the Borderlands universe, which happens to be well coordinated with the people at Gearbox, which in itself is pretty darn awesome. It serves to sort of fill in a few blanks between the established canon of the three Borderlands games, particularly (SPOILERS!) in the third episode where we get to know how Athena winds up a prisoner of the BL2 Vault Hunters and thus sets the story for the beginning of the Pre-Sequel. It does so all the while telling a fantastic new story fully in line with the original Borderlands humour, which (personal opinion, feel free to disagree) makes it feel more like Borderlands than the Pre-Sequel did to me.So, yeah, in short, if you like story driven games and you have bothered to read through all this, chances are you have probably already either bought the game or you will be doing it shortly.

,Recommended,330830,29350339,Posted: 18 January,all,Double Uppercut,"It's going to be weird writing a positive review for this game, after the terrible taste it left in my mouth.Tales from the Borderlands is a story that takes place long after the first two Borderlands games, in which you play two unwitting protagonists- Rhys and Fiona- on their quest to find the mysterious Vault. I will admit the first episode kinda hooked me and I was onboard and ready to go, and- despite what issues I had- it let to a very solid Telltale experience.I haven't played anything by Telltale since Walking Dead, and most of you might know it's one of my favorite games out there. You might also know that I tore the original Borderlands a new one when I played it again a couple years ago. I've never been fond of the games, mainly because of how poorly-utilized their unique world is. But I do think Telltale could make a much better experience from the world and zany characters from the Borderlands world and... for the most part, they did.The game is standard Telltale gameplay. It's not very hard. Just walk forward when prompted, choose a dialogue option, solve what few puzzles the game has, and react to the impossibly fast quick time events thrown your way. It's surprisingly more limited in gameplay variety like The Walking Dead had. There are almost no puzzles. You're just wheeled through the story, piece by piece, and then you're done.So how about the story? Eh, for the most part it's pretty good. I like the main characters just fine, but I do think some of the other ones are thrown in just for fan-pandering. There's a bit of corny dialogue here and there, some plot holes, and some shot incosistency but it didn't bother me a whole lot. I also wasn't as big of a fan of how Handsome Jack's program was handled in the story. He also wasn't that intimidating of an antagonist for Rhys, especially towards... Episode 5.Might as well get this out of the way. Episode 5 sucks d***. MASSIVE D***. It's got the most cheese in the story as well as the most fan-pandering. Everything you can expect out of a cheesey action-comedy flick's ending happens. And what's worst of all is it fakes you out with a quick ending to the story that was built up over FOUR EPISODES, then shifts to the future for a horrible plot twist and a drawn-out final act that I just didn't care about. It was too much too late. That and choosing a team for the final part just felt too much like Telltale was tugging on Mass Effect 2's Suicide Mission, and the logic behind which characters will come with you and which won't is really odd. One character won't join your squad because you didn't do something that they weren't even there to see, let alone care about! What the actual f***?But, that being said, I do think Tales from the Borderlands is charming, fast-paced, fun, and entertaining. It's got those qualities of your average Marvel cinematic universe action film. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it is fun enough to warrant a good playthrough. It looks good, the story is alright. Sure it's flawed but I happened to enjoy the bits of goodness I found in Tales from the Borderlands, and I'm going to give it a 6/10."

I found myself laughing out loud often, and literally had to pause after the most absurd ""shoot out"" to catch my breath and wipe tears from my eyes. It is definitely an entertaining romp that ""feels"" like a borderlands game despite the massively different gameplay.Speaking of, Tales is *NOT* a shooter. Only putting that because a lot of my friends asked me. Ultimately, it's all story and no real gameplay challenge, but that's okay! It's kind of like a point and click ""choose your own adventure"" game on rails, and it's incredibly fun provided you enjoy story. Everything is timed, though, so it still keeps you on your toes. It's the kind of game you pop in when you just wanna relax and be entertained, not challenged, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's incredibly entertaining.... like watching a 10 hour Borderlands movie that you get to direct.And storywise, a few things happen that will probably affect Borderlands 3, unless 2k decides not to make this game canon.All in all?

,Recommended,330830,30649924,Posted: 21 March,all,#SadidadiDash [NGNL] [ibtA],"Hi there and welcome to a long review about 'Tales from the Borderlands.'First, I'm a huge fan of Borderlands franchise. I bought all the games, all the DLCs (except the costumes DLCs), and ready to play 'em anytime if someone asks me to. Literally my first game that I bought on Steam is Borderlands 2. And from that purchase, I'm beginning to turn into an addict person who just loves Borderlands so much. Trust my words, IT IS AMASTERPIECE.Plot (10/10) :The story takes place after the events from Borderlands 2 & Borderlands The Pre-Sequel. You play as Rhys, a salary man at Hyperion and a fanboy of Handsome Jack. Rhys has a best friend called Vaughn. Together, you'll do your first mission to steal a deal from Vasquez, which is a guy that you really hate in Hyperion. Stole 10 million dollars and buy a vault key from August. But, later in the game, your mission gets bigger and bigger. You will play from a different perspective here. Yeah, you will play as another character with another objective. You will play as another character called Fiona, a con artist who teamed up with Sasha, her sister, which is also a con artist. Fiona and Sasha set a deal with August to sell a vault key to a guy named Vasquez, but it turns out to be Rhys. The deal went off, just saying. Your mission, which is to buy a vault key, turns into a mission to opening a vault. And remember, this is one of the Borderlands franchise, so prepare to get mind blown with the damn plot twist.Art (9/10) :The art still suits the Borderlands franchise with a touch from Telltale Series, but seriously, the art feels like a completely Borderlands franchise and it feels like Telltale didn't even touch the art style. The Borderlands franchise has its own unique art style that I found myself fell in love with.Sounds (8/10) :Why an 8? Because sometimes when the character says a line, the intonation just doesn't fit in for me. Despite that, the music in this game is good with the sound effects that fits into the scene. The jokes in this game are unbearable. It is so good that you suddenly forgot that you've cried a few minutes ago. Yes, I did not expect to cry when I played this game, but boy I cried.Gameplay (10/10) :It's the usual Telltale Series, so obviously it's a choice maker and your choices will definitely do something about the next events in the game. I made some wrong decisions in this game, but do I regret it? No, not even a single one. This game has 5 episodes to play with an average of 2 hours per episode. I recommend when you play this game, do a one episode session. I'm saying this because I didn't enjoy the time when I was really tired and I have to go to sleep and ended up closing the game. It's so frustrating to wait until the next morning to play this game again.OVERALL (9,8/10) :This game is too good for me. I just love the way how they started an intro of an episode. which is pretty epic and I love how they do it. You want some sneak peek? Go to my screenshots and see it for yourself.This game is RECOMMENDED for you who loves story-based and choice-maker kind of games. But if you want to play this game, I suggest you to play the Borderlands 2 & the Borderlands The Pre-Sequel to completely understand where is this story began. But if you don't wanna do that, that's completely fine. I'm just saying that if you play those 2 games first, you'll be able to enjoy this game at its finest.What are you waiting for? Go get some money and buy this game!"

,Recommended,330830,32799659,Posted: 25 June,all,spykeq,"Tales from the Borderlands is an entertaining adventure that follows a story from two different perspectives. Here you follow Rhys, a worker from Hyperion, and Fiona, a thief that lives on Pandora, as they travel around Pandora to look for a vault.Those that are familiar with the Borderlands series will find themselves at home, with witty and hilarious writing throughout the game. With that being said, this is not a typical Borderlands game, meaning that you will not be running around as a vault hunter shooting people around Pandora to get loot. Instead this follows the Telltale point and click style of gameplay as the story unfolds.Those that are new to the series will get a decent introduction to many of the characters and the world of Pandora. While there are some call backs and references that may be missed, there's enough content here for newcomers to enjoy.As with most Telltale games, there are many choices that you may make that will affect the world of the game. While the story is linear,with there being only one ending,the choices here will affect the way people in Pandora sees you.Even though there is only one ending, all the choices made throughout the game will affect the final choice you can make, which affects how the final scene plays out. This is good writing, as it allows the player to feel a sense of ownership of their playthrough while setting up the game for a second season.Overall, the presentation, writing, music, and choices are solid. If you are a fan of Telltale or if you are interesting in trying out Telltale games, this is definitely one to pick up."

It's great to take a look at parts of Pandora where you aren't instantly assaulted on all sides; there are sane people on Pandora too, for whom living in the mad hell is part of their daily routine.The humor is solid and spot-on, too. A little less LOLRANDUM than 2, but not quite as stark as 1, it strikes a nice balance between gory shock humor, deadpan sarcasm, and straight-up ludicrous characters.And let's be honest, that's what you play telltale games for. It's more of an interactive movie than an actual game, but at least the quick-time events are done well. The prompts are obvious, there's very little penalty for missing one, and either result is quite entertaining.It feels as though your actions have weight, even though, in the end, you pretty much end up with exactly the same story. You can't really tell if insulting or complimenting that one mob boss made a vast difference at the end; a few different lines of dialogue are all you're likely to get.Still, it's a fun ride, and I would definitely recommend playing it if you enjoy TellTale OR Borderlands."

76561198152797055,Recommended,330830,29592907,Posted: 30 January,all,David the Goliath,"There is no denying that most of the Borderlands games is about collecting tons of loot and shooting everything with a red health bar untill it's depleted. After all, Pandora is an insanely dangerous place, it makes Australia look like a kindegarten. However, what I also love about the games are the dark/silly humor, the interesting characters and the story (especially BL2). Additionally, there is a huge story gap between BL2 and BL the PS (the main story of the latter is one huge flashback). I am happy that the gap is filled with another 5 chapters. And a lot of new faces. I hope they'll return later.The only downside for me was the fact that the controls are fixed (yes, people with AZERTY keyboards exist)I can definitely recommend it for those who are interested in the story of the Borderlands series. For those unfamiliar (or those who kinda only care about shooting an looting) it will be less interesting (since the action is limited, and a lot of background info)."
,Recommended,330830,13107288,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,[MLM] MeingroessterFan,"Tales from the Borderlands is Telltale Game's take on the Borderlands universe, taking their unique style of storytelling and putting it into a universe that before was only explored  in the roles of gun-wielding, bullet-showering, rocket-storming, meat-bicycling ""badasses"" as the game calls them. This time though, your characters never held guns before in their life and couldn't be further away from the ""badass"" status of previous heroes and heroines. And in my opinion, this game is the best thing Telltale ever made. Heck, it's one of my favorite things ever. Here, I'll try and tell you why.When playing through the main Borderlands games, I have often found myself wondering... what if I wasn't a ninja assassin with unknown origin that crafts haikus as fast as he fashions corpses out of adversaries? What if I was just one of those puny npcs that wiggle around in Sanctuary, no guns, no shields, no special abilities, what if I actually needed to be afraid of these bandit hordes that want to slice me to pieces? And on top of that, what if I didn't just explore Pandora by running and gunning through every place I visit? What if I was able to properly interact with my environments, explore all the tiny details of the world, actually have meaningful interactions with all these characters and creatures? Basically, I wanted to see the very nice and detailed world that is Pandora from a different perspective. So naturally, when I heard that Tales from the Borderlands would be just that, I was thrilled. Spoilers though, you do still end up murdering quite a few bandits (well, mostly you just witness other people do the murdering for you, but my point still stands, ooer), but the slaughter of adversaries is not the main focus of this game at all. It's the characters and their interactions with one another.Yeah, on the note of characters - When I first played Borderlands 2 (never had a chance to play Borderlands 1, so BL2 was my introduction to the series) I thought that the characters and dialogue (well, mostly monologues) were extremely funny and well written, especially the main villain Handsome Jack. On my first time through, I was also quite gripped by the story of it, mainly some of the more... dramatic scenes later on. Coming back to it though, I realize that a lot of it was kinda weird and not too well done. Still entertaining, and I would definitely recommend BL2 on basis of its story, but it isn't as great as I originally thought it was. Luckily, Telltale Games are all about the story, and they took the writing to a whole other level.While TFTBL might not be as dramatic and tear-jerking as, say, Telltale's Walking Dead, it still has some emotional and tragic moments in the later episodes. More importantly though, it's extremely funny, extremely gripping and just overall a wild and epic ride.The story of the game takes place after the ending of BL2; you play as two characters: Rhys, a Hyperion code monkey who works on Helios (that big H in the sky, yknow), and Fiona, a pandoran con artist. Rhys, who idolizes the late Handsome Jack like most people in Hyperion, gets scammed out of his promotion by a snarky rival, finds out about a deal made with a pandoran bandit: 2 Million dollars for a vault key. Rhys and his good friend Vaughn steal their new boss's car and 2 Million bucks, and they shoot themselves onto pandora to get the vault key for themselves. Meanwhile on Pandora, Fiona and her sister Sasha get ready to perform their biggest con yet: sell a forged vault key. Revealing anything more than that would be spoiler territory, but I can assure you, a wild ride ensues.So that's the premise. You explore Pandora through the eyes of a code monkey and a bandit, and at some point, there will be giant robots. If you only discovered this game now, you have one big advantage over people like me that started playing it when it first came out: You can play all the episodes right now, you don't have to wait two or three months between play sessions. So if you are at all interested in the universe of Borderlands, and manage to put down your legendaries and your e-techs and whatever for at least a few hours, I can almost guarantee that Tales from the Borderlands will suck you in. Plus, since this is a Telltale's adventure game, the choice system will allow for multiple playthroughs. I haven't even mentioned this yet, but there are many choices you have to make during the course of the story. While it may not have the same gravitas as it does in the likes of Walking Dead, it still has consequences and leads to different interactions and dialogue. Just, yknow, you don't have to chop anyone's arm off with an axe to save them from zombies. Because there are no zombies. Instead there's loader bots. Which are also very cool.TL;DRPros:+Amazing story and endearing characters+Unique and elegant graphical style (this time, Telltale's typical cel-shaded style fits perfectly with the source material, eh)+8-10 hours of gameplay with good replay value due to the multiple choice progression system+Actually pretty good music (though some of it is borrowed from the main BL games). But dat menu theme though. Just take a moment and sit in the main menu listening to the music. It's epic.Cons:-The character animations can be a little wonky at timesFinal verdict: Get this game. In my opinion, it is both Telltale's best, and Borderlands's best."

It was a dark, gritty, and violent hard-boiled noire detective story. I liked it really much.Then i played Walking dead s1. It was a dark, sad, and violent depressing survival story. I loved it.And then... I played Tales from the Borderlands. Twice. It was funny, witty and comical adventure of two friends. And it was awesome. Before playing this game i was familiar with Borderlands series already. I played the first one twice and the second one 8 times. But you can totally enjoy this game without playing BL 1, 2, or pre-sequel!So let's go through some parts.1. GameplayThis game is a point and click adventure game, where you make decisions. And your choices matter. Actually, they matter more than they did in wolf among us for an example. This game only has 1 puzzle and it is not hard. You play as two characters. The company man Rhys, and The con-artist Fiona. It is kinda sad that Rhys is a bit more important character.2. StoryNow, it's kinda hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers so you should just play the game yourself. You can also watch the trailers above.3. CharactersSo this game has lots of memorable characters.Rhys, who tries to be cool but ends up doing something awkward.Vaughn, the nerdy BFF of RhysFiona, the smooth talking con-artistSasha, Fionas gun obsessed sister (and possible love interest for Rhys).Handsome Jacks A.I. (friend or foe?).And of course...The robot Gortys who is always cute and positive.4. Verdict and Pros n' ConsThis game is amazing and it has moments when it's sad or dramatic but most of the time, i laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off.Telltale made this feel like Borderlands.If you like Borderlands, play it. If you don't, play it anyways. Trust me. You're gonna have a blast.Pros:-Colourful cast of characters.-Finger gun fight.-Loader-bot and gortys.-Choices matter-Patrick Warburton as Vasquez-Story-Replayability-Funny as hell-SoundtrackCons:-A few plot holes-Fiona is overshadowed by Rhys.I give it a 9/10.

It actively encourages you to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions and be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, something I loved! It was a game with a gray decision area, letting you have attitude and take the easy way out because that's exactly how your character would act! It's great! The first 3 acts even follow this formula to a T and it feels just wonderful.But then the fourth episode rears its ugly mug and things start getting cliched and choices become very black and white. It immediately starts with some horrendously forced attempt at a tear-jerker by killing off a character none of the cast knows much about and tries to act choked up about some guy they kind of knew dying. It's also at this point Telltale starts trying to sell a romance between Sasha and Rhys which I find equally dumb. There's no need for it here.Episode 5 turns the plot for a u-turn by completely forgetting about the initial plot and making some crappy power-rangers fight the climax of the series. It's horrendously out of place and it doesn't satisfy the curiosity I had at the beginning of the series.It's not all bad, but man it really hurts the overall product.

They give you time to really care about these guys before stepping on your emotions.- there are bad puns and refrences to other games. perfect.- not a single moment feels like it's too stretched out, and it didn't feel like they were running out of time either. it's very well balanced.- Loader bot is a pro in himself, but you knew that already.- the music is amazing and each episode has it's own perfectly fitting track.- the stunning cinematopraphy in the opening credits for each episode blows my mind every time.Cons:-the action scenes can be very confusing or frustrating because of awkward camera angles and/or editing-TellTale and action scenes are not very good friends, so the animation can at times look akward or weird during those scenes.- SPOILERS: in the last episode, Helios crashes. it's an Emotional moment, sure, but i think it was a huge waste of good space station and of borderlands history to let it go down like that- SPOILERS: it is never explained how Athena gets out of her imprisonment, which they made out to be a HUGE deal, but this just made it feel irrelevant.-broken money system. when you, as Fiona, steal money from a dead bandit, it at times does not go to your wallet and it just... dissapears?tales from the borderlands is among the best game i've ver had the pleasure of playing, and i think it's a shame that it's so overshaddowed by games like the walking dead and the wolf among us. it's worth the price, and i wish for more people to get the amazing experience it is to follow Rhys and Fiona's take on the same story about trust, teamwork, survival and betrayal.9.4/10"

The characters are fun and the interactions between them are very entertaining. The story doesn't take itself very seriously and it works out perfectly with the Borderlands feel. That's not to say that the story is some sideshow or anything. It is tailored to make the character interactions shine and you choices do feel like they matter.8.5/10.

While maintaining the humor and action of the tradtional shooter games, the story is protrayed in such a way that can easily and cleanly wrap up the borderlands series. (Or at least Handsome Jack's Arc of the world since BL3 is in production...)I love how games like this give you the option to completely define the characters to your perference. Rhys is a little bit of a hands on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for me due to the responses I picked, while Fiona is a bit more of a humble theif with morals looking for some more thrills in life. Completely diffrent then how my friend played through the game, and for him Rhys is a sweet guy and Fiona is a bit more of a ♥♥♥♥♥. It's really cool how you can deliver the canon story in diffrent ways based on your decions.There's also some life lessons to be learned when watching Rhys interact with his life long hero, Handsome Jack, but who really cares about the meanifulstuff anyway?It's a good game and worth a play if you're more into the lore side of Borderlands rather then the gameplay. Ties together many loose ends, and tosses in some shockers that will have to be addressed in BL3 since this game is confirmed for the canon timeline, happening after 2.Not much replay value though unless you wanted to go through again and try being diffrent with your responses, (Example being: not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Rhys like I was lol), but there's not that many diffrent outcomes based on what you pick and the main story carries through either way.It is a visual novel, and like any good story, I might give it a quick reread down the road. Personally it is my favorite Borderlands game."

,Recommended,330830,29328333,Posted: 17 January,all,doriansworld,"Dying is easy, comedy is hard, and a whole lot of both goes on in Tales from the Borderlands. But as difficult as comedy can be, Tales from the Borderlands pulls it off without breaking a sweat. Staying consistently funny for ten-plus hours, maintaining an engaging story, and being enjoyable to play is about as easy as juggling flaming chainsaws, but Tales from the Borderlands pulls it off with as much grace (and as many explosions) as you could possibly hope for. Basically, it's brilliant, and it's what other comedy games should want to be when they grow up.Set after the events of Borderlands 2 and starring two wildly different protagonists - cybernetically-enhanced dork Rhys, and fast-talking conwoman Fiona - Tales from the Borderlands is all about a crew of misfits and the wacky hijinks they get up to in their quest to hunt down the Vault key that will lead them to incredible riches. Complications naturally arise, and they find themselves getting involved with gang warfare, long-dead corporations, betrayal, revenge, and one very unfortunate use of a spork. Rhys and Fiona share storytelling duties, each describing how things went from their particular perspective, exaggerating here and embellishing there so that they always end up looking clever, heroic, and daring.That leads to some hilarious back-and-forth when one calls the other out on their skewed version of events, like when Rhys claims to have sealed a business deal in a hyper-violent way and Fiona reveals that he did a lot less killing and a lot more begging and crying. While that happens quite a bit in the game's opening episodes, the tone of their alternating narratives shifts later on, with Rhys filling in blind spots in Fiona's version of events, and vice versa. It’s a creative approach to the rivals-ending-up-as-allies trope, allowing them the chance to transform into genuinely charming and likable characters along their journey. The supporting cast, especially Loaderbot, Vasquez, and Sasha, are equally memorable and round out the action with delightful dialog and antics.All of these folks working together serve to elevate the two things Tales wants to highlight most: action and comedy. Being able to go anywhere and do anything with the story lets the developers get extremely creative with the game's scenes of mayhem (forcing the protagonists into makeshift death derbies, launching a travel trailer into orbit, building an entire sequence riffing on a cartoon from the 80s), which are perfectly executed and extremely fun to go blazing through. In terms of controls you might be limited to swiping left and right with some button-mashing thrown in, in keeping with Telltale's standard model for episodic interaction. Still, the action is so colorfully and ridiculously realized that unless you have an abiding issue with the format, you probably won't notice.I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHERDespite their stark differences, Tales from the Borderlands takes a page out of The Walking Dead's book by letting your choices affect who accompanies you in the final fight. You don't deal with as many moral conundrums here, so it's less about who you pandered to most often and more about what singular favors you happened to do for them. It works out to a very satisfying conclusion that may not wildly alter the course of the story, but does make for one incredible final act.Of course, while it would've been easy for those scenes to blur together into a smear of indistinct car crashes, explosions, and bullet-hurricanes, Tales’ comedy is expertly used in a variety of ways to make every sequence feel memorable. Sometimes it's situational, like when two characters fall off a cliff and share a heartfelt goodbye before realizing they're two feet off the ground. Sometimes it elevates the action into something unique, as during a chase scene where our heroes dodge death-beams in a collapsing Airstream trailer while fleeing a genitalia-faced superbeast. Sometimes it's downright juvenile - how else do you describe a hologram using its lack of physical body to make it look like someone's tender bits are talking?Plus, when the moment is right, a lack of comedy hits that much harder than it would in isolation, as it's made even starker by the frivolity surrounding it. It's a tricky balance to strike well, and the season does slip up in spots - early on it's a bit too heavy-handed with its drama and less effective with its jokes, and drags as a result. Thankfully, it picks up in the middle with stronger comedy and better drama, and by the end they truly work in harmony - even with intense tragedy pressing up right against ridiculous physical comedy (literally zero seconds in between), the whole thing flows naturally and feels perfectly on-point.Of course, part of the reason all of that high-octane hilarity feels so right is because it's so perfectly Borderlands, and Telltale's loyalty to the franchise remains consistently clear. More than just using the Borderlands universe as a convenient backdrop, Tales is a canon addition to it, and liberally integrates characters and bits of lore from throughout the franchise's history. The story is almost entirely about a treasure recovered from the defunct Atlas Corporation, the protagonists hunt Psychos and run from skags while searching for a Vault, and beloved characters like Athena, Zer0, Scooter, and of course Handsome Jack show up in roles perfectly carved out just for them. Not only does that make Tales feel like a true addition the series, but it doles out that sweet fanservice like candy, giving fans a peek into the lives of their favorite characters in a new game that's worthwhile in its own right.Yet those references are never so esoteric that people who never played the Borderlands games will feel lost. The worst you'll get is a sense that a person who just showed up probably isn't a brand new character, but Tales does a good job of explaining why they're important now and not leaving you twisting in the wind. Fans might get more out those cameos just by their nature, but there's still plenty here for non-fans to enjoy.Back when Tales from the Borderlands was first announced, there was a lot of speculation about how it could even work. How do you take a series like Borderlands, known mostly for its rat-a-tat action and ridiculous one-liners, and make a narrative story out of it? But as this bloody hilarious rampage comes to a close, Tales has proven that not only can it be done, but it can be done brilliantly, as long as you come at it with a boatload of love and laughs. And yes, guns too. Hilarious, heartfelt and high-octane, Tales from the Borderlands is a must-play game that sets a new standard for comedy games to come."
,Recommended,330830,29329809,Posted: 17 January,all,ancientorange,"This is now my favorite TTG game. Previously, my favorite was ""A Wolf Among Us"", which I enjoyed so much I bought this one and ""The Walking Dead"". My error was in playing TWD first. Enh... my error was playing TWD at all.It took me over a year to finish TWD because I didn't care about any of the characters. The only reason I finished the first season was realizing I'd get to see a bunch of them die.By comparison, I cared about every character they put on screen in this game. I loved every character they introduced me to, and wanted to know what would happen to them. Furthermore, I was consistently delighted with what happened to them. I'm just sad there are now three seasons and two DLC's for TWD but nothing more for Borderlands.The writing is snappy and the humour is well balanced between verbal and slapstick. The voice acting is top notch and fits the characters. It's like having the best parts of the Borderlands series without all the annoying walking and backtracking. The combat is delightful.This game is so much fun, I didn't even have to silence my inner critic that would normally rant about the QTE's--and I laughed out loud when I got to the one they troll you with. I was also delighted by the long one at the end of episode 5. You have to understand: while I like good stories, I despise QTE's and consider them a blight on gaming (like uPlay!), but they managed to sneak one in that I enjoyed.Control switches between two characters that are often on screen at the same time, and not by player choice. To help you know who you're playing, the interface is slightly different. I only found one case where they messed that up, but fortunately it was clear from context which you were.The one negative is that when you fatally fail a QTE sequence, sometimes the checkpoint is annoyingly far back, but rarely more than a few moments.Needs Moar Seasons!"

Odd to look at.Audio: ""Where can I download these tracks""Ok, the tracks in this game really suit the overall tone of the game. The music here, I wanted to download right off the bat after playing each episode. It was fantastic on all sides. Althoughhh~ Sound layering isnt all that good, nor is it particularly bad. It's just mediocre. The sound effects, they didnt bother to give emphasis on. The sound of metal clanking to each other, sound like metal clanking to each other. Yet the layering isnt really there. Probably also because there isnt much sound effects on each of the scenes to begin with. And to touch on it a bit, The voice acting was superb. I could feel their sarcasm radiating from the screen because of their performances. It was amazing. Props to the voice actors.Gameplay: Really? -.-""Its a telltale game......Story: Can't get enough of the dialogueTo clear things up, the story here is very very simple. But its the dialogue of the individual characters that make it very interesting. Jokes here are moment-reliant and extremely funny. And its elevated with such awesome voice actors. Making each of the little simple moments in-game engaging and entertaining. I would buy this game full price for the story alone. The writing here is clever and immature in all the right places, which is hard to do to begin with. Add to the fact that the developers have to mesh it with some gameplay elements, It makes their jobs a whole lot more difficult. Story gets an A++++ in my book because of that.TL;DR:A Buy at full price. It's probably the best Telltale game to come out after The Walking dead (Season 1 of course) series.Its got a LOT of laughs. And suprisingly a bit of the feels.Its the most underrated Telltale game in my opinion.If you feel like you kinda wanna buy this""Don't let your dreams be dreams, Just do it!"""

The choices you make carry some weight in the first four episodes, though they all come to similar ends in episode 5... However, the variety definitely feels more real than in any of the other TellTale games I've played.The gameplay mechanics are.... frankly, terrible. There are some aimless point and click puzzles throughout the game, but they're terribly weak. The real meat of this game is in the story, the quirky characters, the strong plot, and well placed and executed QTE sections. The soundtrack is top notch, and the voice acting is definitely a highlight of the game as a whole.

Whilst the Walking Dead is (though very good) kinda bleak and very sad this game just wants you to have fun with it. Practically every line of dialogue is guaranteed to have something that will make you laugh, smirk, half-smirk or at least smile inwardly. There's a couple of jokes that fell flat in the first episode but that's such a small percentage considering everything is funny.It does some very funny and clever things, for example, the story is being told to another character by the two protagonists Rhys and Fiona as they've been captured. They will lie and argue with eachother over how things went down and you'll sometimes see the same scene twice, once with a highly unrealistic version of what happened and then again with what really happened. Also the first time you die, your captor will raise an eyebrow (okay maybe, he's wearing a mask- (his/her identity is a major plot point) and Rhys will say ""Okay, maybe I didn't die, but I could have!""It really captures the Borderlands feel, from the way it introduces the characters with their name coming up and a little subtitle, to the intros. The musical intros are perfect- in true Borderlands spirit. The first one in particular makes you feel so cool, the second one is sleek as well. The third (my favourite) one feels like a road trip movie, the fourth is just playing with the by now established characters, and the fifth one is more melancholy. They are all awesomeLeading me to my next point. It is consistently funny, but it'll play with your whole emotional range. There's some cute, incredibly awkward romance, a little bit of tension, some sadness (it made me sniffle once) and some ridiculous over the top silliness. You'll come out feeling very fond of this cast of brilliant, funny characters and I can imagine many people will have different favourites- mine's Sasha, or maybe the robots.Your choices- well, they don't effect the main storyline thaaaat much- (but when do they ever in these kinds of games? I've made my peace with that) although there are some scenes that you'll miss out on depending on your choices. There is a bit of replay value then, because as I've hopefully made clear, everything in this game is funny. If you were to replay it you could pick all different dialogue options and get different witty retorts and rejoinders from the characters. Whereas in the other telltale games it's a little disappointing when your dialogue options don't make a massive difference, it's okay here because really you're just picking the option you think will lead to the funniest punchline.I only wish this was getting the attention it so readily deserves. My personal GOTYAlso if people could stop buying the game thinking it's a borderlands sequel and then down-voting it THAT'D BE GREAT"

Well, even with all the positive views I was always aprehensive about these games because unlike typical Adventure Games you don't control as much - so it's more like watching a game than playing it.Well, after playing through only Episode 1 of 5 of Tales from the Borderlands I have to say that I'm sold! The story is instantly engaging, fun, and brings all of the Borderlands humor and character to the table. I'm overly impressed by the story options - enough so to say that once I get done playing I'm definitely going to go back and replay through just to experience how my choices vary the story playout.So without even playing Episodes 2-5 I have to give this a postive review. Episode 1 lasted me precisely 2 hours and I imagine the others are around the same in length. Given your dialogue options there's definitely some replayability here.

They are more focused on the Game of Thrones interactive series, which is receiving more attention and updates.

As i had never played a telltale game before i went in with relatively low expectations when i picked the game up on a sale. I had heard good things about other telltale games and i really enjoyed playing Borderlands 2 so i felt like giving it a try.All i can say after completing this game is WOW.I have never been moved so much by a game, movie, book or any sorts of media (given that i havent played/watched/red too many) but this was just amazing. The characters were amazing and i really cared about them, the story and the different choices you got to make were also excellent. Even if some of the choices were pretty small at times i still cared about the possible outcome, but the really big choices really made me sweat in my chair and raised my heartbeat alot.Another plus for me is the voice acting, alot of games are plauged by terrible voice acting but i can tell you for sure that this is not one of them. The different lines made by the characters felt realistic and i never felt that a character felt stale.All in all this is probably one of the best games i have played and it just makes the waiting for Borderlands 3 even more painful.

However, this was not a problem at all, as I understood perfectly well what was going on throughout the whole story.  In fact, after finishing Tales from the Borderlands, I am now interested in trying out other games in both categories (such as Borderlands 2 or The Wolf Among Us).  This game kept me hooked throughout the entire journey, both because I was interested in finding out what was going to happen next and because of the constant humor (which many other reviewers refer to as ""characteristic of the Borderlands series"").  The characters are all awesome, and the developers knew exactly when to make the plot funny but also when to keep it serious.It's true that there are some graphical glitches - occasionally, at the beginning of a scene, a frame would flash that wasn't supposed to be there.  However, these glitches only serve to be minor annoyances, as the game is generally very well put together.  The cel-shaded art style allows for the environments to be very colorful, and the soundtrack has some catchy tunes.  The voice actors that were hired for this game are some of the most talented in the industry, and they really succeeded in bringing the characters to life, regardless of the varying situations I placed them in due to the choices I made as the player.  This game essentially plays out like an interactive movie, similar to other Telltale games, and I'm glad to say that many of your choices throughout the story DO matter, unlike some other similar games that have the exact same ending(s) regardless of what the player did earlier in the game (this is a huge mistake I've been noticing with some adventure games these days).  Although Tales from the Borderlands has the same overarching ending regardless of your choices, it does vary significantly depending on who you've allied with, and believe me - you'll want as many characters available as possible because you'll want to see all of the different variations of the ending (which, by the way, is incredibly epic just on its own).Again, you don't need to play any of the other Borderlands games to understand this one, but there are still interesting references to the other games for those who have.  Regardless of your prior experience with the Borderlands franchise, I guarantee that after playing this game you will remember the exploits of Rhys, Fiona, and all of their friends for a good while."

Perhaps I'm biased since I've really enjoyed the Borderlands games, but I'm loving it and found the writing to be absolutely hysterical at places.While the first episode is ""only"" 2.5hrs, it is truly packed and never stops and results in feeling a lot longer than that.  I just finished and am already looking forward to playing again just to try some of the other choices/paths.If you like Borderlands, even though this is obviously a totally different play-style, this is a must-buy for such a truly well-done story/game in the Borderlands universe.  For this Borderlands fan, this is a 10 out of 10."
,Recommended,330830,21010204,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,King Vegeta,"The best Borderlands game in the series & probably Telltales' best point & click adventure to date.  The overall experience is just so amazing that I couldn't put it down from beginning to end.  A must buy game!PROS-Long engrossing story-Fun cast of characters-Improved QTE mechanics-Choices actually have effects!?CONS-Can't skip cutscenes after death-They killed my favorite BL Character :'(STORYUnlike previous Telltale games this game actually puts you in the roll of two protagonists.  Rhys is the first you meet, a young man who worked for Hyperion.  He starts out in the middle of the desert searching for someone.  He eventually gets ambushed by a lone masked bandit & is dragged off.  During his capture the bandit asks him to tell him a story about how he ended up where he is.  Rhys then starts The Tale from the Borderlands!One of the more brilliant parts of the story is how each chapter begins.  They all start off in the normal borderlands style of 2D page by page cutscenes but then as you get through the chapter you're treated to a great opening every time.  You could say every opening to a chapter is like getting a new Borderlands intro.  Each one is simply amazing to witness.As Rhys is dragged off further he is brought to a camp where you meet the second protagonist, Fiona who has also been taken prisoner by the bandit.  She's a professional con-artist who got a job involving Rhys & everything went to hell.  In the aftermath they ended up forming a neccessary alliance in order to survive their ordeals together.The bandit has captured them both in order to learn what he calls, ""The Truth.""GAMEPLAYIf you've played other Telltale games you know what you're in for.  Mostly QTE segments within the cutscenes with choices of dialog.  Inbetween cutscenes you will have small puzzle like elements.  I say ""Puzzle-Like"" because they're all so easy they barely feel like puzzles at all.  I really wish Telltale would spruce up the puzzle elements of their games & make them more challenging.  They mostly consist of ""Find this item"" or ""Hit this switch"".  Actually, that's pretty much all their puzzles consist of & it just feels tacked on to break up the story.I guess you could say the real puzzles in the game are within the dialog because they effect the outcomes & what happens within the game.  A good example appears in later chapters with Fiona where she is given options to shoot with elemental properties.  These are all pretty easy, though & involve simply choosing the right element for the corresponding color.  You could also say that unlocking specific characters for the final chapter is part of the puzzle element within Telltale games.GRAPHICSThe graphics are of typical Borderlands & Telltale style.  It's almost as if Borderlands was meant to be a Telltale game because they're both represented in such similar fashions.  Cellshaded & outlined.  The game does have some graphical glitches every now and then with flashing character models & lip sync issues.  Other than that though the game looks & feels great.  The QTE segments also tend to make cutscenes look off.  Unless you time it properly it will look like you teleport.  This isn't really a big issue but more of a nitpick for me as I'd prefer much more fluid transitions.AUDIOThe music is fantastic & perfectly entwined with the whole Borderlands world.  Opening cutscenes playback with probably the best music they could use & everything just feels natural for the whole game's aethstetic.Voice acting is also very well done to the point where I have no complaints about it.OVERALLIf you enjoy Telltale games or Point & Click style gameplay or just an enjoying experience full of laughs, drama, & more laughs then you should probably pick this game up.  I had more fun with this game in particular than I have with any other Telltale game & that says alot.  This is absolutely the best Telltale game currently on the market & I hope there will be more Tales from the Borderlands games in the future or at least something similar to them."

This is a Telltale-styled adventure game set in the Borderlands universe. Rather than collecting loot and shooting faces, you will be primarily making on-the-fly dialog choices to direct the scenes how you want to see them play out. You don't have to have played any past Borderlands games to enjoy the experience, but you will get more out of it if you have. Especially Borderlands 2.With that out of the way, this game was really well done. The writing and voice acting were both great and really brought the characters to life. It's a shame that Telltale hasn't found a way to evolve their gameplay beyond constant QTEs, but it didn't get in the way very often. At least you don't have to feel too pressured about permanently losing characters due to your QTE performance like in some other games in the genre. Comparatively, this game is more humorous and light-hearted in tone. Overall, it's a really fun ride with a few heartstring pullers near the end. I would certainly recommend this game to just about anyone."

Even though my choices in either of those games mattered very little, it at least had some impact on the rest of the story.Tales from the Borderlands on the other hand did none of that. I felt like no matter what I did, the story would progress the exact same. I even played back two of the chapters to see if the outcome would change with completely different choices, and unsurprisingly all that changed were a handful of lines.Before I get into my main negatives, I have to say that the world building and additional lore the game adds is actually really interesting. If it were not for the additional lore the game provided, I most likely would have dropped this game early on.Everything about the writing just feels one-dimensional and lifeless. None of the characters felt particularly memorable and each character's design felt uninspired, which is upsetting seeing as every Borderlands character Gearbox creates is full of life and detail.I won’t complain about the gameplay since it is a point and click after all, but I was hoping for a better balance of puzzles and exploring, most of the game had me running on a rail and didn’t give me much chance to explore the interesting locations presented in-game.Overall, Tales from the Borderlands is just disappointing. There are plenty of better ways to spend your time and money. Unless you are really into the world of Borderlands like myself, then I can’t recommend this title."

To summarise why all six episodes present one of the finest sci-fi adventures in recent memory, not to mention one of the most enjoyable video games of last year, would be the gamut of emotion once the journey has concluded. You'll feel a sentimentality that is both genuine and rare, even for a developer which has long earned its stripes for their deft skill in storytelling.Tales from the Borderlands is deliriously action packed, balancing its aggressively nihilistic environments with dark humour and a cast of characters whose roles slowly galvanise into that of a dysfunctional family, providing more than a few sneakily poignant moments amid the ridiculous chaos. Telltale made a bold choice with this title and as such it comes off with double the heart of anything else they've done since the first season of The Walking Dead."

The humor is what's blowing this game up (sometimes literally), even the choices-matter system is being laughed on, you know those things ""insert_name will remember this"" and stuff like these, it's all tested by humor and it's BLOODY AWESOME!! (yeah sometimes literally, again, so much puns).The story is about a pair of girls and a pair of boys in its core, two con-women and two ambitious salary guys. I don't want go spoiling anything but the plot twists and character development are very enjoyable and all of this fits great into borderlands' timeline and Pandora's storyline developing in other games of the series.

But damn, it was the funniest few days of my life. I'm jaded at times, so I was meh about purchasing the game. The Game of Thrones series pulled me off to buy it but after reading a few reviews about the Borderlands game, I decided to buy it.The graphics are like any other Telltale game, the voice acting actually sounded human, the story made sense, the jokes weren't too mature or immature, just right. I am releaved that it didn't ALWAYS force me into things like the Game of Thrones series. Oh Mira, how much I hated her. Also, the game explains itself from the other games, so I kind of know what is happening in the world. I didn't know robots have feelings, though, made a mistake at the start just because of this.Anyways, I will most likely replay the game in a years time, and that is a rare thing for me to say. The only disappointment was the/my ending. Not sure how many endings there were, but it did the same thing as Game of Thrones, it just showed there will be a part 2.

While Borderlands 2 improved over the first game significantly with at least making you take notice of what was happening in the worlda little, Tales from the Borderlands made you actually care. I'm actually invested in Borderlands canon now singlehandedly thanks to this game, as long as future Borderlands games don't ignore what happened here and make some of the big storyline developments have consequences in further games.So what makes this so great? It's really the characters, fully embodied by the great voiceover work from the entire cast. The overly busy Troy Baker might've made his mark playing Joel from The Last of Us or Booker DeWitt from Bioshock Infinite, but I think he's just as good here as he was in those games. And you also get some great performances out of Laura Bailey, Patrick Warburton, and many, many others (even Chris ""I used to host Singled Out!"" Hardwick). And a special shout out should go out to Ashley Johnson, who absolutely killed it as GORTYS.What also worked? Choice mattered. Maybe they weren't earth shattering, and maybe everyone still got to point A to point Z no matter what happened in between, but when I arrived at that critical episode 5, I realized that things I had done and forgotten about really did carry over.The fact of the matter is if you've enjoyed any of Telltale's other games, you owe it to yourself to play this. It might not be a ""gamers' game"" (whatever that is), but it has enough amazing characters, a fantastic story, memorable songs, genuine laughs, and plenty of heartfelt ""This is a Borderlands game and I'm almost crying?!"" moments that you shouldn't even care if it's really a game or not."

The result is a surprisingly solid and charming spinoff that expands the Borderlands universe in some interesting ways and may set the stage for the inevitable third maingame. While in turns of gameplay it is even more conservative as Walking Dead (which is kind of disappointing after just having played Life is Strange), it does its job at being entertaining through the five episodes of about 2 hours length each, just don't expect anything challenging.

Borderlands is sacred territory for me, one of my all-time favorite series, so I was really worried they would miss what makes it special. I was wrong.In fact, they've captured it perfectly, and perhaps even given the world more life and character than a co-op shooter could ever muster on its own. I went in expecting a slow TWD style game (and to be fair, there are points like that, there has to be) but when the action ramps up it takes it to 11.Many don't enjoy QTEs, and if that's the case then this is your warning, after all it's a Tell Tale game so you should expect them. However, no other Dev has done them right, and they never feel like a burden, at least to me.The story is shaping up to be fantastic, and there are even some legitimately surprising twists that fit well. It also appears that your actions do have a significant effect on the story as well, perhaps even more so than in previous games like TWD.My only complaint is a sign in issue with Tell Tale Accounts, the GUI seems to freeze and it doesn’t appear to be any way to get away from it other than forcing the program to close, but I'd wager this will be fixed in the coming days.All in all Episode 1 has me dying for more, and if the next 4 episodes are anything like the 1st, it's going to be a bloody blast."

If you love sci-fi settings, wild adventures, and silly humour and comedy, you will love this game. The main characters are very lovable, and there are many I found myself attached to.What is Tales from the Borderlands?TFB is not a shooter like the Borderlands series. It has nothing to do with the story in the shooter games and is essentially a spin-off of it. This is a story-driven game featuring quick time events, difficult decicions, and a branching timeline. The game is made up of 5 different episodes, which are all released and ready to play. The game is like an interactive movie where you control some of the decisions your characters make.Gameplay: The gameplay is mostly smooth. When your character is in danger, you must press buttons on your keyboard or controller to save them. My only main issue is that the mouse is terribly optimized and has a 3 second delay in movement. This makes clicking decisions and dodging attacks very hard, but I managed to get through it alright, even though I have terrible reflexes =P The only way to fix this (if it bothers you alot) is to lower the resolution to 800x600, however the game doesn't look as good using this. I had to do this for episode 5 though, the quick-time events are harder in it. =)Graphics: The game has pretty graphics, and the locations look really realsitic and well made. I also love the comic-book artstyle and the sketch marks on the character faces, making them look like a comic character.Conclusion: I wholeheartedly recommend this game! It has a wonderful story, exciting battles, and an amazing fight in the last episode that tensed me up :D Even if you don't like Borderlands/ don't know anything about it, this game is still a cool sc-fi adventure experience."

Lots of sit-back-and-enjoy-the-witty-dialogue, every so often  some action scenes that require some quick reactions, but on the whole, a great way to relax on the sofa.

There is a nice balance between point & clicking, cutscenes and decision-making.  This game has choice and consequence so there are a wealth of different outcomes for each chapter, and therefore the whole game.At the end of each chapter you receive a summary of all your choices, and how they compare to global player stats.  Cool game, funny dialogue, fantastic soundtrack, quirky-yet-typical Telltale graphics.  Really fun game."

The second one was much better but I did not have anyonewho I could play it with really so I never got terribly far. The humor and the aestetic ofthe game is one thing that always appealed itself to me. That being said I waited a longwhile for this Tales of from Tell tale to go on a 75% off sale on steam. Finally it cameso I picked it up expecting nothing, here is my experience.I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Tales from Borderlands season 1 stood out as a joy filledromp through Pandora and other classic Borderlands areas. The games writing and humor areactually incredible and very enjoyable. I found myself laughing out loud and face palmingover and over again. I binged on the first 3 episodes that took me over 7 hours and enjoyedjust about every minute of it. The game has a rare personality which lets say for exampleWalking Dead season 2 sorely lacked. Telltale has out done themselves with the two maincharacters in TFB, and their motives and actions are engaging and fun. This series is abreath of fresh air in TellTales repertoire which takes itself too seriously in many cases.In terms of narrative the episodes are paced well, and have a good amount of ups anddowns and great laughs. I respect them for sticking true to Borderlands zaney world. How-ever, what I hated was when they tried to ""make me feel"" bad or sad for two characters thatto be honest I couldn't give a wet♥♥♥♥♥♥about. I hate it when you can TELL that they areinserting ""audience sighs here"" ""que tears"" I despise that, its not genuine its a forcedset of events you can see coming miles away and it detracts incredibly from the overallstory and enjoyment. However there were some characters that made me feel a lot more thanI expected and THAT is how you do it. When you insert a character you'd never think twiceabout and bring us close to said character(s). That is good writing and characterdevelopment and that balanced out the ""Feel bad on purpose"" moments that Telltale pushedtwice in this season.So if you are a fan of what telltale does, buy it, if you are a fan of Borderlandslore, story and world pick this up. I doubt either bases will be let down. One thing tobe warned the ending a massive sequel bait and honestly terrible. I am pretty sure Telltaletook a holiday for the last 5 minutes of the game.

For fairness' sake The Wolf Among Us was nice too, but I really have a sweet tooth for the Sci-Fi setting above fantasy/mystery ones.A lot has been already written on the details like great stylish graphics, sound, excellent memorable characters and voiceovers, etc. so I just stick with a feeling Tales from the Borderlands gives.From the very first minutes of gameplay I was immediately hooked and enveloped with the game world's atmosphere, tiny details which matter and the way how I could actually relate to some most crucial choices character was offered and executed and how it impacted future storyline.Naturally, you cannot expect to have complete variability from such a game, but I considered it to be just a constraint you are given in basically any game out there.Well, it's been a while since I got such a warm feeling from entertainment product of late. It hit a string in me and actually felt as an *adventure* and I was sad it finally has gotten to an end.Ultimately this game is about the value of friendship, trust issues between human beings, enveloped in road-story with a lot of humour, sometimes seemingly stupid characters and packed with a lot of nice action scenes.So if you feel a need to take a short break from modern generic games, you might give this one a try.P.S. And no, it's not ""adventure"" in sense of ""quest-ish"" type of game, I don't understand why so many people ""point-and-click"" this out, if you forgive wordplaying.* This review is based on GOG version."

Still, it took only a couple of minutes to get back into the flow, Telltale Games have expertly captured the spirit and style of the original shooters and ported the setting into their very own style of adventure games.Hilarious, funny, hilariously funny at times, Telltale still sprinkled in enough drama and a little bit of mystery to keep it multi-dimensional. I really like the characters and that they are original in their own right, not just copycats from the shooters (even though the cameos from known characters are much appreciated as well).Personally, I like a good story and good presentation above everything else, so I do not mind being relegated to a few clicks per minute and the game being more of an interactive movie than a real game.

You only have one gun, with ONE BULLET, and something tells me I'm gonna want to save it for later. The characters are hilarious and sympathetic all at the same time, and the writing is the best in the series (in my opinon) in terms of a mix of action and suspense that the ""regular"" Borderlands might never pull off due to their design as pure action games.The one complaint I have is the price.

Wenn man allerdings auch nur ein kleine Interesse an der Welt und deren Bewohner hat, darf man diesen Teil nicht auslassen.Episode 1 ist sehr gut gelungen, Borderlands Neulingen wird direkt gezeigt, was es heißt im Borderlands-Universum zu leben. Allerdings sollten diese sich kurz ansehen, was eine Vault in diesem Spiel ist.Dieser Teil der Borderlandsreihe hat kein Skillsystem, nicht das übliche Loot-What-You-See und keine Charakterauswahl. Statt dessen spielt man Rhys, einen Hyperionagenten, und Fiona, eine Conartistin. Diese unterscheiden sich durch ihre besonderen eigenschaften, Rhys hat ein Cyberauge, mit dem er Wissenswertes über Personen oder Gegenstände erfahren kann.  Fiona hat Geld. Individualisierung der Charaktere geschieht hier durch die Gesprächsoptionen und, höchst wahrscheinlich, durch das modifizierte Lootsystem. Man muss sich entscheiden, welche Gegenstände man gerne benutzen möchte und diese lootet man. Hier spielen wir nun einmal nicht wie üblich einen mächtigen und rücksichtslosen Vault Hunter, sondern normale Bewohner dieses Universums, in dem man alles tun muss, um zu überleben.Selbst kleinere Entscheidungen fühlen wichtig an, wieviel Geld man für Gegenstände ausgeben möchte und ähnliches. Der Soundtrack passt sehr gut und der Plot ist stimmiger und spannender als die vorgehenden Teile, was natürlich auch zum großteil daher kommt, dass dieses Spiel kein Egoshooter ist, sondern eher ein Point & Click Adventure, dadurch lässt sich die Geschichte natürlich ganz anders erzählen. Die Charaktere haben sehr gute Dialoge und passen gut in das Universum.Lohnt sich aufjedenfall!"

The game played well, the dialog was funny and in most cases flowed really naturally (which can be rare in these sort of games) and the visuals were exactly like the predesesor games. You get sucked in and can't wait for more.The Pros:Characters you can indentify with. You just find yourself getting along with them and you really want to root for them.A really good character driven story. As above, you root for them, and the story pushes you to want them to win.The visuals and gameplay: It ran at a solid 30 FPS with only a few bits of stuttering on my pretty old  mid range laptop. That's got to mean something. There's lots to explore, scan and see.The Cons:The quicktime events are stupid easy to complete. I didn't miss one out of a few hours of gameplay and I think the game is way to forgiving in that sense. Maybe that's a feature but to me it felt like they were very slow in most instances and could be completed without much effort.I said above that there is lots to do. And that's true. There is loads to see. But every environment only had maybe 6-7 things tops to scan, talk to and intereact with. That's why I'm saying 'lots' because there are loads of environments. Taken at an individual level though, there isn't a huge amount to do. Sure, the charm of the game is in the dialog and characters but it would have been nice to have been able to explore a bit more, or scan more things. That's not to say that the areas weren't awesome, they really were.Overall, 8/10. It just needed a little more to do per area wise."

Oh, what's that? We're not just rehashing the same game again?Yeah, that's right, and if you're familiar with Telltale Games, and you played the hell out of ""The Walking Dead,"" ""The Wolf Among Us,"" or any of their other similar titles, odds are, you are going to love ""Tales from the Borderlands,"" just as I did. Esspecially if you happen to already be steeped in the Borderlands story.Now make no mistake. If you're not familiar with Telltale Games, but you are familiar with the Borderlands IP, this may not be what you're expecting. Telltale Games are story driven, heavy dialogue, narratives that feel much more like a movie than a game. That's not to say there isn't action. Hell, this is Pandora we're talking about, and it's just as violent and bloody as you remember it! But this is not an FPS, so don't be expecting one.As per the norm with Borderlands games, the writing is witty, hilarious, and, more often than not, brutally heavy on the dark humor.Also important to remember, TtG release things episodically, so although you'll be starting out with only about a 1 and a half to 2 hour game, that will be extended as the new seasons are released periodically (at no extra charge, of course). It really turns in to about the same thing as waiting for the new season of that show you like... but usually much faster.Bottom line, if you love games from Telltale, or you happen to really love the story in Borderlands, this one is for you.So go buy it, OR I'LL...

Story was surprisingly good considering how the writing in Borderlands games usually is, and there's very few ""meme"" references, if that puts you off.

In it you play as two characters, Rhys and Fiona. You then recount events from each of their points of views and play out events in the past, affecting their futures, Got it? Good.Pros:+Good voice acting+Longer length ( about 2 hours and 30 minutes )+More interactive combat sequencesCons:-Too many jokes-Story is all over the place-Towards the end things stop making senseIt's a good debut for a new game from Telltale.

So I gave it a shot and was dumbfounded. (In a good way.) So here's a review:Episode 1:Pros:-Set the suprisingly high standard of the series-Awesome tough choices-Absolutely hillarions-Perfect point-and-click gameplay-Relateable and human characters-Great soundtrack-Story worthy of a movie-Greatest voice acting in a game (Other than The Last Of Us and Halo 4)Cons:-Short (2-3 hrs)-That's it!I know most steam reviews tell a funny moment and give a 10/10, but this is an honest rating.9.2/10This is because I can't wait to see what they can do next!Episode 2: Atlas MuggedPros:-More focused on the story-Awesome puzzles-Still absolutely hillarious!-The intro credits scene is great!!!!!!-Handsome Jack!Cons:-Not as over the top as episode 1-Still short as heck-Nothing else (really!!)Memorable scenes:-The intro-Pimping your ride-Robbing your own house-ATHENAAAAAAAA!-The cliff hanger (I trusted Jack)I think a step away from the over the top action and into the story for a while was a great idea, and I think it did a great job setting up episode 3.9.4/10Episode 3: Catch a ridePros:-Awesome story-Everything else I already mentoined-Arguably the best one yet!Cons:-Still shorter than Vaughn (Yeah I went there)9.7/10Episode 4: Escape plan BravoPros:-Everything!!!! (I got to fight people with finger guns!!!!)Cons:-None (It's too awesome for length to matter, even if it's the shortest one yet)Memorable scenes:-Building a spaceship-Settling stuff with finger guns.-Not spoiling any deaths here...Before I start this review, i want to congratulate telltale on making this finale the best it could be. They haven't made a bad episode, and with all the pressure to keep going, that makes it all the morespecial. 20th century fox announced a borderlands movie, (no, really. They did.) Doesn't everyone know it's a bad idea to make video game movies, well this prettymuch was one. Since they didn' f this up, it might be good.Here we go!Episode 5: The vault of the travelerPros:-The story-The intro-Vaughn grew a beard?-Vault hunting-Gortys Power Rangers!-Going inside the traveller-Picking your crew (Apparently, and I quote: Felix was ""too dead"" to join my team)Although this has the most pros, it also has the most cons including:-Still too awesome for length to matter. Wait, isn't that a pro? Whatever.-Preformance and ghraphical issues, including teleporting people, faces and disappearing frames.-Obvious plot twists ""Time heals all wounds."" Seriously? That's the best you can do? I saw through that like clean glass!10/10Overall game Review:Say what you will about the number of quick time events, or the engine it runs on, because Tales From The Borderlands has the best story Have ever seen in gaming (yes, it's better than the last of us and a crap ton of bethesda rpgs). Everything else about the game is perfect! This is a near perfect game!Despite all the cons, this is the best episode in the series, Judge all you want. This is my review! Make your own!Thank you Telltale, for letting me enjoy the BEST 10 hours of gaming in my entire life! (Yeah, I said it, and I meant every word.)I reccomend this more than any video game on the market, and I love it that much. Why did you spend all that time reading this review! Get the freaking game! Get. It. Now. Wtf are you waiting for? It's not even full price for a game! I'm waiting. Go. Shut up and go. I don't care about the amount of quick time events.

I can make or break relationships with one decision, I honestly got (and frankly still am, a lot) really emotionally invested in the characters, especially Rhys (my personal favorite). By the first hour into the game I was already in love with the characters and my heart honestly aches to see their story come to an end, so I'm pouring my heart into this review. Anyways, on with the meat of the review:Pros:- The story line is immersive, the characters really get you attached and interested into whats what, with the added awesomeness that it still contains the original Borderlands (2) (visually and humorously) feel with a similar taste in humour.- Beautifully written dialogue and voice casting, the simplest innocent line said in the right way can make you double over laughing or get really sad, something I experienced many times in this narrative.- The DRAMA, or lack thereof... who knows? It's your decision.- Story line is on point with my emotions, it's really really good.- Let me just say again, the characters arefantastic. I wouldn't have them any other way.-Guess who's baaaaack...(What some people may call)Cons:- 99.9999999999999% less guns, but it's really not about the guns, sorry to those Unkempt Harold lovers.- Too shortfor me.- Not a whole lot of actual movement in the game, a lot of watching and clicking dialogue, not to say that there isn't ANY movement it's just substantially less than any of the Borderlands games by like 90%In any case, If you're on the edge on whether to buy this game or not, just get it, on a rainy day or when you're trying to avoid relatives it'll be a great way to cacoon yourself away and enjoy the rollercoaster of this story. I would obviously suggest getting this game on sale, but it's honestly worth whatever cost. Alright maybe not 10 million dollars, but close."

76561198257990575,Recommended,330830,33435698,Posted: 10 July,all,JewPowersActivate,"Enjoyable game with a likeable and well designed cast of characters and good story, but with lacking gameplay and slightly irrelevant choices.TFTB is a choice game with an episodic story with two protagonists, told largely in the past tense. Good for fans of choice games and story rich games, with quick time gameplay.Optimal Controller: Console ControllerProsCharactersTelltale shows this great ability to take the Borderlands style and adapt it into the characters. They don't take themselves too seriously, keeping the story away mostly from anything too dark, but they're also nuanced and unique. On top of everything, they're just likeable. You'll be rooting for the protagonists.Story- Some PartsWell thought out story executed equally well. Telltale show themselves to be good storytellers who can make their stiry generally very atmospheric and immersive. It's normally quite light, but also spectacular, dark, and emotional in parts. But it's also uninteresting and slow paced in others. The ending is  a classic happy ending, thoughyou never find out what's in the vault and what happens to the characters, and there's no massive endgame choice that affects the ending.That being said, the characters definitely earn their happy ending.MusicIt's quite minor, but TFTB features some very good music that really sets the scene. There's a variety of genres, but the intro music Jungle- Busy Earning is amazing.No ClaptrapUnless you got prankedConsGameplayIn a video game, it's not great for the primary con to be gameplay. TFTB is best made as a movie with choice. A semi-game. The quick time gameplay isn't a pro or a con, it's generally not particularly interesting or poor, but the puzzle gamelay in between story segments isn't great. It's not terrible or frustrating, it just isn't really fun. Walking around an area to click on an item and walk to another area to click on another thing isn't very fun, but it sums up most of the slow time gameplay.Story- Some PartsI already said most of this in the Story section, but I'll say it again briefly. Sometimes the story lags a bit or gets to an uninteresting part. However, this is a minor complaint as the majority of the story is perfectly fine. The ending too, isn't very magnitudal but wraps the game up nicely.VariesChoicesWhen Telltale tells you that X will remember that, they're usually lying. It's nice to have a choice, but when you realise that it was useless you realise that it was just a hurdle to progress the story. Enough of the choices were meaningful or humorous enough to drive this out of the Cons header, but too many are meaningless. Each option, when faced with a choice, will usually offer a unique sentence of dialogue before reverting back to where the game wants you to be. The dialogue is, however, well written enough to justify it. Yet I find many of the 'major' choices to be inconsequential and only a few to make a genuine difference.To conclude, a good game definitely worth a purchase and definitely a cut above the average Steam content, but not perfect with a few major flaws."

,Recommended,330830,34695299,Posted: 2 September,all,The Eater of Dreams,"I'm going to go into this review assuming you're already familiar and down with the established Telltale formula, for all its quirks. That is, you're more interested in an interactive story where your choices are mostly reflected in dialogue, rather than changing major plot points. Where the outcome is largely the same but the details along the way become your own - a customized telling, so to speak. If that style isn't your thing, then this won't be either.This might well be the most successful transition of another intellectual property to Telltale game I've played. The Borderlands series seems at first like a really odd choice for a story-based game, given it has always been about shooting guns and then looting better guns. But beneath the violence and over-the-top style of humour, the games have always had heart.So it's in this bizarre setting that two non-action heroes can really shine. The game's world is utterly insane, but everyone knows it and they just try to roll with it.There's a grounded feel to all the wackiness.Sure, it's a horrible death world where masked psychopaths regularly have murder for breakfast, but it's still a world where people have family, friends, and dreams. It's cartoonish but never consequence-free, and though death is practically the wallpaper, it's still something to be afraid of and sometimes mourned.The writing is enjoyable and mostly maintains a good balance between silliness and seriousness. Moments of drama are interrupted by someone's awkward phrasing, or a surprisingly easy solution to the problem. Characters maybe are a little too self-aware, frequently commenting on their own actions even as they do them, but there areplenty of great jokesthat hit the mark along with oodles of physical humour. I laughed out loud more than once.The strongest aspect is the large cast of shady characters. Instead of the usual set of grizzled mercenaries spouting one-liners, the dual protagonists are a corporate jerk and a devious con-woman. You alternate between controlling each of them, and their adversarial relationship turned begrudging respect is consistently fun to play around with. They're not action heroes, but you're frequently plunged into situations the heroes of the main games would have shrugged off with barely a sweat, and so you're left to see how normal people would deal with it.There are plenty of gems in the supporting cast as well. Some faces are familiar, but for the most part it doesn't rely too heavily on returning characters. They're mostly cameos, temporary allies, or even opposition along the way, but they're never the main focus. The cast is brought to life bysuperb voice actingby some of the best talents in the business, though the typically clunky facial animation can take away from that a little.Also of note, as ever with the series, the creators haveexcellent taste in music, making for some awesome musical action sequences to introduce the episodes. I have at this point frequently had to admit I found certain bands I like through the Borderlands games.There was just a whole lot I liked about this particular story. From its pacing, to its characters, to its consistent tone. I would say there are a few narrative missteps that I won't get into here, but my final feelings are thoroughly positive.I do recommend having finished at least Borderlands 2before playing this. Major plot points from that are glossed over without further explanation, so it would be best to know them. It draws from the Pre-Sequel as well, but not as heavily.Overall, if you enjoy the setting, and want to know what comes next, this is a great way to enjoy the universe from another perspective and in another style."

There is definitley a replay value, however I didn't play it a second time through because I would personally rewind a chapter and make different decisions based on how I thought it would play out at the end of the game.Tales from the Borderlands doesn't keep you enthralled by making you watch cut scenes.

Honestly, I always felt like Borderlands 2 was a failure to the original borderlands game - it always felt like it was forcing the already heavy-handed story on me, and the guns had all become super accurate, rendering more spammy guns like the combat rifles useless, so I'd really hesitated before buying this absolutely fantastic game.I don't want to reveal too much, because as with all telltale games, this is more similar to watching a film or a tv show than it is to playing a game - however, it is very interactive, and from what I've seen, your actions have more potential dialogue results than in the other two telltale games I've played (the walking dead s1, wolf among us), at least, from a player's point of view. It's mostly a mashup of heist/treasure hunter adventure films all set in the borderlands setting. They've done one hell of a job, and I'm seriously a great fan of both genres - this is insanely well done, I enjoyed every moment.As with every telltale game I've seen yet, they've done the climax insanely well, involving both the player and the story on the highest degree out of the entire period of the game, making it exhilarating to both play and witness. I'm happy to say this is my favourite game I've played yet, and my second favourite film/tv show."

,Recommended,330830,32839633,Posted: 26 June,all,DavyDaveDavid,"Tales from the Borderlands is a successful adaptation of the Borderlands IP into another epic from TellTale Games. The game is, as always from TellTale, a story-driven, episodic, point & click, adventure game, featuring two playable main protagonists: Rhys, a suave but cowardly businessman from the Hyperion Corporation; and Fiona, a hardened and beautiful con artist born and raised on the Planet Pandora. After things go south for Rhys when his rival steals his chance at the big leagues, and a job for Fiona goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ the two reluctantly team up for one extraordinary adventure that eventually leads them to the spoils of a Vault.I have a fairly recent computer, still lacking a GPU I’m afraid, and I was able to easily play this game with 720p and high settings. For the unique art style of Borderlands, the game looks great and I can’t recall any times I had lag because of hardware issues.Thanks to this game being episodic, we get more awesome intro and outro pieces for each episode. However only the finale gets individual songs for its intro and outro, for the rest each respective song plays at the beginning and end of their episode. Other musical pieces featured in the game will perfectly set you into the mood and place on Pandora.Despite that I had a lot of fun with the main story, I’m a little disappointed we didn’t spend some more time world building. Granted, I’m thankful we got to see more from Hyperion and learn they’re not completely filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Learning that there are some genuinely “normal” people on Pandora is great to lighten up the mood for the planet. Before we meet Fiona and her peers, our idea of the common Pandorans were Psychos and Bandits, this game makes that seem like less of the case. Getting back on topic, what I would have wanted to learn more is stuff outside of Pandora. Not counting this, we’ve spent two games on Pandora and one on its moon, Elpis. I would’ve loved to learn more outside of these two. However, now I can only think how this game will impact future installments in the main series, because some important♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down (literally, in one case).If you’re a fan of Borderlands and don’t mind the radical shift in gameplay, and the lack of badassitude in our main characters compared to previous ones, then you’ll enjoy Tales from the Borderlands.

The cast is very likeable. It's a more laid-back and humorous story but nevertheless has some dramatic moments were the voice actors and facial animators can shine even more. You control two characters coming from basically two different worlds (the stiff and seemingly clean corporate realm vs. the Pandorian dirt world of daily survival) explaining an obstacle-ridden treasure hunt journey from either perspectives, all-too-often mocking each other and their somewhat delusional attempts of sugarcoating their own place in it. As usual it's a heavily story-driven and cinematic game and nothing for oldschool adventure/puzzle lovers. For Telltale standards there is a relatively fair amount of moments where you can take your own pace and examine a thing or two or talk with someone a bit, however.There are more or less obvious references to the main Borderlands series as well as cameo appearances. Some I clearly know, others not because I've only played the original Borderlands. It still feels as if all is coming together well, and rather than to put me off make me more interested in the other loot-shooter titles within the main series. I doubt I will play them anytime soon though, as the compact and cinematic way of storytelling within a lore- and character-rich universe as it is done in ""Tales from the Borderlands"" fits me better for the moment."

I usually was like, yea, walking dead you are ok, yea walking dead 2 pls die, u sucks hard. But this... I offer my stylish Fiona hat to you guys. YOU DID GOOD. YOU DID REALLY GOOD. Who would thing i would be so hyped about story from Borderlands universe? But here i am. Looking forward to the future! If there is any? Maybe?And i hope that Sasha x Rhys thing isnt gone, when they poofed in the end..."

Tales from the Borderlands is a five part episodic game series from the creators of The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series. Set on the unforgiving world of Pandora after the events seen in Borderlands 2, this is a story full of Borderlands’ trademark humor, following two adventurers on their quest for greatness.You’ll play as Rhys, a Hyperion ‘suit’ with dreams of being the next Handsome Jack, and Fiona, a Pandoran con artist looking to score her biggest ever swindle. Thrown together as unwilling partners in an adventure to recover cash they both think is theirs, their journey will take you on a wild ride where gangsters, bandit lords, and Vault Hunters are just some of the obstacles you’ll encounter, in this new take on the award-winning universe created by Gearbox Software.  -  Highly Recommended!"

Don't listen to the stooges who say that it's TWD. They're wrong. This game has more to it than the three TWD games put together. The plot is strong, the characters are all memorable, and you actually feel for them. The game is 200% hilarious, and the scenes are brilliantly done to keep up a tone of light heartedness throughout most of the game. The moments when emotions change for various, well thought out reasons actually affect you emotionally. I admit that the game did nearly bring me to tears on one occasion, and was almost as successful twice more. It will make you angry, it will make you incredibly satisfied, and it will make you smile and laugh far more frequently than any other game.Buy it. Play it.

Yes, this game has great story,  fun characters and lots of action-packed goofiness. I would recommend it for these qualities alone. However, don't expect this to be traditional point & click type adventure game. Actually, don't expect it to be much of a game at all. Basically it's interactive movie with some very restricted gameplay elements. If you haven't played these games before, the gameplay goes something like this:[Long cutscene]""Not press Q repeatedly.""[Cutscene]""Now select some dialog options. You have few secs to select each.""[Long cutscene]""Now move around in this small room and try to find the thing you have to click.""[Cutscene]""Now press some arrow buttons in right order or you die.""...This being said, I do like the story, and the characters and yes it's fun.

,Recommended,330830,13216550,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Zed Clampet,"This is another great game from Telltale.  The only negative is that it is a little on the short side as it only took me 2.3 hours to finish.STORY:  Won't put any spoilers here.  The game is great fun and the story is full of action and adventure.  It really draws you in right from the start, though you probably won't get as emotionally attached to most of these characters as you did to the ones from The Walking Dead.  On the other hand, the action is pretty well non-stop.  When I did my playthrough of the game, I had to delete my commentary because there just wasn't room for it.  The story is just that full.MECHANICS:  Telltale has got this down to a science now, and even people who haven't played their games before should easily master the gameplay.  This is good, since the point here is not all the QTE events, but the story, and the mechanics flow so smoothly that they don't pull you away from the story.  Speaking of QTE events, there really aren't that many, and I didn't die in my playthrough.  Most of the interaction involves choosing conversation options.  Which brings me to my next section.CHOICES MATTER:   Honestly, and I've only played it once, but the choices don't seem to make a very big difference in what happens.  It would be more like The Walking Dead 1 rather than The Walking Dead 2.  I'm fairly certain everyone gets the same ending.  There are a couple of scenes where I can imagine that making a different choice would have a significant outcome in the next installment of this series, but it's hard to explain without giving away spoilers.  But this is all to be expected from the first installment.OVERALL:  If you like these Telltale games, you'll like this one as well.  Fun story, fun choices, exciting and tasteful QTE's.Hope this review was helpful.If you are still curious as to what it's like or would just rather watch someone play it, the link to my part 1 of the game is here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxDb4mShtUw&list=PLV8i2f0l80BlCsG9xgSSadD0d9GcO62mX"

But, my internet cut out for a week and I had to set about playing my handful of downloaded games, including Tales from the Borderlands.This was fortuitous. The game resisted my enthusiasm initally (exploring Pandora without a legendary SMG in my hand feels alien) but became immersive fairly quickly. The central plot is good, better than any in the original Borderlands series, and full of nuanced references.There are compelling twists, some genuinely moving moments, and a welcome return of Handsome Jack on best form. The choices give you a lot of power over shaping the central characters - deciding whether to make Rhys a Hyperion fascist or a moral adventurer, and Fiona either a cold-hearted con artist or a vault hunter in love with Scooter.All in all, a worthy contribution to an addictive series. Maybe Telltale Games will pick up the task of Half Life 3."

While I could go for a bit more on the traditional puzzle side, I can't argue with the success they've created for themselves.Tales from the Borderlands moves even more heavily into the area of dialogue than their previous offerings. And it works great. The dialogue is both sharp and genuinely funny. The central cast are likable and play off one another well, and playing as two of them gives you a great opportunity to shape what the central relationship actually looks like. More importantly you're never without a line that will allow you a dry retort, or simply give you a chance to make yourself look like an idiot. Never has been being an idiot such fun.I can't comment on how well it fits with Borderlands other than the aesthetic (which is spot on), but for anyone who is a fan of the Telltale format they owe it to themselves to get this series.

It's a typical albeit unique FPS RPG with some of the most annoying drop mechanics in a game i've ever seen. Also DLC out the♥♥♥♥♥ That said, it has a pretty interesting world with decent characters which makes it more sad the Gearbox writers decided the best way to utilisize would be making the story age horribly by adding in every meme they could think of for no good reason.With that in mind, while I enjoy the hell out of Telltale games I was a bit worried how this would turn out, especially with how The Walking Dead Season 2, while fantastic, lacked what made Season 1 so spectacular. After playing through episodes 1 -3 of Tales from the Borderlands I honestly think it's one of the best games Telltale has EVER released.It doesn't play like a Borderlands game yet it still has the charm of the games. The Borderlands UI, returning characters and craziness of Pandora makes it feel like home. So what is it about?You play Rhys, a Hyperion lackey who looked up to Handsome Jack and wishes to be as powerful and influential as him only to be let down time and time again by the company, and Fiona, a con-woman with her sister always hoping to get that big score and no longer on the run. After a big deal over a lurcious vault key goes wrong they find that there is something bigger they both must work towards, despite their distrust and dislike of each other. The story is told sometime in the future with a mysterious stranger who has unknown motives and asks both Rhys and Fiona of their sides of the story which of course, are bias in their own way and leads to pretty funny jokes and scenes. The pacing is just fantastic, voice acting is superb (seriously, the cast they got for this game is crazy; Nolan North, Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, freakin' Patrick Warburton?! As well as the original game voice actors!) and holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥the Intros are just amazing. Seriously, the first and second intros are hilarious and the music is incredibly fitting, better than any current Borderlands intro I've seen.My only complaint honestly is the gameplay is lacking, it is a Telltale game after all and QTE's do get repetitive and boring but dialogue choices are pretty solid. I just wish there was a bit more freedom in certain scenes, like in the original Walking Dead where you could talk to people and find out how they feel about a situation or whatever (which to be fair, they did a good job with in Episode 3). Regardless, it's a incredible and funny as hell experience and I'm really looking forward to seeing how the rest of the game pans out. If you're a Borderlands fan, why the ♥♥♥♥ don't you have this already? If you're not as big as a fan of Borderlands then it's still awesome and is definitely worth your time.Episode 1 - 9/10Episode 2 - 8/10Episode 3 - 8/10Episode 4 - 9/10 holy♥♥♥♥♥♥best episode, really funnyEpisode 5 - 9/10 Amazing.

,Recommended,330830,18628128,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Dj =D,"IntroductionThis was quite a difficult game to form an opinion on. Multiple times throughout the course of the episodes my opinion of it changed from good to bad and vice versa, heck, sometimes in the same episode. It was only recently I worked out why: it's because there are two main points to this game. And each time my opinion changed, I was focusing on a different one. So to make this review better, I'll be reviewing the two points seperately. The story and the gameplay. If you're a big borderlands fan and want to see more of Pandora and its people, then you'd do best reading story first. If you are more focused on just playing the game rather than the details behind it, then read gameplay first. I'll start with the story.The StoryAfter playing this game to completion, I can say that the story behind it was absolutely excellent. If the rumours of there being a Borderlands movie in the works are true, then I definitely hope that telltale is on the production team. It had its low points at times (The second episode is mostly just setting the stage for things to come), but then every story usually does. Episode 1 introduces you to the creative cast of characters ranging from Rhys and Vaughn, the nervous company men and their complete opposites Fiona and Sasha, two con artists adapted to the harsh life on Pandora. The story swaps between the two main characters at different points, and it's interesting to see events you saw previously played out again with this new perspective, revealing new information, though this does tend to happen less in some of the later episodes. Throughout the story there are multiple plot twists and unexpected surprises, all leading up to a big finale as the mysteries created since the start of the first episode are solved. There are also several cameos from different characters from the original Borderlands games, and it's always a welcome surprise to see a character return. I've got to hand it to Telltale as well, they portrayed Handsome Jack absolutely perfectly. He's the usual cold hearted homocidal♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he's still one of the best villains I've seen. Telltale understand this. They know that Handsome Jack is a great villain, and that a lot of Borderlands fans love him. Through this, they actually encourage you to feel genuinely sorry for him at points, a man who likely murdered thousands of innocent civilians. Dialogue is very well written as well, though sometimes I didn't really like the options I presented. As Fiona you can act nice to Rhys, then soon after in some scripted dialogue she would insult him again. It was a little annoying, but I imagine Telltale wanted the relationship of the characters to follow a set path. I enjoyed the ending until the very last section, which didn't make much sense. I do not know whether this will be left open to interpretation, or another season will be releasing in the future (or it may be referenced in a future full Borderlands game).To sum up, the story is very well written and interesting most of the time. The character cameos are a welcome addition, and getting to see more of Jack is always great thing. If you're a big fan of Borderlands and the characters behind it, you will enjoy this, and get to learn more about Pandora's lore in the process.The GameplayI'd like to warn you that I may give some minor spoilers about episode 3 in this section, as i'll be discussing a change in a feature. I won't disclose exactly what causes this change and why, and I'll highlight the section in which it is contained if you absolutely do not want any spoilers to the story.Unfortunately the gameplay is not up to the same standard as the story. This is an interactive movie with empthasis on the ""movie"" part. You can interact with the story, but your effects are minimal. Whatever you do, the story will continue on its set path eventually. While there are points at which you can create a minor deviance to the main storyline, most of the time these choices will simply give you some different dialogue, which would then transition into the same dialogue had you picked another choice, or give you a popup in the corner saying ""X will remember this"" (Which also seems to have no effect). Absolutely the most infuriating example of this (Medium episode 1 spoiler!)is when you are given an option to self-destruct your loader bot, or let them escape. If you choose to self-destruct, there is a large explosion and the usual ""Loader bot will remember that"". At the end of the episode Loader Bot is somehow back again completely fine!Aside from dialogue choices every so often, player interaction is relegated to a few quick time events which lead to restarting the sequence immediately on failure, very small ""minigames"" which can't be failed and occasional points at which you can walk around and interact with different objects. These sections allow you a little freedom in which you can explore, but you can still only progress a certain way.The only choices that seem to have genuine power to them occur at the end of an episode, but depending on the episode the severity of the consequences can vary. The final choice in Episode 2 changes the starting chapters of Episode 3 entirely (whichever your choice, eventually the two paths rejoin again) whilst at the end of Episode 4 what seems to be an extremely important choice is actually near enough useless. One choice gives the exact same outcome as the other, with an extra five minutes or so of dialogue. I was severely disapointed with that one.Minor Episode 1 and 3 spoilers coming up!Though I was more annoyed with the way the important choices were quickly stripped from the game. From the trailer and screenshots you can see evidence of a combat sequence with a loader bot. You select from multiple different parts, each with their own stats, then call down your bot and fight. This never happens again. An entire feature with stats and everything, and nothing is made out of it. When you are in Fiona's introductory scenes, you are told that she can use money to bribe people for better options, and can find multiple bundles of money on your way. Once again, you do this once. In future episodes, this currency is used purely for cosmetic options.Though the feature removal that angered me the most was Fiona's gun. It sounded like an excellent concept. A gun with only one bullet, would you use it or save it at different times? At the end of episode 1 you get your first chance to use a bullet, but like so many other choices, this is meaningless. You are told in the recap of Episode 1 ""A bullet saved is a bullet earned"". Then you're given two more bullets. Weakens the dramatic effect of the feature a bit, but you are given an upgrade in return. Three elements to select from with your shot, but each can only be fired once. You get another point to use your bullet, but this time you are forced to fire, and not allowed a choice. Once you choose an element, the camera focuses directly on your barrel, the empthasize the fact that you can now no longer use that element.Come episode three and you're suddenly given a box of infinite bullets and the one-shot element feature is gone as well. You have a ""lucky bullet"" in your inventory but this is never used either.It's like Telltale couldn't be bothered to make the story work around these features and just canned them instead.End of spoilersIn conclusion, I still enjoyed the game, but only after I decided to put my focus on the story and stop thinking about the effect of my choices. Your choices will have little or no effect whatsoever in the long run. It's better to think less of this as a game and more of just a film with interchangable dialogue, you'll enjoy it more. As such, I cannot recommend it at full price either. Get this on a sale if you're a Borderlands fan and can look past the lack of choice."

,Recommended,330830,13138415,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Kira,As soon as I heard that telltale was making this game I knew automatically to expect a high caliber of writing in the game's story but I was skeptical since I wasn't too much into borderlands. Suffice to say I bought this game based on critic reviews and I was blown away by how Telltale adapted borderlands to make their own spectacular story based game.The humor is hilarious. The two main lead characters are lovable scamps who both just want to move up in a corrupt and dangerous world. In terms of gameplay its standard telltale fare with point and click. Telltale however has thrown in some surprises that I don't want to spoil. The first episodes sets up the rest of the season spectacularly and most important of all makes you emotionally invested in the two main leads.I personally wasn't the biggest fan of borderlands games before I played this since i didn't care much for acquiring loot but this game hooked me.Pandora is a beautiful twisted world with a lot to offer to any player.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone seeing as there is no prerequisite of playing any of the borderlands games to be able to understand and enjoy this game. Telltale however has taken care to reward those hardcore players by ensuring a keen eye to detail in the borderlands lore.At this point stop reading my review and buy this game!

This game is brilliant. For a comedy game, I never thought I would actually grow to care for characters in this. The story is good, the comedy is amazing and very well written at times, the options to change how your character(s) and certain NPC's look adds a very personal touch to things and the music. The general score for the game is spot on and fits each scene well but the licensed music is perfect. All 5 intro songs and the final credits song for episode 5 really capture the mood of what is happening in such a precise way, it paints a vivid picture. If you don't like Borderlands or have never played it in the first place, it doesn't matter. The game is accessable to new comers (such as myself) and is even better for those who have played the other games in the series (which I had done around the time episode 4 was released) If this isn't an argument for video games being art then I don't know what is.

If you want a ""real review"" then go on youtube and search up some douch canooe who gets payed to do this sort of thing.CharactersWell this game is obviously a different breed of borderlands gameplay that anyone who has played any of the Borderlands titles is used to, but that's no reason to put it down yet. The game starts you off with two protagonists, Rhys : A hyperion ""suit"" as they call it trying to make his way on being the next handsome jack and taking the place on the Hyperion throne and Fiona: A pandoran con artist just trying to make a quick buck when a deal takes a turn for the worst.   Right off the bat you can see that these characters have some chemistry and it's good to see the same story telling mechanics used in previous Telltale games. Both Rhys and Fiona come from two different mental and physical backrounds, which really plays in to the whole opposites attract sort of scenario that seems to have been going on in most of the story of episode one. Surprisingly enough the characters will seem to be edged into your head and make you want to keep playing the game so that you find out what happens to them.Story TellingThis part catches you by surprise almost. Not to say that I was having some negative expectations, but I was not expecting anywhere near this decency in the ability to tell a tale in a Borderlands game. I guess Telltale sort of gave it that pizazz that it needed. Previous Tell tale games in the near past that we've seen have tended to keep us at the edge of our seat in some high quality drama without a comedic breaking point to sort of tell us that this is not a complete sob story. While this game manages to do that, but balance it out with a high amount of comedy to keep  telling our selves things such as ""I remember that from the last games"" or ""I get the refrence"" I can tell there were probably more in there, but the most obvious one I heard was when a loader bot said ""Fatality"" after murdering some bandits. No, its not a complete sob story that will make you cry(at least I hope not) like with The Walking Dead games 1 and 2, but it delivers that sort of emotion that you keep hidden to tell yourself that you're a man at night and will give you enough feels to walk up to the mirror and tell yourself ""Could that have gone better?"". Also yes I am quoting myself.GameplayWell lets face it these games are really never ment to deliver quality gameplay with non buggy controls and hyper sensetive movments that will lock on your every move to ensure that you get the best gaming experience possible, but for the most part the controls are on point to me. Never did I yell at my screen that literally displays images in 1s and 0s like I did with the first Walking Dead game trying to get Lee to move in the right direction or stop walking into a wall. Nor did I call out ""Bull♥♥♥♥♥♥"" When I swore on my life that I hit the W key to move out of the way from an incoming attack, but the game did not register even though it was painfully obvious that I hit it at the right moment.Summary: The game delivers the idea of a Dynamic duo with a tastes of opposites attract and sets it off really well with the chemistry that both of them hold torwards eachother and succesfully delivers a game with comedy, but still manages to keep that Telltale spunk and gives us that tiny pinch of drama we need from a game like this. The gameplay is pretty good and has almost no issues to begin with. Though I feel like they werent giving us a 110% with this one I truly believe that they struck a decent landing with it.My score: 8.5/10 Gives us that extra pinch of borderlands we need after the pre-sequel"

I had fun even. However there are a lot of things that tick me off about Tales from Borderlands.The first and major thing is:IT IS NOT WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED AS.The devs give you an illusion of choice - no matter what you choose the outcome remains preaty much same. Sure, you have those small variancies in story but in the end the major things remian as they are.(The steam achievements are a dead giveaway).The second major flaw:To get the result devs want they will bring in the most audacious logic and twisted mechanics be it in story telling, action and even physics.Aside those the other cons are:- long dialogs that suddently spring a QTE on you (sure, you can pause and get you bearing but still)- control of character is given to you to perform actions like:- press that one and only button,- walk that one small walkway- Q smash for action like just standing up- control of character is also taken away randomly: you see a ""purple"" item and want to approach to pick it up and...no- no rewind or skip option for sequences you have already witnessed- around 10h for entire 5 chapter story- sometimes it wants to be an adventure game but falls sooo shortPros:- borderlands music- good voice acting- some humour- Loader BotOverall.Good to get the whole package on sale only."

It crashes on game over, it doesn't actually save your game, and it stutters no matter how low the graphics are set. The story is presumably good, but considering I can't even make it past Chapter 1 because, as I said, it constantly crashes and refuses to save my progress, I don't really know that!"
,Not Recommended,330830,33847098,Posted: 27 July,all,ChromeAlum,"Compared to other games made by Telltale, TFTB is a good game. When put in the context of the Borderlands series...not so much. The first chapter lures you in, and by all means is a good chapter. I enjoyed the hell out of it. The problems come a little later in the next chapters.Handsome Jack is not the same as he was in Borderlands TPS and 2. The differences are very off putting, with his slight voice differences and the fact that his personality just doesn't match. In BDL2, Handsome Jack was maniacal, crazy, and of course silly at times. But he always had a purpose and a drive. Handsome Jack in TFTB is more of a ""hur-dur killing people is fun, wouldn't it be funny if I just called people names the entire game.""At first, it is fun getting the small teases from other established Borderlands character, but it gets out of hand quickly where some become shoehorned into the game in order to create drama. The main protaganists are well designed characters, so having someone from another game pop-up for 1 scene becomes a tedious distraction.I will give Telltale some credit in the fact that Deus ex-machina is used sparingly. Where I have issues is when the problems that the characters face in the first place arrive out of nowhere in the same style. Everything is fine until it isn't, but no reason is given as to why it happened. This gets predictable and infuriating after the 5th time.I would end this by saying that if you like TTG and haven't played Borderlands, you would probably enjoy it. But if you really like Borderlands, just know that this game might end up different than you would have expected for a Borderlands game."

,Not Recommended,330830,24828538,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,LittleFaust,"When I played it the first time, it honestly enjoyed it. It was my first game in this ""choose your own adventure""-book style, and I enjoyed the funny and over the top story. Some parts in Episode 4 and 5 were unexpectedly sad, but I still would have recommended it for the earlier episodes, and brilliant scenes like theemployee gun fight on Helios station.A year has passed, and I have played ""Life is Strange"". Since I enjoyed  ""Tales from the Borderlands"" the first time, I started a second playthrough. That was my mistake.""Tales from the Borderlands"" is by no means a bad game, but I noticed how horribly unpolished it actually is.First thing I noticed when I started it was the language. I am not a native English speaker, but I always play in English (if that is the original language of the game), because of the superior voice acting. For most of the games I own the language is set by the Steam settings, it used to work for this game too. Seems like they patched that ""bug"". The in-game language is  now the system language/region of the computer.After I taught my computer English I could finally start playing the game, but I gave up after 2 Episodes.1. It is impossible to skip dialogues. Or cutscenes. Not even the recap at the beginning of an Episode. If you played the game once, and know that a certain part of the dialogue or scene is not interesting, have fun watching it again, completely. That alone does not sound too bad, does it?2. It gets frustrating if you are trying to test different choices, because there are so few checkpoints. Decide to reload from the last checkpoint to see how the conversation could have turned out? Prepare to watch three minutes of cutscenes again. Or more. The same happens if you actually manage to die during the fight scenes.3. Controls and Camera. In some parts of the game you can move the main character in third-person view. Usually you have to scan things with his special ability. That works sometimes, but every time you are in a big room game desing fails completely. The controls are clunky and slow, there are tons of invisble walls, and the camera angles are set.  Even the camera angles for the scanning ability are set, depending on where the player is standing. That would be fine for a game with 1D-movement, but they give you an illusion of exploration. It is impossible to stray even a little bit from the rails they put you on. It would actually be more enjoyable if just 1D-movement was possible.Maybe my mistake was playing TftB again after playing ""Life is Strange"". I know that TftB is older, but freedom to chooose the language, skippable cutscenes and voice lines, as well as a decent camera system is no rocket science.If you dont mind paying more than 20€ on a 12 h movie go ahead, its not bad. But don't expect to be able to discover all the choices without a lot of frustration, and don't be disappointed if you just want to look around the usually well designed environments."

I'll give you some advice, save his life if you do buy this game.Sure, the game has a unique charm to it, and the characters are somewhat likeable. I liked Jack somewhat (Though he really becomes more of an annoyance in chapters 3,4, and 5); And the narrative I liked as well, with a couple of surprise twists in the mix. However, playing through the story again, you'll find that most of your decisions are, again, completely pointless. If you're a fan of Tell Tale, then you'll like the game.

This is an interactive story where all you get to do is some ""press left"", ""press right"" or button mashing actions when the game tells you (dragon's lair style...) or make some dialog decisions that might affect your relationship with the character you're talking to, but not really affect the story at all. There's also some scenes were the game tries to give an ""adventure game"" like feel, where you can walk around and you have an inventory and stuff, but you get through those after a few button clicks on well marked spots on the screen. As I said, it's like a movie, you just sit back and watch through most of it.That would be good enough if it were a great story. I admit that the first episode got me hooked and I thought it was going to be interesting. But the more it progresses, the more it becomes like one of these clichéd movies that hollywood churns out by the dozens today, with a ""group of friends"" of watered down characters that ""stick together"" and ""have an adventure"" etc. It's a good idea to create a story in the borderlands universe and see familiar characters doing cameos, but I don't think the feel of this game captures accurately the Borderlands feel."

Loads of people I know were talking about Telltale games, which they were told were amazing. The same resonance seems to be in the professional reviewer community. And then you play the game. If you can call it that. You don't really play at all. Telltale games are (essentially) glorified movies. You move the story along by choosing dialogue lines. While your choices matter in the short run, the grand scheme of the story stays unchanged, so it quickly begins to feel rather futile. You might as well program a bot that always clicks the first option and enjoy the movie. ""But wait"", you ask, ""isn't there any actual gameplay?"". Well, I'm glad you asked. There is one form of ""gameplay"": Quicktime events. That's right. The worst kind of gameplay.So overall, while the storyline is quite funny and at times original, I would hesitate calling this a game. It is desperately trying to be a movie. But then, I'm quite sure, this wouldn't make for a good movie either. It is, in one word, disappointing.TL,DR: Quicktime events are the only gameplay. The majority of the ""game"" is spent staring at the screen and making dialogue choices without meaningful impact. If you were hoping for another fun Borderlands adventure, you will be sorely disappointed.Judging by the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews, it seems that people around here are more and more looking for the one-way kind of entertainment that TV used to offer and streams offer these days. If that is for you, this game might be for you. But honestly, you're probably cheaper off and even happier watching someone play through it on a stream. It will cost you even less effort than playing the game and it allows you to shut of your brain entirely."

When I enter Scooter's workshop, playing as Fiona, the workshop is subtly but definitely broken; there is not only no icon for turning on or off the radio to your immediate left upon entering, but also no radio to begin with! Additionally, there is no container to steal cash from, but also no vending machine around the corner of where the first vending machine is. If you're reading this, and you're able to relay it to anyone who would be able to fix this issue at Gearbox, 2K, or Steam, please do.I do not recommend this game for the time being, because you will not be able to play it as long as this roadblock in Episode 2 is still up."

I say this because most of the so called choices in this game have little or no consequence to the plot. I would enjoy this game more if choosing different actions can change the plot more significantly and the story can branch to, like, 5 different endings (I don't mind even if 3 of the endings are quite similar). Buta game where most of the gameplay consists of picking choices, but the plot doesn't move much when I pick the opposite important decision, is disappointing to me. Especially with so much hype.Sure, the music and the graphics and such are quite pleasing, but I feel cheated because the store page says ""Your choices matter, changing the story around you, and making the tale yours."" Yes. You forgot to mention they don't matter much.I've played RPGs (where the main selling point isn't the plot branches) that has more plot flexibility than this. And I'd rather watch some of my favourite movies again if I knew that this game doesn't give what I want - plot branches. The top 3 helpful reviews being 2 sentences long at the time doesn't help.TL;DR Misleads people into believing plot branches as one of the main selling points of the game. If you can enjoy an interactive movie where most of the gameplay is picking choices but doesn't actually branch the story out, good for you. I won't buy anything from Telltale anytime soon though.A request: Please stop upvoting helpful reviews only because you agree with it.

""Get Tiny Tina's Doll."" or ""Find porno-mags for that one guy at New Haven.""How should I put it, if you think that Borderlands 2 had too much Internet Meme's and it practically ruined your experience a bit......Forget about that, Tales from the Borderlands knows when to not make jokes annoying and manages to separate Serious Hilarity and Silly Hilarity, something the original Borderlands games' somewhat failed to do in my oppinion.I'd say Tell Tales Games managed to write better plot then the original Borderlands' plot, it shows you that there is more then 8 BAZILLION GUNS in Borderlands and that there actually is people living on Pandora.Even though the game is a point and click game, it's really tense at most, no breaks on the game train.Tales from the Borderlands managed to deliver something which I value TTG for; awesome characters that you care for and everyone of them has their thing that makes them unique. They managed to set off a plot without deadtime, it was great all the way through.This game is perfect if you finished the Borderlands 2 but got tired of all the Internet culture and memes from the DLC's, which to be honest happened so often the Borderlands series grew dull - this game brings quality back to the Borderlands universe and I can't wait to play Episode 2.This game was the last nail in the coffin, Tell Tale Games will always be recommended by me.Well ♥♥♥♥ing Done TTG, Well ♥♥♥♥ing Done!EDIT: Episode 5 was the biggest disappointment, during the course of the entire Episode 5 I only touched the controller twice the rest LITTERALLY played itself.It's like they fired all the people that worked on the game up to episode 4 and then decided that they wanted the game to suck.The Last Episode of Tales of the Borderlands ruined everything they had built up, it'd be a better ending if everyone just toppled over and died in the end of the episodeEverything above the EDIT?

As a result, I found this game fun, funny, and a worthy addition to the canons of both Borderlands and Telltale. However, I also think it is the most flawed Telltale game they have produced so far, full of problems that I really hope don't become the standard. I also can't recommend this game unless you are both a Borderlands and a Telltale fan like I am; for a Borderlands purist it would be boring and pointless, and for a Telltale purist it's just too bloated with Borderlands in-jokes and references.[ALL SPOILERS]The game has two protagonists, Rhys and Fiona. Rhys is a well designed everyman voiced by Troy Baker, full of flaws and ambitions, and undertaking a complete arc through the course of events. Fiona, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. Despite being voiced by the great Laura Bailey, she is bland, has a stilted character arc, and for some reason shares Rhys' asymmetry despite it making no sense for her already-overdesigned outfit. I really wanted to like Fiona, but she is just not close to the rounded character that Rhys is.Part of the problem comes from her sister, Sasha, being given what should have been Fiona's attention throughout the entire game. Sasha is a fan-fiction Mary Sue, however much you want to deny it. She can do no wrong, is consistantly given lots of screen time, gets two simultanious romance arcs, and is a central part of the motivations of both Rhys and Fiona for nearly the whole game. This culminates in the final episode, where everyone talks and anticipates her arrival, she gets to make a heroic sacrifice, and then gets a long death scene to serve as the primary emotional payoff for the entire plot. Fiona stands by, doing nothing but agree with everyone else and watch Sasha. Fiona is the sidekick, and despite being a playable character contributes less and less as the plot moves forward.Speaking of playability, there isn't that much. This is the first Telltale game in which I really got the impression that they were writing a movie and occasionally remembered they needed to throw in some gameplay. As a result, what there is feels token. When you have a gun, there is only one thing to shoot. If you fail a quicktime event, nothing happens and the scene continues anyway. The unique talents of each character, Rhys's scanning and Fiona's wallet (yes, really), are underused, serving as skippable jokes and very occasional paid-choices respectively.All this would be forgivable if the plot itself was worthwhile. Unfourtunately, the storyline is far too ambitious, with ludicrous amounts of scope stretched thin over the final two episodes. The entire game consistently commits a Telltale sin by prioritising plot and spectacle over character. The exception is the first episode, which has a grounded scope and deals with much firmer character beats (ambition and revenge for Rhys, betrayal for Fiona) and thus succeeds brilliantly. From there they took it on an increasingly zany on-rails rollercoaster that left the characters, especially Fiona, behind.Worse still, Rhys's character arc based around a Handsome Jack AI isn't even related to the main overarcing Gortys plot, and in episode 5 is quickly resolved so that the spectacle can begin. Fiona's villain in Vallory is also literally instantly removed from the plot with little repercussions, despite being the primary motivating force for episodes 3 and 4. Both villains and their ties to the protagonists are very quickly brought to a head and then even more quickly disposed of in the first half of episode 5, all for the very funny but ultimately hollow climax.Which leads me to the choices. They don't matter. And in Tales, they don't even pretend they do for very long. In Walking Dead, or the Wolf Among Us, the plot is always the same but the player has control over the nuance of their character, and how and why they interact with others. Rhys occasionally touches on the nuance with his Ruthless Climber vs Nice Guy choices, but after a while you realise that the main two protagonists are merely tagging along with the plot rather than driving or moulding it. The 'major' choices come down to whether or not you insulted someone or agreed with someone else, instead of Walking Dead's literal life-and-death choices or Wolf's consequence-creating rampages. This culminates in the major choice of episode 4, whether or not to accept Jack's offer of Hyperion on a platter; within the first 10 minutes of episode 5, this choice is immediately invalidated.The great sin of Tales from the Borderlands is to discard the great character journeys Telltale is known for to make way for Borderlands's spectacle. The reveal of the Masked Stranger was well done and applaudable, and an extended finger-gun fight in episode 4 was hilarious, but other than that the game was a chunk of cotton candy; sweet, great to eat, but with almost no weight or lasting value."

Turning what could potentially have been fun scenes into head-shakingly bad soapboxing about issues which really does not pertain to the story that is unfolding, and seems born out some some personal crusade to be the very-most progressivest widdle guy in the business. Clearly, just because someone is involved in the creation of a game does not mean they should be kept around for later iterations of said series. Call this ""the George Lucas effect"", if you want.With the series now concluded (with no small amount of self-ironic quipping about the embarrassingly slow development pace in the intro), I feel like Telltale against all odds managed to pry a somewhat satisfying ending from the mess of the penultimate episode. Still, because of the immense amount of time it took to release every episode, the poor choice of including a new secondary writer halfway through, and what seems like a general confusion at Telltale studio as to how to juggle several projects at the same time, I cannot bring myself to recommend this title for the full price.I would recommend getting it on sale, now that it has been concluded. And in the future I (and many others, I suspect) will be more vary about buying Telltale products on release, especially if their new Minecraft game is an indication of the time and effort to be put into their products from now on."

Unfortunately, the developers marred it in a couple of serious ways.  First and most importantly, they stuck a timer on the dialog choices.  So, instead of sitting back, enjoying the story, and thinking over my choices, I was forced into making snap judgements.  Not what I wanted.  Adding insult to that injury, the timer varied from dialog to dialog and sometimes I couldn't even get to the choice I wanted before it defaulted to no choice at all.  Plus, the timer on the dialog choice starts before the characters are even done talking.  IOW, we have to make a choice before we're even fully aware of the full conversation.  The next biggest problem is that they stuck a whole mess of ""combat"" into the game (heck, most of the last segment is combat).  I've got no problem with combat, per se.  But, with this interface, it sucks.  I'd have been far happier with the dialog and combat interfaces used in the real Borderlands games.  Going along with that is the ""button mashing"" nature of the combat.  Literally.  And, they chose to use the letter ""Q"" for that button mashing.  Little finger, left hand, first row of the keyboard.  About the only key more unsuited for button mashing would be the ""Z"" key.  And, finally, one of the characters, Gortys, is so childish it made me wince.  The game has an ""M"" rating.  Why put a baby-talking character into it?One other thing (a recommendation for the developers instead of a complaint):  all the Achievements in the game are of the type ""finish this segment of the game.""  Since there are multiple endings to the game, it would be nice if there were Achievements for getting to the various endings.Anyway, I'm not recommending the game.  If you like interactive movies and aren't put off by the timer, the combat, and the button mashing, you might give it a shot if you can find it for less than $11.  Otherwise, no.  It's just not worth it."

It's probably the best Telltale game, and definitely the most consistant--every single episode had at least something noteworthy in it, and they didn't pull out the carpet from under us like they have many many times before.The game starts out slowly and does not really leave you expecting much. The story extends naturally out from the ending of the first episode and doesn't really pull any twists whatsoever, with one very abrupt and honestly shocking exception. You can probably map out the entire story by looking at the episode screencaps. Rhys and Fiona get trapped on Pandora. Rhys and Fiona get *more* trapped on Pandora. Rhys and Fiona go somewhere exotic and get cornered by the villains. Rhys and Fiona go back to Helios. Rhys and Fiona confront the stranger and deal with a vault. I suppose if you haven't played Borderlands 2 before, you might be surprised by some of the story hooks, but at the same time, if you haven't played Borderlands 2, I strongly reccomend you do not play this game. If you've read the store description you probably know why. The story doesn't have any of the huge gaping flaws that TWD and TWAU had. Instead of being a total trainwreck, it's more like a boring train ride, and you forgot to bring your 3DS.The very predictable and dry story is exacerbated by Telltale's failed methods of production. It's already hard enough to remember the characters and choices you've made with them being so innocuous, but when you have to wait four months inbetween each episode, it gets even worse. It doesn't matter too much to me, as I'm reviewing this game as a finished product, but I have to say on behalf of everyone that waited to play the episodes on release that it was an extremely frustrating ordeal. If Telltale sticks to this design methodology again then I'm convinced that the paychecks straight from the multitude of publishers who want their games ""Telltale style"" are more important to them than the satisfaction of their customers.I said at the beginning of my review that this game was ""not bad"", and that's probably because it's not much of anything.  Puzzles are limited in scope, take less than a minute to solve even by someone with horrible problem skills (me), and don't really have any reason to be there except in one particular instance. Choices are far more limited and provide far less consequences and contrivances than they ever have. QTEs are barely even there except at the very end of the game. But I don't really care, because all of the above are aspects of Telltale games that are frequently horrible. By getting rid of these elements they saved me a lot of frustration, but I can't really applaud Telltale for getting rid of virtually all of their game's content instead of improving it, especially since the Borderlands series is the first licensed property Telltale has touched that actually has gameplay, and therefore looks particularly odd without it.Overall I can't really reccomend that someone pay upwards of $15 for this game when there's a multitude of different youtubers that put what is basically the same experience on youtube for free, and I can't really feel bad for telling people to not pay Telltale for their work when their production schedule is completely unacceptable. As a story it's servicable. Rousing campfire tale, but not a cinematic experience that's going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Honestly, the times I enjoyed myself most with this game were the dialogues where world progresion was indicated, likeRhys recovering the deed to Atlas and potentially attempting to revive the corporation.That kind of stuff was great, because it makes me wonder if they're going to implement that in Borderlands 3. And that's really all this game was. Waiting for Borderlands 3.Also, Zer0 has a different voice actor in the last episode and nobody mentions it. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ was that?"

They have average graphics and story, but have nice engine and are fun to play, and score an average of 7.5-8.0 on my book. Played them both through on PC, and experienced some 40+ hours of playtime on each. When I first noticed a new borderlands game that  had a score over 90 on gamespot and ""very positive"" reviews from 1600+ people on steam, I didn't even bother to read the review texts, and bought the game right away via steam for 22.90€. Had good expectations.Then the reality hit hard, right after 5 minutes of gameplay. This is some kind of garbage where I can't move freely, am forced to awkwardly ""walk"" on a locked path with ridicuously slow speed (Zzzz), and can't look freely around either. Back to 90s it is, almost resembling Monkey Islands, but without any comedy. The game involves scenes where you have to click a certain spot on the screen fast, with a pointer that's almost invisible against the background (argh). Randomly you also have to repeatedly hammer a single key as fast as you can for 5 seconds or so, or until your brains burst. Then you follow a movie for the next 4-5 minutes, answer a question, and repeat.The storyline is great and is entertaining to follow. But being a movie where your part is just to slow it down and to answer some questions, I found this a horribly waste of time and money. The game is ridicously expensive for such a short and restricted entertainment. My first playthrough lasted less than 3 hours, and was shocked to see that this was really the end. I don't find any reuse value on this either, and won't have any interest to play it through again, just to see how the different answers would have affected, while hanging myself on boredom waiting for the movie to progress.Points: Story 7 (good), game engine 2 (horrible), value 3 (bad), total score 4 (poor).Edited: this review is for the episode 1, which is the only episode currently available."

I will extend this, for instance:Sometimes you can see something coming from far away [SPOILER: handsome jack betrayal, felix is probably the guy with the armour, you should not touch mutated flowers, the only scientist in the ATLAS lab is actualy an atlas scientist (duh)...], and the game kind of notices that, but in no case you will be able to use your choices to impact that, no matter what. You can try but it will end in a forced conclusion and move forward, or maybe even punish you for even try. At the end  this destroys any kind of inmersion you could have.You can feel the lazines in every choice you do. every time you try to step out of the generic, easy, main plot, the game goes like naaaah, doing that would require too much efort, beter go back to the main generic plot. And the same goes for the rest of the minigames/Puzzles.It would make an awesome experience without that crap, sort of like watching a movie but with the freedom to ask for more from the characters, and the freedom to advance the plot at your pleasure, but that edge where the game forces you to take decisions or pick up sides between realy limited choices is what makes this experience anoying. Because you can easily feel that all that is created only to produce a stupid drama environment, that wont allow you to realy do anything at allbut will keep asking for your input anywais (and then critisize it because of reasons).Would i buy it again? No. Not because the game is not worth it, but because is mostly a cheap excuse of a half work.

Given a release timeline like this, I would not recomend anyone to purchase this title until all episodes have been released. It could be a year before we see the final episode.--Sadly, I didn't like it.It should be noted that this is the first Telltale click-through game that I've played, so I don't have any experience with their other games, which I had heard were highly rated.I have only played the first episode of TFTBL (Tales from the Borderlands), as that's what is available at this time. Should my opinion change later, I will update this review. I will likely continue to watch/play through the remaining episodes.I've played a number of click-through games and have positive things to say about some of them, but this one annoyed me more than it entertained me.The ""play"" style is my most significant complaint, which consisted of one of the following: Choosing a multiple-choice selection with your mouse cursor, repeatedly pressing Q as fast as possible, optionally followed by E, using the directional arrows, or clicking on a particular spot on the screen to inspect or interact with something. More often than not, these inputs are time-sensitive, so doing it too slowly or doing the wrong thing gets you killed, which means re-doing the sequence before it. If the input method were to only be the mouse, or only be the keyboard or a select number of keys, I don't think this would annoy me quite as much, but since I need to have my hands at the ready at all times -- right hand on the mouse and left hand anywhere between the Q, E, WASD, and directional arrow keys (on opposite sides of the keyboard!) -- it gets tiring and feels clumsy. If it's going to be a click-through game, just let me click through it, instead of having to worry about what clumsy key I'm going to have to press next.If they had let me use the WASD keys as a replacement for the directional arrows, that would have been fine, but they don't (as I died many times testing this). This almost seems more like a bug than a design problem.The art style is not the same as Borderlands, but it's close. I could get over it, but combined with the robotic and artificial character movements (of non-robotic characters), it distracts from the story being told. Fingers are fatter, people are shorter, the loader bot is about six feet too tall, and body proportions seem off.Re-use of many Borderlands sounds, voice clips, and music feels cheap and cheesy. When you see a loot chest or ammo box open in Borderlands, the animation and the sound feel natural, but it felt very jaringly unnatural during scenes of TFTBL. I mostly blame the square robotic movements and poor animation.Speaking of cheesy re-use of Borderlands assets, a number of characters (Bewm, Steele, Tector, Zero, Shade, Jack, Nakayama, Moxxi, Marcus) make unecessary and brief appearances to prop up what so far is a very non-compelling storyline. I predict by the end of the last episide, almost every major and minor Borderlands character will also have made a five-minute shallow contribution to this tale. Originality = good, re-use of every other existing Borderlands charcter and asset because you can't come up with your own = bad. Using a small number of cameo characters is fine, but repeated cameo apperances get old fast and I didn't even get through the end of the first episide before I knew I was going to be writing this paragraph.The writing so far isn't that good. Characters contridict themselves constantly and I don't feel like I've gotten to know them because their behavior is so comically erratic.On the positive side, voice acting is pretty good, the new original characters are somewhat interesting so far, and the price wasn't too high (Unlike the recent $60 release of the Pre-Sequel).In all, I would not recomend to any of my friends that they buy TFTBL until the last episode has been released.Maybe it will get better... or much worse."

Every so often you have to click the mouse on something showing on the screen or type a character. And that's pretty much it as far as the game mechanics go. If anything the random sprinkling of game elements throughout the presentation distract from the story. Imagine watching a movie in which the plot is heating up. You’re getting engrossed in the action and all of a sudden you have to repeatedly type “Q” on a keyboard or the entire thing stops and you need to restart from a few seconds before the “Q” prompt came up. WTF? How is that entertaining?I’m sure I’ll pick it up again later because the story is interesting (and I paid for this thing) but I’ll have to be a lot more boerd than I am right now. In the meantime I’m going to play through Borderlands TPS again (and not buy any more Telltale games).Bottom line: Good Story. Silly random game mechanics are distracting at best, frustrating for the most part."

It's not. It's a TV show mixed with a little Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book. While the description does say it's a five part episodic series, I simply took it as there's five chapters of the game in which you flip between viewpoints/characters/storyline. Additionally, the trailor has Jack explaining the timeline along side the other true Borderlands games. Add in the fact they continually use the word ""play as"" and I guess I just misinterpreted it. This was my first experience with any Telltale Games so I was unaware of what this was suppose to be. While I fully realized this wasn't going to be a full BL3 game or something....I did think it was a little add-on that would have something to kill other than my time.To add something productive, the story is true Borderlands humor and is somewhat enjoyable. I was just expecting something else. I wouldn't have bought it had I known."

And the INCREDIBLY lame joke in the beginning of the second episode that tried to sweep the giant delay under the rug; ""Yes yes, we all know it's been a long time"" made me almost hostile towards the game.Despite this, I played through that episode as well and it was alright. Not as good as the first, but certainly not bad. Then followed another prolongued wait until the third episode came out and by now interest had waned to the point where I didn't even remember what was really going on. I still played that episode but this time I wasn't enjoying the game - it introduced too many new things, tried to do way too much with cameos, twists and new characters that it just turned into tasteless mush. I played the fourth episode for 15 minutes and honestly, nothing happens. Just.. it's boring me. I couldn't bring myself to play through it.I'm a huge fan of Borderlands. I loved both Borderlands and Borderlands II. I didn't downright hate the Pre-Sequel. But this.. I'm sorry to say, it's just bland and tasteless - it feels like they stopped caring; that they know this game isn't what it should be and are just going through the motions to get it out.

,Not Recommended,330830,18909007,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,Ding Ding Dong,"Tl;dr: Walking sections are awful, the beginning and the end are awful, too much of pace-breaking empty space. The middle section is the game's saving grace, and it just barely makes the game worth recommending.Straight to the negative parts:As with all Telltale games, there are walking sections in-between plot cutscenes and dialogues, and these sections are horrible. Firstly, the characters walk excruciatingly slowly. It isn't helped the fixed camera and the steering, either. The whole movement feels as naturally flowing as a river of bricks. Secondly, it takes surprisingly a lot of time to look at the points of interest littered throughout these sections. Walking is one contributor to that, the second is the UI, which buggers up if there are two inspectable things, or if the inspectable thing involves two actions (look/interact). Or if the game is feeling cruel. Or if it's a Friday. Thirdly, some inspectables move the plot, most don't, and they aren't told apart from one another, so if you like your fluff text, chances are you're gonna eat♥♥♥♥♥♥and watch the plot roll on.Second part: narrative structure. It starts in medias res and told from 2 perspectives along the same timeline, therefore removing somebunall tension from the plot (you know characters x and y are gonna be fine, what's going to happen to either, how to react, etc.). Then, the dramatic structure of the game dedicates the first episode entirely to exposition, and, frankly, it is terribly dull. I dropped it halfway through the first time I played it, leaving it for half a year for disgust to subside. Episodes 2 through 4 start with better and get to great. The fifth, though, the resolution, is as boring as the first one. Compared to the 4th, it is very much akin to the last drop going down your leg. The last episode isn't helped by its audio being buggy: the last 30 minutes or so 75% of the spoken dialogue just didn't play at all (thank gods for subtitles).Thirdly: There is a lot of downtime where nothing happens, at all. Partly due to the bumbling-about sections, partly due to how dialogue works. In TWD you were constantly under pressure, in TftB everyone is chill and responds at their own pace. Although, it's not even that. It's more of the general silence that only occasionally gets interrupted by the plot. The pacing is weird. Imagine a group of awkward people trying to chitchat, failing, staying silent for a bit, and trying to speak again, rinse and repeat. It is kind of like that.Fourth and last complaint: There is still no option to disable the long, *unskippable* NEXT TIME ON THE TFTB and PREVIOUSLY ON TFTB, even with the full game. It's somewhat grating, because it's very likely that one is going to watch these things back to back.All that aside, episodes 2-4 are really ♥♥♥♥ing great, almost enough to save the whole thing, but not quite."

I was playing another game that was not from Telltale but had similarities, Life is Strange, which I loved and I read reviews calling it ""Telltale rippoff"". So I was like, what the heck, if I loved this, I might like the Telltale games ever better.So, I tried this one first because I was fun of the original Borderlands. And I can't say, they depict the Borderlands lore preety well and the dialogues and characters are some of the wittiest ever, I even expect to see some of these characters appearing in Borderlands 3 if it's ever out. In terms of story, characters, dialogues, Telltale does a marvelous job (and I expect this from their other games I have yet to play).But here is the thing, I know this is like an adventure game or not (depending on who you ask). Maybe an interactive movie? And I don't mind that, maybe it's not my taste of games. But it gives me this awful feeling of what the game industry is going to. Making games even more easier, even more casual, in ways that are like insulting your intelligence. I get it, it's supposed to be more like a movie, there are dialogues which go too fast because you have to answer else it wouldn't have the flow of a movie. And skip that, when you finally are given control of your character after 10 minutes of forced dialogues, it's pointing you directly to the solution of the most trivial puzzles ever. They didn't even need to put it, it's more like a chore to click on what is in front of me. They have a very restricted camera, intentionally so that the objects of interest are always in front of you and you won't miss them, you grab an item and there is an imaginary inventory, but you just need to click on the next object and it shows you the icon with the object to use. It really shows the solution in your face, for example I had to lift some heavy objects, and my character couldn't, and at that point I wanted to start thinking whether I should use a lever or ask someone to help me, but even before that it shows small cinematic where my character is looking at the side of the robot, like it tells you ""Hey, just ask the robot!"". It tells you the solution in your own face and it wasn't even hard at all!!! I am not gonna talk about QTEs, which I absolutely loath.I don't like the approach of Telltale games. I know it will be the same in the acclaimed masterpieces like The Walking Dead or others. It's like saying, OMG adventures are dead, the problem is that games stuck in puzzles and quit, what are we gonna do? Make them as easy than ever, people don't have to think, they should not stuck in a puzzle not even for a second. Omg, this ridiculously easy puzzle can still confuse players. Let's focus their camera directly to the solution.It makes me feel this game has no soul, it's rather like watching your favorite Anime but with M$ Clippy popping out all the time to ask you about choices. But the control of your character is totally restricted so that it leads you to the solution. These restrictions take away the feeling of exploration and figuring out things for yourself. What they do would work like some Anime miniseries but not as an interactive experience.I am not saying this is a ""no-game"" game. I used to love adventure games. I also like even ""non-game"" games like Dear Esther and Gone Home. For the single reason, they let you wonder around the environment 360 degrees, and there were a lot of things to discover, even if there was no actual gameplay. You felt you were exploring the world. Not being forced through Pablovian button mashing and destroying the sense of freedom.Unless you like the Telltale games style of gameplay, I don't recommend this."

You are nothing but a spectator with almost nothing to do.  I read the rave reviews, could not find a bad review, and got it on a sale.  The story is not bad, the characters are engaging, the humor is good.  The world of Pandora is exotic enough to hold your attention.  But there's almost no interaction.  It's basically an up-scaled ""dragons lair"" where you have to press a key once in a while.  Like, every ten minutes or so.  The rest of the time you just watch the story unfold.  Not a bad story, mind you.  But you're passive, like watching television.  Nothing you say or do really matters.  Either you get killed, in which case you just replay the scene again, or you pres the right key/right time and the story continues exactly as it would have.

Anyways I expected an amazing ending one that would have ended in overcoming challenges and use Gordys to unlock the vault but not with a titan guarding the vault, I mean not every vault has to have a titan guarding it, I expected an adventure, a long jouney to unlock the treasures of the vault and sure there would be some things blocking the journey to get what's inside but they would overcome that stuff and be rewarded with whatever riches are inside the vault. Lastly I honestly hope that none of this story is put into Borderlands 3 and I hope this was just all for fun and none of this transpires to the next Borderlands.

Episode 2 was told to be out in about four weeks, and then they said it would January. It's been a month late and there's not even a release date in sight. Telltale is working on many projects at the moment (e.g. Game of Thrones, Minecraft: Story Mode) and I guess they simply forgot about this one. Tales from the Borderlands is a great game, but we've all been tiredly waiting for the second episode to come out and so far Telltale has come up short. I will not recommend this game until Telltale becomes timely with their episode updates.+Perfect blend of Telltale and Borderlands humor+Dynamic choices that make you think+Unique and quirky characters+Captures Borderlands series' atmosphere well+Two playable characters+Anti-hero protagonists, a Hyperion employee and a Pandoran thief trying to get rich+Excellent voice acting, including Patrick Warburton (Brock from the Venture Bros.)+Cool additions to the Borderlands universe (Echo scanner eyes)+Many references to the Borderlands games, including some surprise characters that I will not spoil-Untimely updates. Come on Telltale, it's been three months.The last update from TT was on February 22nd, claiming the Episode 2 will be big and on its way, but still no release date after an extra month of waiting. It's a shame that Telltale is neglecting this game, because it actually is my favorite from them. So far, Episode 1 was a blast to play. While the moral choices and dillemas never come close to The Walking Dead game, the humor and storytelling are definitely my cup of tea. As a huge Borderlands fan, this title definitely does the series justice. The only issue is that Telltale isn't giving this title justice. If you're a fan of the Borderlands series and its trademark humor, and enjoy the choice-based gameplay of Telltale games, definitely pick up this game...once all of the episodes are released."

Sure there is a pause button there for stopping the action in its tracks (don't know if it works during decision-making)... but, unfortunately, no fast-forward for skipping conversations that you do not want to hear (or heard already).And it has button-mashing QTE - a sin in my book, no matter how you look at it.Bottom line?Pick if you are a Telltale fan.Consider if you are a Borderlands fan.Wait for sale.And in any case, NOT recommended."

Most of the people I am seeing obecting to negative reviews, act like we have to or that we can only compare it to games made by Telltale games.

It's nothing at all like the original Borderlands games.This game is like watching a story on TV, with the exception that once in a while you have a few seconds to quickly press a button to force the character to move in a given direction (or else you die and have to start over at a previous checkpoint and watch the dialog leading up to the action all over again).  Alternately, you might have just a few seconds to select one of three different dialog choices, and depending on which you chose it may alter the flow of the story somewhat.It felt like playing ""Space Ace"" or ""Dragon's Lair"" (early 1980's laser video disc games), in that you didn't really interact with the game very much.  For most of the game you are a spectator watching TV.  That's not what I had in mind when I bought the game.  Sigh.I will admit that the story line is a bit intriguing, but it doesn't really tie in with the other three Borderlands games, so it was hard to really care about the story like I did for Borderlands.  Yeah, it's in the same basic universe, but you have different characters, different motivations, and a different setting to boot.  So why do I care about these people again?  I really had a hard time getting into it.The other downfall is that the entire game only lasts about 2 hours - maybe a bit less even.  Sure, once you've finished you can re-start and select different dialog to see how the story changes, but honestly the outcome is going to be nearly the same no matter what.They say there will be more content coming soon, but even if there are more stories, it's still boring to watch.

It tells the same story, though there are occasions where you make decisions (that effect how the story plays out), and there are quick-time events (some of which make you look bad♥♥♥♥♥ and some which result in a game-over if you fail them).I'm not trying to be insulting by calling it a ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure"", really. I enjoyed Tales from the Borderlands, and I do recommend it (hence the thumbs up). It's just that it's really not an Adventure game in the same vein as the Day of the Tentacle, for instance.What surprises me is just how good Tales from the Borderlands is, considering it's based in the same universe as an FPS whose claim to fame was the randomly generated guns (and the weird art style). It fits the tone so well that it's added geniune depth to the other games in the series.I did come across a few odd slow-downs, and the last episode did chug a little bit as it tried to reconcile the dialogues with the choices I've made (there were awkward pauses as though to leave time enough for a third character to chime in with their comments). Overall though, it was pretty smooth, and a great little game.If you're a fan of the FPS Borderlands, you owe it to yourself to play through Tales from the Borderlands. You'll find a new appreciation for the series, espcially seeing how other people live through this violent world of bandits, Vaults and Vault-Hunters."

76561198046881436,Recommended,330830,30524372,Posted: 15 March,all,Garthorium,"I was encouraged by my cousin to buy this game, and whilst my initial purchase was reluctant, I found a rather enjoyable game, if not a flawed one.Let me start by stating that my first Telltale game was TWD, so I will make a lot of comparisons here.Firstly, let's start with the Pro's:1. Enjoyable story - I supposeSet after the events of Borderlands 2, we pick up two new main characters, in which throughout the game you will switch between them for their takes on the story. The story was in most senses, predictable, a few little surprises here and there, but don't expect it to blow you away.2. Entertainment factor - some genuinely comedic momentsI found myself laughing out loud at some parts, to note, but not spoil the corporate warfare scene, the face peel, the 'bro' scene and other various parts I legitimately enjoyed. Other times I found my eyes rolling at some pretty forced and flat jokes. A solid 50/50, I'd be generous to say 60/40. Some good laughs to be had, but expect some cringe content.3. Gameplay - plenty of what we know, scarcely what we don't.TftB adds some new mechanics over their other entires, such as the eye-scan for increased environment information, and a perhaps more fleshed out inventory, even if it is as 'unnecessary' as ever. The same old, classic, Telltale illusion of choice and on your feet response-based conversation system are ever present too. Expect yourself to have to pay a bit more attention in this one however; it is unwise to have your hands dawdle away from your keyboard and mouse.I'm pretty sure I've listed most of the pro's here, now let me inform you of the cons:1. Technical and system - no step forward, but 3 steps backThe game, frankly, runs like crap. A lot of shortcuts and poor animations are present in this game. Dialogue cuts out, and subtitles fail to properly synch to what the characters are actually saying, synch as in, they don't exactly say what the subtitles have you think they say. As much as I like Telltale's games, their engine clearly lacks polish and finesse, and the game suffers with its limitations. In particular, you will notice that the main characters and those in your immediate line of sight function 'satisfactorily' whilst everyone else is either static or sometimes glitching about the place. Compared to TWD, this game was a bit of a visual mess. Most character animations are extremely jarring and jagged, a right mess to witness. This was my experience at least.2. Soundtrack - Jared Emerson-Johnson returns, only to miss the mark?The soundtrack was a complete miss here, entirely lackluster and totally off point. I can agree that every composer/artist has their own flare, but I wasn't captivated, motivated, or stirred by any pieces in this game, and the nods back to the FPS games, with pieces done by Jesper Kyd, only further agitated me in realising the score was so off. The main menu theme alone precisely and accurately reflects my message here, the vibes are in an entirely different field.3. Pacing - an ending that drags out indefinitelyUnlike TWD, this had to be one of the most dragged out endings I've witnessed in recent memory. To the point where I fidgeted in my seat in anticipation of it finally being over. I can respect and appreciate closure, but when the ending purposely drags on just to fit in one last joke, you really get a sense of wanting to get to the end as quickly as you can. For the actual ending, I enjoyed, it was a more serious note as opposed to the light-hearted jolly fest that the rest of the game was, but the ending definitely was a strange pace, fast in some places, slow in others.4. Characters - love em', hate em', both extreme, but certainly not the formerI didn't feel much of a connection to any character outside of the main two. We do get character development sure, but most characters aren't fleshed out, or even, flesh-outable(?) The fact that towards the end of the game I was supposed to feel sad/happy/whatever have you towards some of the characters was a revalation in itself. At the end of the game, I felt a severe disconnect to most NPC's, this is only compounded when during the idle moments in the game, discussion with the NPC's is kept to an absolute minimum, as opposed to TWD, where, you know, we actually find out things about them, as there are plenty of opportunities to do so. Shame.OVERALL VERDICT:I hope I've somewhat enlightened you with this review. Despite the fact I rag on the game more than I praise it, I still recommend it. Why? Because despite its flaws, you still have an enjoyable game here, that is sure to entertain you. That is, provided, you can overlook the technical flaws, the pretty average and forgettable soundtrack, the rather chaotic pacing, the very real illusion of choice with a seemingly inconsequential dialogue system - for the most part, and the overall clunkyness and washed out same old same old Telltale engine, then I would expect you to be in for a treat, if not perhaps the sweetest, at least an edible one.5/10"

It's fast paced enough to be engaging from the start but still allows you to really appreciate the character development and choice sections. And given that this game is set in the Borderlands universe the TellTale developers did a great job at capturing the unique ""dark"" twisted comedy that Borderlands is known for.If you have played the Borderlands games before, you will love this, and if you haven't, it is an amazing introduction to the world of Pandora and the Borderlands universe.

You select some dialogue and some movement periodically which determines how characters react to you and if you survive certain events.  If you remember the choose your adventure books or old arcade dragonslayer video game then you kinda know the feel of the game.  Kinda between watching television and playing a full blown shooter.  Just a casual experience with some input required.  I find it refreshing, relaxing, and somethingI can do in between television and shooters.  I recommend it if you want that experience.  It seems like a new class of video game.  Maybe a ""fist-person-chooser"".  Ha!  Enjoy it.  Is it a video game?  Well, it requires input to play, so I say yes it is.

Sure it's not an FPS game but instead of listening to all the conversation going on around you while shooting your way through bandits and baddies you're actually engaged in the conversation and the events you normally are scripted into.Now, as for the idea that you aren't really choosing your own adventure, to some extent, you arent. Yeah there's a major quest line but what you do get to choose is the your reactions, your friendships, possible romance?, and how badass you are while undergoing Rhys and Fiona's journey from suit and conartist to Vault Hunters. Which might be just in time for Borderlands 3. Pandora is going to need all the Vault Hunters it can get (if you don't understand, complete Borderlands the Pre-Sequel)."

The writing from Telltale is solid, they did what they set out to do, flesh out a great story using the Borderlands universe. Lots of great Borderlands humour spotted all throughout. References to previous games and character cameos. Animations and assets were good. Eye candy all over, many new unique characters, great costume/art design. Very cinematic and unique in how it tells the story.Episode one has set a solid foundation for the rest of the story. Lots of speculation and I got goosebumps whenever I heard Jack's voice. The story is good at jumping from humour to serious parts.Only thing I noticed that bothered me a little was over extended animated scenes (not enough ""gameplay"") and choices that probably wouldn't change outcomes.And now the wait for episode 2...Episode 2 & 3I lost my save file as Steam doesn't store it on the cloud so I played 1-3 together. Having a blast right away after the intro of episode 2. There are big moments when the writing seems genius and perfectly executed. Lots of implementation of the story jumping either forwards and back or between characters. Often in stories when the focus is shifted, events for the others seem to simply stop, in this everything is happening at once.

With dialogue throughout consistently reflecting a Borderlandesque (sorry) flair, it is plain to see that no expense has been spared to ensure this collaboration is true to its source material.As well as Telltale Games' normal knack for dialogue, the balance of pace and tone throughout weaves effortlessly alongside the well constructed plot.With two playable characters whose paths cross through respective misdeeds, 'Tales from the Borderlands' pushes Telltale Games to its creative limits. The world of Pandora is explored through the eyes of criminals and Hyperion employees (although the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive *cough*), taking a fresh stance on those originally considered enemies in the Borderlands series,  adding to its thought-provoking spectrum of personalities that eliminates the false dichotomy of 'good and evil'.I could go on.But, in short, three episodes down and I feel Telltale Games have outdone themselves in their partnership with the Borderlands development teams. To those of you who have played the Borderlands series, it really will feel like you're coming home. If you haven't played the Borderlands series, the game stands on its own two legs to provide a thrilling, story driven comedy adventure; the exposition alone covers all the backstory you need to know.So come on and play; show the Borderlands universe your name is 'Ten Million Dollars'."

You get to chose how your characters react to certain things (which changes some of the dynamics between them but doesn't affect the overall story very much) and play some QTEs and thats it. Basically an interactive story.But that story is rock solid, well written and interesting with a few interesting twists.

,Recommended,330830,17783848,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,Snow,"(As a note, this is being written after Episode 4. I might change/make a new post for the finale).Firstly, I'd recommend playing (or at least trying out) Borderlands 2 and the Pre-sequel. Whilst it does feature characters from the first one, you meet them in the second one and get to know them, so it isn't required.Secondly, if you are not a fan of a more cinematic/interactive story, I don't think this game is for you. It's mainly dialogue focused with some Point and Click and QTE events, standard of a Telltale game.With that being said, if you meet both requirements, I think you will love this game. The writing never really falls flat on it's face in my opinion, as to where it can at times in the other Borderlands games. There is a great blend of serious and comedy in the writing, which I personally like.The gameplay doesn't really have any ""difficult"" portions, as it's mostly just button mashing, reacting quickly, and figuring out puzzles (most of which are straight forward if you put a little thought in).As for characters, I enjoy the ensemble of main and supporting characters. Some may find one of your later characters to be a little bit annoying (won't name drop as it's a bit of a spoiler), but personally I like them.All in all, this is a game that has fantastic writing (I like it more than some other Telltale titles), memorable characters, a memorable (at times) soundtrack, and memorable quotes. It can even get emotional at times!I definitely recommend this game, it's worth the full price but I'd 100% get it on sale if you want to save some cash.P.S. This is only the second video game to make me cry. Yeah."

Its really hard to say this but its even better than The Walking Dead games Telltale have made. I personaly love these type of games. Story telling, point and click and I just LOVE this game.Tales from the Borderland is a game from Telltale. It has 5 episodes.The writing is smart, thoughtful, and it makes you laugh all the time (if you have good humor), but it's also highly effective through both gameplay and story at making you, the player, genuinely care about the characters. Well most of them... It has a really good, exiting and fun story. It isn`t much to say about the graphic. Its the same as any other Telltale game so its really good and it works really well.The gameplay and story was really good through all the episodes, but the last episode man.... WOW. What a ending. This review will not contain any spoilers or anything so I won`t say anything about the story.This game made me laugh really much, it made me cry and I couldn`t stop playing it until the end.I love Telltale, I love these type of games. This is a 10/10 for sure! I can`t recommend it enoguh, even if you have not played Borderland before."

There is so much story telling, and a lot of cameos from previous characters. This title focuses more on story telling than game play, so there isn't direct combat or item collecting on the same scale as the others. Its more relaxed, but just as fantastic as the other titles. Its single player - which I love, and the new characters just enhance the Borderlands world. I highly recommend it if you were a fan of the others."

After 2 min you're also introduced with the second protagonist, Fiona.Everything that happens in the beginning is in the present time, while most of the game is in the past, hence the name ""Tales"" from the borderlands. So the protagonists tells a tale and since it's a telltale game you get to choose how the tale will be, you make the choices.So with all five episodes out, am I gonna recommend this game? Or did they ruin the entire Borderlands universe with this game? Yes, I do recommend this game with my entire heart!This did come as a surprise though, I honestly thought that Telltale would make a bad game. I didnt think that a click and point adventure game would work in the Borderlands universe but well, I was wrong.This game does easily get a 9/10 from me, I remove 1 point because there's just one ending in the game, even if you make several choices you will always have the same ending as everyone.VerdictI do recommend this game for fans of the Borderlands universe, for people that like click & point games, for people that like choice---What the hell.

Being a huge fan of the entire Borderland series I actually avoided playing this one for quite sometime, assuming that a Borderlands game without the first person shooter element would be a waste of time. I finally caved and picked it up during a Steam sale and thought, since I've already spent the money, I'll give it a shot, which turned out to be a great decision. As expected, the action is minimal and exclusively limite to the quick time events, but there was never any question about wanting to finish the game and find out how the story ended.It's difficult to call what TellTale creates 'games' as they are little more than an interactive graphic novel, peppered liberally with  quick time events, but the quality of the story writing comes through in a big way. What you get with this game is another trip through the wastelands of Pandora with an interesting story populated by both likable and hateful characters, and thats enough for me."

The comic-inspired aesthetic of Telltale games is also an incredibly natural fit for the visual style of Borderlands, and going further, Telltale wraps this entire game in Borderlands presentation, borrowing menu styles to item descriptions, etc... The real victory that this game achieves beyond just that basic fanservice is that it tells a story that's more focused on creating more convincing character arcs and motives for the inhabitants of Pandora and Helios. Sure, it still sprinkles on plenty of humor, but the story told within Tales of the Borderlands strikes such a stronger emotional chord than a mainline Borderlands game could ever hope to. It's a good story wrapped in one of my favorite videogame contexts of the last generation (going by console generations). If you're a Telltale fan or a Borderlands fan, this game is for you; if you're a fan of both, then you really shouldn't even be bothering with reviews -- you should just play it."

Very replayable, so far it has been the only telltale game I have played more than twice that I haven't become sick of looking at.  Which is the best, because unfortunately that happened with GoT and TWD Season two, and the final episode of Thrones hadn't even been released before I became annoyed with myself for playing too much and getting sick of it.This game is the best interactive story game I have ever played, can't recommend it enough.  It has to be one of my favourite games of all time.  The story is engaging and even for someone who hadn't played past the first boss of Borderlands 2 before playing this game, I enjoyed it so much that I just ended up finishing Borderlands 2, purchasing the Pre-Sequel and completing it too.  So yes, this game is also a great introduction to the whacky Borderlands Universe.So many references to movies and other games as well.  Like I said, I really recommend playing it.  If you are short on cash, wait until it's on sale.  But unlike a fair few other games, I really think this game is good enough at full price.  The less you know about the game going into it, the better.  I hadn't watched any gameplay or even trailers of this game before I started it, I just knew I had loved previous telltale releases and a few friends had told me to play this.  I can say I enjoyed it and probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much had I watched some youtube-gamer play through the whole game like I had before playing the Walking Dead seasons one and two."

You've made a new friend! Eww gross is that a face?The music is top notch.The cinematics are varied, interesting and for the most part are seamless.The voice acting is superb, and feels like they fit right in to the PAndora/Borderlands world.You care about the characters - and they are all very individual.You may shed a tear. You may squee.If anything the 1st/2nd eps are a little slow to begin with, and aren't without their flaws, but if you can get through those the pay offs in terms of the story and pure entertainment are huge.  This might be one of my favourite casual games because of the way the stories were weaved in.Episode 4 was an absolute treat from beginnning to end.Episode 5 was an amazing finale, and well worth the 10 hours it took to get there.  It's rare I catch myself smiling through a game, but I definitely did it in this one.  I never knew a Quick Time Event  could be that much fun!Negatives (minor):Using voice actors who sound remarkably similar to other iconic characters usually doesn't work well(e.g. one of the main protagonists sounds like Lilith from the Borderlands series).Where's the skip dialogue button?The first 5 minutes made me want to uninstall.  That's not a good way to start.The main antagonist, in my opinion, was made too hateable and unredeemable in the first 2 minutes.This is on my ""Highly recommended"" list for seasoned hardcore gamers and casuals alike.

By their sides are Vaughn: a pen-pushing accountant and Rhys' partner in corporate crime, Sasha: Fiona's sister and fellow grifter, and Loader Bot: Pure awesomeness.Through 5 chapters, these unlikely (and unwilling) partners unravel the mystery of The Vault of the Traveller. (Or traveler if you're American).From the signature comic book styling to the extremely clever storyline, this is another classic creation by Telltale.Pros:Great art design,Intricate storyline,Signature British-style Borderlands humour (Psychos included),Relevant choices with far-reaching effects (obviously, It's Telltale),No technical problems on my (relatively high end rig) laptop.Cons:Like the other games you get a list of your choices at the end of each chapter, however to get all of them you have to go through the hassle of making a Telltale account.General warnings:If you are not familiar with the Borderlands universe don't play this game, you will not understand it at all,If you do not have the sense of humour that you find skags being killed at opportunity funny, I advise you avoid this game as you would avoid Boris Johnson on LSD.

A year or two ago, i decided to watch a playthrough of the three newer sam & max game, however, so i knew their basic writing style. I consider this even funnier than those games. Just about every character so far, save for yvette (one of your main character's friends) has had some line that made me laugh, from Vasquez's comparison of spaceships and male genetalia to Loader bot's...Loader bot. Easily one of my favorite mechanics in the game is Rhys's echo eye, which allows you to scan most gameworld objects, and often has either references to the main series borderlands games, funny descriptions, or a mixture of both.The gameplay is...well, a point-and-click adventure game. you know what you're getting into. however, there are QTE segments in some of the more action-oriented scenes, which-surprisingly-don't suck, and manage to give you the feel of  an action game like the original borderlands(es).I only have three complaints with the first episode-number one would be Vasquez. His voice actor is Patrick Warburton, who i know best as Brock Samson from poker night at the inventory. While i like him as a voice actor, he only has one voice, and sometimes it's a bit hard for me to remember that i'm not listening to Brock Sampson, I'm listening to Hugo Vasquez. However, after I heard his voice a few times, it became easier for my brain to diferentiate the characters. Number two is a small moment in the world of curiosities (minor spoilers, you may want to look on a paragraph down). As you go through the first time, you see some characters from Borderlands 2 and 1, seemingly mounted and stuffed on pikes. One of these is Shade. you cross the hall, hopefully listening to the commentary and scanning the characters for more good dialogue, until you come to a locked door. You're sent back through the hall, seeing that the case previously holding shade is empty. A few steps later, you get jumpscared. Now, I'll admit hear and now tat I'm a wuss, and I shouldn't have gotten asscared as i did, but it was a moment that dampened my enjoyment of the game.My final complaint is a somewhat big one: the choice timer. At most points where you choose your action, there's a small bar ticking down.  This bar can go quite fast sometimes, and you're required to pick your option before it empties in the middle. This can be troublesome if you want to decide what to say, or in some cases do. It puts unnessecary pressure on the player, even if it can be alleviated by the dialogue following being amusing. There also tend to be dialogue while the bar is ticking down of the character you're talking too waiting for your response, so if you want to hear all the dialogue-and trust me, you do-you have to wait until the last second, which runs the risk of missing your chance to pick. a simple button to pause time so you have a chance t decide on some of the more fast moving decisions might be nice, but it's not necessary.Overall, Tales From The Borderlands is a wonderful game, and i hwoleheartedly recommend it to anyone-be they a fan of telltale, borderlands, or even neither, as the story is so far rather accessible to anyone. if i would have to rate it on an out of 10 scale...well, i wouldnt, i would rate it 10/-10, because it's just that good."

This is truly a change from the FPS Borderlands norm, into an exciting story adventure where the interaction from the player decides the outcome. What is more suprosing though however, is that even though the game is heavily crafted from the Borderlands world, I belive those who are a fans of Telltale Games for other titles may just enjoy this too. The references to the games are there, or course, but Telltale have almost 'clued you in' instead of making you feel stupid for not knowing.Aside from the look and feel, the game mechanics are also pretty sound. The timing is just right to select a response for each situation, and even some of the options can lead to unexpected outcomes. The gameplay pace is slow, yet not so slow that you feel you are being forced to sit through. And lastly the sounds are very dynamic and well placed.I would recomend the game to everyone in the world, ever."

I never played a Borderlands game before, but the story seemed interesting to me from the beginning. Altogether, I was surprised how much effort and creativity went into Tales from the Borderlands and can't wait for the next episode."

For myself, I was excited because I was a huge fan of the previous entries to the series.And now we finally reach a conclusion. We end with a beautiful scene inside the vault, with serene music and a nice blue hue. Sasha Fiona and Rhys have a conversation, a reflection on their accomplishments. I can't help but feel a chill, and even the feeling of sadness. Not that I was sad due to the story, but because the journey had come to an end.It's not often that I find a game where I want to cry - cry for the reason that it was such a beautiful game. I cannot find any other game that melds comedy, action, and shooting the ever living hell out of everything other than Borderlands. Somehow, Telltale managed to capture that same feeling even better than Gearbox, in my humble opinion.The opening sequence as always was genius, with a song to fit the mood perfectly. Crashing from Helios with the song playing, facing the unknown. And then Rhys cutting off his link from Jack was awesome and emotional. I actually felt bad for Jack, but then again, that would have been a mistake. Either way, it was handled so well done.The point is, everything about this episode I mentioned represents why this game is one of my new favorites. This should go down as the best game Telltale has made... at least until we have the sequel to Tales, which will inevitably come. And boy am I looking forward to it."

TellTale really captured the atmosphere and humour of the Borderlands games and world really well, and you feel like this story is something that could really happen there. It was nice to see one or two familiar faces from the games pop up too. I loved the main characters and antagonists, and the voice acting was great (which is to be expected I guess when there are some quite big name voice actors involved, like Nolan North and Troy Baker).

A puzzle game often gets you to do a puzzle in a pre-defined way, leaving little/no choice in the way it plays, a walk-'em-up requires nothing more than exploration, story, and/or puzzles, but these are still games.Then there are people who saythis game is too short; NEWS flash, it isn't fully out yet, that's what is meant by an ""Episodic Game"", we are given the first part of the game, we make decisions, the people behind it adjust the later episodes based on our decisions and comments, they release the next episode, and the cycle repeats, allowing for polished gameplay that is literally deturmined by the player.As for the game itself, really nice; the characters are really different from what we expect from the Borderlands world, but they feel like those who belong in it, the con-artists, the small league Hyperion workers, Augest and his lack of trust to even long time friends, everyone!The story seems to bring a lot to the table, especially in the last chapter in episode 1, the situations the characters get themselves in are the situations that real people could become a part of in this world, the twists are awesome, and the dialougue, I made Zer0 give me a <3 emote, what's not to love?The QTE's are instant death, and that irritates me, but you have plenty of time to do them, and a few choices as to what to do at points.I find it unfair to rate this game right now, it still has so much to offer and it has hardly even scratched the surface of what it wants to share, so I rate this (rating pending)/10, as I have only played, probably less than, 1/5 of this game, but I enjoyed all of it."

(Look, Ijust...okay?))of very story driven QTE dialogue with consequences and it's fantastic.The humour in this game is top notch, and as a fan of the Borderlands series I was worried it would delve into sophomoric bathroom humour as they occasionally do, but so far it's been the dry humour I've enjoyed from the series. I had to pause the game after my character jumped on the back of a bandit and failed to break his neck yelling ""I've got this!"" where after the bandit yells ""No he doesn't!"" which is what led to this review. That is the moment in which I felt not  a penny had been wasted on this game. It had me snickering many times, but that single moment was enough to make me write my first ever review and strongly recommend this game.I read from other reviews the QTEs went too fast, but maybe it's the brashness afforded to me by whiskey, but I've never felt they went to fast. After the first chapter, I knew what type of person my character was was and picked the choice I felt they would say, giving me the replayability to be the complete opposite person on a later playthrough (which I know will happen).Bottom line, it's fantastic and you're fantastic for purchasing it."

OK, technically it's more like a interactive movie, but the blend of story, characters, and drama make it so easy to get sucked into it, especially when you have to get involved with what is going on.Telltale Games have weaved an excellent story with an exceptional emotional roller coaster to keep you coming back for more.

Enough to where you are curious enough to play it again and see where another path leads and what it could unlock.Story wise, it fits perfectly into the Borderlands franchise and gives more depth to a few things like Jack and Athena. I have (and love) all three games, and I find this Tell Tale title very entertaining.

This game maintains the Borderlands humor, respects the Lore, tons of references, nods to the fans and has a lot of great voiced cameos. Not to mention that finale which actually acknowledges a lot of the decisions you made throughout the other episodes with dramatically different scenes at certain points. The series, I assume Season 1 of many more after that great finale, is going places and had me smiling and giggling like a little kid nearly the entire time while also pulling at my heart strings over certain emotional scenes.The reveal of the Masked Man is very well done as well. Now that I look back there were many hints towards who he was but still, very well done.I greatly look forward to a Season 2 of this game or for Fiona and Rhys to continue their adventures in Borderlands 3 in some form.Telltale really delivered here and it's my hope that their other game series continue this amount of fun and quality that Tales From The Borderlands has brought.I cannot recommend this game enough.

As usual, they nail their source, encapsulating everything that makes Borderlands the outstanding franchise it rightfully is- Characters. From Rhys to Fiona to Loaderbot to Vazques. Each a larger than life caricature in best Borderlands tradition. And while Claptrap is famously missing, there's plenty of robot love to go around, ohhh yeah- Humor!! not everything is a hit, but 3 episodes in and I'm still cracking up- Music! gods, what a soundtrack. Shawn Lee and his Ping Pong Orchestra's 'Kiss The Sky' from Episode 2 will never leave my earballs- Voice acting! TellTale delivers once more. Outstanding to see Patrick Warburton return after Poker Night 2. He is one of the great, underappreciated voice actors- Story. It takes the backseat over the hilarity most of the time, but it's there and moving to the, inevitable, chaotic conclusion- choose your own adventure style choicesCons:- Bro, not nearly enough Bros, Bro.Verdict:Fun, exhilarating and perfectly performed. Tales From The Borderlands deserves a spot in any library.Fans of story driven games should give this a serious thought, as it delivers on characters and story.Action driven players might want to look around further, as you'll sit around as a spectator most of the time.If I could have an extramarital affair with a game, this would be it.

Absolutely hilarious at almost every turn, quite exciting at perfect moments, and  most importantly - it makes you care about the characters and get invested in their stories. The top-notch writing of Telltales esteemed folks is back and in a completely refreshing way compared to the dreariness of most of their previous titles.Some people will say that the choices you make in this game don't matter, but I WHOLLY disagree with that. The choices I made in my game were incredibly important, but only to me. The game didn't even care what choices I made, but they were an integral part of my experience with it. By the end of the final episode you come to realize that YOU have been part of writing these characters. YOU get to decide what kinds of characters you want them to be, where they will end up, how they relate to eachother, what they think of others and their actions. In a way, they are YOUR characters by the end, and I absolutely loved that. There is no better way to get a player invested, than to give them the reigns of how to steer their characters. In many ways, I found this a more profound RPG experience than Fallout 4... And it's not even an RPG. That's a hell of an accomplishment in my eyes.If you enjoyed the Walking Dead games, but had your problems with not feeling like you could actually make any meaningful choices and you like comedy, get this. It is worth your time and money. Your choices won't drastically affect the outcome of the plot, but they damned sure will affect how you feel about your characters."

Even if you're not that into Gearbox' loot-em-up franchise you are still going to have an absolute blast. The Borderlands games are excellent source material for not only a compelling narrative but also a crapton of jokes. Like a bazillion jokes. Probably more jokes than there are guns on Pando- ... nah. Now spend your hard-earned money on this piece of interactive software and you'll have one hell of a good time. It's a scientific fact!Now, if you're not at the checkout right now, you're probably looking for a list of some of the not so shiny stuff. Here you go.There really isn't a lot of interactivity. As can be expected from telltale, the gameplay consists mostly of talky bits and quick-timey bits sometimes interrupted by walky bits where you get the opportunity to look at stuff and talk to your companions. In-engine cutscenes take up most of the time. Didn't bother me, might bother you so I'm telling you right now.Sometimes the animations are really lacking. Early fight scenes in particular simply feel very... light? Like everyone's shooting water guns and hitting each other with napkins. It gets better later though. Much, MUCH better!At around 10 hours it's not a whole lot of game, especially at full price. If you pick it up on sale however and play one episode a day you will get a pretty fun week with a two hour movie for about 1,50€ (or whatever it'll cost next sale) per day.That's all that comes to mind right now. Really not a whole lot to complain about. The game never crashed on me, looked and felt like the source material and closing it after finishing the last episode felt pretty great.

The story alone is enough to make it an amazing game but that combined with its visual aesthetic and incredibly good sountrack makes it one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.Granted its replayability declines considerably once you have several playthoughs under your belt but in an age where most major game developers look to just milk their consumers for money instead of actually developing a compelling game this game stands out as a rare exception.I can guarantee that you will laugh and if you are not a stone cold rock when it comes to your emotions you will definitely tear up a bit as well.

I never felt that my ideas of who the characters should be was at odds with the dialogue choices either, something very few story-driven games capture, and characters reacted in subtle, believable and often surprisingly considered ways.  It has the sense of travel and time passing that few adventure games really capture too, and does so better than anything I've played since Grim Fandango.The typical Telltale mechanics are all there but are subtly played with, better fit the story and very rarely feel intrusive.  The choices you make throughout the game feel like they have a genuine impact on the relationships between the characters, and the way in which you have played the entire game shapes how the ending plays out.  A combination of excellent writing and clever use of the mechanics make this the best implementation of the Telltale structure to date.TL; DR:It feels like Borderlands and does Telltale better than the others, with a brilliant cast, great story and wonderful sense of adventure."

The previous Borderlands games were great but, because of their length and repetitive gameplay, they could be a real grind, Tales lets you see the world of Pandora from eyes other than a vault hunter's. Your choices may not alter the story drastically but they do change who your allies are which is a nice alternative to the false pretense that all your choices will change the course of the story. The writing is fantastic, with each episode better than the last. There are some incredibly fun scenes and some laugh out loud moments. For anyone who has enjoyed the Borderlands series and is at least partial to Telltale's point and click formula, this is a must."

Much intelligent humor but also emotional and purely epic in multiple scenes. I had the most badass finger-gun shootout in history. Many accountants died. Every episode has a Borderlands-style opening with very well chosen songs, that pump you up...they are so well done! I have only 2 points to criticise: First, some of the QTE events are getting REALLY old and tedious (specifically the hammering of the Q key). Pressing directional keys is not so much a problem and the game is very forgiving for mistakes.....but that repeating Q pressing was really annoying throughout the game. Second, you must have played at least Borderlands2 to fully appreciate and enjoy this game. I would say it is mandatory. Other than that, surprisingly good game...this one is worth more money than they're asking. Great production!"

If you like the humor and style of the series, you'll probably like this spin-off.My only real gripe is that there isn't a whole lot of interactivity in this one compared to Wolf Among Us or Walking Dead. It's a lot more straightforward and rarely gives you a break to explore. Instead it focuses on the dynamics between the two very different characters you control. Even when they are in the same scene controlling them works very well.Dialogue is also great in this one. Plenty of laughs. Great soundtrack.This game is definitely geared towards Borderlands fans, but I could see someone new to the series still enjoying this one."

All the characters are portrayed brilliantly and is hard to please everyone but that is what makes the game so compelling. With the quick dialog options does not leave you time to ponder but to go with your gut. It is these quickfire dialog choices that makes the game flow smoothly and keeps you engaged with the story. Also some choices soley reflect on you and have no impact on the game can leave you questioning your own morals (for a fleeting moment.)Visually this game is a fusion of borderlands cartoon/animated style with the Telltale mechanics and with previous titles such as The Wolf Among Us, it is a match to suit both companies. If you are a fan of the borderlands imagry, then this game will suit you well.This game ( or interactive story) is worth the price tag. Telltale Games have set a standard for this type of genre and is shows.

,Recommended,330830,13088664,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,Corey,"EPISODE FOUR REVIEWEpisode 4 of Tales from the Borderlands was brilliant. Easily one of the funniest episodes yet with choices that impacted the entire series, which is crazy. I'm so happy this episode came a lot sooner than the others because Telltale always had me hanging on for the next episode for too long, but they seem to have fixed their mistakes with the quick release of this episode. As always, amazing writing from Gearbox and Telltale Games and incredibly entertaining gameplay.I'm really curious how this series is going to end but goddamn, I commend Telltale and Gearbox for this masterpiece.EPISODE THREE REVIEWGoddamn it, this series just gets better and better as it progresses. Episode 3's release kinda shocked me as I wasn't aware it was coming out until the game updated on Steam but it was definitely worth the wait. Even halfway through the series, they're still adding new characters that are lovable in the same way that the main characters already are. Gortys is a surprisingly amazing character, probably one of my favorite from most of the recent episodic games I've played in a while, the episode didn't fall short of making me laugh hard at some scenes, such as Fiona saying ""Touchgoal"" in victory of defeating some enemies and Gortys talking about Rhys' tie.This series (as I claimed in my review for the previous episode) is well on it's way to being my favorite Telltale Games series period, and this episode just furthers that claim.Only negative things I can say are the that I encountered a few glitches, one which crashed my game and wouldn't play to the point that I had to completely re-install the game again, which wasn't a pleasant experience, but that didn't take much away from the brilliant experience I had with this episode.Play this right now if you have any interest in the Borderlands series whatsoever.EPISODE TWO REVIEWI just finished Tales From The Borderlands Episode 2 and holy ♥♥♥♥, this is my favorite Telltale series ever. It's so funny, entertaining, fun to play and I love almost all of the characters. There was some twists that I didn't see coming and the Loader Bot character is hilarious. I'm honestly so happy that the second episode finally came out and I can't wait for episode 3.EPISODE ONE REVIEWI just finished episode one of Tales From The Borderlands, Zer0 Sum with my sister (She was Fiona, I was Rhys) and that was perfect. Incredible story, hilarious moments (I was crying from laughter at points) surprisingly amazing action sequences, easily-likeable characters and it's everything and more that I expected from the game.It's also a surprisingly long Telltale episode, clocking in at around 2 and a half hours if you take time to explore and interact with the characters.I rarely give these out because I don't think there's much that's perfect, but that was a 10 out of 10. Definitely pick it up and play it. If you love the lore of Borderlands, love Telltale Games, or both, you will love this first episode. (I rarely give out score-based reviews as I don't want to be entirely bias and give a critical review on the media, but honestly, I had no faults with this starting episode.)"

The interesting art style, along with the great story line and tons of comedic value, makes this game incredibly fun to play. Even more so, just like every other Tell Tale Game, there is always some kind of heartbreaking choice you have to make. Thus forcing you to feel attached to the characters, and to become roped into the game altogether. Then, in the end, you are left crying about it all being over. Seriously though, this is a great game, and I fully advise you to play it.(Note: I have never played any actual Borderlands game, so I cannot make any comparisons.

The story was accompanied by a variety of interesting (and fantastic) characters that you easily get invested in - whenever characters were in danger I physically wanted to make sure all of my 'friends' made it out alive. The game switched between slow-paced dialogue/exploring scenes and action sections frequently, with the exposition being constantly interesting and the action making you feel like a badass every time (my favourite scene is the beginning of episode 2, taking down the Hive). Telltale kept the perfect balance of humour and seriousness throughout, and keeping to true Borderlands themes kept the game 18+, the humour and the action is no holes barred. Moving on to my favourite aspect of this game, the sound design was especially exceptable - every episode I would be looking forwards to the next intro song, and they have all been added to my Spotify playlists.Overall I believe this game to be Telltale's magnum opus so far, I honestly don't know how they will top it (though I do look forwards to being blown away yet again, as I was with this after the walking dead). If you're at all interested in Telltale or story-based games, give this a try; if you like the Borderlands games and don't mind a story focus, give this a try. I would honestly recommend this to anybody though.It usually takes a lot to make me truly love a game, the only other game that did this was probably TWD S1, but anyway I give Tales from the Borderlands - 10/10."

Its only minor downsides are, like any TellTale game, knowledge of the franchise is a near must. Playing this before Borderlands 1 and 2 not only would dull the experience, but also net you a few spoilers.That said, this is a game for the fans of that series. Funny and fantastically written without relying on memes and in-jokes that plagued Borderlands 2. The choices you pick throughout the episodes matter, resulting in wildly different conversations and scenes, something which is a must for these style of games, something that few manage (Cough Life is Strange).Tales from the Borderlands is the only TellTale adventure, along side Wolf Among Us, that I'd recommend is worth it even without a discount sale price."

But now I gotta say: By far one of the best games I have played in a long whileTales from the Borderlands is and has everything a roleplayer would miss in borderlands:More character depth (not to say bl itself has none of it - but quite limited); But above all:The chance to experience the world of Pandora with more detail and a certain amount of respect.Playing as a Con-Artist and a Hyperion Salary man you firepower is quite... limited. A hunch of bandits are now something you should be afraid of - or at least work more with your mind.The story itself reveals some awesome and well made twist, but I gotta say here as a little minus point: It is so awesome and rich in the plot, that you got the feeling it wont fit whole in an 5-episodic game like this. And this is my only complain.Tales from the Borderlands in retrospect:PROs:+ the characters+ the humor+ the depth of everything+ the story+ gameplay and design+ replayable until some point+ hellload of things to explore+ action scenes (not all, but overall they are awesome)CONs:- too shortWarning:If you have a problem with eyeballs being shoved out of the face, slowy torn out limbs and those things and you don't have a certain understanding of black humor - then this game is nothing for you."

Get it.The long version: If you've played a Telltale game before, then nothing in Tales from the Borderlands will surprise you. The same QTE-lite sequences, point-and-click adventuring, and decision making are all here, just like the other games. But this one did something to me that the others never did - it made me laugh. Sometimes, it made me laugh my butt off.I should say that I came into this game without really knowing a lot about Borderlands. Sure, I half-heartedly played my way through the very first one, but I can't say I paid much attention to the overall story. My experience was mostly just BLAM BLAM LOOT LOOT EXPLOSION.The beauty of this game is that I didn't need to know much. That's because clever writing and lovable characters are really the heart of Tales from the Borderlands. That, and the amazing soundtrack. So if you love getting wrapped up in a good story, and you want to have a bit of escapist fun that will make you smile, then I'd definitely suggest this game."

Yes, I already like Borderlands, so that's a plus, but there are more reasons to love this game. First, the look. The Cell-Shading never fit more perfectly than in this game, because it just looks exactly like Borderlands. Also, you have a larger impact on the story than in the previous games. It's still very guided, but with neat variations here and there. Another thing I loved were the intros for every episode. Those just dripped with atmosphere and set you in a perfect mood for the story to come. Last of all: The story itself is awesome. The characters are interesting, the plot takes the weirdness of Borderlands and puts it in a surprisingly emotional plot and the humor hits all the right spots. Definetely worth checking outso in short:+ Borderlandsy Atmosphere+ engaging plot and characters+ actual impact on the story+ humor+ awesome soundtrack- Season 2 is not out yet"

Telltale and Gearbox brought an incredible story to the already rich Borderlands universe.The characters you meet are fully realized - funny, smart, mysterious, brave, caring, etc.  It's a complete joy to take these characters through an adventure on Pandora, especially so if you've played through the FPS series because you get to see another side to the characters and the additional links to the canon.The game is superbly written & directed; everything from the logo reveals at the start of each episode to the action sequences and touching scenes are expressed like you'd see on the big screen, only you're the one giving out the lines of dialog.  You'll grow attached to some characters.  You'll despise others.  You'll probably tear up once or twice.If you like Borderlands, buy this game.  It's a requirement.  If you don't like Borderlands or haven't played the games, it still has a wonderful set of characters and story to enjoy.Great work, Telltale & Gearbox.

Likewise, every decision inThe Wolf Among Usmade you feel more or less like an outsider, but there didn't seem to be much of a character arc for Bigbee.Tales from the Borderlandsbreaks those molds, tailoring the relationships of the characters to the decisions you make, always with what feels like meaningful character progression.

So many things about this were great.  The story, by itself is enough of a reason to get this game, it is phenomenal!  It brings you on a rollercoaster of emotions, sadness, joy, anger, and it also includes lots of humor that fits extreamly well in the scenes and does not seem out of place.  The voice actors did an excellent job, from the beginning I loved the two main characters Fiona and Rhys.  Patrick Warburton, who played Vasquez, had a very dreamy voice and I would play a game that was just him talking if that existed.  Tell tale has done it again, made another brilliant game that I will lose entire nights of sleep because I cant stop thinking about the games!  The only negative about this game is the wait between the episodes of the game.  However, since the game is completely out now, there is no wait!  Get this game now!  What are you waiting for!"

The game has the same play style as the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, but still manages to pack in the same feeling as Borderland 2, including all the one liners.It still keeps the same loot and money system present in the Borderlands games although in a simplified way befitting the point and click style. In addition, lore buffs like myself can further analyze Characters and items as Rhys to gain some intriguing and often hilarious background information on the Universe.That being said the game does have a few flaws to it. The first episode seemed a bit on the short side, seeming, at least to me, shorter than the first episode of the Walking Dead Season 1. Also the cursor seems to disappear at odd moments especially during dialogue and occasionally during quick time events. I missed one dialogue  opportunity due to this.All and all, Tales from the Borderlands is well worth it's price, especially with several more episodes on the way.I will update the review as more episodes are released.Summery:PROS:Borderlands!Tell Tale!humorousAction still thereHandsomeness!CONS:Episode 1 is a bit on the shortCursor occasionally disappears"

Keeping in line with the Borderlands universe and adding some action segments (aka quick time events) does remind you that you're in a world full of crazy people, but the important thing is that you're going to love these crazy people.Now in the first episode you really only meet 1 or 2 people from previous Borderlands games, the rest are all brand new. And let me say, Telltale and Gearbox did a fantastic job writing these characters up. They all have unique personalities yet they don't exactly fit stereotypes, and the dialogue is actually ingeniously funny (more funny than the other games in the series, even).A lot of the complaints about this series came from those who thought a point and click gameplay style would ruin Borderlands.

,Recommended,330830,13085370,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,WeaselBiggs,"Let's be clear on one thing : Tales from the Borderlands is not a shooter. The universe it's set in has been the host to three decent-to-excellent FPS romps, but you'll enjoy this fairly oddball story if you start with the understanding that there's much more to Pandora than 87 bajillion guns, meat bicycles or little steward robots with a chronic need for personal validation and a Dubstep fixation.Once that's settled, you'll be treated to another case of Telltale Games hitting their licensed project out of the ballpark, the polar opposite to the ho-hum Back to the Future series in terms of quality, as well as a decent companion to The Wolf Among Us or the two Walking Dead series.Again, that's in terms of quality. In terms of content, Tales from the Borderlands couldn't possibly be any more different. Where the first two were serious to the point of heart-wrenching drama or gritty Noir sets and themes, this is a game that takes the technical excellence of Bigby Wolf's run across Fabletown and slathers it in the madcap style and substance of Gearbox Software's flagship franchise. The end result is a Borderlands game where one of your two protagonists receives a gun only once. Said gun isn't much more than a small holdout pistol and holds only a single bullet.That's because it's not an FPS gun; it's a narrative-required gun. It's not meant to be a crazy sci-fi pea-shooter, it's meant to be just another fork in the story's road. As choices come and go, then so too do bullets. That's one bullet you're free to hang on to, or to spend at the first opportunity available. No modifyers, no elemental damage – nothing. In fact, one of the supporting characters gets to use a Maliwan SMG, and you're quite deliberately left with nothing.You're not here to shoot stuff. You're not here to stack XP points. You're here to find a Vault – and even that's just the final threshold resulting out of an attempt from a disgruntled Hyperion wage slave to give the company one final middle finger before sailing off with a briefcase full of cash. Said wage slave, Rhys, is a mousey and fast-talking idiot in the making, an embryonic Handsome Jack 2.0 that you're entirely free to play as a nice guy with prickly tendencies or as a budding sociopath on the road to self-discovery. He eventually crosses path with Fiona, a Pandora native who's also had to play it fast and loose in her time, as a con artist. In both cases, your best weapons aren't tri-tipped rifles so much as your labial muscles and tongue. You're probably surrounded by the sharpest wits on the planet and aren't that bad yourself in both cases, and will spend most of two hours or so facing down corporate heartlessness or gibbering gun-toting insanity with the power of your brain-noodle. Both Rhys and Fiona's attempts at striking it rich intersect in plot-motivating and comical ways, assembling a ragtag group of people who don't quite trust each other yet but find that they're in it for the long haul.As you can expect, the game is packed to the gills with references to the first two games and their respective expansions. None of it all really warrants serious spoiler warnings, but you'll be pleasantly surprised to find out just who they've managed to sneak in despite rather severe cases of life deprivation. The one spoiler I can't really dodge is Zer0's appearance in the first chapter, as it fittingly bears his name. Zer0 Sum sets the tone and establishes the main players, all the while revealing the game series' one and only serious problem.That problem is Handsome Jack.He's been a wonderful antagonist in the second game, and having him around in The Pre-Sequel was at least somewhat entertaining – but Tales from the Borderlands makes such insistent call-backs to his involvement in the general universe's plot that you're left wondering just where the series will be forced to go, after this. Jack's dead as of Borderlands 2; isn't it time someone else stepped up to the Giant Corporate Sphincter's seat and filled it? Tales itself is quick to introduce the concept of the universe being so chock-full of self-serving megacorps they generally function as meat-grinders for career sociopaths! In that case, why did they lean so heavily on Handsome Jack as the instigator for the current state of affairs?It's complicated – I can't spoil anything but I do feel I have to address the case of a fictitious universe growing disturbingly amorous of a character that does pack oodles of charisma, but who also needs to give the headlights to someone else. I'm afraid Handsome Jack could become Pandora's Lestat, unkillable by virtue of sheer awesomeness, inextricable from the narrative even in a postmortem form due to Telltale's own writers latching onto him.That said, they've handled everything else perfectly. There's plenty of loaned assets you'll recognize directly out of Borderlands 1 and 2, the guns – glorified props as they are in this case – are all still justifiably “Borderlandsish” in appearance, and those swats of unique narrative or world-building that Telltale has managed to carve for itself do actually feel like they fit in the main universe. You're still on Pandora and it still feels like Pandora – albeit a talky, clicky and Quick-Time-Eventy version of Pandora. The art style fits, the writing fits, the tone fits – it's just not a shooter, is all. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.I mean, as much as I love that nutty universe, I'm glad to have characters around who take their definition of “quirky” further than just randomly quoting Macbeth in the middle of a no-holds-barred firefight or offering you a mid-game quest consisting of shooting them in the face.Yes. Look up Face McShooty on Google. You might miss him completely in Borderlands 2, but he does ask you to shoot him in the face. Not the knees or arms, though – the face. He's very particular about that.Instead, Tales articulates its own quirks through Troy Baker's excellent performance as Rhys and Laura Bailey's best performance since the female Boss in Saints Row IV; as Fiona. One sells the idea of a hapless fast-talker and the other voices a believably snarky and clever native. Through them, the world of Pandora expands far beyond your usual ramshackle bandit outposts and grows into even more of a tangible place. From a world-building point of view, it's what Gearbox's concept has been sorely needing.Beyond all this, there isn't much to say. The game is fairly stable on my rig, I've heard reports of some players being stuck without dialog audio thanks to improperly selected sound card channels, but that's it. A few tweaks in Windows' Sound menu and you're good to go.As with every other Telltale game, this is an experience that will only get better as later future installments are released. You aren't paying for your initial two hours – you're paying for six to twelve potential hours with some amount of replay value tossed in.The only thing left to consider is if this is a tale you'd consider worth experiencing for yourself. If you're a fan of Gearbox's loot-and-shoot bonanza on more than simply technical grounds and actually have a vested interest in Pandora's defining history, you might appreciate this. If you're in it for the sake of finding pungent kill-sticks above all else, however, you're probably better off giving this a pass.More story or more guns? If you answered “story”, pick this up without delay. If not – maybe consider catching a Let's Play of the completed series, a year or so from now."

Really fast match up the mouse action type style.The characters TellTale created for this game fit perfectly in the Borderlands Universe.If you're a fan of Borderlands but never tried a Point to Click game before, then this one would sure be a great one to try.Don't expect a ton of gun combat, there is a little bit with the loaders which is interesting but it's not for long.TellTale is really great at making their Point to Click games not seem like a Point to Click game at all.This was another great entry, can't wait for more episodes.9/10"

But sometimes they are so good they are worth playing. If any other producer tried this I think they would have failed. If you like the Borderlands universe and dont mind something a little different you should be absolutly entertained. Its hard to review this like a normal game and so I will just try to explain my experience.Do not think just because this is a Telltale adventure game that you will be bored with a slow paced point and click.First thing's first, play this with a gamepad if youve got it. It just feels better. That might be more opinion than anything but try it out.The characters are fantastic. They are certainly doing the Borderlands mythos proud. They are all lovable in their own way and even though you have control over many of the two main characters action you tend to feel the urge to make choices you think that specific character would make and not just playing yourself through two different people.The story is paced amazingly well, it provides a few spots you could probably stop for the night, but like a Tv show, you might feel the urge to binge it all in one shot like a Netflix-travaganza. I did. And I cannot wait for more.This is just plain fun on all accounts. And Funny too. Never does this game break its back for a joke. Its all written very hilariously and very well.I really feel like my choices matters and could have effected the outcome of this chapter as well as the whole game. We will see. Second playthrough on the way.Cons:I was hoping for more inventory based puzzling, however it seems that may be in the future. There is a barely used inventory system in the game and it seems to me that it will come in use later.Big con for me, its not all out yet. I waited for this to come out, and beat it in a few hours and now I have to wait for the rest.Final verdict?If you want a change of pace, buy it. Now.This is not assassins creed or even mario so comparing it to something like that is apples to oranges."

Tales from the Borderlands does an excellent job of exploring the world of Pandora from the perspective of non-badasses who are struggling to survive (unlike the protagonists of the main Borderlands games and their New-U stations [with one exception]). It further expands the story following the events of Borderlands 2, so those who went out of their way to listen to ECHO recordings and actually read the paragraphs of quest text and played the game for its plot would enjoy TFTBL.+ The directing in all the scenes is fantastic.+ Two protagonists means you play from the perspective of two different characters.+ Only Telltale can make me wince while scooping out an eyeball in the context of a game franchise where bandits blow up into bloody bits and Goliaths vomit corrosive acid on a regular basis.+ Fantastic voice acting. Side note: Vasquez is voiced by Patrick Warburton a.k.a. Brock Samson (Venture Bros.), Kronk (Emperor's New Groove), and Joe Swanson (Family Guy)- There are a few minor graphical glitches, and some of the animations are a little awkward.- Telltale games in general would do well with some sort of bookmark feature to revisit specific decision points without having to replay an entire episode."

I actually cared about the characters and really wanted to know how things were played out.Of course with all of these games sometimes you will find choices that just don't feel right in the dialogue options. But there were very few times i saw that happen. Character progression is something that is in the player and not written in the script. Both characters can be cocky all the way through and see what consequences it has.This game is not only for people who have played Borderlands.

I'll get started on my review.Sections1. Graphics2. Controls3. Audio4. Optimization5. Story6. Overall1. GraphicsThe graphics for this game are the average Telltale kind, but mixed with regular old Borderlands as well. They aren't realistic of course, and they aren't too cartoony, putting it in a nice little spot in between. It looks beautiful on high settings and the colors are fittingly vibrant. The lighting for Pandora looks very close to the lighting as in the regular Borderlands games, being the same old sunny desert-like planet. I wish the mouse color would be brought out at more points, as it is usually clear and I can sometimes not find it.2. ControlsI don't have to say much for this, considering the controls are about the same if not the same for the other Telltale games (As far as I know). For those who don't know the controls, the games make great use of the WASD, arrow keys, Q & E, along with the mouse. Not much else, but you won't really find yourself using other controls often, if at all. They're amazingly easy to use and if you're used to the keyboard (Which you should be) then you'll be fine. As for points it needs you to click, you simply drag the mouse over to that point, which is shown by a bright red circle on it. You won't have to worry about remembering lots of buttons.3. AudioThe audio is nicely done. I love the music and sounds of the weapons, voices, cars, etc. They are all put at a nice default level. The audio is a big part of this game as it sounds so good. I can only wish that many games in the future have as well done audio as this one. You'll rarely notice yourself having to strain your ears to hear voices, and even if you have that problem you can simply turn on subtitles. The audio all fits together, where a character's voice is still hearable but  a little shut out by loud sounds, giving it a realistic like feeling.4. OptimizationThe game is incredibly well optimized and should be able to be played on nearly every computer from as early as 2009-2010. My computer isn't as strong as most but I can still play on high settings at an average of 50-60FPS. I haven't noticed any large dips in the framerate, even in action packed moments, where the framerate stays steady but can go down to 40FPS or so. The average computer should be able to play this game on at least medium settings.5. Story - NOTE: Possible spoilers.Tales From the Borderlands features two main protagonists, Fiona and Rhys. Fiona, a thief born on Pandora, is a con-artist taught and raised by a pro. Rhys, on the other hand, is a Hyperion employee working to become the next Handsome Jack (As the game is based after the events of Borderlands 2). However, a twist in his plans comes along, where a man named Vasquez takes over Hyperion, killing the former boss, Mr. Henderson. Vasquez then proceeds to demote Rhys extremely, cruelly taking the position Rhys was about to be given. Rhys then begins to work against Vasquez, with the help of his friends, Yvette and Vaughn. After a deal goes wrong, Fiona and Rhys must work together to  get what they want. Your choices, with both characters, matter very much so. Your friends will look at you differently depending on your choices, as in all of the other Telltale games.In my opinion, the story is well constructed. They definitely thought it out a lot and it seems like it will influence the total future of Borderlands. I can't wait to find out what comes next.6. OverallHere's where the points come in. Using from what I've seen from the first episode, I'll give my review. This review may be updated in the future, possibly for the better or worse.Graphics - 9.5/10 - While the graphics are nice, I feel like there could be a little more detail. It might just be me, though. The graphics were put in a nice place between realistic and cartoony.Controls - 8/10 - I'd like a little more use of the controls and I can sometimes feel trapped. I'd like to adjust the mouse sensitivity so I can make my decisions before time goes out, especially since I struggle to find the mouse on the screen.Audio - 9.7/10 - The audio in this game is great. There may be a little tiny bit more they can do, and I know they can improve it a tiny bit more. Otherwise, the audio is absolutely great and is some of the best I've ever heard.Optimization - 10/10 - I see no problems with the optimization. The game can run on such a wide variety of computers that it would be hard to find someone with a computer that fails to run this game.Story - 8/10 - There's some more detail they could add, like a little backstory or even some character profiles would be nice. The feeling of characters betraying each other and the greed they're driven by can be easily felt by the player, making you feel for the character(s) at points. I'm impressed.Overall Score - 9/10 - The game can still offer more to the player, even though what is already included makes me very close to satisfied, just a little more could help in my rating being boosted. As I stated before, I'm not a big Borderlands fan. This game, however, made my relationship with the series improve and I hope it continues to do so. I highly recommend that you buy it. You'll get laughs, sadness, and feelings in between, along with a sense of accomplishment."

They are witty, aware of themselves and very entertaining, despite an overall lack of deep story or meaningful characters. That is why, when I heard Telltale Games was working on a story driven game for the franchise, I had some minor skepticism, but overall excitement. What they did with The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones games was a wonder, so you can imagine that I bought this game a soon as I could, and was not disappointed in the least.Jumping in, you are a young Hyperion employee, living life and up for a major promotion. This doesn’t work out, unfortunately, as your rival (voiced by non-other than Kronk) has taken your place. Without getting into much spoiler territory, you definitely will be unable to seize the promotion. Obvious course of action? Vengeance in the form of intercepting a deal down on Pandora for a Vault key. Wacky hijinks ensue, and it all feels very much like a Borderlands game.Beyond the story of the Hyperion employee wronged by the boss, you also play an intelligent con-women who lives on Pandora. Both main characters have people in their lives around them that make appearance in the game, and are incredibly interesting characters. In the short 2.5 hours that made up the first episode of the game, I found myself attached to each character and generally worried they were going to die at some point. This degree of writing is something to be cherished in the shoot-em or generally weak writing that make up the reality of today’s gaming world.Overall, this game is worth it. It is entertaining, well written and a fun delve into the world of Pandora. Buy it now, buy it tomorrow, but no matter when, buy it and have a hell of a good time."

,Recommended,330830,13168640,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,Ariurotl,"Not so much a review as a number of thoughts on the first episode of the series from the perspective of someone very familiar with previous Telltale offerings, but completely clueless about anything Borderlands (other than the fact that it's a shooter of some kind, which was enough of a reason for me to stay as far away as possible from the original games).TFTB marks a return to more comedic style compared to Telltale's recent somber and dark offerings (The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us). Judging by the first episode, the return is a successful one. The humor is not particularly sophisticated, but I found myself chuckling at the one-liners, sharp banter and pop culture references nonetheless. It certainly makes for a nice change of pace, especially compared with soul-crushing despair of TWD.Then there are all the Borderlands references, which will probably please fans of the universe... yet I didn't get much out of those for obvious reasons. Rhys' ""magic eye"" is sparingly utilized as an exposition device of sorts, but since it can only be activated in free roam areas, the effectiveness is diminished. It is often presumed that the player is familiar with various oddballs popping up throughout the story with great fanfare (often literally), and I'm pretty sure colorful characters like Shade and regrettably-named Zer0 are supposed to be familiar to the player... yet there's no in-game way to find out more about them. Luckily, it's not at all difficult to understand the motivations of most characters (said motivation more often than not being greed), and the game speaks a universal language. You might not get the references, but you won't be at a loss of what's going on.Another thing that contrasts sharply with the previous Telltale games is the much-increased length of QTE action scenes. I must admit that I never felt comfortable with those concessions to gameplay in TWD and TWAU, especially in the latter, where they often felt tacked on. Their use is more justified here, seeing how the series is based on an action game license, but personally I'd still prefer to see the action unfold without having to mash buttons all the time... yet somehow, despite the action coming thick and fast (or rather, thicker and faster than usual), this episode marked the first time I DIDN'T get a ""Game Over, You're Dead"" screen in a Telltale game, so go figure.Speaking of action, the performance of good ol' Telltale Tool engine in TFTB surprised me immensely. It doesn't stutter nearly as much as it does in the previous games. In fact, it stutters less and less with every new Telltale game. And while this ongoing engine optimization is laudable, perhaps the company should invest some of the megabucks their ever-increasing profile earned them into developing a new one.There's a few technical issues with the game, however. Firstly, TFTB *really* doesn't like it when you try to play it in 4:3. The menu often fails to adjust and gets cut off on the left side of the screen. Furthermore, the game currently seems to ""half-exist"" on Steam. I can see it in my library and play it, but unlocked achievements don't show up on the timeline. I must say, however, that I didn't experience the ""disappearing cursor"" bug that seems to have affected some people.Another pleasant surprise is the episode's length. It just might be the longest episode of a Telltale game I've ever played. It felt quite long, at least. I just hope the rest of this series will provide at least a comparable amount of content per episode.All in all, it's been a fun ride so far and the first episode proved to be much better than I expected. I just wanted ""something Telltale"" to tide me over until Game of Thrones, and instead I got an entertaining and engrossing story in its own right. Now the creators just have to keep it up."

Tales from the Borderlands is their new game with collaboration with GearBox and the Borderlands team in order to continue the story after Borderlands 2. The story puts you in the roles of Rhys and Fiona, two people completely different and kind of the same. Rhys wants to be the next big dog on Hyperion and gets screwed and when he tries to find a way to stick it to Hyperion, he finds Fiona and things get very interesting, very fast.The game puts you in the role of Rhys first and it's rather neat how the Loader mechanic comes to play when it first comes in, and also what you can make this dude do. Also, able to scan the environment is awesome and filled with tidbits of information for the fans of the games. With Fiona, it seems like it's about finding currency and either spending it or finding ways to save for later to get even better things. You also get appearances from new characters, old favorites and even older favorites.The flow of the story is wonderful, and the humor is as spot on as it usually is with a Borderlands game. But since this is a TellTale game, the focus is on interactions, decisions, and a few Quick Time Events (QTE) moments that make you think fast. Like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, this game leaves you wanting more after the first chapter, so I hope to update soon after I play each one. But you must get this, if you are a fan of the Borderlands experience or if you are just into great story telling. Warning, this is filled with spoilers from the past games so I would recommend to play those so that you can be on board with this game. If not, still a very enjoyable and funny ride."

The writing is exactly what I hoped from them, the cast is well-rounded, the action scenes were plentiful and exciting, the use of music was so pleasing, and the amount of content in one episode is perfect and more than I'd expect.So we have two groups of cast members, Rhys's Vaughn and Yvette, with Fiona's Felix and Sasha. Like I've said, this core group was very well rounded, and I enjoyed each character. Yvette may not be the most used, but Felix and Sasha provided great perspectives in terms of dialogue and those quiet scenes the game puts us through. As for Vaughn, he's that whiny character that balances what most people dislike with some realistic caution we as a player should consider. Status: Currently Dreading Everything. Finally, the other side characters(but very important ones), August, Vasquez, Bossanova, Zero. All incredibly entertaining to see on screen. The villains were plentiful, as well as the Borderlands references.As a Borderlands game, and me being a huge Borderlands story fan(I understand it might be hard to see the story the the gun-toting gameplay of the main franchise, but Borderlands 2 really impressed me with it's world), Tales From the Borderlands gives me the exact feeling I get when I appreciate a Borderlands Lore and story point, but then lets me savor it with the typical intensity that TellTale game has. Even if you don't like Borderlands, try this game out. It's a good, more stand-out display of what's so good about the Borderlands world.As for direct references, I have two things to say. The music and the... references. The music is usually direct from Borderlands 2, and as a big fan of the soundtrack, I'd say they used all the music with pinpoint accuracy. The joy I felt when Southern Shelf Combat played, oohhhh man. Then you have those moments where they reference the plot of past games, like in the World of Curiousities(I won't spoil what you find there). However, the game mostly references DLC story content from Borderlands 2(and a bit of 1). I loved those moments, though, as well as the action scenes. As for decisions, you have a hand in the arsenal of your loader bot, and there are some creative decisions you'll have to make, like saving your only bullet throughout the entire season. I used it this episode, but what if I didn't? It gave me two chances to just in this episode.Either way, this game is 10/10, I can't WAIT for the next episode. The writing is actually a bit surprising in it's intelligence, as in, the plot is pretty clever. I didn't expect the episode to be so long, it was definitely over two hours long, and A LOT happened. That plot description about the vault key and stuff for this episode? Yeah, going into episode two, we have a whole different set-up to head toward, and I'm ready for it."

However, let me just say right off the bat that this game is A M A Z I N G. An overwhelmingly positive customer satisfaction status is well-deserved to say the least. The art, music, and voice acting all tied together to create a fluid experience that I will never forget. The writing created a broad spectrum of emotions ranging from anxiety to surprise. Relatable characters helped me transition into the Borderlands world and provided a sense of realism in this fictional story. QTEs and decision making unfold the story as you progress and will make you see that this game has potential for unlimited, unbounded replayability. You do not need any background knowledge about the Borderlands world to start this game, because it is a completely different experience. After completing the game, I felt sad that it ended so soon and wished for a sequel to be released. Unfortunately, there is no news of a sequel or Part 2 for Tales from the Borderlands, so in the meantime I will be playing Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel. Overall, this game will leave a lasting impression on you for the rest of your life because it is so G O S H D A R N G O O D! I highly recommend that you pick up this game so you can experience it yourself. You WILL NOT regret it.TL;DR: THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME! GET IT!"

Knowing fully well that Borderlands is all about jokes and killing with little backstory, I still expected Telltale Games to create a very touching, emotional game in which the player has a lot of sympathy for the protagonist(s) just like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.This is not the case in Tales From the Borderlands though. This game, a ¡Telltale Game!, actually made me laugh, instead of cry(due to their emotional games like The Walking Dead).The protagonists aren't as lovable as Lee/Clementine or Bigby, the story isn't as grasping as other Telltale masterpieces and the game doesn't play with your emotions while The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us did this all the time.So, does this mean that this is a bad game? Does this mean that this game is not worth to be called a Telltale game?I believe this game, though unusual when compared to recent Telltale games, should be seen as a masterpiece. Where this game lacks certain emotional and story traits, it completely makes up for it through humor and funny protagonists and characters.Besides, a Borderlands game without the jokes and violence wouldn't really be a Borderlands game.There were numerous events in the game in which I laughed out loud and especially protagonist Rhys is a blast!I especially refer to the scene where Rhys blows the Vault Key seller's mind as one of the funniest scenes so far!On a final note:I do believe that The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us take first (TWD) and second place (TWAU), but Tales from the Borderlands should definitely be considered a great game. And who knows, maybe the game will prove me wrong. Second place may be up for grabs…"

Hated Wolf among Us. Despised Game of Thrones. Played opening of their Minecraft story and never went back to it and I have no intention of playing any TTG game again, especially as they continue to claim your choice tailor blah blah blah (they cant even tailor a story.)I'm also sane and a normal human being, therefore I know that the stupid 'X will remember that' prompts are pathetic attempts at tricking you into thinking your choices matter.Oh, and then theres this game, Tales from the Borderlands.Yeah its good. Try it out.Its less about your choices mattering, and more about just choosing what you'd like the character to say. You can intentionally choose 'incorrect' or 'fail' options and the game will roll with it in humourous ways. This is perfectly emphasised by a latter choice where you have to build a 'team' = Your choices dont matter, so you arent encouraged to choose a team you think is effective, you're instead choosing a team made up of your favourite characters, the ones you want to take with you through to the end.  Oh, and for once there is a proper ENDING. Cliffhangers in these kind of games are stupid and annoying, so its nice that this game actually feels like a concrete story, Oh and its important to the Borderlands Lore, unlike the stupid Game of Thrones games where whenever a lore character appeared you knew they would survive no matter what despite the game idiotically expecting you to think otherwise.Again, you don't choose dialogue options you think are effective, you choose dialoge that is potentially funny, even if its clearly a dumb choice. You can play Rhys as a clumsy socially awkward genius or a self-centred pragmatist, the dialogue is all there.There is even character to some of the gameover screens.And its funny."

Tales from the Borderlands, like their other games, is not particularly challenging as far as video games generally go - you basically just need to push certain buttons when the game tells you and have a decent sense of timing. But, what it lacks in challenge, it makes up tenfold in its hilarious, witty and memorable story. One of the most enjoyable 10 hours in a video game I've ever spent; I wish it was longer.

I'm recommending this game with some reservations.First off, this game feels less like a game than a pick your own adventure movie.  The biggest gameplay are dialog choices and quick time events ala Dragon's Lair or Braindead 13.  When I started the game I played through one episode and quit, wanting something more interactive at the time.I came back after a few days though, because the story is great.  I'm not entirely sure the dialog and writing are perfectly in line with the Borderlands universe, but I enjoyed it immensely.  One thing I have to say is that the folks at Telltale Games are masters at the art of storytelling.  One of the things under the hood that took me a little while to notice is that your choices can dramatically affect the dialog and the scenes that you play through.   For a game that you can play through in eleven hours, there is a ridiculous quantity of content hidden away behind the choices you don't make.One thing I found really amusing about the game, is that every episode is introduced by Marcus in his storytelling style, and about a third into each episode there is a musical interlude similar to what starts each Borderlands game.  Telltale really pulled out all of the stops in trying to make this feel like a Borderlands game without actually being in the same genre.In short (why do people always put this at the end of a review?) this game is a great example of storytelling over gameplay.  If you are looking for more of the Borderlands universe and don’t necessarily want the gameplay I'd say you should pick it up without hesitation.  If you want more run and gun fun and don't really care about the story, take a pass.  If you are somewhere in the middle I get the impression that this is a good place for a Borderlands fan to get a taste of what Telltale games are like.  Regardless of whether you like this style of game or not, there is probably enough Pandora in here to make the game an overall positive experience."

Thus far, I have played Telltale's The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Game of Thrones, and I can say with utmost confidence this is the best of the bunch. The characters are all smartly written and compelling, the dialogue is hilarious (though it may be a hit or miss case if you aren't normally a fan of typical Borderlands style humor), and the animation is done very well, especially considering Telltale's less than stunning engine. If you want a story driven Borderlands game with shooting elements and a lack of QTEs, you shouldn't be looking here. Yes, the 'game', in true Telltale fashion, simply boils down to an interactive movie, but the choices in this game are interesting enough that I really felt like I was a part of the experience. Finally, I have to give credit to Telltale for their phenomenal music choices in Tales from the Borderlands. Each episode features a different opening track, and each one is equally awesome and memorable."

My ONLY problem with the game, as you can see by my playtime, is that it's too short. I am not sure if other telltale games are this short, but I wished it was longer. The gameplay was fantastic, using a fair amount of quicktime events, and subtle foreshadowing of what's to come.If you think that 25$ is worth ~12 hours of gametime, AMAZING gameplay at that, do not hesitate to pick up a copy of Tales from the Borderlands today."

There may be a time when Telltale tells a tale that is bad, or even worse, boring. Rest assured, it is not this day. This is another great foray into someone else's IP, and they deliver yet again on the promise of a tale well told.Not to avoid full disclosure, I really enjoyed Borderlands 2, even if I was  a late adopter. I really dug the whole vibe, and it fit really well with the whole Space Cowboy scifi subgenre that I formatted my mind too when first I saw Cowboy Bebop in 1996. So I am a fan of both Telltale Games and Borderlands. If you are as well, then you're not even reading this, because you have already bought the game and played through it, seen Zero(tm) Do The Thing(tm).If you are a fan of EITHER Borderlands or of Telltale, I highly recommend this game. If you aren't sure, go look up the music playlists on youtube. They are excellent, and do not spoil anything. The music and voice acting are on point as usual for these games. The music blends some familliar elements from the games and new tracks with the same flavor. Suffice it to say that it's GOOD.

And as different as the Borderlands-Universe is from the postapocalyptic and fairytale/noir-esque ones of the games mentioned above, it is as magical and fits the style of the Telltale team just as well.The game-developers' ability to grasp the soul of each respective universe and make beautiful and funny games with it is literally awesome.In Tales from the Borderlands the player follows the plot from the perspectives of two characters: the first being a salary-man named Rhys, working his way up in the relentless ranks of the big bad company Hyperion. Slightly arrogant and at times megalomaniac,(which always seems to come at the price of insecurity,) clumsy and neurasthenic, but with a heart of gold and witty.The latter two qualities he shares with his female counterpart Fiona, a  charming and talented Pandoran (Pandora being the name of the planet on which most of the story takes place) con-artist.These are the two lead parts, around whom the plot unfolds. One could describe the plot as being one big treasure hunt (or Vault hunt, in Borderlands-lingo) but this wouldn't do justice to the craftsmanship, with which Telltale developed this game. It wouldn't do justice to  the strong characters, whose interaction among each other is the real treasure (isn't that corny). As it is with well-told stories, the How is at least equally as important as the What; and I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to experince the How."

I eagerly awaited each update and immediately played the episodes as they came out. The characters are a great, diverse bunch and the plot is great. The game blends a lot of (dark) humor with heartfelt emotion. Wonderful cameos from the BL franchise but also stands well on its own.Of the TTG series I've either played myself or watched, Tales from the Borderlands is far and above my favorite thus far. I've never had problems with technical glitches (unlike TWAU's game-ruining messed up save file glitch that still isn't fixed). Highly recommend this game for BL fans and newcomers alike.

As the heroes uncover more about Gortys and it's secret Vault hunting capabilities they make friends, enemies (A lot of enemies actually) and come across characters that many who have played the games of the Borderlands series will recognize or have heard of at the very least.

76561197980429671,Recommended,330830,20388201,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Bubba Jones,"This is probably Telltale's best work at this point.  This can be counted as all the more surprising since it was made out of Borderlands, a game series well known for having little story and almost no dialogue driving you through it.  While the game uses Borderlands as a IP to base its world off of, it requires no knowledge of the IP.  In fact, I'd encourage someone with no knowledge of the FPS games to play this one, as their ignorance of it will leave them more entertained and surprised by what happens.  The dialogue and presentation are flawless, the choices you can make keep playthroughs fresh and are funny and interesting enough to encourage you to replay the game without making it feel like a chore.The gameplay follows Telltale's signature system of making decisions which then influence dialogue and further choices you can make later in the game.  I feel this game highlights this design best as the way the characters and world are written make you feel like everyone's ambiguous feelings on morality frees you to make any of the decisions at a whim.  This encourages replayability and you don't feel you have to make a decision you'd regret or feel bad about to see some of the game you never seen before.  So, you're more likely to see, and not be told by someone else, what consequences x or y decision had on the rest of the story.Beyond that, puzzles are not difficult and involve exploring the screen for the next thing you click on to move, going through a dialogue tree, or finishing a quicktime event.  The mechanics are not there to challenge you, just provide a framework to express the story and cement the choices you make.The world remains light-hearted even though the characters acknowledge how crap-sack it is.  This light-hearted tone makes serious tragedy hit you harder and have more of an emotional impact than you would otherwise expect.  You need only look to the other reviews and forums to see what everyone says about Loader Bot, Scooter, the protagonists to see how far people were drawn into these characters.I've been invested and entertained enough to play through the story twice through already to see several of the decisions and dialogue choices I didn't make the first time through.  At no point while I was replaying did I feel I was forced to go through something and there was always enough new things to keep me playing.  I can not recommend this highly enough as Telltale's finest example of how they make their interactive fiction."

The Walking Dead formula is simple:the heroes are trying to go somewhere, there's zombies, someone out to get you, LOTS of tears, character deaths, and depressing visuals. I went into this game skeptical. I watched the first episode on youtube, and I liked it. (I am a HUGE borderlands fan. I have played all borderlands content except the headhunter packs, since I couldn't get them with the GOTY.) I bought the game and become hooked on the story. It is great as hell. I mean the characters, Rhys, Fiona, LOADERBOT (making the annoying enemies in Borderlands 2 become my tear-jerkers and saddest enemies to kill now), and GORTYS. I played through the first time and episode 5 was the best thing I ever played (LOL). I played a second time, now so happy to see what choices would affect the story differently, and I was kinda disappointed. The choices make no difference until episode 5 unless you count the beginnings of episode 3 and 5. The 5th episode actually gives you the chance tochoose your own party to complete the story with! Zero's voice was off however in the episode and annoyed me, along with the ""weddings are expensive comment with Athena where her model jerks oddly. The ending was a little annoying because  THAT of all things in episode 5 didnt have variability. :/ Still though, great game. Best game of 2015. Totally the wait between episodes (even though episode 4..... [i still cry]....). Now, let's measure the pros and cons.Pros:1. Great Story2. Great, lovable characters3. Amazing finale4. It changes the Borderland universe!5. A little more time with the best parts of Borderlands 2 (JACK!!!!!!!!!!)6. Great Humor and ROFL moments7. The best reveal since Darth Vader's ""Luke, I am your father!"" :DCons:1. Glitches2. The long wait between episodes3. Zero's voice in Episode 54. Details in the story that don't fit together (probably due to story contantly being changed)5.The Hyperion space station was in episode 1?6. Your choices don't really affect the overall story except for episode 5 and episode 3's opening7.

I at first thought this game would be another one of those normal telltale games, ive never been so wrong in my life. This game had everything that all of the other borderlands games had and it filled in a lot of empty gaps between the games.Playing this game have been one of the best 12 hours of borderlands experience, along with being a fun telltale game it came with some great music, sounds, story and characters. Most games leave me with a really stupid ending to the game that feels like if it was copied from every other game on the market but this ending was diferent it left you pondering what would happen next but not in a really bad cliff hanger way but in a well concluded story way.Tales From The Borderlands: 10.5/10"

It has interesting characters, an amazing story line, great soundtracks, some hilarious humor, and enough gameplay to make you feel like you're playing a game and not just watching a tv show with the occasional quick time event. It most certainly did not take away any of the grittiness and atmosphere of Boderlands, it still has all the same brutality, language, and randomness of the Borderlands universe.All in all I would highly recommend getting this game if you enjoy TellTale, Borderlands, or choose your own adventure games in general.

This game does exactly that, but more than that, it's basically a video game version of what Guardians of the Galaxy was (the movie, not the game). A great adventure, nonstop hilarity, an amazing licensed soundtrack, lovable characters (loader bot is best bot) and occasional moments of genuine heartwarming and sadness.As for the gameplay, it's Telltale. It's a little more hands-off than games of the past.Honestly, I think it's better than TWAU or TWD, although it may be that this game is just more fresh on my mind. It's also an entirely different change of tone from those games (Which Telltale pulled off in surprising fashion), so it's hard to compare them, but this game is DEFINITELY worth your time."

At several points you will get caught up in the moment and inevitably make decisions you will come to regret, either immediately or later on. Despite these regrets you still have to keep moving forward because at the end of the day, no matter what happens, it will still make a great story.I definitely recommend if you enjoy the borderlands style of humor and are looking for a good tale."

This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing rollercoaster.tl;dr-The game is wonderful, I love it to death.I'm no gaming efficianado, but if you like the Borderlands universe, and story driven games, go right on ahead and click that damn buy button (unless you can't, financially, in which case wait for a sale and click the dang button!)This game is fantastic, the story is wonderful. Lighthearted with dark undertones, with tie-ins to the actual games (mostly the pre-sequel, such as showing how and why Athena was captured).The game brings in some favorite characters, such as Scooter, Brick, and Mordecai. I especially enjoyed the meetings with Zer0, he's just really cool.You play as 2 characters who have these clashing personalities and backgrounds, who work together fantastically because of it. Rhys, the Hyperion stooge, and Fiona, the Pandoran hustler. The main cast extends to Rhys's best friend and Fiona's sister. The group's chemistry brings forth a je ne sais quoi. They aren't friends because they want to be, but because it is prudent. And that slowly changes as they get to know each other over the course of the game.As for gameplay, it's nothing really new. If you've played any of the Telltale games, or even any episodic point and click game, you got it in the bag. Except for maybe the greatest action sequence in the game, when you and some Vault Hunter go all powerranger in a giant robotThe music in the game is wonderful, well chosen pieces that you may not listen to in your spare time, but it will definitely suit the scene any time a track is played. From the sad moment songs, to the ""HELL YEAH! WE JUST KICKED SOME♥♥♥♥♥quot; moment songs, it all just comes together perfectly.There are negatives to this game, don't get me wrong. But in my opinion, they are far out-weighed by the sheer awesome that is stuffed deep into the game's soul. A short list of the major ones that bug me are:-The ending is a little confusing, and incredibly open ended. (Telltale has stated that a second season is entirely possible)-There are some moments that can go without a joke, but it doesn't totally ruin it...

I actually enjoyed this game far more than I thought I would, these 12.5 hours on record was all in one sitting when I was originally playing it late at night to fall asleep to it because I couldn't decide what to watch on Netflix. So expect your playthrough to be around this long. My only criticisms are that this game gives you many choices that give you the illusion of having a huge impact on the story, but subsequent playthroughs with different choices will have you finding that the story is pretty much the same no matter what you do, and only small changes occur as a result of your ""dramatic"" choices (having more money to buy something, someone says a silly line or a more serious one, etc etc.) Your choices definitely matter in the final scenario, and the game will tell you what choices you've made specifically to get this outcome, as well as what choices you could've made to have different, or better, outcomes. But this final moment in the story was the only time I felt like my choices actually mattered, and even then the ending is pretty much the same no matter the choices, the only real change is how that scenario plays out and with who.That being said, I still recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Borderlands story at full price. For anyone just interested in a funny and surprisingly ""more emotional than expected"" Telltale title, maybe wait until a discount before picking this one up, and you'll definitely be happy."

I would be thrilled to have a second season, as the ending is slightly ambiguous, and just because I really want to see more of these characters!

People who care more about gameplay2. People who do not like, or care for the Borderlands lore (Obviously)3. People who do not like Telltale games, but enjoyed BorderlandsExtrapolationFOR1a. Personally, I thought this game was fantastic. This is, understanding that I have played Borderlands 2, and the Pre-sequel. Another thing to note about the Borderlands in general is it's rather morbid sense of humor. Either you like it, or you don't. If you are interested in Borderlands, give this a shot.2a. This game is dark. It has a number of moments featuing intense scenes that are, of course treated with a fair amount of levity - in typical Borderlands fashion. The story itself is pretty solid, usually playing off of the more dark moments with comedic commentary in a sort of anime kind of style. Overall the story is solid, but definitely not with out it's cliches.3a. If you like Telltale then what you see is what you get. There's not much too it. Over all, very nicely animated - although filled with more cinematography then usual. Of course all in the Borderlands universe, and featuing strong well made charcters.4a. If you wished there was more lore, and focus on Pandora then you've come to the right place. This game gives you Pandora (and Hyperion) from a completely different prespective, and it's fantastic. Just note that you'll be exploring Pandora through the characters. There is no exposition to be had in this game.NOT FOR1b. The focus of this game is in the story, not the gameplay. As far as gameplay is concerned QTEs (Quick Time Events) and couple of very simple hacking minigames are about it.2b. Well, it's Borderlands. Space adventure. Ridiculous morbid comedy. Alien planet, and that's about it. Take it or leave it.3b. It's still a Telltale game. There is no actual shoot and loot in this game (Which is to be expected). You have choices, moral decisions all from the same Telltale formula we know and love.Final ThoughtsI liked the game. I did, in the end have some reservations about the ending, but outside of that thought it was pretty fantastic. If you want a meme answer ""This game made me feel emotions towards a Loader Bot"" would be the best response. Also, great music choices. Seriously go pick this up. It's worth your time, and money.Game RecomendationsIf you liked this game, like me I would recomend pretty much all the other Telltale games however listing The Walking Dead as a highlight just noting that The Walking Dead is very dark, and missing those moments of levity and back and forth character dialogue. I would also recomend Dangan Ronpa if you want a much heavier on the reading, much more Japanese story focused game with it's own share of ridiculous morbid humor"

There was not one scene, one character, one moment that didnt have me chuckling or on the edge of my seat with excitement.This is by far the best telltale use of quick time events, as well as the one with the least amount of glitches and frame rate drops, which makes it a mostly smooth ride through a ever twisting plot that keeeps throwing surise after surprise in your face.As soon as I completed the game I wanted to play it again immediately (and will) to see how the different choices play out, which is a huge plus for a game of this type. I wont know until I play through it again, but this story has the most potential to offer completely different outcomes than any of the other telltale game series.Its great to see telltale slowly take a genre that could othersise stagnate a bit  if they didnt, into territory that could show the way for story telling in computer games.

What makes Tales from the Borderlands shine are the facts it tells a really fun and engaging story, filled with likable characters, so many in fact that is surprising to an age of bland and bidimensional character development. If you are looking for a really funny game, set in an appropriate background with lovely characters, and don't mind the fact that its core mechanics are the same as any other recent Telltale game, then Tales from the Borderlands is definitely for you."

It had fun characters, fun action sequences (sort of a first for Telltale IMO although you could make the argument that Wolf Among Us had some good ones), and an interesting story.  This game is just straight up fun.  It's all about the journey, and it was cool that I had my older brother basically watch me play the entire game, enjoying it with me all the way."

The game does a good job in immersing you in the Borderlands world. For people who have already played the Borderlands games, you will find yourself at home with familiar characters and locations throughout the game.What makes this game different from most Telltale games is the comedy. While Borderlands games are renowned for its use of satire through its dialogue and character interactions, most Telltale games are rather morose and use that to invoke tension and drama in the narrative. Tales from the Borderlands strays away from Telltales normal narrative style and uses Borderlands trademark humor to create a more casual, yet enjoyable story.I think my only personal gripe is that Telltale releases these in episodic format. I usually just end up waiting until all episodes are released to play them all. because there is usually a big gap in between release dates of each episode that it feels somewhat disconnected returning to a game you played 3 months ago. Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this game and Telltale games in general.If you enjoy Telltale games, buy this. If you enjoy the Borderlands series, buy this. Heck, if you're just looking for a game with an enjoyable story and characters, buy this game. You really can't go wrong."

I've been a big Borderlands fan ever since the original game and I was intially skeptical about this game when it was first released.  But after I played through the first two episodes as well as the recently released third episode, boy, was I wrong.  This game is a must-have for Borderlands fans everywhere.  Telltale has worked with both Gearbox and 2k to expand on the Borderlands universe without destroying the already established storyline; something that most spinoff games fail to accomplish.  Each episode is crafted with expert story-telling and you really bond with these characters.  Not only that, these episodes serve as a ""pre-sequel"" between Borderlands 2 and the upcoming Borderlands 3.  At the ending of episode 3, for example, it shows how Athena got captured by Brick and Mordecai and how she was brought to Sanctuary for interrogation; AKA the introduction of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.Seriously, get this game"

It somehow manages to feel like somethign that would be directly in a Borderlands game with the style and the sense of humor. I only really saw anything about this game at Pax South when i saw Twitch do an interview while waiting in line to play a game infront of the booth but by god did they undersell how awesome this game is. Currently while i am writing this review episode 1-3 are the only ones that are out but they are amazing. This is a perfect example of a game that is easily carried by story and characters that so many devs fail to understand because they make stuff to complicated. I highly recomend buying this game

,Recommended,330830,13220808,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,NNGAMING,"I will be updating this review over the course of the season.Episode 1 review: This is coming from a guy who has NEVER played a single Borderlands game (I will be buying ""Game Of Thrones"" during the Steam holiday sale despite the fact I have heard news that Game Of Thrones is a game for fans of the ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" book series and/or the ""Game Of Thrones"" HBO TV show that it shares a canon with. BUT I have played Back To The Future (on PS3), The Walking Dead (Seasons 1, 400 Days, and 2) (on IOS and soon PC (in preperation for Season 3)), and The Wolf Among Us (Also on IOS and possibly on PC in the future)) and I have to say ""Episode 1: Zer0 Sum"" was the best debut episode Telltale has ever done (In my opinion as I have not played any Telltale game prior to Back To The Future.), Zer0 Sum was funny and action packed at the same time. As you've likely heard this episodic game has 2 protagonists: Rhys, a Hyperion employee who's goal is to be ""the next Handsome Jack"" (If you've played Borderlands 2 and/or Borderlands The Pre-Sequel you already know who he is.), and Fiona, a Con artist who can talk her way out of more situations than she can shoot her way out of. If you have played the previous Borderlands games, there will some familiar faces (Zer0 for example) in this episode, but you have no need to have played previous Borderlands games to enjoy Tales. ""Zer0 Sum"" is a little over 2 hours long, Telltale normally with The Walking Dead: Season 2 and The Wolf Among Us has made their episodes around 90 minutes so this is more in line with The Walking Dead: Season 1, episodes for that game series were around 2 hours long.Verdict for Episode 1: 8.5 out of 10 or 85% whatever your preference.Episode 2 review: SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED ""Episode 1: Zer0 Sum"" OR WATCHED  ""MARVEL'S AGENTS OF SHIELD"" UP TO SEASON 1 EPISODE 21: ""RAGTAG""!When I finished ""Episode 2: Atlas Mugged"" I had just experinced another 90 minutes of a cool blend of action, story, and of course comedy. This episode we step back into the shoes of Rhys and Fiona and the action picks up right where Episode 1 left off, unlike ""Game of Thrones Episode 2: The Lost Lords"" this episode acually had some plot progression, Rhys is dealing with the shocking revelation that Handsome Jack is in his head... and Vaughn's suprising upper body (no homosexuality I promise), and Fiona having a bounty on her head (due to her past as a con artist). This was more fun than Episode 1 was and gives more character devolopment to our main characters, if you watch the Agents of SHIELD TV show, I think a relationship explored this episode will remind you of Ward's relationship to John Garrett on that show (NOTE: I DON'T STAND WITH WARD! #NOWARDREDEMPTION ARC!). This episode leaves off on an interesting cliffhanger which will leave you excited for ""Episode 3: Catch a Ride""!Verdict for Episode 2: 9.0 out of 10 or 90% whatever your preference.Episode 3 review: SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED ""Episode 2: Atlas Mugged""!When I finished ""Episode 3: Catch a Ride"" I had just experienced yet another 2 hours of that cool blend of action, story, and comedy. This episode picks up right where Atlas Muggeed left off and once more sees us return to the perspectives of Rhys, who, in my playthrough, is still dealing with Handsome Jack being in his head and his ranting about Rhys choosing Fiona over Jack and starts falling in love with Sasha along the way, Rhysha is happening in my playthrough, and Fiona, who, in my playthrough, is developing an aspiration to become a Vault Hunter and is picking up a few tricks of the trade from Athena. This episode sees the introduction of Vallory (the queenpin that we heard about towards the end of Atlas Mugged and is seeming to be poised as the Big Bad of the season) and Gortys (a loveable robot who has already joined Clem and Lee from The Walking Dead and Rhys and Fiona from this game as one of my favourite Telltale characters). The characters spend a majority of the episode at a dome of sorts which delivers the most beautiful sights this series has seen so far, and split into 2 groups, Rhysha (I already ship it!) and Fiona and Athena. The episode ends with a cliffhanger that will leave you excited for where Telltale could take this season in Episode 4 and feels reminiscent of the cliffhanger of ""Telltale's The Walking Dead: Season 2: Episode 2: A House Divided"".Verdict for Episode 3: 9.5 out of 10 or 95% whichever you prefer!Episode 4 review: Coming whenever Telltale releases ""Episode 4: Escape Plan Bravo""!"

Mouse smoothing/acceleration/deceleration. I mean jeez, what's wrong with the developers who put this in by default and don't let the players turn it off?2. Unskippable scenes - even if you've already seen them - HEAVILY reduces the replayability value: I'm not sitting listeting to the same jokes (however good they might've been) for the second time, it's just a waste of time. It also makes getting ""bad endings"" (if there are such, dunno yet) or just making a mistake an offence punishable by having to watch all the cutscenes again. Not fun.3. QTEs and ""action"" sequences. I don't see any point in them. QTEs are SO annoying, and SO pointless and just not fun hwatsoever. ""Action"" sequences are... well, they are ""okay"", but that's it, I personally don't think they add anything to a visual novel, and it's essentially a visual novel, as the whole value of this ""game"" is in it's story and that's it.4. Having no proper save-load mechanics is a poor choice for a visiual novel (this is aggravated by the 1st point of non-skippability of ""seen"" content.5. The artwork is phenomenal, but the animation quality is a mess sometimes. Some emotions on the character's face look either untimely, or very unnatural, or plain stupid.All in all I would say that I am having fun with this game, but jeez, the developers did everything they could to make this game less fun than it could have been without the things I've enumerated, they've made almost everything to spoil the fun they've put in that game. I don't get why.TellTaleGames could learn a couple things about the VNs' production from their Japanese colleagues like KID, Success or Nitroplus."

That would be fairly disingenuous, but I can still sing Tales From The Borderlands' praises from the mountaintops. While it does help quite a bit to have the prior Borderlands games, especially the second and the Pre-Sequel, under one's belt for context, Tales From The Borderlands is perfectly playable and loveable if experienced on its own.Instead of making things a solo run, Tales From The Borderlands bounces your point of view and control between Rhys, a Hyperion up-and-comer, and the Pandoran con artist Fiona, telling different aspects of how their fates intertwined and, in many cases, somewhat conflicting accounts of what went down while they were together. Despite their differences in capabilities, gameplay doesn't shift too violently between their segments, and the story matches the mechanics' ease of transition the entire way through.As has become tradition for the Borderlands franchise, a great deal of the enjoyment of Tales From is wrapped up in the characters. Both Rhys and Fiona come equipped with plucky sidekicks of a sort, in the form of Fiona's sister Sasha and Rhys' coworker Vaughn, with plenty of other faces, familiar and new, popping in as events proceed. All of the characters give you a reason to care about them, even if that care takes the form of loathing, as their stories weave a rich tapestry with a wide variety of outcomes. As it stands, I've only taken the time to see one of those potential outcome sets, but even in discussion, I've heard several courses of events that differed wildly from my own playthrough, and I'm quite aware I missed a few things.The visual style of Tales From The Borderlands matches perfectly with the precedent laid down by Gearbox in the first-person versions of the games, as does the audible side of things. Licensed music is used just as adeptly in Tales From The Borderlands as it is in prior Borderlands games, but this time, there's a new licensed track in every (or almost every) episode of the game. Given the slower pace of an adventure game, the action in Tales From The Borderlands doesn't quite match that of the core Borderlands franchise, but the quick time events this time around often demand a bit more quickness than players of other Telltale titles may expect. It's not quite a match for frenetic shooting and looting, but it puts in a good effort while still feeling game-appropriate.There's only so much that can be said while avoiding potential spoilers, but I will mention that I was legitimately crying tears of joy during the climactic sequences of the fifth episode. Everything you do up to that point hints at what's about to happen, but even then, you're not entirely let in on how things will go down until they are, indeed, going down.Again, Borderlands fan or not, this is absolutely worth a slot in your Steam library. Give it a little love and it'll love you right back."

Was the first tell tale game I have played so it was a bit different for me.BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEMS first off the higher your screen resolution the laggier your mouse will become. This has nothing to do with how good your graphics card is or anything its just a problem with the game so if it causes issues drop the resolution done a bit and that should fix it (But seriously TTG this shouldn't even be a issue at all)Second problem is I played this all in one sitting (granted it was a long 10 hr sitting but hey rainy day amusement) and right near the end of the 5th episode lines of dialogue where just plain missing. I won't say where just to make it spoiler free but since I played it all in one sitting without a single issue with the voices its safe to say my audio settings and everything was fine so its purely a problem with the games. Considering this game is pretty much completely based on dialogue and very little on game play I think its a pretty big problem.And while making choices is fun and all its not really clear in what context you’re going to say something, Sometimes when the pair are together you’re not even sure whos going to be saying the part you just clicked. But that being said your choices really don't have a huge impact on the story.Apparently its all cannon but I'm sure if they make BL3 they will explain a little of what happened. So I don't think there is any harm skipping this if its not your thing. But seriously that voice bug really ruined it for me, if that didn't happen I would probably be all praises. Shame there is only a yes or no recommendation. If you’re really into borderlands and cannot get enough of it then yeah get it. If its not a big thing for you then probably no loss skipping it"

Both get caught up in some messy business which would take them on an adventure across Pandora. The game was fantastic and made me feel many emotions throughout. It could make me laugh so loud, my room shaked. It could deeply sadden me unlike any other game has before.

But if you like Borderlands and if you've enjoyed games like The Walking Dead from Telltale, then this game is a good fit for you.I really enjoyed this game.  Entertaining characters, NPC or not.  And the fact that you controlled two different characters at different times means that you can choose to be all good, all bad, or have the characters insult each other throughout the game if they are on different wavelengths (I went for the insults).Again, if you don't like Telltale games, I'm not going to convince you otherwise.

This game is incredibly hilarious. There are even some very sweet moments as well. I was engrossed in the story throughout.As far as gameplay goes, there isn't much of a game here. It is more of an interactive story with lots and lots of dialogue choices and quick time events throughout all 5 episodes. Being an interactive story is not a bad thing in this case because the writing and voice acting is so amazingly good. I can't believe I'm saying that a video game was really well written.

This is the third (not counting TWD as two) of thier games I've played, the others being The Walking Dead 1 and 2 and Wolf Among Us. This one is based in the Borderlands world and it's great to be able to play the story in familiar places (more so from BL2 though). There are also old faces in there to chat with including Zero and Athena but the story is mainly based around 2 people, with two extra sidekicks along for the ride.I'm not going to go too much into the story but a quick run over is that you are two, low level people in the world of Borderlands, trying to get out of the rut they're in by any means. He works for Hyperion and is sick of being stood on, she is a con artist, ready to fool anyone of their money. They meet up when a deal goes wrong and the story goes on from there.The game is more of an interactive TV program than a full on action game. You watch the story, making choices about what's said and things they do with everything you do and say having a knock on effect at some point. It's not as cruel as The Walking Dead though, that would kill off people if you farted in the wrong direction. Every-so-often you'll take part in QuickTime events, where you'll have to press the right key, or mouse button in time to perform an action. if you get it wrong, it can change the whole story, or you'll die and be able to get another crack.The writing is amazing, I would truly watch this is it was on TV. It's funny, sad, action packed and emotional with some great music and songs thrown in for good measure. The voice acting to makes it that extra bit special with every one of those involved being bang on the markIf you've not played a Tell Tales game before, you won't go wrong with this one as a starter.GET IT NOW."

Just love the episode the only bummer is waiting for the next one to come out. Oh lastly this episode seemed longer than the walking dead......highly recommend this even if you have no clue on the borderlands lore.Review update.Just finished the game - best game of 2015. The 'finger shootout' best scene on any form of media ever! You get so invested into these characters when this scene comes up it is a pure golden moment. Would recommend playing this right through. Leaving months between episodes does not do the story arc or characters justice. Binge gaming at its best! Highly recommended!

If you are familiar with, and enjoy their previous games then you will certainly enjoy this one. If you have never heard of Telltale, they make decision driven story games. You play the main character who is sent forth on a story where you make the calls and the relationships you forge determine the fate of the world you are in. This is the basic formula for all their games. This one takes place in the Borderlands universe where you play as a Hyperion employee trying to climb his way up the corporate ladder, and a Pandoran con artist trying to get by. Their paths cross and hijinx ensue. If you are a fan of Borderlands, check it out. If not, play Wolf Among Us."

The common criticism of Tell Tale's more recent ""adventure"" games (such as The Walking Dead & The Wolf Among Us) is they only offer a slight illusion of choice. None of the choices really effect the narrative in a meanigful way. While that is certainly still true here I always find that as long as the games are well paced and written I can still enjoy them for what they are. And Tales is certainly well written and the acting is spot on.

Tales from the Borderlands takes everything cool about Pandora and makes it better, only this time you'll see it through the eyes of genuinely nice and relatable characters instead of those of our classic vault hunters, though you'll get to meet some old faces...Don't get me wrong, this would probably be a great experience even if you didn't know the whole story but I still highly suggest playing Borderlands 1 and 2 if you haven't already, both because they're great games in their own right and because they'll let you enjoy Tales from the Borderlands much more.Also this got the voice of Brock Samson in it, 'nuff said, buy this as soon as you can."
