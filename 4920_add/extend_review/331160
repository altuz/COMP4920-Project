,Recommended,331160,14699574,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Gamaroc,"SERIOUS NOTE - Many people have said this game crashes. I have figured out why. This game appears to only work with NVIDIA graphics cards. Integrated graphics cards causes the game to crash when you load the game. I've tested this on a desktop with a GT 640 and a laptop with both a GTX 1050 and an Intel 630 graphcis card. The desktop can play the game, and so can the laptop, but by using the NVIDIA card, otherwise the game crashes when using the Intel graphics card. Make sure you run the game with an NVIDIA card. I'm not sure about AMD, to be honest. Anywho...Seriously, this is one of the best Disney game I've ever played! And one of the best driving games I’ve ever played :DI love this game!The game is about Lightning McQueen and Cars.The graphics are great. Quite appealing if you ask me. The town looks amazing with a lot of cars roaming around town, the best part is smashing into them and watching them fly and say funny quotes! The town looks like how you would expect it to look in the film. The characters look accurate to what they look like in the film which is pretty cool. The voice acting was totally awesome and pretty funny. For example, as McQueen overtakes a racer, he says ""objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear"", that cracked me up!The game has free roam (best Disney Cars game IMO), you can drive as Lightning McQueen around 3 different areas including Radiator Springs, what I enjoy doing is ramming into other cars and watching them fly while they say funny things xDFree roam is pretty much calm and fun to explore!The story doesn't really cover the film's story, it's kind of based on what happened after the story, so if you haven't watched the film then this game has got some spoilers for you. Spoilers, get it? The wing on the back of a car...?There are a lot of fun tracks to race on and a variety of characters to choose from, from Lightning McQueen to Wingo, and a bunch of paint jobs to customise them with. The characters have different stats like top speed, acceleration, handling etc. The characters' personalities fit perfectly to the film, and they do make races lively with funny and memorable quotes: Like McQueen’s ""KA-CHOW!"" phrase xD   He says it in different ways, he shouts it and whispers it and some of them sound funny to me.The bad thing about character selection is that there are some cars (like Luigi, Sarge and Fillmore etc.) who can race with you, but you can't race as them, so that kinda sucks :(There are fun mini games added to the side, like Mater's Tractor Tipping game, where you have to wake up tractors without waking up getting caught by Frank, and also Sheriff's Pursuit, where you have to pursuit cars while they are moving fast. They are harder than they sound, but they are enjoyable. The bad part is that they are too long and take too much time, like around 10-15 minutes.There are also Piston Cup races, each being 12 laps around. There is also a pit stop mini game with Guido as he changes the tires and refuels the car. But you could only play as the race cars in Piston Cup races, like Lightning McQueen, or Chick Hicks and Doc Hudson etc. not Mater or Ramone (lol) But I guess it makes sense, hence it being a Piston Cup race.Now onto the important part, the gameplay. The cars drive at different speeds and the drifting is handy, although it doesn't look like the drifting in the film, hence the ""turn right to go left"" quote. The wheel still goes in the direction you want to go, so the car just looks like it's making a hard turn instead of actually drifting. The gameplay is really fun, smooth and easy to master each track with various shortcuts.However sometimes the car decides to flip and go upside down if you try to crash yourself, it sounds funny and it makes up for it because it is funny lol.  Making contact with other racers will make your car slower which isn't what I'd expect from a racing game, but they do talk after collision which is a good thing.This game has controller support, so you can play 2 player split-screen multiplayer with your friend, which is a pretty fun addition.This game is friendly towards kids alright? So don't go wrecking other cars lol, because they don't show damage marks like scratches or dents.Or if you want to get straight into the action, use cheat codes to unlock all characters and race tracks and there you have it :Dbtw there are other cheats like unlimited boost which is fun!The soundtrack is amazing by the way, like awesome tracks from Bruno Coon and great music like ""Here I Am"" by the Explosion, and ""Free Ride"" from Edgar Winter Group, the soundtrack is addictive so listen to it if you dare XDThe only bad thing about this PC version (Steam version) is the lighting at night.Because the game is old and wasn't really updated, when playing mini games and races in night, it's too dark to see or drive, which is annoying and is preventing me from fully completing the game. So, I hope that gets fixed soon.The game is pretty and awesome, quite classic! The graphics are pretty good for a 2006 game. I first played it on PS2 and was addicted to it due to its awesomeness! I recommend this to any Cars fan, or racing fan. Because this game is fun!"

,Recommended,331160,32745019,Posted: 24 June,all,KirbyFan45,"I have one main word when it comes to this game: NOSTALGIA!!!!! No, seriously! This was one of my favorite Gamecube games growing up. Although I did grow up with the norm for these like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Mario Sunshine, I usually go unique and play games like this and MAN is this good! I remember a lot from when I was growing up and playing this again brung it all back! This is an open world game that is also a racing game. Think of the Crash Time series, but more for kids. In the game, you start a prologue race that takes place in Lightning McQueen's dream. As you probably guessed so far, this is based on the movie by Pixar (more specifically, it takes place after, and does it well) and I am not the type of person who are like, ""Des gam ez bezd on moove, muzt suk,"" or something like that, and this game is further evidence. After Lightning's dream, you start the game for real, and you get so many options for play. You can do normal races, minigames, a side quest like thing where you collect stamps, and even Piston Cup races once you get enough Trophy points. In game, you can get regular points that act as a currency to buy things for the Arcade and 2 Player modes as well as some secrets.Now I should go in detail. Normal races are just that, races. You go pass people, do jumps, find shortcuts, and use boosts once you get them. Minigames can be anything from Tractor Tipping, a stealth like game, or collecting tires with Luigi, where you collect tires. This game has variety so far, and we have one more mode to go, and that is the Piston Cup races. These are more like NASCAR races where you go in an oval at high speeds. In the middle of a Piston Cup race (only in Story Mode) you do a pitstop minigame where depending on the time, you can get a good speed boost, but the inputs can get confusing since they show the button number and not what the number is. Now, a good game can't be complete without some great music, and this game delivers! This game features old time music with modern twists (modern as in around 2006). Seriously, 2006 was the time for great video game music. Yes, even for Sonic 06. I mean, c'mon, you HAVE to admit the game at least had an awesome soundtrack. To make this soundtrack even more amazing, it even has licensed songs for it's style. I really recommend listening to the music on YouTube is you can or even buying the soundtrack that is licensed.Now, I praised the game like crazy so far, but like everything, it has issues. First, the games graphics are based on the Gamecube graphics and not the XBOX360 graphics. That may be fine since it makes me more nostalgic, but this just seems weird. Also, this version seems to be emulated since there can be some graphical errors found, mostly in character's eyes and on certain textures. Like I said earlier, since the button's number is displayed and not the actual number, you can sometimes get confused, normally in minigames that don't use the normal controls that you mapped (in fact, when I started, the numbers confused me so much, I got my steering reversed, as in I somehow got my lefts confused with my rights. Don't ask). Also, the game is easy as heck. Once you get in first place, you basically won since you go too fast and end up like, 33 seconds ahead of 2nd. However, these are more minor things and the good HEAVILY outweighs the bad. I recommend this to everyone, especially people who grew up with the game on consoles. I got this from the Disney Mega Wave 2 (or whatever it's called) and it was worth it! This game is godlike and is perfect for racing game beginners and people who want a good local multiplayer experience."

,Recommended,331160,29620689,Posted: 31 January,all,Yoshiman716,"Wow... This game is just fantastic. When I first got this, it was my piece of junk PS2 that had a really hard time reading discs, making it really hard to play for longer than an hour. But over 10 years later, with it on my computer, it's even better than I remember. Let's start with some positives:The game is excellently designed. I never found one track that I deemed unfair or too difficult. Even the Piston Cup races were a ton of fun, and that's saying a lot for tracks that are just straightaways and then a left turn.The free-roam is awesome. Seriously, I can drive around the HUB worlds for hours and not get bored.Now onto some negatives:Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the minigames. Some like Sheriff's Hot Pursuit, High Speed Heist, and Lightning Strikes Back are at best OK, but others like Tractor Tipping and Mater's Backwards Lesson get way too hard for their own good, and Doc's Lesson: Powerslide is just way too short. Also, Lizzie's Postcard Hunt is one of the worst scavenger hunts I've ever had to go through in a video game.The control can be kind of awkward sometimes. I occasionally found myself just being flung against the wall for no reason, not turning as sharply as I wanted to even though I was powersliding, and it can just feel really slippery at times.Now this is just a nitpick (and it might just be my computer), but a lot of the textures, mainly the eyelids on the characters (especially Mack), will start flickering at random. The framerate will just suddenly drop at random as well, but again, this might just be my computer.Overall, Cars is a great racing game that definitely worth the £15, and even though it does have a lot of problems, I think you should try it if you haven't already.My rating: 7.5/10"
76561198144212261,Recommended,331160,34439515,Posted: 23 August,all,Buttlerr,"A great game that I enjoy. I remember playing this as a kid, and I was excited when I recently found out that it was available on Steam. This game has great races and mini-games. The controls can sometimes feel floaty and weird, but it is easy to get used to (I used a PS4 controller). The hub world, consisting of Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, and Tailfin Pass, give you this sense of exploration. Not to mention you can hit npc cars in these hubs which can be very hilarious if you are doing this with someone watching you. You can choose a difficulty before starting Story Mode, which are Rookie, Pro, Champion, and another mode that is the most challenging that you need to unlock (I don't know how to unlock it or the name of it). The cutscenes have original voice actors. You can also get bonus content like characters (note: unlocked characters can't be used in Story Mode), paint jobs for characters, art, deleted cutscenes, and other videos, but you need to pay with points you receive in-game. The characters you unlock can only be used in Arcade and Multiplayer. Arcade is where you can choose a character and paint job and choose any mini-game or race that you have unlocked while playing in Story Mode. Multiplayer is basically just Arcade but with multiplayer. Multiplayer is split screen, and there is no online play. The only downfall is the sometimes floaty and weird controls that can take some getting used to and the difficulty that keeps on switching from easy to difficult, then back to easy and cycle repeats. Overall, it is a great game that anyone can enjoy, and I am more than happy to call it one of my favorite racing games."

This game runs at 30fps with no option to turn it off and crashing into things always gives a slight pause in the hub world. You should check out Mater National if you are interested in this. Most of the game is the same but it does not support widescreen. Though it is 60fps! with much better textures. More hub world and new tracks. I perfer over this older verion.That being said the story and racing is all very good. The hub world is also a nice touch.I still recommend this game because it is fun.

Unfortunately, only a few races worked, and I would not recommend this game. I only wanted to relive my childhood, but I guess my childhood will have to remain as it is."

Unfortunately, I lost the disc somewhere in my old house, and I never found it ever again. After almost a decade of searching, I've finally found it here on steam, and it's just as good as it has always been."

,Recommended,331160,34061453,Posted: 6 August,all,Xark,"Nice little game full of nostalgia if you played it as a kid already!The story is very cheap and leans a little bit on the movie.The races aren't challenging at all, but quite fun, because I personaly think the tracks are good designed.There is a quite big world (for 2006) to explore!When you haven't experienced this game as a child then I guess you never will and the game isn't something for you"
