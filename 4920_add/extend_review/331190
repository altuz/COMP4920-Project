,Recommended,331190,18012742,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,Noven,"So far Master Spy has been recommended by all 18 to review before me. Why toss my hat in at this point? Because this game deserves it. The release was too recent to call it a hidden gem, but it's definitely a gem that deserves more positive reviews.Chances are if you've navigated to this page you have some interest in this type of game. If so, I have only one thing to ask before wholeheartedly recommending this game. Are you very put off by having to die many times in the process of learning and then pulling off heavily execution-intensive plans? If not, get this game. Everything about the game works extremely well, particularly the soundtrack and controls - both important in such a rigorous platformer. It is true what others have said: Master Spy is frustrating because of how demanding it is, but almost never unfair.It took me probably a little long to beat Novice Mode at 5.7 hours, as I kept grinding through levels even when my execution was slacking badly, but there are harder modes and a little extra content already revealed to me so far. If you're worried about playtime, I will definitely be playing more of this game, and even at this point I would definitely say it is worth $10."
,Recommended,331190,32071008,Posted: 30 May,all,Valborg,"I really love the idea and the aesthetics, but it is far too brutal, even for a game advertised as such. Compare this to a game like Odallus: The Dark Call, or even the original Castlevania, and you will find that the difficulty here is just a tad bit too artificial and one dimensional -- there is no significant pattern detection or rhythm to the gameplay, no bag of tricks or movesets to explore and permute, just a big ""How fast can you react?"" thrown at you level after level. Games like Super Hexagon are appropriate for that type of difficulty, but I don't want to punish myself in a narrative game.UPDATE: After being notified that there is a classic cheat code (up up down down left right left right) on the start screen that unlocks, among other things, all of the cutscenes, I must say that my largest concern with the game has been addressed. It is still a shame that I lack the fortitude of will to master Master Spy, but maybe in the future I will come back and try it once more. Now that I can try any portion of any level at will, and can freely enjoy the story and music of the game, I am changing my recommendation with the understanding that this is still an INCREDIBLY demanding, challenging, and brutal game."
,Recommended,331190,32356129,Posted: 11 June,all,fetty wasp,An absolute gem of a game. Yes it's difficult but the failures never feel cheap. Every time I got caught I knew excatly what I did wrong and what I should have done to avoid it. This makes completing every level feel so very rewarding.Don't listen to the people who gave this game a negative review for being too hard. I'm a very average gamer and I managed to finish it just fine.Add in great retro graphics and an excellent atmospheric soundtrack and this game is steal (har har).
76561198040295426,Recommended,331190,17953471,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,diegzumillo,"Getting one thing out of the way: calling this a stealth game, in my opinion, is a bit of a stretch. Sure, under the hood stealth is avoidance and timing so the line is blurred. But this one definitely belongs alongside super meat boy and other high precision platformers rather than stealth titles. But don't let this turn you off on the game, it's really fun to play.The comparison to super meat boy is a good one. It learns from it. Repetition is good when it doesn't waste our time. So you die and instantly respawn. And you will die. A lot. In one chapter I died more than 400 times. We have a wide spectrum of mechanics to keep the game fresh, the invisibility cloak makes you invisible and slower, some enemies move back and forth, some only move when you have your back to them, others instantly jump at you independent of cloak etc. You learn as you go.My main criticism is that these levels are quite big. This kind of gameplay of high precision, difficult, repetitive, works better with short levels. There is a checkpoint system in the game but I don't find it nearly generous enough. And it is awkward to say the least. It saves when you 'pick' a file object. So naturally it disappears after you pick it up. Then you start asking yourself 'should I have picked this up after doing something else?' then you discover that there is a super hard section ahead and you picked the file (saved) before a less tough one, so every time you respawn you have to redo the less hard section first. You could reset the level and pick up the checkpoints in a better order but that requires replaying some of the level, which can be quite the pain.I'm still playing the game, cursing and yelling as I go, but I always return to it. It's very compelling! Worth buying."

I'm rarely compelled to write reviews but this game deserves a lot more love than its getting.When I think back on it, in every way this seems like a game I wouldn't enjoy. I'm not good at precision platformers and this is an extremely difficult one. But the incredible level design and instant refresh made it not only tolerable but enjoyable. I didn't get mad when I would die, it was just a puzzle I was figuring out and getting closer and closer with each attempt. And you will die a lot. For example, in the 5th and final act, I died a total of 863 times.Even though I got an F grade on all 5 acts, I feel like a badass for finishing it.The aesthetic is great, the cutscenes and soundtrack are absolutely incredible. I will be purchasing the soundtrack as soon as I finish typing this review.This game certainly isn't for everyone, but I can't speak highly enough of it. I'll certainly be watching for what Turbogun does next. Thanks for making this great game TG!"

It's harder than Super Meat Boy, but I don't feel like the game is unfair. The controls are tight and responsive. The stages are sort of puzzle-like in that you have to figure out how to navigate through traps. Stylistically the game is beautiful, I really like the 80s Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes. The music is really good too."
76561198129143039,Recommended,331190,28958616,Posted: 2 January,all,Zerotoinfinity,"Pre-review advice: At least buy the soundtrack. Buy it no matter what. I sincerely doubt you'll regret it.Master Spy is primarily a precision platformer, secondarily a stealth platformer, and also really, really, really really reallyreallyREALLY hard.You play as Master Spy, a (not very imaginative) master spy who excels in infiltrating places with the help of his invisibility trench coat. This comes in handy, as he is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and will surrender to any man who glances at him sideways from behind a panel of reinforced glass, and also because the places he has to break into are [insert comparison to Fort Knox's security here]. You've been hired to recover a data reel which is apparentlysoimportant that World War Three isn't even the worst case scenario. Your contract will take you to many places, like mansions, yachts, assassin dens, and dangerous factories, and there are really interesting and well done cutscenes in between each to continue the story.Master Spy inhabits a universe where apparently you get infinite mulligans, and only the one where you get a hole-in-one  and complete the level will count as far as everyone around you is concerned. God, however, is watching the whole time. At the end of each mission, He grades you based on how long you took and the number to times he had to bail you out.If you're really bad/careless/reckless like me, then you will probably receive something like this after completing a mission (this was my grade for the third one):Completed in: 59:35Grade: FTimes Caught: 507 timesGrade: FI know, right? But trust me, if you are willing to stick with it, it's totally worth it. And it's not like Master Spy itself is particularly unfair. The controls are super tight and responsive, and I never felt like I died due to confusing or unresponsive controls. The threat is the environment, not your own ability to navigate it. There are at least two varieties of dog, assassins, tigers, sharks, rent-a-cops, real security guards, cut-rate Men In Black, psycho robots, and actual security agents blessed with the mystical gift of actually being attentive to their jobs. I haven't ever even played many platformers in general, especially not hardcore precision platformers of this style. Despite this, Master Spy took me ~5 hours to complete, which isn't too bad really. Granted, I was playing on novice, which provides in-level checkpoints to make it easier.At any rate, Master Spyispossible, and almost always fair. It requires dedication like any other difficult game, but it isn't out to get you. If you aren't keen on the game after I put up my statistics of one of the missions (it is real, I swear), then just buy the soundtrack instead. I've already said this, I know, but it's important.P.S: The dev of this game is super involved and attentive to the community, which isn't necessarily a reason to buy it, but it is very cool. It says a lot that they put in so much time to respond to player feedback and such."
,Recommended,331190,23879375,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,William Shakesman,"It's Meat Boy with a cloaking device. I should hate it. The cloaker, which slows you but makes you invisible to any death trap that will kill you if it sees you, more or less guarantees you will be doing awful, fiddly jump-decloak-grab-cloak-land thumb gymnastics over and over until you perfect. The level gimmicks are all hugely different but you can find all the usual sins in one or two places: Exceedingly long trap reset wait times (Most levels are timed for speed running but there is at least one I can't figure out how to do anything but wait for.), risky runs that require frame perfect entry despite the fact it's completely on rails and there's no real reason to demand that annoying level of precision. And then the game proceeds to pretend to insult you by rating you on how much you died at a trial and error frustration platformer. May as well rate me on how many bullets I fire in Gears of War, bro. Worse, there's no tutorial at all, not even a hint (The ONLY time you get one is in world 3 to show you a door unlock switch. I thought at this point the developer was making fun of me.), you don't even know about your weird flippy mid-air jump or what it could possibly be used for, and a few traps are going to just kill you over and over until you figure out that maybe they aren't detecting what you think... like maybe it's detecting movement instead of you...?I mean, this is all awful, but it's still some of the best I've played of the subgenre. The spy theme of the game is effortlessly cool in a Golgo 13 badass style. The traps are extremely well-varied, such that each world and each room manages to have its own identity, as opposed to Meat Boy's ""the one with one square wide jumps between saws vs. the one with one square wide WALL JUMPS between saws"". The controls are pretty tight, no Meat Boy sliding or physics based wall jump nonsense. Most of the tougher rooms don't feel on rails. Several are, yes, but the more interesting rooms seem to be fairly open on ways to complete them, at least with regards to the order of jumps you need to make. Some of the late game traps are kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but there's nothing here you can't do so long as you can learn some simple thumb gymnastics for jump-decloak-cloak.The music is pretty good, the art is great, and the cutscenes are extremely cool, again, in a Golgo 13 style.Overall, this is a very solid entry in a crowded subgenre. There is a lot of care in this to make each level unique and interesting. It's certainly a worthwhile purchase."

The music totally brings the cut scenes and game play to life (Mission 3's song is amazing. Thank you RAC!). The game play is just about the right amount of difficulty (challenging but not so difficult that you want to quit). At one point I was stuck in the game and had to use the steam forums to discover there is a double jump mechanic. I highly reccomend this game and can't wait to see what the developers create next!

The rooms never devolved into giant puzzles and I felt like I was getting through them as the Master Spy instead of sitting and analyzing a big multi screened puzzle.  I can really think of only one sequence that required a lot of percision on my part, the rest of the game is just you and the Spy.* The soundtrack is also fantastic, and if you like the old Ninja Gaiden Nes cutscenes then you'll love the ones in Master Spy."

The comparison to Super Meat Boy is apt. It is also very pretty, with unwavering attention to its aesthetic (in both visuals and sound design) and a good soundtrack to boot.My only complaint is that a few level sequences start with challenges blocking the player and you need to wait for them to move out of the way to begin. This increases time spent waiting around, which, when you've died 20+ times in a level, can add up."

Master Spy fills that need very well. Like Hotline Miami, the controls are extremely simple to learn, but the variety of traps, enemies, and situations keeps the game from ever feeling stale. The game is fun, the music is excellent (and the soundtrack worth purchasing) and the nostalgic, Ninja Gaiden-style cutscenes are well-made.

It has absolutely zero combat in the game (besides cutscenes), so if you're looking for a game that abstains from combat then look no further. The game is agreeably difficult, but do not let that deter you as it is not done in such a way that would rob a person of that triumphant feeling that comes from overcoming a challenge.I honestly would love to see some more platformer games from TURBOGUN (Master Spy 2, hint hint), you guys are really responsive to feedback and quite obviously know how to put together an amazing platform game. It's jam packed with nostalgic feelings for those who may have been gaming in the 80s-90s but also brings a crisp platforming experience for everyone.The music is absolutely stunning as well, André Allen Anjos is brilliant."

The game is fast paced for a precision platformer, introducing elements like invisibility, double jumping and much more. The game not only demands you take in your environment but also be able to navigate it deftly and without getting caught. Don't think stealth game however, the game requires you to move fast and sometimes to improvise on the spot to avoid detection. That being said the game is not easy, in fact in a moment of desperation near the end I reached out to devs for some help and they were more than happy to oblige me, which was fantastic because the ending was amazing. That brings me to another thing, the cut scenes and story are another strong point for the game, the pixel animation is fantastic and the plot and characters are just kitschy enough to make you giggle at times. By and far one of the best indie games I've played so far this year."
,Recommended,331190,25810855,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Grody,"Master Spy is an extremely challenging puzzle platformer with stealth elements.You assume the role of the titular Master Spy and must infiltrate a plethora of trap-filled compounds, evading state of the art security measures armed only with a prototype invisibility cloak and your acrobatic abilities. Any contact with the variety of environmental hazards in this game will kill you, and being seen by any security guards will fail the level, so there are a number of unique challenges revolving around fast and precise platforming and trap evasion while constantly under pressure of being detected by guards. While the game is 'fair' in the sense that you could theoretically make it through the entire thing without ever dying to something you couldn't see coming, unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how masochistic you are) several of the levels in this game feel just barely possible to complete, requiring incredible speed and accuracy with absolutely no room for error. Some of the later levels in particular are infuriating and almost had me dropping the game entirely. If you persevere however, you'll likely experience the extreme satisfaction of overcoming all the odds stacked against you, and in between every chapter you're rewarded with some extremely stylish and well-animated cutscenes which progress the story.The presentation of this game is absolutely top-notch, with some clean and detailed retro graphics, upbeat and catchy music, varied environments with immense background detail, and a very simple yet engaging plot portrayed through fluidly animated cutscenes. All of this comes together to create a very impressive and enjoyable game that clearly had a lot of love and dedication poured into it. In some areas it can be hard to distinguish interactable platforms from the background/foreground, but this only becomes an issue in a very small handful of levels, and is hardly a persistent problem.Overall, Master Spy is a frustrating yet enjoyable platformer flowing with style and charm. The game cultivates the feel of being an expert espionage agent, not through indepth stealth mechanics, but through the act of fluidly breezing through deadly security setups with speed and finesse, where one misstep will spell failure and you're constantly under pressure, all set to the background of a smooth and cool spy soundtrack. It is a rather short game, but it's also pretty cheap and I feel warrants the price tag, and all the levels are replayable. If you're just looking to burn a few hours with an engaging puzzle platformer with high difficulty, you'll probably get your money's worth. Just be sure to brace yourself for some serious anger."

This game is amazing! It's controls are simple, but what it lacks in complexity with controls, it more than makes up for with complexity in gameplay, much like the old style of video games this gem is based off of. Basically, the first level starts out relativley simple, getting you used to the cloaking and stealth aspects of the game. It forces you to learn what traps do what and how to avoid them by a bit of trial and error. I find this system MUCH better than outright telling you or forcing you through a tutorial, because it lets the player feel like they figured it out themselves and earned it. With regards to death or getting, the game is very generous, but in the right ways. Each time you get to a checkpoint, a nice little beep happens. There are checkpoints every one or two screens or so, so death won't set you back to far. Worried it sounds a bit too easy? It's not! This game is so generous with checkpoints because each area is very challenging. I've only played on normal mode so far and it's very difficult, but there's a harder difficulty as well. Pretty much, this game forces you to figure out how to get through a room's traps and guards, then use quick reflexes and timing to get through; it's a beautiful blend of puzzle solving and skill. Gameplay-wise I find this game to be nearly perfect (something VERY rare for me to say!). Now that I've shared my thoughts on the most important aspect, I'll move on to the more aesthetic parts of the game. The soundtrack is amazing! Definitley pick it up if you enjoy the music in the trailer. The graphics are very stylized to look like an old DOS game or something, and the virtual screen is curved to simulate the curve of an old monitor. The graphics are beautiful in their own way, and add some mystique to the game (perfect for a spy game!). The cutscenes, music, and sound effects work together very well to set a mysterious atmosphere. I have next to no complaints (again VERY rare for me to say). As someone who enjoys old NES games and a good challenge, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game."

I bought it for full price, even playing through the first 3 missions in 2 hours (on Novice) I’ve got my money’s worth.  Unlike Mario and Meat Boy, the controls are tight, which is necessary.  Now for the difficulty: I don’t know why people compare it to I Want to Be the Guy/Boshy.  This game requires precision, but not does not feature the brain-numbing pixel-perfect jumps in Boshy.  I realize that the game would be much harder without checkpoints, but the same can be said about playing Boshy on Hardon-mode.  I feel it’s hard to compare to Super Meat Boy (a game I really liked) because it’s a totally different style.  In my opinion, the fun part about SMB is blasting through a level as fast as possible, while in Master Spy the satisfaction comes from figuring out the perfect way to make it through the level without getting caught.My only critique is that in some levels, as far as I could tell, it was not always possible to “one cycle” the room – you might have to wait a little bit for traps/enemies to move.   But this is a minor complaint compared to the great soundtrack, graphics, story and gameplay."

That. Soundtrack. It made me come back after I got tired of a certain level in chapter 3, made me get back in there because I just wanted to hear it again. And I did.

Even the slightest, errant twitch will be your death.- Walking into a room with only a split-second to react before a guard, trap, or dog totals you isn't the fun kind of difficulty. It's a CHEAP SHOT.- I couldn't get past the scrolling search-lights in the second mission.- Starvation of checkpoints means you'll be re-tracing your steps. Over and over and over and over and OVER.- I understand a spy's job is to infiltrate, not assassinate, but SOME kind of takedown move or gadget to use on guards would be nice.- No tutorial - if there were any moves beyond ""cloak/uncloak"" and ""jump,"" I wasn't aware of them.- The grading system just rubs salt in the wound after you've been caught numerous times due to the aforementioned ruthless difficulty.Final Analysis: Fun concept, but the brutal difficulty (with no easy/normal mode) will be a severe turn-off to most players."

A key mechanic in the game is a cloak you can use to hide from human enemies and cameras - animals will smell and attack you, which makes sense. While you're using it, you can still move, but not very fast, and you can't jump very well horizontally.That's not too bad when it's just simple timing, but it quickly becomes you needing to switch between being mobile and being safe from getting detected by most enemies really quickly, while dodging other hazards. You see some of that in the trailer, which I probably should have given a second look, so it's more my own fault really. There's nothing really wrong with the game at all provided you like precision platforming, I just didn't like that aspect of it.Also as an aside, it's a bit lame when you have a cutscene of your character easily dealing with an enemy when you can't actually do anything about them in the game."

It requires memorization and rapid-yet-precise controller movements, especially in the later stages. You will have to figure out some game mechanics via trial and error. When you fail, you will likely have to start over from a much earlier checkpoint.This describesMaster Spy. AndNinja Gaiden. AndGhouls 'n' Ghosts. AndMetal Gear.In this game, you play as the Master Spy, a contract spook who can infiltrate past any security blockade. You can walk, jump, somersault jump, don your optical-camouflage coat, and crack computer terminals. Get spotted, and you lose.This represents one of the few times I've ever seen a modern release capture the true feel of Japanese releases of the late 80s and early 90s, when chain-smoking devs were trying to squeeze the last bit of mustard out of early gaming hardware.Master Spydoesn't feel like some watered-down emulation or pandering homage, that drops unsubtle references to older games at every opportunity. Rather, it looks and plays like a competitor to titles on the NES or MSX2, such asThe Mafat ConspiracyorMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake. It has that gritty, unabashed punk edge.If there’s anything that keeps it from masquerading as a release for real hardware, it’s the stellar electronica soundtrack. In a way, this makesMaster Spyfeel like a game for a console that doesn’t exist, with the graphics chops of the MSX2, and the audio capabilities of a TurboDuo.Decades ago, games with a difficulty curve like that ofMaster Spywere common. Their design emulated contemporary arcade titles -- games designed to drain coins from pockets, to keep arcade operators in the black. Today, most gamers are no longer familiar with this approach.Does that makeMaster Spya bad game? Is it a relic of a bygone era, decades late to the party? Or is it a digital painting, faithfully created in the style of the masters that shaped the game industry?In short, if you want a game thattrulycould have been found on a cartridge or a floppy disk in the late 1980s, this is it."
