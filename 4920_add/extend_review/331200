They are:-Wandering through a completely empty grassy field that has NOTHING to do-A tiny shooting range with no scoring or other mechanics-Staring at a flat 2-D image of grass that gradually gets bigger-Standing in a field with cows that spin in place while one dubstep music track plays-Wandering through a completely empty snowy allley that has NOTHING to do-Standing in a field with static teleporting cows while one ""disco"" music track plays-Staring at a ""searching for online server"" screen that never goes awayIf you play the game for any slightly extended period of time the game glitches so that none of the modes work until you exit the game (even the exit game button stops working)This game is a joke that is not funny. I implore you: do not buy this game and encourage this idiocy. This is just crapping out something that only a cynical man would call a game and selling it as satire. If this game were a real joke, it would not be selling for ten dollars."

However, I can get for a pretty good price and it doesn't lookthat bad, so I buy it as a little joke. How bad can it be anyways?The game looks only normal bad at first glance, but then you realize that there are random invisible walls where the game seemingly draws infinitely, the mace only works if you crouch down and hit the cow in the udder or something, the time manipulating powerups are completely flat textures that are nearly impossible to pick up, the reload function is seemingly useless as the guns don't seem to ever run out of ammuntition, there's no point in useing anything other than the machine gun anyways, the other guns are fully auto for some completely asinine reason, jumping is incredibly stiff and doesn't feel like it works half the time, even at that there's no point to jumping because there's no diversity in the different environments, and it takes less than 15 minutes to seeeverythingthe game has to offer.The soundtrack's pretty nice though..5/10"

What would I do without this game?So I bought it.The only way I can rate this game is with an example. Imagine you're walking in the mall and you come across a shoe store. You see a shoe on display that is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. One that, without it, your life would be meaningless and overwhelmingly boring. You go inside, further examine the shoe, and find that you want to buy it. You ask the clerk if they have a shoe in stock for your foot size. She comes back with an unfortunate ""no"" to that answer, when you find out that the clerk is a cow. You're not actually in the mall, but in the middle of a field, and the shoe? The shoe is the grass that surrounds your every direction. Your life in this game is brought down to one word: exterminate. It is not a good game and I wish I could exterminate this from my steam library rather than exterminate the cows in this game.All in all: eh."

,Recommended,331200,20095242,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,Roahn,"Grass Simulator takes place back in the 70's where it was common for 'hippies' to try and stand up for their land during an era where it was common for industrialists to turn nature places into buildings and factories that made the business man alot of money. This is a story driven RPG where your choices matter. You play as a character created person trying to keep the land that you grew up in with a group of your friends/foes as a business man by the name of Daniel Davies who owns the multi-billionare corporation: 'Davies Inc' wants to turn the memory rich land into a profitable cookie factory. Its up to you to stop him as you are introduced to the sprawling open world of the land you are trying to protect and the towns surrounding it as you can either stop Davies by gaining power or doing underground illegal work. Either way gives a completely different story with more choices branching out from there. This game also has a heavy focus on weed or as its known 'grass' in the game as every day in the game you have the choice to take the 'grass' and boost your stats but slowly your character is losing its stats and dying or you can choose to not take 'grass' which will leave your character with small stats but will gain immensly as you keep choosing not to take it. Hence the title of this name. Other than the protagonist and the antagonist there are other side characters who are very unique and almost make this game. These characters include Charles Heathbar; your boyfriend or Charlie Heathbar who is your girlfriend (you choose). There is also your best friend Piccolo as you can decide to whether hide his alien identity or keep it public and of course your inside source on 'Davies Inc', Louis Litt. He was easily the best character and made me feel for everyone in the game. Do you know what also made me feel for everything in the game? The beatiful graphics that almost made me feel I was in a real world and of course the sheer scale of this world I was in. It is huge covering the small American towns around you and as you go through the game slowly unlocking the whole of North America and when you complete the mains story you get the endgame of South America where there is promised to be DLC and more quests there. Overall, this game is amazing and is a must play to anyone who has a PC.Pros:+Beautiful Graphics+Story changes every time+Large open world+Amazing characters+Made me feel for the land+Ending made me cryCons:-The story is a little too long with it clocking around 200 hours. But thats just the main story and there are over 9000 side quests.This game shows what happens when you really try to pull of an amazing game and the only con isn't even a con.11/10"

You know how sometimes things just feel like things are meant to be, like how there are some people you connect with on a deeper level or you have a feeling you are supposed to do something, even if you know it's wrong, that's the feeling I get when I play Grass Simulator. It makes me feel fulfilled in life. I know I shouldn't play it, I know it's wrong, I know what people will think, but it makes me feel so good, I just can't stop playing once I start. I click the play button and I get transported to another world, a world that is full of cows and grass. I think people underestimate this game, once you get to about 20 hours you begin to understand why it is so great, you begin to see the beauty of the game.So, if you like grass, cows, and loud music then buy this game.I hope this helped."

You see yourself in infancy, and as you watch the grass grow you become wiser, and older. I feel that grass simulator shows that YOU are the grass, and you are just one grass sapling in a whole field of grass, you grow with the grass, you die with the grass. Grass Simulator is not a game. Its a way of showing the true world, and that you are nothing more than a piece of grass in a field, waiting to be eaten by a cow. Grass Sim is a soulsearch to find your true place in this world."

There's just so much to say.Grass Simulator is, simply put, the best single-player games ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Grass Simulator compared to other games. What Daniel Davies has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent FPS here. Grass Simulator doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of video games to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen."

This is an experience.In my few short minutes of play time I was exposed to vast open worlds simllar to that of Skyrim or The Forest, I could roam frozen wastelands and green pastures alike in my search to find Cow Jesus and bring him back to the light.After Cow Jesus ascended back to Cow Heaven during Dubstep Mode, I took it upon myself to be the next saviour of cowkind and seek out someone who could take up his mantle. I encountered many cows with powers in my travels, but they were simply unwilling to become a saviour like the great Cow Jesus was. Infuriated, I opened fire on the cows with my arsenal of firearms and was struck down by Cow Jesus. I was thrown several meteres into the air and died. However, I was forgiven by Cow Jesus, for he is a great and merciful God, although he was unwilling to save my shattered legs, causing me to trip every few steps as I continued my search for a cow who could lead all other cows to salvation. I walked across water, scaled the highest mountains and even slowed down time during my quest.Perhaps you will succeed where I have failed. Perhaps you will succeed in the lastest mode, the mode they call ""Oh Lord"". I was weak and unable to finish the quest, and fell to the deepest depths of Cow Hell where I saw the holy trinity of Cow God, Cow Jesus and The Holy Cow mocking me from their sanctuary in the sky.I pray you will not be put off by all the negative reviews and will take up my quest so that Cow Jesus can rise once again in Dubstep mode.Cow God speed my son.11/10"

IS IT OVER?!I am...I think...my first vision after coming back was exactly as I suspected:  a Steam window asking me to write a review of Grass Simulator, AN EXPERIENCE I CAN ONLY BRIEFLY DESCRIBE AS TRANSCENDENTALThere I was, in Dubstep mode, scratching my head and wondering if I could come up with an even lazier method for acquiring quick cocaine cash than the developer, when one of the tiny dancing cows turned to me and spoke my name, but not in a language of this world......it felt like a thousand cockroaches had scurried up my spine and escaped out of the hairs on the back of my neck...A small black dot then appeared at the center of my screen and began expanding more rapidly than I could realize that this was not happening in the game.The blackness enveloped me on all sides.  It felt like the blackness had then started to infiltrate my mind. The universe spun and any attempts at rationalizing what was happening just led to a combination of worsening confusion and schizophrenic popping noises in my brain like all the pneumatic and hydraulic fittings connecting my neurons were bursting.  An overwhelming vibrating nausea seemed to take over every organ in my body and the urge to expel this violent soup inside me was unbearable.  Something was taking control and it was not about to let me protest.  I felt like I was being...stirred...I can't describe how long I endured this.  I could fathom eternity because I had no grasp of anything else.  My bones felt like uranium and my senses had eventually vanished.  My conscience had become a singularity that I could somehow gaze into but would recoil away from in horror.  When I somehow put some comfortable distance between me and my own conscience, a voice spoke to me in inhaled, reversed gasping whispers.  It felt like a language that only I could understand and seemed like was being conceived and conducted on the fly just for me.  The ethereal fingers of the voice articulated its message in what felt like a maddening thousand years for me to decipher:""Eight dollars ninety-nine.  Now don't you feel silly?  Go now, and warn the others.""Here I sit now where the Sun's warmth through my window feels like I've been thawed out of a glacier.  Where the distant boom-boom-PSSHT of my neighbor's awful hip hop sounds like a symphony that took a lifetime to compose.  Where the crumbs at the bottom of my bag of Cheetos taste like nourishment that could cure all the world's hunger.  Where typing on this keyboard feels like I'm speaking to the world for the very first time.Where knowledge is abundant, and love is all that really matters.So do it, dear reader.  Buy Grass Simulator, endure it to the demise and violent reimagining of your being, and then find some reason to care again.  Feel inescapable loss and then rapturous triumph.  Eat some fruit.  Hug your mother.  Wash your damn car.  Man up and ask that girl out already.  Try to pretend that this life means something because now you understand what nothing is.LIVE MY NIGHTMARE, BECOME GOD, AND THEN TELL THE UNIVERSE TO GO ♥♥♥♥ ITSELF"
