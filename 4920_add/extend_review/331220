The game play, while very simple, is a ton of fun, and makes for an incredible party game.Bad: We could not get every device working. The biggest boon to this game would be having friends come over and download it on their phones or tablets, but when we tried running multiple platforms together it was bug city. Different devices would log in as the same player, ghost players would be able to run around and stab whoever they wanted (which was hilarious, but for the wrong reasons), and the game would crash constantly or throw people back to the lobby.I hope a patch comes in the next few days, I will definitely be trying this out again. Recommended, but with a warning."

Let's be clear: some games can benefit more from positive user's feedback than others. I didn't need to read at people's opinions to know I was buying Awesomenauts or Binding of Isaac.But truth is that it took me some time to finally purchase Thief Town. I wasn't pretty sure. And it was a damn good purchase. The game excels at what I think is the most important for a local multiplayer: creating tension and hilarious moments that make you and your friend burst into laughs.It's not a game you will play more than an hour in a single session (but most local multiplayer games aren't designed for that, to be fair). But it's a game you will surely propose to play every time you and your friends decide to have a fun time playing some local multiplayer on Steam.Its strengths remind me to Nidhogg: a super easy to learn game that guarantee a lot of laughs.I picture you at the same spot I was: doubting if this not so specially good-looking game worths the money. Believe me, mate: it is super worth. Highly recommended."

With its easy to understand gameplay, it's the kind of game that non-hardcore gamers can easily compete with hardcore gamers in and have a great shot at winning (sort of like a Nintendo game in that regard).

,Not Recommended,331220,23932967,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Trump 2016,"Do not buy this game. Buy ""Hidden in Plain Sight"" instead.Thief town is all style and 0 substance. The game plays like this: You and your friends are on screen with a bunch of npcs that look exactly like you and your friends. The objective is to find out which one of the npcs based on movement are actually one of your friends and stab them without getting stabbed by your friends first. This is an incredibly fun CONCEPT but is executed very, very poorly in Thief Town.Technical problems:Firstly, every single player has to bind their controls EVERY SINGLE TIME THE GAME IS LAUNCHED. If you don't understand what you're doing and bind the wrong keys you have to walk over to the bartender to change your key bindings using the very same incorrect controlls you just bound. ""Couldn't you just reset them in the menu?"" you may ask. Unfortunately you still need to navigate the menu with broken controls and then you need to rebind keys for every player. ""Why aren't the the controls bound to default keys like the arrow keys, wasd, or the controller joysticks and then editable in the menu therefore solving all these problems?"" That's a good question reader, I have no idea.This game's simple control scheme and design lends itself to using multiple xbox controllers and playing it on the tv, however the game designers seem to disagree. Directional controls cannot be mapped to the xbox controller's directional pad, in addition, mapping the directional controls to the analog stick PREVENTS DIAGONAL MOVEMENT. This almost would be forgivable if the controls were bound to the directional pad but no diagonal movement on an analog stick? It also almost would be forgivable if the npcs weren't able to move diagonally in game, but they are, destroying any player's ability to accurately blend in. I should say that I did make a post about this problem in the forum and did recive a responce from a developer but he blamed the lack of diagonal movement on my controller rather than on a fault of the game. I have tried 3 different controllers that work perfectly fine with any other game on steam but they all suffer the same lack of diagonal movement. So either all three of my controllers break for literally only this game or there is real problem with keymapping. I'll let you decide.The game also has trouble dealing with high resolutions. Even when I downscaled my resolution to help the game cope I experenced high frame rate issues and screen tearing which I just had to deal with becuase if I recall, there is no v-sync feature and if there is, it does little to nothing.Game Design Problems:Even if the technical issues were fixed the base game itself is just badly designed. There are multiple game modes but they do little to solve the problems in design and fail to keep the game from falling into a state of repetative boredom. The premise is to hide as best you can from your friends while trying to figure out who they are. Unfortunately the small arena you are given to move around in in addition to the large size of the player sprites makes it nearly impossible to differentiate between characters. You cannot identify a player based on movement if there is no room in which to move. In addition, you cannot follow a specific character once they are identified due to the flurry of npcs constantly moving over their position. It's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack if the hay stack was bunched up in one location and the hay in the haystack was constantly moving. The best and only strategy is to throw the entire point of the game out the window and begin stabbing literally anything that gets close to you, hopefully killing a player. The game then just tuns into a stabbing death match because everyone knows who everyone else is because trying to stealth at all will just get you stabbed. Your friends might as well just flip coins for fun becase the game just turns into a game of chance with 0 skill, 0 thought, and 0 fun involved.I paid 2$ for this game and I would have had more fun setting those 2$ on fire and betting on how long it would  take them to burn."
