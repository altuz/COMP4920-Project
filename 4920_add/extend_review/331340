76561198030414441,Not Recommended,331340,16430785,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,Ralgaoud,"Tulpa is a 2D puzzle platformer where you control two characters with different abilities. The girl can push/pull things and jump and the floating boy can interact with onscreen objects with the mouse cursor. If you've played Limbo you'll have an inkling of what you're in for, if not, that means that you will learn what to do by being killed, repeatedly. Some deaths are unavoidable the first time around. This aspect makes the game frustrating, especially coupled with the obtuse puzzles you'll have to solve. The puzzle-solving boils down to clicking any suspicious object on-screen to determine its utility. The unresponsive controls confound the puzzle-solving further, as there are instances where I knew what should be done, but the controls failed me. Despite the colorful presentation and surreal imagery, there is no story in this game. It is one of those games that throws as much weirdness at you and hope that your mind would probe for meaning, when there isn't any. If there was an underlying thread of meaning that ties up this adventure, it went way beyond me. Game duration is about 1-2hrs."

The game sacrifices the logic in the name of the surreal flavour. Yes, this means ""trial and error"" most of the time. Like Hapland.The controls are not horrible, as other people claim. Granted that using X and Z together with WASD movement is very awkward, but you can use Shift and Ctrl instead.The atmosphere is great at some points, and just off in others. The ""Ophelia is Distressed"" thing in the first part was great, why did that stop? I was expecting more of that. Actually, I was expecting more of everything, the game is ridiculously short.Only get this during a sale."

It's surreal, beautiful, charming, and you get a great half experience from it, the other half is frustration, which is surprising for me since barely any game does that to me.The game is a damn beautiful art piece, which as vibrant colors, great art work that looks like it was inspired by a mix of Indian, Arabian, and English art. The puzzles are really simple and hidden so plainly that you'd just miss it somehow, and that's kind of what I think is makes (one version of) a good puzzle game.The beginning section is annoying, along side with most of the game. I get what they're trying to do, adding a creepy/scary factor to it, but it's more annoying than being effectively creepy.The controls/gameplay are less than solid work, sometimes frustrating, where there actions are delayed, moving objects around are noticeably laggy, and half of the time the character won't hold on to a ledge.Tulpa is absolutely astonishing in the way that it looks, it's art is just fantastic, it's creepy factor is amazing, and the pacing of it is good too, the characters are also great with how one is working with the other to continue their adventure, but it's a shame that it has such low quality control in the gameplay side of things, which includes the platforming design, the controls, the interactions with items and the environment, the movement and jumping system, that and the guides/tutorials are bad or not even there to help sort out what you can do in the game, which I think they aren't there because of the shortness of the game? not sure.I'm actually more disappointed that angry with the game, looking forward to it before release, and then finally playing the game, it did an amazing job in its looks, in the characters, in the puzzles, but not in the gameplay sadly, which is why I recommend this game only at a price cut, around 6 dollars is a good point, but if it didn't have those problems that ruined half of my experiences, then I would wholeheartedly recommend at full price, even if it is short 2-3 hour game, I'm more into a great experience rather than length, to an extent, and this Tulpa delivered half a good one.Shamelesslinkto original post."

The music is amazing and definitely sets the mood for the rest of the game. The minimalist style is awesome. The game itself runs smoothly and beautifully. This is an all around good game so far. Anyone who likes games like ""Limbo"" will really enjoy this game."

,Recommended,331340,15222863,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,Apokalypsis,"Tulpa is a surreal and somewhat creepy puzzle game. It's layout is pretty bizarre and has a slightly hellish feel about it, with basic colour schemes for each level (white, black and one other colour). It's worth playing if you can get it on a discount, but the length detracts from the value and so I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. I'd like to have seen more to the game, the shortness of the game leaves me feeling unfulfilled. More story development would have been good, too."

Has been a problem with the jump button not being responsive, but the developer got in touch and they've been fantastic.  I'm sure that this won't be a problem for much longer.  **  EDIT **  Turns out to be my not too great machine specs.  From the other reviews this doesn't seem to be a problem for most people.  **I can't recommend the game enough.  It's feels unique and stands out from the usual fayre.  The sound only adds to the mood of the game.  The puzzles are fun, not too difficult, but you will die a few times trying to solve them.  Stick with it though as the visual style only gets better as you progress, just look at the trailer :)"

Keep in mind, there are a few annoyances with the game and controls, and the game is very short, 3-4 hours, In the end, I was left wanting more visual eye candy, Overall, I am very satisfied and would play again. Would recommend for art lovers and casual gamers."

Yes.The artwork and music make for a great mood, the puzzles are enjoyable, and it's a game that draws you in, and that makes you look at the whole picture, even where you'd normally just glance. The mood all that makes is great, and I'm definitely going to play this again."
,Not Recommended,331340,19134390,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,ValkyrieMorrigu,"Wanted to like this. I tried, I really did, but the controls are awful and when trying to jump, Ophelia hardly ever bloody jumps correctly leading to death and having to start over, and over, and over again until I feel like throwing things.It's clunky and not enjoyable. It's a frustrating waste of money.I may give it a go again but frankly, I'm tired of turning into shattered glass and repetitive motions."
,Not Recommended,331340,19296826,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Shawnecy,"You control two characters in Culpa, a girl who jumps and climbs (and even pulls things twice in the whole game) and a guy who basically exists to be a 'wormhole' liability and to let you point and click with your mouse. You switch between them with a keypress. It's a bit of a clunky mechanic. When in control of the guy, the girl will blindly walk off of cliffs to stay close to him. Most puzzles require you to find the magic thing to click on and interact with. Once you've identified that, the 'puzzle' is often just dragging something. The platforming controls are slow and sluggish and platforming itself never poses any real challenge. The game's art style is consistent and almost unique; it is a cousin of the ""silhouette"" platformer that's become so common as of late.The game is very short and doesn't offer much to engage the player in terms of unique game mechanics or a gaming experience in general. I wouldn't recommend this to all but the most diehard of puzzle platforming fans. 5/10."

I don't really mind the riddles because it's still fun, but the length is a real turnoff. It looks nice and I'd have liked to see more of it.

,Not Recommended,331340,16421019,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,LonM,"I would not recommend 'Tulpa'.As a game, it's not great. The keys used are WASD to move, X&Z for actions, and the mouse. This is pretty hard to play with, as moving my hand around to move while holding X [for example to move something] is extremey awkward, and the controls cannot be re-mapped.The visuals in the game are nice, although I am missing any symbolism here, because I have no clue about the subject matter of 'Tulpas'. Nearer the end, the game starts to use some evangelion 3 level visuals which fit right in to the game, but I have no idea what they mean.This is actually true for a lot of the game. There are many puzzles where I found the solution just by random chance, and some things are never really explained.Perhaps if you like the subject matter you would enjoy the game, but i cannot recommend it for anyone who doesn't."

I did like the creepiness and minimalist design. The music was ok, if a bit bland and uninspired.Where it fails is in it's overall clunky controls and mechanics. everything there is laggy, slow, sloppy, and frustrating. Too much pixel hunting to see what you were meant to interact with.Overall, I can't recommend this for any price over $3."

,Not Recommended,331340,16356948,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,Razputin,"I really wanted to enjoy this game. When I first saw it in the store, this game seemed like a gem buried in... Well, more commercially successful titles. But boy was I wrong.Gameplay:4/10Controlling both characters is incredibly awkward, Ofelia cannot jump or grab ledges properly half of the time, while Oliver can accidentally kill her because she keeps running towards him. I mean, game explained that they must be close to each other, why implement this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic? Overall movement is kinda sloppy, this isn't something you expect from a platformer-ish game. Puzzles (which I assume to be the core of the game) are either very basic, or very ""hard"" - the cheap and nonsensical type of hard. Sometimes those puzzles just kill you, because it's the only way to find out how it works so you can solve it, sometimes you won't be able to figure out what to do for good 10 minutes, and when you eventually will, you'd feel no pleasure, you won't slap your palm across forehead, saying ""My, how stupid am I, the solution was so obvious!"", because it wasn't.Music/SFX:6/10Not good, not bad. Sounds are basic: footsteps, clatter, splats and such were most probably promptly taken from some online library. Music is just ambient, seems like composer tried to fit the ""atmosphere"", but he couldn't succeed nor fail for reason I'll explain later.Story:...Come on now. Game wasn't even trying to tell a story. All there is to it is a blueprint: you get a few hints of what's going on in the beginning, in the end, and couple of times during the playthrough.Graphics+""atmosphere"":4/10It seems like that is exactly what everyone is praising about this game, and this is exactly what I imagined this game would be: an immersive experience, packed with simple, but beautiful backgrounds, little exploration here and there, just... You know, I wanted this game to play with me, take away my reality perception and throw me out in the end, sitting here, astounded, kinda like Nifflas' or Pixel's games do. It promised to do it. It never did. Backgrounds are straight up bland and uninspiring, most objects seem SO out of place, color solutions are unsatisfying. The game was trying way too hard to be a mysterious, but it ended up just shoving it into your face: ""Hey, there is a limbless skeleton on the wall, and he operates the elevator, isn't it brilliant? And look at this pheasant assembly animation! You speechless yet? What? Random doesn't mean genius? Well, screw you, have some hands growing out of ground"".My overall score:4/10Thismightbe a little biased, since I had such high expectations about this one, and being disappointed right from the title screenout-of-place syndrome: the beginning, just look at this fontdoesn't help.TL:DR only buy this game on sale, without expectations and, if possible, without experience in Yume Nikki type of games."

76561198072117155,Recommended,331340,18197492,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,TabZ,"I am torn on whether or not to recommend this game.Personally, the biggest perk from this game is its atmosphere. How beautiful and artful it is comes in a close second, however. The imagery is fantastical. I loved the colors and how each level centralizes (or tries to anyway) around a certain theme and color. I found that the character breaking into shards of glass when dying was interesting and the entire concept of what a tulpa is. The visuals and the atmosphere of this game is the most fascinating and enjoyable aspect this game has to offer.On the other side, this game has some hefty cons. It is incredibly short. One playthrough takes roughly about an hour to get through (this is coming from someone who gets stuck on the simplest of puzzles). The ending is very abrupt and unexpected with no real plot involved - unless I am perhaps too vague to understand the depth that is presented in the surreal imagery. There does appear to be a hint of a story underlying the imagery, but after spending my time going through multiple playthroughs I simply cannot fathom what I am missing. With so much to look forward to regarding the imagery and the atmosphere I was hoping for at least five levels to go deeper into the concept of a ""tulpa"" (which is a fascinating concept on its own and I did not feel as though it explored this idea at all). I was, admittedly, very disappointed with the abrupt ending as I was enjoying the game up until then. I had expected a lot more from it.Regardless of its hefty con ... it is worth playing in my opinion, especially if you enjoy atmospheric games with lots of imagery. I would wait until it was on sale to purchase, though."
