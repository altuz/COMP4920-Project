,Not Recommended,331390,13855852,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,No,"Although I'm giving this a negative review with the only choices being the black or white ""Recommended"" or ""Not Recommended"", I'm doing it more to give constructive criticism to the developer and inform potential buyers of some things positive reviewers might be leaving out.The difficulty curve is extremely harsh. You have four levels of difficulty you can play at. Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. In the first three you can pause the game at any time in order to take your time placing units (spirits), looking at tooltips to read weaknesses, etc. In Insane you cannot pause at all. I started out playing on Normal and assumed that it wouldn't be too hard to progress at that level. Wrong. Even at Normal you will most likely quickly get overwhelmed and have to fall back to playing levels on Easy. Even on Easy you will most likely have a hard time completing progressive levels and have to go back to earlier levels and grind random rewards (Item Blossoms) and sell those rewards for money that you can buy enchanting items with from the store and upgrade your Spirits items with.This however is another issue in my opinion. Completing levels only gives you experience that levels up your spirits and the item blossoms depending on what difficulty level you played and if you did it perfectly without any enemies making it across the end line and damaging your 10 health points. It used to give fewer item blossoms but it was patched to increase the rewards. On Easy you will get 4 random Item Blossoms (3 + 1 if you do it perfectly) from a specific pool of items that the level can give. Completing levels does not give you any money. You have to sell your random rewards to the shop for ~33% of their value that the store sells the same items for. Also, sometimes rewards consist of patterns that unlock items in the shop; aka they have no monetary value. So to enchant one of your spirits weapons up to +10 you need to grind easy levels repeatedly getting rewards such as Bows that you sell for about 33 currency or Coins that you sell for 97 currency. You might get around 200-350 currency per repeated grind. You need 400 for each level of enchanting up to level 10. I think it would be better if the game directly rewarded currency for each level completed instead of needing to grind materials and sell them for low percentages repeatedly.The story is pretty random and hard to follow. None of the characters know why they're there or why they're doing what they're doing. The main character seems to have amnesia. It's hard to follow which character is even talking when you're clicking through the dialogue at a decent pace. When there are four characters on screen and two are named ""Mindy"" and ""Minzy"" and two are named ""Nina"" and ""Nino"" it can kind of be confusing which one is saying what. Especially when there is usually no indication of a character starting to talk besides the (very similar) name changing. Aka the character art won't change and the speech is not appearing above their head; it is always in the same place down in the center. Even when the character suddenly changes moods and says something like ""What!? Really!?"" their expression won't change and they still have the same smiling expression art used. And you cannot scroll back up to past conversation to check something if you missed it or were clicking through too quickly. You can usually do this in visual novels and having that feature would be great.It's worth pointing out that there is some Engrish. It's not constant but there is quite a bit of it. Incorrect grammar, missing words, words in the wrong order. For example: one time a line said something like ""Quick, we to need go now!"" instead of ""Quick, we need to go now!"". It's definitely not impossible to understand but there are a bunch of errors.Although it isn't a huge deal it can be kind of annoying dealing with the different elements of the enemy mobs. They have weaknesses and affinities. The weaknesses are simple enough; a raccoon spirit enemy has a weakness to fire? Great, your fire archer spirits work well against them. The annoying thing is the affinities. If they have a lightning affinity for example they will absorb and heal from any lightning damage. There are Leapie enemies which hold shields that have a lightning affinity and are immune to all damage except any that has shield piercing on it. They're weak to wind so once you get the wind archers with shield piercing you obviously use those to kill them. But when tons of Leapies come out on all five rows it's kind of annoying to have your Lightning Mage spirit up. It will just constantly attack the Leapies and heal them. You can't even desummon spirits once you summon them. You do have the ability to pause the game and manually click and redirect the Lightning Mage spirit's attacks to another enemy (if any are there) but as soon as it kills it it will just attack the next closest enemy (probably a Leapie) and start healing them again. It's not worth constantly manually redirecting your dim-witted spirits attacks for every kill, so I just end up not using the spirit at this point. There have seriously been rows of enemies that include alternating Leapies (weak to wind) and Squirrel spirits (wind affinity, heal from wind damage) over and over. One leapie, one squirrel, one leapie, one squirrel, etc. You need to place your wind archers to kill the Leapies, but as soon as the first Leapie drops it will continue to shoot the next enemy - the squirrel - that will just block it's attacks and heal from it. You can use other spirits to kill the squirrel enemies but your wind archer spirit will continue to shoot them as well until it despawns, constantly healing it and competing against your own spirit trying to kill it. The elements can be kind of frustrating and rather than purely rewarding using the correct elements to do more damage the affinities seem to limit what you can do and punish yourself in some instances.Another thing I hope could be changed is sometimes you try placing your own Leapie spirits to block incoming waves and if you misjudge whether or not you have enough room to place the Leapie it will just instantly delete it once you resume game because it was a fraction too close and got placed on top of the enemy. And then you are sort of screwed or at least at a big disadvantage as it goes on its 10 second cooldown and the wave you were trying to block is probably sprinting or equally dangerous. You can be very conservative in such situations and just place it another square back but having an indicator telling you that you can't place it there would be nice.Overall I think that it is a pretty fun game. It can be rather hectic and the difficulty curve does seem kind of broken as of now. I don't think it should be necessary to both drop down to the lowest difficulty and still need to grind to improve your spirits because you can't even progress on said easiest difficulty without doing so. The developer is very defensive about people commenting on this. I've seen responses with him questioning if they listened to the tutorial or are using strategic pause enough or that he sees they haven't enchanted a weapon to +10. I have done grinding to enchant multiple weapons to +10, etc, paid attention to every tip given and pause a lot (it's necessary); it's still challenging even on easy. I hope the information I provided was useful. There are many positive aspects to the game; I am simply chosing to focus on the negatives since nobody seems to really point them out. The developer seems to care about the game and still be involved in improving it. I do think it's a decent game.I recommend picking it up.Edit: In a recent patch (you can see him post patch notes in the announcements) the developer improved the electric caster spirit's AI and increased item sell values (from 35% to 50%), improved some typos, etc. He continues to work to improve the game."

The spirits you summon are short-lived, so you constantly have to summon new spirits to keep up with appearing enemies. You can pause the game anytime (except on highest difficulty), allowing you to plan your defense precisely.As mentioned in the opening line, Winged Sakura has extensive RPG elements as well. Each spirit has level that increases as the spirit participates in battles, and can equip its personal weapon and an accessory from a fairly large list. Equipment’s quality can be improved by both finding or crafting higher-tier versions of the item, or upgrading existing item (and as upgrade cost raises with item’s tier, upgrading lower-tier items is often a preferable alternative to getting higher-tier items).The story is very interesting, and cutscenes are done in anime style, with beautiful character art. Both cutscenes and battle art is very good in general, as can be seen on screenshots.I recommend Winged Sakura to all fans of defense games, doubly so if they like anime style as well!"

,Not Recommended,331390,31875241,Posted: 20 May,all,Mr. Matt,"In Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc, you read through brief dialog segments, interact with a shop/menu system, and experience a Plants-Vs.-Zombies-like combat system. I'm often a sucker for tower defense sorts of games and persistence progress such as level-ups and relevant unlockables, so I gravitated toward this purchase and gave it a fair go.StoryBefore I talk about anything else, I have to say that the story-telling is a bit clumsily handled, with plot-twists being too strongly hinted at and a small cast of characters in which two pairs of characters have the same names (Mindy and Minzy, and Nina and Nino), each of whom are on-screen at the same time with their dialog only written (no audio), without speech bubbles or text position changes, making it confusing at first as to who is saying what, and which character is which. There seemed to be a few decent bits of story writing here and there, but it just felt mishandled. That said, I don't really hold it against the game. I didn't come to this game or even this genre for plot at all, so although I didn't think the parts of the story I experienced were very good, I don't mind in the slightest.Brief PositivesNow, that said, I found numerous qualities I liked about the game; particularly its visuals and its music/sound. As far as 2D games go, the art style was enjoyable to the eye, and the songs, though few, were quite good and didn't get old for me. Also, the leveling system for both your spirits you summon as well as your playable character's skill tree were enjoyable during the more than a dozen hours I sunk into the game. The gameplay itself is even enjoyable. I was concerned that I wouldn't like how spirits you summon disappear mere seconds later, but it kept the game rather intense, and the ability to pause and quickly place more spirits in a hurry to stop attackers was well-done. Win the battle, and you get experience and item rewards. Therein, however, was the core issue I had with the game.Grinding, Grinding Ad NauseumWith many JRPGs, the deciding factor on whether or not the game is actually fun for me to play comes down to this question: ""is the grinding fun and does it feel really rewarding?"" With Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc, the overall answer was ""no."" The leveling grind was not a problem for me; rather, it was the item grind that caused the game to stop being enjoyable for me. Weapons and accessories are obtained either as random drops, or you can buy or craft them, provided you obtained the schematic to add it to the shop menu. Of course, those schematics are also random drops out of 17-20 or so other items that infinitely replenish, adding back to the pool of items I don't want to get. You get 4-5 items per battle playing on the reasonable early game difficulties (I played on Normal; beat a few on Hard), and those battles can take about 10 minutes or so, each.This might not sound like a problem. Let me clarify it a bit. Weapons are colored in terms of quality, like in Borderlands or Diablo. If I had a white bow, I would need a green bow purchase schematic to buy a green bow, or I would need a green bow crafting schematic and parts to combine with the white bow to make a green bow. If I just have bad luck, I can be incapable of ever getting a green bow. The various weapons of the game are all this way; same with accessories. If I get a blue bow crafting schematic sometime, then I'll need a green bow to craft it, and if I was never able to get the green bow, then I'm screwed on ever getting a better weapon for that spirit until I luck I spent7 hoursjust farming to get 2-3 early-game schematics this morning, anddid notend up getting them.7 hours, in an area where the XP payout isn't good, and playing the same couple of levels repeatedly got really old. It's not like I was hunting for some late-game uber-rare show-off loot. This was early-game stuff, and this should not take this long to obtain. At least one guaranteed schematic as loot from each round would mean only having to play some of the same levels only 7 or 8 times in a row. That sounds a bit overkill already, but as it is, it took me 7 hours this morning trying to get 2-3 particular item schematics and not succeeding. If I had gotten the schematics, then I'd need to craft those items, and then upgrade them up to ten times using more and more and more parts obtained from hours of grinding these battles.ConclusionI initially enjoyed Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc, but lost all enthusiasm for it after realizing the deliberate amount of excessive grinding the developer elected to put into the game. As I mentioned earlier, when I'm grinding in a game, I want to feel that my time spent has been rewarded, and 7 hours invested without the low-end schematics I set out for is simply unacceptable. It is very disappointing as I would liked to have followed the odd, albeit clumsy story to its conclusion, and seen the later levels and spirits of the game."

I do, the idea of building up a massive wall of peons and watching them go about bringing destruction to the lemmings below has always been a type of game that inspired me. And my other guilty pleasure is that cute anime garbage that makes me happy. Games like Recettear and 100% Orange Juice, whereas lacking in violence, still can make you smile just from the smiles on the cute characters faces.But wait. Those things don't mix...or do they...?They can sure try. And here we come to Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc: A fast paced anime-styled tower defense game by Winged Sakura Games.I'm sure I've lost you already, so allow me to clear things up now. This is not the type of tower defense game many people will be expecting. It's beyond fast paced, it's hectic, and though I've yet to actually find a need for it, the game comes with a ""Strategic Pause"" (This is a normal pause, but allows you to catch your breath, refill your drink, think about your next move, or run out into the rain and question your current life choices). The game is structured very similarly (so far) to the first levels of Plants versus Zombies, another tower defense game that this one, like many others, so desperately wants to live up to. Except this time around, it's cats versus....the same exact cats, and your cats are on a timer. By this, I mean they fade away in seconds, or even after they attack ONCE. So you will be constantly reapplying the towers and struggling to keep yourself from being overrun by.............cats. Oh and a chicken! And I *think* I've seen bunnies by now.The gameplay is honestly pretty enjoyable. Fast paced is a nice breath of fresh air in the genre, and I'm always willing to try something new. So let's move onto...the...story......Hm.If you're looking into buying this game, or at least have read the review up to this point, you're probably an anime fan. And most anime fans have enjoyed anime on television, from Adult Swim to Toonami, all the way to Anime Unleashed by from Techtv. Think back to those good old days--remember when you'd turn it on, and it would be an anime that you've never seen before, but the story was a good ten episodes in already? But you watched it anyways, not really trying to get into the story? Mine was .hack//sign. God save me, I had no bloody idea what was happening, but I watched it anyways. Point being, that's what this story is. You get into the story, and CLEARLY, you're in the middle, but the game makes no attempt catch you (or its characters) up to speed. They all start out like they know a bunch of secrets, act all chummy, and guess what? You're not in on the joke.The art style is charming if cliched', and there seems to be a lot to do for your characters. There's a skill tree, item crafting, upgrades, so on and so forth. I use the word upgrade despondently because Claws turns into Claws, but with a green name and a bunch of upward pointing green arrows on the stats. I would have liked to have seen the artists come up with cooler weapon and accessory upgrades akin to Drakengard style, where each upgrade looks a little more menacing. But since you only see these items in the inventory between rounds, I'm sure I'll get over it.This game is still very recently released and Team Winged Sakura Games seems to know what their doing when it comes to patching the game. But for now, don't be surprised when you have to grind the same ""rounds"" (all the levels are the same) over and over again. Which is probably a good thing, because the STORY mode, a term used VERY loosely, looks to be very very short from where I stand, at just around 5 hours, grinding included. However, I HAVE NOT BEATEN THIS GAME, so this shortness may and or may not be true.EDIT: Good news. It's infact quite a bit longer than I expected! This is a good thing.There is a neko maid added about an hour in. I am still waiting for an explaination for this beyond ""because anime.""All and all, I'm still playing the game, and it knows how to keep my focus. I feel like there isn't much substance, only one level, enemies are also allies, storyline thinner than the maids blouse's fabric, and upgrades are only just so because the game tells you they are. If you like anime and tower defense, you'll probably enjoy this game. There's a survival mode that I assume becomes unlocked once you beat the game, and there are some trophies, though it seems like they'd be easy to get.Lastly, the steam cards trade for this game at around 2$ a piece, and I've currently gained for. Do wih this what you will. This is Faust, thanks for reading.+Fast paced Gameplay+Classic modern Anime Design+Fair amounts of strategy required+Rewarding Grinding--------------------Unappealing storyline-Slightly non user friendly-Lazy design-A neko maid? Really. Come on. You're better than this! And Sakura? REALLY? Didn't sakura spirits just come out? Didn't it just forcefeed us these stupid trophes? This is what is known as profiling.

,Recommended,331390,24570285,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,Justin_Brett,"Okay, I know what you're thinking. Looks like some dumb anime game, right? I can't actually be recommending it. Well, I totally is, and I am.First of all, if you don't have a tolerance for this kind of thing, I'd check out right now, because Winged Sakura is pretty much exactly the kind of game you'd expect from that title. It's pretty much unironic about that, which had a certain silly charm to me, but obviously not for everyone. You play as Mindy, a young mage, and her Sakura Minzy - basically a spirit partner. They find themselves stuck in a building, and have no memory of how or why they're here. To find out, you'll need to head through four areas of twelve stages each, defending the place from attacks. Objectively the story is kinda bad; it often brings up new plot elements out of nowhere, all the characters are pretty one-note, and there's a lot of it.What really drew me in was the gameplay. Like Plants VS Zombies, it's a lane defense, but far more complicated. From the start there are far more enemies coming at you, there are considerations like elemental resistances and shields to take into account, and most importantly your towers in this are all spirits (the same as the enemies you fight, which is neat) that show up temporarily, generally ten seconds at most. That's enough time to get a few shots off, but every spirit has a cooldown period before you can place another, meaning there's a lot of micro-management to put them where they're most useful. That's helped by the game offering a tactical pause you can use at any time to plan out what you want to do, although Insane, the hardest difficulty available in each stage, disables it. If you enjoy that kind of gameplay, it's quite fun, and all your spirits are fairly unique to one another in what they can do.Despite you potentially being able to have multiples of them out at once, every spirit is treated as a unique party member, and you can equip them with a personal weapon and one accessory, the latter of which do things like increasing the time they're on the field or decreasing their cooldown period. This is where the game gets a bit imperfect, as after every level you gain up to six drops depending on the difficulty, which include the ability to buy or craft items at the store. There are several tiers to each item, so you may find yourself having problems upgrading through no fault of your own. I remember unlocking a spirit fairly late in the game and not getting its weapon after the level, so I either had to go without for the next one or run that level again. After the first couple they become standardized at fifteen waves each, so this can definitely be a bit of a pain, and it would have been nice if there was a system where lower-tier items became unlocked automatically. The actual crafting can take some lucky drops as well, and while more straight-forward, buying the materials for that takes money, which you get by selling stuff you get. So it's a big cycle.It sounds odd to recommend Winged Sakura after my review of Prime World Defenders, but the actual game part of it was good enough to make me play it all the way through. Still, I would fully agree it is not necessarily a game for everyone, and that you need to have a reasonable tolerance for trashy anime and watching numbers go up. If you do, it will serve you well on both accounts. If not, give this one a pass."

Well, the game has a high initial difficulty curve that may throw many people off and the bosses are maybe a bit too similar: every new boss felt to me like a more powerful version of the last one (except for the final boss).The normal levels also felt a tad too repetitive, but I can say that during a normal playthrough the game doesn't overstay its welcome, just if you want to 100% it like me. It took me 64 hours to get all the achievements.The story is very hard to follow and it takes quite a while to become something that makes some kind of sense, and unfortunately as soon as it became interesting the game itself endedwith a cliffhanger(but there's a sequel that will come out eventually).Audio and visuals are okay, maybe the characters art during dialogues could be better, but that didn't ruin anything for me.Achievements are average, a bit too grindy but the game itself provides you some mechanics to make them less boring (like the guaranteed level up for every 15 waves in survival mode).The devs seem to be quite active in helping people in the forum, this is a plus.Overall:+ a tower defense that has its own personality+ challenging, but rewarding+ decent customization options- a bit repetitive- below average storyYou will also get extra content in their next games if you buy this one, a good way to reward players.I recommend it, I had fun playing it and the devs seem worthy of support."

The game has a 30 second timer on it, but you have to right-click on the timer to reset to 30seconds, there is also  game pause so you can determine your next move. The game play mechanics is pretty good, not too easy yet not too difficult either, its a quick learn. There is a certain amount of stereotypicalness with this game, if you love anime style visual novels this i must have. As a person who really doesn't care much for strategy games, I find myself being driven to succeed to just go further in the story and see what happens. Its got really good solitaire style game play, the game itself pretty quickly paced but with strategic pauses it makes it a lot more casual. If you love stragetgy games, it may not be the deepest, but for the rest of us, its a very fun easy to learn game with a really fun cheeky upbeat tempo. The soundtrack is nothing short of AMAZING, really suits the gameplay."

You grind and grind and level up and then mow down hordes of enemies. That is all this game has to offer; but sometimes that's all I'm in the mood for, so I give it a weak thumbs up.Positives:+ It's simple and plays fast.+ If you like grinding and leveling up, you can do plenty of that in this game.+ Enjoyable game play, particularly if you like Plants vs. Zombies-esque games.Negatives:- I really didn't enjoy the story. I'm not an otaku, but I know enough about anime to know that this took all the common tropes of anime, and just threw them together. This game brought absolutely nothing new to the table storywise.- The humor (and just the writing in general) really grated on my nerves. It felt like everything fell flat.- Grindy.

Even going down to ""easy"" difficulty doesn't work. You're then stuck until you've improved your units quite a bit, which involves two things: levelling them up through using them (grinding) and upgrading their equipment by (again) grinding for drops.You know what?

The music is lovely and the style reminded me of the Naruto Storm games.As you progress, you lvl up and gain access to a skill tree from which you can strategize your play style, upgrade and equip weapons and accessories to your monsters. A must to do because the levels get hard... fast! And that's only from playing on Normal.Story wise it's the typical, lost memories, transported to a new world anime teen concept, but you can skip all that just by pressing Esc if you want so, no drag down for forcing you to read all that.Get it, if you like strategy, good ambiance and visuals."

Maybe two but the second one was kind of expected so I dont mind that much.1) the need to wait 10s before you can skip to another wave. You waste incredible amount of time later when you want to farm some items, mostly recipes, I personally dont see any reason why it is made this way. If you need time to finish the wave when you are slowly progressing then you still have that 29s before the next one but when you are strong enough and you only need to farm then it slows you down a lot when you can skip at 19s and you start at 29s.2) lotsof grinding can be a problem for some people."

It’s a lane defense game where you have to collect recipes and parts to equip spirits to take on wave after wave in nearly 50 levels (plus endless mode). In order to get the gear you need, you need to either find it after winning a level, at which point it is usually underpowered. Or you need to find a Data Fragment, in which case you can buy it in the store. Or you need to find the recipe and hope you have or can buy the right parts. The setup is good, but the execution is weak. The main problem is the grind. There are items where you need to beat a 10 minute level in order to have at best a 25% chance of finding the item you need. I had a stretch of bad luck and it took more than four hours to finally get the recipe I needed, only to realize I didn’t have any of the parts to craft it. I had to farm for another hour to get the Data Fragments to buy the parts in the store.If you don’t mind the grind, then it is worth picking up, but that is not an enthusiastic recommendation."

It has a tactical rpg set up where you place monsters on a board to battle waves of oncoming monsters. Luckily, it has a pause button(can be turned off if you want more difficulty), so you can strategize more easily without rushing. The dev(s) is a good one, who cares and listens to fans. It has good music, and nice backgrounds. Give this a try if you want a nice tactical tower defense rpg. ---Side note, I like the main male guy Seven, lol. He is pretty cool. I hope Seven gets a chance to be a playable character in one of the Winged Sakura games."
