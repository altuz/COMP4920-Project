I believe a couple of the actors from the film returned for the game.Cons:The game is £7, but it only lasts about an hour, which really isn't worth it.The lip-syncing and mouth animations are very choppy.Conclusion:If you are looking for a game to entertain you for a little while, this is a fine game. It is a little expensive for a hour-long game, but overall, it's innocent enough. I'd probably give it a 6/10."

I got a time of 52:00 flat. The trick was realizing that the underwater apples and pears were acutally NOT a part of the game but an effect from the LSD mashed potatos I ate for dinner. Never the less, this game is still a mastapiece. EA, Ubisoft, Activision could take a page out of Disney•Pixar's book and creat a work of art like this if they weren't big stupid poo poo heads.  I am the greatest there has ever been in Disney•Pixar's Finding Nemo's speedrunning community. If you wish to get an autograph from me message me and I will give you a copy. Slopnopski out!"

I reported a hacker and he got banned... So admins are pretty quick with their decisions. The bad part about this is that theres no male01 so im kinda disappointed."

I had to run this game on low settings. After playing this game for just 10min; I began smelling burning electronics. It was my graphics cards overheating."

No controller support. Has many issues working on multiple monitors. Didn't get a chance to play it for a while, and got no refund. Dont waste even ten cents on this game. My 4 year old was even saying this game sucks."

,Recommended,331450,34526846,Posted: 27 August,all,DreadPolecat218,"I bought this on sale, reminiscing about owning the game on the xbox back in the day. However, this PC version is different, as it's a point and click adventure of the Finding Nemo story. It only took me a bit over an hour to play through the story, because even though you do follow the separate adventures of both Marlin and Nemo, it is an abridged re-telling of the story (I personally am thankful that they kept the shark scenes). The game also includes short clips from the film, which is pretty cool. A good game if you liked the movie or are looking for something chilled out to play."
