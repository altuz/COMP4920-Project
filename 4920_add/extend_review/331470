,Recommended,331470,30201173,Posted: 26 February,all,Bearboots,"Excellent visual novel which hooks you quite early in the story. Honestly suprised this is a free game, as it's of such a high standard. What also makes this visual novel interesting is that it's based in Soviet Russia which is something I personally have very little exposure to. Worth downloading and reading through at least once. For you completionists out there, the game is engaging enough and the endings diverse enough to justify sinking in the extra hours."

It includes awesome music, great backgrounds, sexy girls(you might think only as a look, but also for the actions taken and smartness, because being smart is actually sexy ;) )and a very impressing storyline wich touched me completely and actually changed my life somehow... In a good way :)... The way that everyone interacts and that you feel that you are living the game is just amazing. I played my favoriterouteeven twice to get more motivated. Those who made the game and decided to put it available for free have a very BIG THUMBS UP from me. Great job!"

I got the Alisa bad end.... and it quite honestly and sincerely broke my heart. the game is full of touching moments and has no shortage of conflict. It is in all meanings of the word, aa masterpiece. I sincerely recommend anyone that likes romance-comedies to definitely play this game. You will surely not regret it. I give my thanks to the team that worked .... no.... TOILED, on this game."

Indeed, I had my doubts about this game as soon as I read the disclaimer about suicide. Oh well, whatever, right!? Violence is often glorified these days... nothing out of the ordinary here, I thought.On my first lap I got the 'Lena, bad end'.On my second lap I started aiming for the 'Lena, good end', but got distracted and stumbled upon 'Semyon, good end' instead. That cleared up a few things.If you can look past the naive and suggestive graphics, the completely different -extreme - outcomes possible from seemingly innocent choices make this visual novel interesting. Whether it's actually good or not, I can't make up my mind. At least, the music and background art is good.By recommending it to you, I hope that you and I will have this common experience to relate to if we happen to end up in the same mental ward or insane asylum."

It's worth at least trying if you have any interest in Visual Novels. The premise is that a man takes a bus to a camp for youths in the past.I wish it had music, but there's plenty of great music you can find to add to the game. Personally I listened to a lot of Wintergatan as I played.I will update when I've finished more, but really just try it. No harm done."
,Not Recommended,331470,29455534,Posted: 23 January,all,DawnPaladin,"There's not much gameplay in this game. I like story games a lot, but this one had ten minutes of scrolling through text before I made my first ""go left/go right"" decision. It's a lot of text for how little it tells you.The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable. He has no interests, no qualities other than awkwardness, and no desire to do...anything, really, other than posting on image boards and whining about how boring his life is. If that's supposed to make him relatable, I think I'm insulted.The music and art are excellent, and the game captures the Soviet feel very well. That's about all it has going for it."
,Recommended,331470,29952333,Posted: 15 February,all,Kyo,"Once you get past the animation in this visual novel it becomes something that pulls you in and leaves you wondering what will happen next. The music, while repetitive, is very well done and beautiful. The story starts off slightly bland and lacking of much ""action"" but it soon changes and you will find yourself hoping you are making the right choices.There are many different endings and experiences for every play through and they are all very well doneOne of the best visual novels I have ever played (which is quite a fair amount)ITS FREE!"

,Recommended,331470,29754371,Posted: 6 February,all,Eye of the Wicked Lord,"I just want to start by saying that I do NOT write reviews unless I feel the game really deserves one. Now, I could not stop reading once this started. And once I finally finished the first time (Alisa's good end) I wish I hadn't finished it. I want to play it over again start to finish. In the short time you know them, you develop a real connection to the characters. At first the story was kind of awkward but once you (and Semyon) accept what's going on, it gets really great. If I've captured your attention this long let me just tell you that once you decide on who you want, persue them relentlessly. You won't be disappointed. My only complaint about this game (and it's not even that bad) is that there are a few typos AND THAT I WISH IT HAD NEVER ENDED. If you asked me to donate money for a part two that turns out just as good then I would. VN's are not typically my style but this was an awesome ride. So a big thank you to the developers. You guys did a great job. Now, if you've managed to read this far, download this game. You won't regret it. Thanks for your time"

Sadly, it didn't do it for me. I only played 30 min before giving up. Anime breasts popping up everywhere triggered my anime-breast-sensitive epilepsy I think. Wish they put a warning.Ok, the story is fairly immersive from the start, the graphics are beautiful and atmospheric, and the concept interesting, but the text needs to be edited to the point where it is cut down by at least half. That being said, if you persevere you can get into the flow (and eventully encounter big friendly anime breasts)My understanding of this game's storyline is: 'man feels his life is hopeless but something surreal happens and he can now meet all these stereotypical women whose sole purpose is to change his life and maybe shag him'.Tear jerker.After 20min, The poorly edited text is too draining, and my anime-breast-epilepsy too easily triggered; it is hard to keep my interest in the storyline, since the story line is 'how many hot girls can I fall in love with -and shag?'It's a shame cause I don't mind sexual content in game, but the sexual content in Everlasting Summer feels sneaky and pointless. I read somewhere the game's explicit sexual content had to be removed to be on Steam, which probably messed with how the game should feel as a whole, and would explain why I was so confused and seizing while playing it. Maybe on a different platform this game would have been advertised as a ponographic or erotica game (with a good old 'all the interchangeable women who changed my life when they shagged me' story in it).So, random anime girls whose sole, deep desire is to shag you, just because your sad self fell asleep on a bus? Yes.Complex story about the meaning of life and love? Not sure, but I'm still seizing.I know a lot of people got hooked on the story and alternative endings, and I respect that, I just know that's not going to be me. Looking forward to trying more visual novels, just not this one."

I wasn't sure what to expect from the game/novel and I can say I was surprised and honestly delighted. The writing is very fluid and matches the images and sounds well. The main characters thoughts are honest and humorous and the writer really catches the way certain impulsive thoughts can pop into someone's head.I'm only an hour in and I didn't want to stop, I cant wait to come back and see what happens next."
,Recommended,331470,29710251,Posted: 4 February,all,axe-336,"First, let's get real:  It's hard to not recommend a free game that doesn't crash your computer.  So, yeah, on that basis alone I would say you should download it.But beyond that, this game could easily be priced at $5-10 and be worthwhile.  While the first hour or so made me want to beat my head against a wall for all the ""Woe is me, everyday is so hum drum."" blah blah that is the general setup to sooooo many of these stories, the actual writing and art and music were all rather good so I stuck with it.  Once I got past the tropey introductions of the different characters and got to the meat of the storyline for some of the girls is where I got to the point where I could say the game is worth $5-$10.One of the things I appreciated was that the ""Bad"" end I got on the path with my first girl was still really fulfilling since it involved a conflict between two of the girls that I felt reflected the choices I had made rather accurately, and made me want to play again and try to figure out the deeper layers of the overall story.  Then there's the novelty of the Russian setting, which I know I haven't experienced before from this sort of game, so it was fun getting little tidbits about Soviet ice cream and having Borsch served for meals.So yeah, if you're a fan of this genre there is no reason to not pick up Everlasting Summer for free."
