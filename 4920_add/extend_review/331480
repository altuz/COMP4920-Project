By setting its story of a shamed priest searching for his kidnapped daughter in a beautifully stylized and hand-painted frozen version of hell,""Pinstripe""is loaded with visual metaphors as the narrative dips between uplifting, heart-breaking and downright disturbing. By the time it all wraps up you will feeling a range of feels depending on how affecting you find the stories conclusion. I found it to be a touching and gentle exit given what our poor priest has to go through to get to his little piece of heaven.One word to sum up the experienceCharmingPerformance/Bug related incidentsNo issues with performance or bugs.Pinstripeis pleasure to play.Similar to games""Never Alone"";""Night in the Woods"";""Even the Ocean"";""Selma and the Wisp""Suitable forSuitable for all ages all though some of the imagery might need some explaining to curious young minds.Position in my games of 2017 cleared list15th favoriteRatinghttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453510"

However I understand there's limitations to what one person can produce. So for what we were given, I still highly reccommend picking this up if you have a chance. Especially if you enjoy story driven/puzzle/platformer games like Inside/Limbo, Among the Sleep, etc.Fantastic experience!"

A very smooth running game, no bugs, no complaints, some of you would complain about having to return to some places repeatedly but i found it more interesting, a straight forward playthrough would be very boring with this story. I finished with the nice ending, wonder if I will play through again but be a 'butt head' as the achievement says. Voice acting was PERFECT and hopefully some of you would recognize a couple of the voice actors. Hope you enjoy it!!"
,Not Recommended,331480,31671023,Posted: 10 May,all,FerimElwin,"While Pinstripe has quite an amazing atmosphere and art style, that's really all it's got going for it. The controls feel a bit too slippery for how much platforming is in the game. The necessity to obtain all the clues to a password before the password can be used is frustrating for multile playthroughs. The worst offender is the need to collect 300 frozen drops to buy a ticket. Prior to the need for the ticket it is possible to only collect 308, and more than ten of them can despawn if you leave the area or open your inventory, making it more than possible to leave yourself in a state where the game cannot be beaten and must be restarted. Overall, while it can be an enjoyable experience, I'd say wait until the game goes on sale to purchase."
,Recommended,331480,33100566,Posted: 1 July,all,oxeren,"Pinstipe is an overall very good game, and I do recommend it, the experience is definitely worth it. Don't be discouraged by the fact that in this review I mostly talk about negative stuff.Let's start with the positives. The game's aesthetics are just incredible. It looks great, the music is amazing, the story is touching and well-told. Together all these aspects form a memorable and atmospheric experience.But unfortunately, great aesthetics are hindered by mediocre gameplay. Puzzle-platformer gameplay in Pinstripe is not inherently bad or anything, it's just in the current market it is pretty much generic, feels uninspired, and hinders the story more than it adds to it. It looks like the gameplay is there just because, well, it is a game and it ought to have some kind of conventional gameplay. But the gameplay feels more like it just gets in the way of the story and is there just to prolong the experience. While playing the game, I often thought that I would've enjoyed Pinstripe more, if it were just a walking-simulator kind of game.Anyway, Pinstripe as a whole is still very good. It is just that gameplay is what kept the game from being truly great for me."

,Recommended,331480,32604292,Posted: 20 June,all,MayuMG,"I never had the chance to help kickstart this, but I wish I did. This game was great, but, of course, there's a few kinks.I personally didn't like how the save system worked; it made it difficult to replay and do the secret stuff since it provides a save station, yet you're not in complete control of it. I expected the usual ""if you load, it brings you right to where you were when you saved"" dealie, but this game does ninja secret saves which kinda defeat the purpose of the save points. It would've been okay if it pulled a Skyrim and had a list of saves and a separate slot for autosave to load from, but it doesn't, so that was pretty inconvenient.*START OF SPOLIERS I GUESS*I only got super stuck a couple of times: getting to the ice minigame in Edge Wood and putting the numbers in to get to Red Wash. However, I feel like it was just my fault for not realizing the solutions. I mean, the Edge Wood one seems a bit ""okay, c'mon now; how could you expect me to do that, there, at that time, using only what I know up until that point?"" but it's also kinda iffy to decide on since the solution is somewhat indicated, meaning I might've just been temporarily dumber than the majority, so I'll just be safe and say I was being dumb. The Red Wash one was litterally me just being dumb though. The numbers were clearly indicated (and glowing) at the top, and I just happened to think I couldn't interact with them.*END OF SPOLIERS I GUESS*The jump floatiness gets a little annoying sometimes, especially when jumping on Little Ladies. I also had dificulties when platforming in the 2nd golden padlock room and across the barrel thing. The barrel thing really made me mad sometimes...Otherwise, everything is perfect. Art is crazy great to look at and beautiful, characters are fun and alive, voice acting is awesome, music really fits the moment and gets you into it, story is basic but very enjoyable; it's definitely a game I would recommend to everyone. It's also fairly short, so it's ideal for those who don't have a lot of free time. I litterally played through 6 times.All in all, yes, it has its small kinks, but I can tell you one thing for certain: this game has lots of heart in it, and it really shows. Please play it; you won't be disappointed. :D"

With such amazing games like Pinstripe to experience , I must say that I am  very gald to have done so. As a kid, this is kind of along the lines  of how I dreamt that games world one day be like.For me Pinstripe is a pure magick. The blend of the beautifully atmospheric sound track, excellent voice acting along with the solid story and gorgeous graphics, for me made this a fantastic gaming experience. This is also one of a number of  games where ive found myself stopping for a minute to float away  to the tune of the magic sounds and sights. Honestly, there is so much soul in this game.The comedic elements of some of the voice acting creates a nice balance between the darker elements of the game. Pinstripe himeself did make me chuckle right from the start. There is a fair amount of back tracking as others have said, however, for the likes of me who love the environments themselves, having to do so is a joy rather than a pain.The game is not that difficult at all, and I can understand the complaints of more hardcore gamers who find this too easy. For me personally though, I myself am far from a great gamer, and I dont want the only thing in a puzzle gaming experience which i can effectively crack to be that  my own computer screen (as my controller takes flight from my hands at 3am bonkers level frustration). The puzzles are of a straight forward nature, however, I think the balance is just right. Many will disagree. YMMV.All in all  I will say that I loved this game and that I most certainly highyly recommened it. This game was a beautiful experience and one which I was extremely  happy to loose msyelf in during the 6 or so hours in which I played it. A great and magkical game indeed this is."

Now the second run is the real deal if wanted to go for the 100% which maybe I will but for now yes I recommend it. It short (yes it can be completed in less than a hour) but the experience is good, so maybe an opportunity to this game is worth your time and money."
,Recommended,331480,31524850,Posted: 3 May,all,Squish92,"Thomas Brush had the opportunity to be the ever-rare video game auteur. Every creative choice was his to make, all the way down to the music, which is unheard of in games.The result is a short (around 2 hours, perfect length for what the game tries to do) puzzle-platformer with mild combat. But what's more impressive is the tight story, impeccable visual design and the sublime music.Very mild spoilers here, but I was anticipating the story to go down the easyreligious cynicismroute and it never did. That element of the story was just a backdrop to hang the main character's arc on, and I have immense respect for that.I would say that this game didn'tquitestrike me with that feeling of ""awe"" that I'm always seeking in video games, but I have a ton of artistic respect for Brush in making all of the components of his game come together in a cohesive vision. And I'm eagerly awaiting whatever he makes next!"

I ALWAYS get stuck in these games and end up googling a walkthrough becuase I am so impatient. I only did it once or twice here, only to realize that I already had the answer I was seeking. This game hits all my favorite points, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I stumbled upon it randomly (right after completing 'Thimbleweed Park,' which I also found when I wasn't looking for it. Great game, I cannot say enough about it. My only (sort of ) criticism... I didn't want it to end! Do not bother reading all the reviews, just BUY IT! Worth it at full price, or more. Beautiful, creepy, engaging... Wish there were more like ""Pinstripe' out there."
76561197971783216,Recommended,331480,34082421,Posted: 7 August,all,Aerisnoir,"Bought this game alongside Detention, Oxenfree, & She Remembered Caterpillars as I was searching for 'easy going games with high levels of atmosphere, an interesting 'quirk' and a nice narrative as bonus'. Pinstripe definitely delivered on all fronts.This game is your generic platformer plus puzzle combo but has its own art style and great voice actors delivering funny lines. It controls smoothly and solidly, and it was fun to encounter different types of puzzles within the game and none of them should stump you for more than a few minutes at best.I do understand the complaint about needing to backtrack to collect 300 frozen drops at some point, but I only experienced this as a mild hindrance to the flow of the game. Mostly due to the risk of losing drops because they either fall to unreachable locations or near exits. My advice for this is to be mindful of where you kill enemies (rooftops, chasms, level exits) and to scrounch early on just to make it easier. It wasn't anything I lost sleep over. You'll reach it fast enough."

I'm on my second playthrough now because i want to get the achievements (though i didn't get the achievements yet from my first run... weird..maybe something wrong with the game? ... steam?) I got the tommy gun and it's so ridiculous :)
,Recommended,331480,31473988,Posted: 30 April,all,WeeAddy,"Pinstripe is a good example of indie games that can surprise you. I checked it out based purely on the fact that some of the cameo voice actors (Dan from NSP, and JackSepticEye) retweeted the announcement of the release of the game on Twitter. From there, I just bought it on a whim to surprise myself, having no idea whether or not I'd like it. Have to say, I loved it.The gameplay itself is very basic, it's mostly walking around and interacting with the many NPC's, who provide you with the help to get you from point A to point B, or just to give you a chuckle. Humour is subjective, but I think the game does it quite well with the characters it has, albeit it is a little odd to have the antagonist - who seems so feirce and horrifying at first - calling you childish names. It's an interesting mix between creepy as all Hell, but ridiculously stupid - and I love it. The game takes itself seriously, whilst not at the same time.The premise is that your daughter has been kidnapped by Pinstripe, a man/spirit thing who intends to adopt Bo and make her his own daughter. Why? It's never really explained. No idea what his grudge is against our player character Ted, but we'll ignore that for now. But he seems like a terrifying entity of pure evil, but then a little bit into the game, he'll call you something silly like a ""freakishly looking♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" or something. It might put some people off to take you out of the immersiveness a bit for a silly insult, and even other NPC characters who fart while they talk, but it's all down to personal taste, and I think adds to the games charm and keeps it from just being drab and dull the whole time for the sake of a gritty story.The voice acting matches the writing, and is brilliantly done by all involved. Lines are delivered with just the right amount of care where needed, as well as the right amount of sass and sarcasm.The gameplay, stated by the dev himself, isn't very much to look at -- the game is mostly about the story. But I did find it fun wandering through the environments trying to find what secrets I could, some were easily missable if you're just running through not paying attention. The game is mostly exploring the maps, but it combines a slingshot early on for use in those maps, and it's how you progress through most of the game. The inventory system is a bunch of clues you find along your way to help with various puzzles later down the road, all of which are easily solved by examining the clues correctly (which I got stuck on one time), and it never seems to hard, or too easy. Sprinkled in are a few cool mini-games, which serve as a nice distraction for a simple reward like frozen oil drops, these include timed lock mechanisms, a flappy bird kind of game, and spot the difference - all of which don't take long at all to complete and don't completely intrude on the game.All in all, really fun game. There's more I've yet to explore, such as playing through using the meaner responses (as you can respond to some NPC's with specifically story-based ""nice"" or ""mean"" responses, which may or may not effect your ending -- haven't tested that yet), and exploring the games few golden padlock doors. There's also various items you can acquire in the game with the frozen drops that you can't get on your first playthrough, and I definitely want to try and grab them if I can.I definitely recommend the game. It takes around 2hrs or so to beat for your first time, so I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but I'm still happy I got it. It's a fun experience to go on, and if you're in to story games, it's a nice little story about a father and the search for his daughter that'll be sure to brighten your spirits with its charming characters. And maybe weird you out a little too. Sack juice, anyone?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f42I21kZpRc&index=1&list=PL-Pmyaz5meWxupjdpSFiPLyKmz6jJDVqM"

,Recommended,331480,34747770,Posted: 4 September,all,Dravvad,"Preface:The game has some horrible programming for achievements, as you can see people complain in Discussions. I went through the whole game without an achievement when at least a couple of them should have unlocked, and then randomly 3 of them unlocked at once on my second speedrun when I entered a room. Note that I had re-verified my game files right before this happened as well. I'm not quite sure, but you'll likely have everything unlock in an improper order. Some people even got the achievement for beating the game without damage when they died multiple times, and they didn't get any other achievement.(EDIT: Supposedly the above issue is fixed according to the developer.)Review:The only reason I'm giving this a ""Yes"" is because of the art design.Pinstripe is a simple platforming game, very easy to play. The gameplay is just exploring around, shooting a slingshot at some enemies, and navigating between a handful of areas. But it has some great atmosphere in the graphics and sound, which includes some voice acting that I found to be amazing. If the artistic design was not that good, I would not have played the game, as it is overly simple and much of the short time is spent backtracking to collect repetitive items.I'd say the game is not worth the $14.99 it is, despite the style. The story has next to nothing to do with you being a minister, other than the fact that the game is in Hell. I guess the developers thought the story would seem more shocking if the character was a minister, but it didn't really change much. Even then, the story is understandable and I like it. I am not sure why some people seem to think the story does not explain things to you.Give the game a try, but at a discounted price. You'll hopefully like the art style and voice acting, at least."

I've heard complaints about grinding, I assume for the purchase costing 300 frozen drops, but the game teaches you and guides you based on what you learn without holding your hand along the way. It's a beautiful game with a very intuitive way of showing the player what to do. And as I finished the game, I realized there was clearly more to explore, so I look forward to unlocking the secrets of Pinstripe.The story begins to make sense if you truly take time to play, and pick up the clues. One can easily just rush through and ignore the information, but if you look at what's there, you see the story of the ex-minister, how he died, what happened to him and his daughter, and his wife long ago. I won't give things away, but WHO Pinstripe really is doesn't matter as much as other things you learn along the way. Take your time, smell the roses."

Backtracking is mandatory, solely for fetching more items - though there is no explanation what these items are, or why they're named the way they are. Enemies require no effort to overcome at all - including the final boss. There were 1 or 2 little puzzles with complex physics, which I thought were reasonable, but it was pure chance that led me to figuring out how to approach them. Pacing was consistent throughout, except for immediately at the beginning, where you're encouraged to rapidly seek pursuit, only to discover that you've got to run back and forth through multiple screens.Aesthetically, it's consistent in the style, however the gradiant banding on virtually all the sprites was painful and - I feel - completely avoidable.The music is nice, but you ignore that it's there most of the time, as it doesn't swell and bellow at key points so much as it remains too subtle. It stays within its limits, but fails to support the gameplay. That being said, I acknowledge the diverse skillset required for one person to complete every aspect of this game.I regret the time I spent playing this to completion. Although there is replayability consideration, that in itself is a frustration - as the replay function means some features are ONLY unlocked on replay - with your first playthrough leaving you puzzledwhere the GOD DAMN golden key is...I suspect the reviewer from TIME magazine must have been in an especially melancholy mood and completely naive to most digital entertainment to have found this game so emotionally pivotal, when compared to some of the incredible work out there.On nearing the end of the game, it felt as though this had a much larger scope that was chopped late in development - rather than early.It's a good try, but a tad undercooked."

And I have no regrets.What is there to say about this game? The art style is minimalist but gorgeous, and goes perfectly with the soundtrack. The music switches between eerie, heartbreaking, and beautiful with a flawlessness I have yet to see matched by another indie game. Immersion is important in any game, and Pinstripe pulls that off wonderfully. I became invested in Ted, and really, actually wanted to get Bo back.Gameplay wise, the physics surprised me on how good it was. I found the puzzles logical and an interesting kind of hard, as opposed to just frustrating. The 'find the difference' puzzles were by far my favorite; challenging as well as simply lovely to look at.The NPCs you interact with run the whole gamut, from creepy to hilarious, and it was the voice acting that made that possible. All the voices in this game are absolutely stellar in their own right, and I commend the voice actors for doing a fantastic job. The characters add another layer of story and atmosphere to the game, again in a manner I haven't seen done so well very often.All in all, I truly enjoyed this game. Fifteen dollars is a bit pricey, but personally I would say that it is absolutely worth it. This game was a five year long labor of love, and it shows how much work was put into it. I reccomend buying this game to people who are interested in a game that will make them completely immersed in an experience."

Don't get me wrong for the time playing it I was enjoying every second. it's beautiful, fun, the story is fantastic and the puzzles are interesting... But it's short. Really, really short..... I don't know how to feel really, on the one hand I want to recommend this to my friends but on the other hand I feel rather let down at the lack of actual game.Other problems:  .Combat was more or less worthless really, they introduce a few enemies early on and they show up here and there but they're really just there as obsticles for puzzles and small road blocks. just felt left out and wanting. Firing is smooth and nice but I didn't find combat challenging at any point so I would have liked to have seen it fleshed out more..The game became unstable after playing for about 2 to 2 and a half hours in which made it rather annoying when it crashed on me 3 times, once even at the end and I had to do a bit over again because of it. It's been out for only a few days so I'm sure they'll fix it just know it is a thing as of when I'm writing this..(tiny issue) theres moments where you try to do a puzzle and it doesn't go off... only happened once so it's not a huge deal but it did stall me at the very end of the game :lOverall I have to say great idea, amazing story, nice controls, atmosphere was appealing and really set the mood, but it was just way to short and I feel if it had been longer some of the features would have really shined and led to an overall better experiance for the player. It was only 15.00 so I'm not to upset about this, had it been more I would have probably been quite upset but the price is ok for this."
,Recommended,331480,31514075,Posted: 2 May,all,Whiteheart,"I’ve often found that indie games are so much more emotional and heart driven than AAA games, and Pinstripe is certainly no exception to this fact. Every aspect of the game is perfectly cohesive and immersive from the beginning to the end and I loved every minute of it. Everything about Pinstripe flows together so well to create a hauntingly beautiful and story-driven game. Each element from the graphics, to the music, to the voice acting was extremely well done. The only problem in the game I had was a tiny bit of lag every now and then while jumping. The only other issue is the price point. The game is short and at $15 it’s a bit on the pricey side, but I’m happy to be supporting the talented developer behind the gameCheck out my full review on my website:http://bytesizegeek.com/pinstripegamereview/"
,Recommended,331480,31522316,Posted: 3 May,all,OtherRyn,"The Good: The art style is consistent and amazing. The voice acting is perfect. The puzzles are mildly brain-bendy but not impossible. The story unfolds nicely. Choices you make lightly impact the closing scene.The Bad: No ability to change volume control in-game. No ability to change controller settings.The Meh: The climax event felt short. And if you have certain items, it's no different than any other combat. There wasn't a huge payoff for success. NG+ is not made more difficult, nor does any of the story change. (I haven't been able to get through to Vintage Mode and likely will attempt to do so at a later date.)Pinstripe is nicely done and well presented, though it left me wanting more."

Saw that it was complete and knew I had to get it. The eeriness of the game was put in so well and it gave the game the perfect atmosphere to keep you caught up in the game. Of course it gives you that little joy when you recognize the voices of your favourite You Tuber's throughout too. Each character had a great uniqueness that kept you hooked and kept the game interesting throughout. Mr. Pinstripe was done and voiced so well and I definitely got the chills every time his creepy voice would threaten poor Bo, The challenges throughout were great and I definitely enjoyed having to do a little thinking on some of the puzzles (and reminded me how awful I was at flappy bird). I was really hooked from start to finish and I replayed the game again just to be able to really appreciate the atmosphere and art work. Great game and I am so happy to have played this!

,Recommended,331480,31549000,Posted: 4 May,all,TINY ANGRY CRAB,"So far I have played roughly an hour, and I am enjoying it a lot. It takes a lot from his previous game - coma - at least inasmuch it is a dark, atmospheric game with an emotional charge and a sense of loss. It carries the same interests too; body noises, mushrooms and dark goo mix with an interesting early 1900s nightmare before christmas aesthetic.While coma was an entertaining distraction, however, with puzzles that required very little thought (except for one bizarrely taxing musical test at the end) this game has vastly better puzzling credentials. Thus far the puzzles have been both satisfying and not obscure, ramping up in difficulty and neatly interlocking with and drawing attention to the thematic elements of the game (for example; a pill bottle used to treat an illness is linked with a childish note about treasure with tragic implications...)The acoustic soundtrack is particularly worth picking out; his last game had an exceptional soundtrack, with redwind field in particular being wonderful, and this game continues that, veering between eerie and soothing as the situation demands.If I have any major criticism is it that the tone of the writing is variable, and a couple of guest voices that are, ahem, out of place.For those interested in off-kilter games with a strong aesthetic and tone this is well worth your time. It is exceptional, and for the price doubly so!"
