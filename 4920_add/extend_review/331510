My play through went flawless during the two hours i played.No glitches or half-done stuff just pure eye and ear-candy from the first colors till the end.I warmly reccomand this game if you want a break from the regular noisy comers games.Big thanx to Moondrop

It is stunningly beautiful, and I feel very sorry to give it a thumbs down but it's just too irritating!I don't mind having to put some thought into a puzzle solution, and it can be a great feeling when you finally get it, but if the physics are unpredictable it just becomes an exercise in frustration.  As an example, in the ""fireworks"" level I could see what I needed to do after a moment.  But getting it done?  (Potential spoilers.)I finally got one bench positioned just right so that a rocket went straight outside where it needed to - great!  Now I just have to get the other one in the correct place to direct the rocket into the sky, right?  Except that the next 8 or so rockets I fired all went in slightly different directions to the first one and not one of them made it outside.  The amount of precision needed to get the rocket at the exact same angle in the lantern every time (I'm presuming that was the issue) took any fun out of the endeavour for me.I eventually got it done after maybe 25 minutes or so (more through luck than judgement), had a quick go at the following level, and gave up for the night when that one looked to be even more frustration just waiting to happen.Added to that is the issue mentioned by another reviewer of not being sure what the chains are actually capable of and when they might break, which often seems illogical and just adds to the frustration when you finally get something right and then moving something else breaks that perfect positioning.Perhaps a tutorial with more information might be helpful here, or at least a couple of levels where learning the tolerances of the chains and objects might be easier and not cause so much irritation.  Figuring out how to play in the beginning was fun, but the difficulty of understanding the apparently-unpredictable physics after a few levels took that fun away.I'm sorry, developers - you've made an incredibly beautiful game that just isn't very much fun for me, and fun is more important than looks in the end.  Although it was relatively cheap on sale, my funds are too limited to waste right now so I'm afraid I'll be requesting a refund.  :("

The stained glass, art style and hauntingly, beautiful music are the strength of the game, but sadly are not supported well enough by the gameplay. While the mechanics are interesting, the puzzles never really challenge the player, and feel like they were the last thing on the developers mind. I really enjoyed my time in the world of Amphora, and give it 7 out of 10.Designed by Moondrop, a two person Norwegian developer, Amphora is a physics puzzle game, with a strong narrative. The main story of Amphora follows a girl as she grows from a baby to a young woman, meets a partner, and then struggles through the challenges of war. The story is beautifully portrayed through the speechless and text-less imagery of the game, with perfectly paced and balanced music, supporting it every step of the way.Moondrop aimed to portray their tale through a shadow theatre style, and with the striking colour schemes used, have made an outstanding visual experience. The music used through this touching tale is a cross culture mix and is a pleasure to listen to.The main puzzle mechanics of Amphora are simple. The player is able to move objects within a certain area, and utilise various chains for hanging objects, pushing and pulling objects and for adding weight to lever systems. These base mechanics all work in well with the general physics of the game world, but sadly I found the puzzles all too often lacked depth.In fact, I got so deep into my puzzle solving mind frame, that I started to smash through levels too quickly and missed large chunks of story all together. Don't get me wrong the puzzle mechanics are clever, but the developers missed opportunities to overlay multiple mechanics or really utilise the physics system.I recommend taking your time with this game. Stop at the start of each level and soak up the ambience and think about what the scene is saying to you, before diving in and solving the puzzle. I used this approach on my second play through and found it to be far more rewarding. The playtime of this title may be a little short for some gamers, at only a touch over an hour, but after completing this game I wasn't disappointed.For my full review and other delicious content seeGlitch"

I come back to it once in a while and it wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit. Not only graphics, concept and music, but also the story makes me fall in deep love with this game. The way the story is told is marvelous and knowing the plot never stops me from replaying the game. Even though the story is told in a minimalistic manner, without words whatsoever, I always feel as if I have shared a strong bond with the characters.Not as much of a review as an expression of a deep graditude to the creator. Thank you so very much for something I will never forget."

Some are deceptively hard. Together, all of them weave a wonderful, colorful story of growth, love, and loss.This is a fantastic little gem and I applaudMoondrop's innovation and art design."

You play as an amphora, a magic jar that can do magic things like move objects in this physics-based game, then eventually make sticky threads like spider web strands which gradually get stronger as the game progresses. You are the protector of a child who grows into a young woman and follow her story. There is no dialogue, only tableaus where the puzzles take place. The challenge comes from a limited area in which you can operate, as well as physical barriers. The art is phenomenal, with a silhouette puppet show meets stained glass vibe. The music is likewise great.  All in all, neat story, great art, great music. My only real complaint (besides the fact that I want more of this game, but it's only 2 hours, max!) is that the control to create connections between objects is the same as the one to break them, which means if you are trying to erase a very short connection, or in an awkward place, you end up having to restart because the game ends up making a dozen more tiny connections while you're trying to break one. I had to restart levels lots of time because of this.Great game. 9/10."

And my, what a happy accident this is!A game of love, sorrow and perseverance, Amphora is a stunning art piece by a two-man studio called Moondrop. From the very first scene, I found myself completely immersed within its stained glass visuals and hauntingly beautiful music.  There is no text, speech or even a tutorial. You learn about the game, its story and its mechanics by simply exploring the lovely scene in front of you. That might sound a bit troubling, but in practice it works wonderfully.Even though some of the puzzles are quite easy, I recommend taking it slow. Try to look beyond the puzzle and explore the scenery, otherwise you'll easily miss out on the story.Overall, Amphora has been one of my favourite gaming experiences in 2015 so far. I have a feeling Moondrop is another Supergiant in the making. Time will tell..."

Each puzzle of the game silently, wordlessly exists as a single moment in a dramatic love story.  If that sounds appealing to you, you will likely love this game.It's not flawless.  Occasionally, both the puzzles and the game mechanics suffer from being so vague that the general lack of a clear goal is completely responsible for the puzzle difficulty.  But most of the puzzles are clever and creative enough that this doesn't weigh things down."

Какой ритм, какой звук, какая атмосфера! И эта музыка не упакована в непонятные форматы, а спокойненько лежит себе в папке с игрой…Так, стоп. Я же пишу отзыв об игре, а не о саундтреке.  Действительно, в этой игре сразу бросаются в уши и глаза две вещи: музыка и графика. Всё это очень атмосферно и сочно наполняет игру от начала до конца. Но к сожалению, промежуток между началом  и концом в Амфоре не так уж и велик, уровни проходятся быстрее, чем длятся их загрузки, а уровней не особо много (за 5 часов я прошла игру раз 10, при этом получив все достижения) . Сначала трудно сообразить, что делать в тот или иной момент, но затем понимаешь всю суть, и уровни начинают завершаться один за другим.Я бы сказала, что 300 рублей это не стоит, но всё же рекомендую игру. Почему? В ней можно неплохо повеселиться, прицепляя пугало к двум людям и кидаясь черепахами. Ну а если серьёзно, то Амфора создаёт особенное сказочное настроение, которое пойдёт на пользу любым творческим людям и, возможно, вдохновит на парочку шедевров. Кого-то игра заставит немного поломать голову, у кого-то вызовет улыбку. На распродаже, если таковая будет, можно брать без сомнений.Вывод:Цену на игру следовало бы назначить в два раза меньше, вам решать, согласиться на её приобретение или же взять что-то аналогичное. Хотя подобный интересный квест с чудесной начинкой вы вряд ли найдёте.Oh yeah, once again, once again I need to listen to this masterpiece soundtrack at the beginning of the game. What the rhythm, what the sound, what the atmosphere! And this music wasn't packed in some unknown format, it is just placed in the folder of the game…Um, stop. I'm writing mention about the game, not the soundtrack… Indeed, there are two things in this game that catches the eye and the ear – music and graphics. They fills the game with brightness from the beginning to the end. But unfortunately, the interim between them isn't big, levels can be passed faster than their loadings, and the number of levels isn't big at all (for 5 hours I passed the game about 10 times and get all achievements). For the first time it's difficult to grasp what to do in some moment, but then you understand the whole point, and levels end one by one.I would have said, the game doesn't justify the cost, but I still recommend it. Why? You can have fun hitching the scarecrow to people and throwing turtles. More seriously, Amphora creates the special fabulous mood which can benefit creative people and, perhaps, inspire them for some masterpieces. The game can make you puzzling over or bring a smile. You can buy it on sale without doubts.To sum up,the price of this game should be several times smaller. Well, it's your decision to buy this game or something else. It's hard to find similar interesting quest with wonderful filling, though."

The puzzles got hard in the end, and I needed quiet some time to figure out what I had to do,but it was fun.

Even with struggling on puzzles I was able to complete the game twice in under five hours... and I left the game running during a break for dinner so it's really even less than that. Now, I don't like to judge a game's worth on it's length, and I've played plenty of short games that I'd happily pay $5, $10, even more for, but this is not one of them, so I recommend catching it on sale when it's only a few dollars. The game isn't just short though, the content is lacking. Aside from a few puzzles that you may struggle with, most of them are simple enough to complete in seconds. The ""story"" it supposedly tells is disjointed and the few puzzles that will give you problems (and those problems won't be in solving them, but in getting the physics to work on your side) will make you forget the story entirely when you spend 20 minutes trying to throw a fireball at a soldier. On the other hand it is a beautiful game, truly. The stained glass art style is enchanting and the music is pleasant, but whether that's enough to make the game worth it is up to you-- for me, eh, it evened things out.Overall:+ art style+ music+ concept is fun, in a crayon physics sort of way+ when it works, it works and will make you smile- way too short- fails at telling its story- most of the puzzles are too easy- the difficult puzzles are difficult because of uncomfortable physics, with only one or two requiring you to actually figure out a clever solution"
,Recommended,331510,25672284,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,mr.myshka,"Amphora is a short, but exceedingly beautiful puzzle-game. I bought it solely for its visual design, though the gameplay and overarching story were fitting, welcome additions.The game operates in a series of interactive, scenes that follow the life events of the nameless female protagonist. In these scenes, you complete anywhere from one to several actions to trigger an event. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the solutions to a few scenes, but overall the puzzle portions are pretty simple. And I say simple, not boring. Later solutions can take a bit of thinking though, a bit of ruminating on what exactly you're trying to do, and what kinds of options you have available to you (you gain a few different skills as the scenes progress). Of course, there's always the ""try it and see"" approach, but I think most things are better solved by careful observance. There are also multiple ways to complete the scenes.Overall, the gameplay was fun, and sometimes challenging, but the best part of this game is the stunning visual design. The sound design is also light, but effective."

Mostly everyday struggles.It's really hard to decide whether to recommend Amphora or not. As said above, it looks stunning and sounds marvelously. But awkward unpredictable game physics almost ruined it for me. And yes, the plot. It sometimes becomes incredibly hard to make out what exactly is happening and what to do with all this.What I really liked is the chance to roleplay. If you get too furious about your lads' stupidity, you may go full berserkand slam those ret@rded basards across the screen, throw knives, grenades, animals, lava and other pieces of environment at them. Unfortunately, they don't die but nevertheless give you a slight emotional relief.So yeah, Amphora is recomended for aesthetes and creative minds who like to play games in their own creative wayslol"

With matching music and sound effects where necessary, it sets a great atmosphere.The puzzles are nicely 'paced' begining with very basic solutions, and getting more difficult in time, introducing new mechanics as you go.  Few of the puzzles felt more of a dexterity check, than anything else and by the end some of the tasks (or usable elemenets for them) weren't as clear - but those were singular occurances.Sadly the game is extremly short, given it's original price.

For the most part this was not a particular problem, as after a short bit of time I could figure out what I had to do to get things moving along.There were, however, one or two puzzles the frustrated me a good deal, because I had figured out what to do but it felt like the placements of the objects and the lines seemed finicky to the point where I essentially had the solution but it was off by just a hair or two.Despite this annoying aspect, I feel like overall the game was well done and an enjoyable experience because there wasn't much problem with the other puzzles and the visuals and the audio were so aesthetically pleasing that it was hard to dislike the game just for the little trouble it caused.Given the mostly positive aspects of the game I would reccomend it, but it would probably be better to get on a sale as it is a shorter game (it took me about 4 hours to get all the achievments, which I did through two playthroughs - my second one obviously being much shorter than the first because I knew the solutions)."
