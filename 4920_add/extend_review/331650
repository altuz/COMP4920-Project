,Recommended,331650,32120143,Posted: 1 June,all,cyan0s1s,"This is a follow-up review to my previous Carmageddon reviews, so I will only refer to what is new here.Carmageddon TDR 2000 is the third game in the controversial vehicular combat series. Released in 2000 and developed by Torus Games, an Australian developer known for their family-oriented games based on popular licenses.Stainless Games, the devs behind Carma were not involved and for valid reasons, as SCi had forced them to push C2 out the door only a year after C1 became a hit, which had pushed the small team to exhaustion and is likely the reason why C2 didn't receive an expansion like C1 did in addition to features being cut or not polished. Despite these setbacks C2 was still a hit, and SCi were ordering them to pump out more Carma shortly after to which Stainless told SCi to sod off. But not before SCi was granted the IP in order to have other devs create what would've likely became a series of Carma spinoffs.Except only one saw the light of day, since after TDR 2000 SCi cancelled Carmageddon TV and failed having the series successfully rebooted until their eventual merge into Eidos Interactive in 2005. In February of 2009 Eidos PLC were bought in a takeover by Square Enix. Then finally in June of 2011 Stainless had bought back the rights to Carmageddon from Square Enix. TDR 2000, or TDR as it will be referred as from this point on is therefore considered a spinoff from Stainless' mainline series and they typically look back upon it with negativity, most likely due to their relationship with SCi and their lack of creative control over the project. The critical reception was also mixed as the gameplay was not a significant advancement over C2, which resulted in lackluster sales and blurred chances of there being a fourth installment. But was it really that bad?Off the bat TDR is the most story oriented Carma in the series, as demonstrated with three opening intro movies. The setting this time is thought to be set somewhere after the events of C2's final level which involved setting off a nuclear device that ends the world, which would explain the heavy post-apocalyptic themes in TDR. Except this cannot be the case, as each Carma is its own self-contained universe and timeline. C1 was set in the near future whereas C2 was a more contemporary setting (1998), while TDR is straight up Mad Max. C:R/C:MD went back to C1's setting later on.The story is about a new millennium gone wrong, cities swell with overpopulation and the beaten down police watch as crime spirals out of control. Those suffering the anarchy want the old values, so new towns called subates are created, segregated and tightly policed. The old cities are emptied until all that's left is the poor and the scum. Their hatred of everyone and everything drives them to further lawlessness and they gain control of the cities. Once they begin to threaten the subates an executive decision is taken and nuclear warheads rain down on the cities, killing millions. The survivors, twisted by fallout and mutation are denied help and left to suffer, yet their strength, numbers and hatred grew. The subate bosses build walls around the cities, isolating radiated prisons where criminality is the only way of life. Cops only venture into this hell if they think the gangs are becoming capable of creating weapons or technology that will give them an edge. No one dare crosses between these two worlds. It will take a four-wheeling genius with no morals, a killer instinct and a burning passion to escape. Since the nuking, no such person has existed. Until now. Max Damage, the avatar of prior games, is now a prisoner who participates in a death race to earn his freedom.The missions from C2 return, which now serve as the game's progression of the story, unlike C2's which acted more like self-contained challenges and only barred you from going onto the next group of races. But while C2 only had a mission after three races, in TDR after each race you will have to do a mission. Each group in TDR contains 3 races and 3 missions, for a total of 24 races and 25 missions spread across 9 groups in total. The environments include a whoppin' three cities, a theme park, a docks, a military base, a desert which has the most blatant usage of the Mad Max license, and the final location is set in the clean and futuristic Police State. The Nosebleed Pack also adds 1920s and Hell levels as bonuses, non-canon to the plot.There are 49 vehicles to choose from this time around, most of them new to the series, with 10 more added courtesy of the included expansion, making this the beefiest Carma for sheer variety, although there's notably less heavyweight types near the end like there was in Stainless' games. The cops are back from C1, including the mighty Suppressor, but they're all notably easier to waste this time around thanks to the user operable PUPs introduced from C2, especially the redone Afterburner, which is a real beast this time and treats your car like a jet-propelled rocket which can make for great fun. Some peds also make an effort to fight back, annoying you with steel pipes and Molotovs, while the smart ones flatten themselves against walls to make them harder to hit, but overall they're the same as they've always been. Like C2 you can buy your opponents' vehicles but the parts shop from C1 returns as you manually upgrade your APO between events. You start off underpowered and become overpowered before long, especially if it's all you invest your earnings in.Visually the game is superior to C2 and looks surprisingly good still for an early 00's title, especially launching the game via Hi-Res, which loads the original uncompressed textures. The in-house engine does a great job showing off detail, with improvements across the board. Wheels can be torn off cars now and detachables are commonly seen. Splitting and crushage still exist, although harder to pull off, but vehicles can be made to easily bend and coupled with losing wheels it can render some opponents immobile. Ped gore displays thick clouds of crimson and an eyeball or beating heart if you look close enough, bringing that C1 style of gore back, but actual dismemberment is more limited than it was in C2.Sound design is excellent, very loud and crunchy for collisions with other cars bringing more of that C1 feel unlike C2's more soft and squishy feel. Peds are appropriately squishy though and everything from engine sounds to collisions with the environment sound intimidating and impactful. The soundtrack consists of 'Plague' and 'Utah Saints' for a total of six songs, which is less than other games. I didn't really care for the music this time around and played my own instead.Criticisms are more numerous than other games. The timer is the biggest enemy in the game and the strictest timer in the series, only going up to 4 minutes. Peds net a measily 2 seconds per kill, making them nearly worthless to farm for more time. They're harder to kill too (likely from being radiated) so you need to drive very fast to instakill them, making chaining ped combos harder as a result. Checkpoints grant a time bonus, the only time in the series, as Torus likely encouraged the 'racing' aspect more-so in TDR than Stainless did. Memorizing and farming time bonus PUPs and wasting other cars is crucial to stay in the race for any meaningful amount of time. Some missions can be very tricky at first, especially on first time attempts, but as a whole they're not nearly as frustrating as the ones in C2 IMO. Changes to vehicle handling and physics is less realistic, resulting in less chaos and therefore slightly less fun, and player permadeath from C2 is still here too, but at least you can keep the credits you earned, making it not nearly as much of a waste of time.If considered for what it is I think it's a great game still. If taken as a Carma game it's weaker than most but I like it more than C2. As such I still recommend it. Wasted 'em!3.5/5"

It's my favourite in the series, despite it always having been considered the red-headed step child within the Carmageddon family. Totally unique, but also the only racing game I can call 'atmospheric'. A serious blast and a worthy successor to Carmageddon II and the original in every single way. At least most of us can agree it's better than Max Damage, right?The Great:++Same old Carmageddon gameplay++Lots of area variety++Lots of vehicle variety with some seriously crazy contraptions++Very long game for a racerThe Good:+Seriously great graphics on hi-res mode compared to other games of the year with a very vibrant colour palette+Same great subtle humour as the other games+Music is catchy, if repetitive. Also not included on Steam version :(+Great sense of speed+The ways of upgrading vehicles and buying them is the best way they've managed to do it in the series+Missions are a joy this time around, unlike the artificially difficult, downright sadistic missions of its predecessor+Amazing atmosphere that I've never felt in any other game+Includes two cars (Enforcer is the best in the game) ripped straight out of the Mad Max series, which very few people know+As long as you read the description on the story page and do what it tells you, running this game well is incredibly easy and the framerate is insanely high+Sound design is unique with some otherwordly audio, suiting the kind of 'off' atmosphere of the game+Physics are brilliant+Works perfectly with third-party controller supportThe Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:+-Same sound effects for crashing is pretty funny more than anything-+4 minute limit on timer. A lot of people have a major problem with this but honestly with so many time powerups around and cars to destroy it's never an issue for me. You could also try not playing on the hardest difficulty.+-Crashes at anything above 1080p, unfortunately, so no 4K Carmageddon TDR2000The Bad:-A huge step down from Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now's wonderful vehicle destruction. Vehicles now crumble in the same predictable ways.-Some missions are really ♥♥♥♥ing hard on the hardest difficulty-Missions are somewhat repetitive-Very glitchy physics-Peds only give about 4 seconds of time and are hard to kill, which really sucksThe Horrible:--N/ASound: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Content/Replayability: 8.5/10Overall: 8.5/10ConclusionI adore this game and will defend it to my dying breath.

I'm not speaking relative either, it's a just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.A lot of the fun in Carmageddon comes from the fact that it lets you drive around like a jackass, running over innocents, destroying your competitors, or exploring the large tracks. That is removed in TDR 2000. It's miraculously stingy in awarding you time, you only get 2 seconds for each innocent killed, as opposed to 8 in the first 2. It may not sound like it's that big of a deal, but there are not as many peds  as in the Stainless games, and it rewards the same for ramming opponents, but it doesn't give you credit for it 80% of the time. It's so inconsistent it's infuriating, and in a game that's supposed to be ""free form"" all it does is force you to play it like a normal checkpoint chaser.Not to mention it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥with every possible setup on a computer that exceeds it's recommended specs.The only thing this game actually does right is having a control scheme that let's you play on a craptop without needing xpadder.Only buy if you want all the Carmageddon games, otherwise stay away like it's Swine Flu.

A racing game where, you not only bash into other cars in a ""Free For All"" demolition durby race to the finish, but you also get to run over people. A game where killing pedestrians also gives you points and money.In this game, the races are super brutal. More cars, more tracks, bigger maps, and more people to run over. I still own the original game, which was made back for Windows 98.In this game, as well as it's previous games, you are in an all out race to not only win, but to survive. Although there are very little weapons, so to speak, the real point is to crash and bash. The more you destroy, the more points and money you make. Destroy your opponents, run over peds, pick up money icons, finishing a race, all earn you money in the end.Because this was redesigned for Steam, you shouold know, even when this was made, there were a few bugs that caused the game to crash once in a while.

76561198008369673,Recommended,331650,13638188,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Drecano,"As I write this,  I am sorta disappointed with Steam release of this game.  It has various faults, namely a crashing bug on one of the missions and no music.But I have played this game before on disc and got it here on Steam because I lost my original disc.So I will base my review on the game I played on disc.TDR is...and always will be, the black sheep of this family.  Its not as good as its older siblings Carma 1 and Carma 2...but its not to say its a bad game in general.  Far from it, it is quite enjoyable.  Its different in that the game has the guts to be a little different.  Hows it so different? you ask.  Its got STORY to it.  Albeit a rather tried and tested style of story, but a story none the less.Basically the rich and the police walled off cities in a bid to keep the "" Drogs, Dregs and the Scum"" out of them for a life of peace and tranquility.  They even went as far as NUKING areas to limit and cripple the outside populace.  So this sets up TDR as a post-apocalyptic game.  It does that rather well in the settings that you race around in, especially the city areas where you see wrecked buildings, motorways, hoards of people around bin-fires to keep warm ect, coupled with the police patrols to keep survivors and gangs in check.Now TDR does return to Carma 1 roots in a way, in that you can upgrade your car in a garage pre-race or mission as opposed to the odd Carma 2 way of doing it on the fly in a race or mission.  But it also has the Carma 2 way of dealing with new cars in that what you wreck, is there to buy for you post-race and the opponent cars are pretty nice, they are in the spirit of Carmageddon.  IE theres useless little cars thats nothing more then just an easy wreck, all the way to trucks, which...yeah...they are trucks.It's got a smoother art style the games before it and does look good.  Impacts do a good job of peeling away and hitting off parts of vehicles that are unfortunate to be hit, much like Carma 2, but I think a bit better then that actually.  The game is a bit meaner though in areas such as time awarded for killing peds, hitting and wrecking others, but it softens the blow a bit by making checkpoints give time, so in a sence giving racing a much bigger incentive then previous titles.The biggest complaint, and I feel its the same for a lot of others who played this, are a certain type of misson.  The type where you have to collect 3 pieces of something, usually a bomb.  I'm not against this type of mission, but sweet jeez, theres LOADS of them and they are tedious to do.  One little mess up and those 5 minutes you spent doing that mission, are for naught.  And you will mess up often cus i feel the driving in this game is not as tight as it should be.  Almost an afterthought in my opinion.TDR is a Carma game, theres no doubt on that, but it will be overshadowed by those older brothers of Carma 1 and 2, however, the game isnt as bad as people make it to be.  Its Carma...but...I guess call it Carma Light....Carma Decaf.  It will still do the job just fine and at £3 currently, its not much to give this a go.  I played worse and paid 10x as much for other titles of a particular game series, so really its not bad for small out-lay.  Give it a shot and see what you think.  Just hoping for the game on here to get fixed up though, cus no music ( despite it being poor ) makes the game feel empty."

Is really good looking for a game released in 2000, i had to stop and admire how good the game looks and that is good because the gameplay helps with a good enviroment. the gameplay is the same as the other carmageddon games. even though it was not developed by stainless, it is still a great game. you can also have a classic carmageddon race or play with the missions in the game. you get a few cars to start and you can extend the garage by buying cars when you completed the race when they are wasted. overall it is a good game. it even has the nosebleed pack in it"
