,Not Recommended,331670,17196094,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,BusBoyBud,"The mechanics of this party game are great. I love being able to whip this game out and everyone can play as long as they have a smart phone... but it gets old rather quickly, especially if you can't find new people to play with. I'm seeing a lot of up-votes and the down-votes are not being taken seriously. I'm going to have to be that guy here and advise you not to buy this game in its current state - at least for said price of $25. The positive reviews are warranted, but would I buy this game for $25 if I knew what I know now? Absolutely not. This is for two simple reasons.1. There really are only two games worth playing in this pack: Fibbage and Drawful. You could argue You Don't Know Jack, but if you'd played it once, it's nothing knew. Besides, if you have more than 4 people in your party, you can't play this game, so it is almost always excluded at most parties. Word Spud isn't even a game. End of story. I wouldn't pay a dollar to play it. Lie Swatter is ok, basically a guessing game between two questions and the luckiest person wins. I never played it enough to see how many questions it contains.2. Fibbage and Drawful are the bread and butter of this pack. These together would be worth the $25, IF they actually had a reasonable amount of stock questions. From what I've heard Fibbage has around 200, and Drawful has ~600. Drawful obviously has the most replay value, but Fibbage seems to always be the favorite at parties. Unfortunately, after a few short hours, you see more repeats than you'd like to admit. Now if you like being the host of a party and don't mind the repeats, this isn't so bad, as long as your guests are different people every time.However, I really don't understand why new questions have not been implemented. Or why there isn't a way to have the community submit their own, or at least create your own for your own game. I'm sure the framework was never built to do those things, but why they thought 200 questions would surely be enough is beyond me. Even with Drawful, you begin to see repeats fairly quickly.What's worse is the developers state it is impossible to get repeat questions until you've gone through them all if you host on a single system. This has been contested by several gamers and I too challenge this statement. I've only hosted on one computer and seen repeats within a few hours.I might as well also note there are a lot of bugs: throwing people out of games, randomly not being able to select answers, etc. They are a nuisance, but don't really seem to deter me or the people I play with as the games themselves are so lighthearted in terms of competitiveness. If that is something that is going to bother you, then I would add that to the list of reasons why not to pick this up at its current price tag.The developers themselves said they won't add new content unless the demand is there. Well consider this my demand.  I want to support these guys, but I feel a little cheated. I expected more out of this game than 5 hours. They've opened up an interesting platform, but I think they or someone else could do this genre better justice and increase replayability. They state you’re gonna need more than one party for this, and that's absolutely true. Because otherwise you'll burn out your audience real quick!UPDATE (1/5/2016): This review received more attention than I expected, so with the successor out on steam now, I feel compelled to give an update on the state of the game. It appears the developers due indeed believe there is demand for more content. Unfortunately that content is in the form of a sequal and a price tag of another $25. I can't speak for the this game's successor, but I can give an update on this games current condition. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to say... This game resurfaced for me on New Years Eve with a (reasonably) fresh audience. The game was still littered with bugs (i.e. no one being able to enter in answers, freezing, booting players, no input recognition, etc.), and the newcomers seemed to agree that only Fibbage and Drawful (though primarily Fibbage) was worth playing. Overall an enjoyable experience for the newbies, but a little lackluster for those who had played with me before. Simply put, the game still lacks polish and solid content.It is a shame the developers have decided to neglect this game and move on to other titles. The platform they've created has a lot of potential, which I feel has gone mostly untapped. I think this platform yearns for a DLC format. Similar to the Heads Up mobile party game, you could buythemed DLC packs for Fibbage or Drawful for just a few bucks. Hell, have a Star Wars themed pack, that would sell like hotcakes right now. Another idea is to sell additional games as DLC to add to your party pack. Giving users the abilityto hand-pick and personalize their party pack for when they host! This would increase the replayability of the game, especially with the same crowd. But at the very least, if they continue down this business strategy of separate releases, it would be helpfulto connect the games, so you can access all the jackbox party games you've bought through one interface... Though, I don't see myself buying another one of these any time soon at a 25 markup."

The other three games are too fast paces.From the few games I played over the internet, I had a lot of fun! I heard some complaints about questions repeating questions, but it's hard for me to say without playing many, many games."
,Not Recommended,331670,13145771,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Mr Windblade,"Hardest no I've ever written.  I love the games in the party pack.  They're a lot of fun.  My family and I have managed to get a few hours of entertainment out of them and I have immensely enjoyed the content.  You Don't Know Jack 2015 and Fibbage both feature Cookie Masterson, which is really the most important thing to know, with Drawful being the surprise hit of the pack.You Don't Know Jack is a classic trivia game show environment where each question is posed, then each player is able to give their answers. Cookie is condescending and evil towards the folks who get it wrong, something that often provides a great spot of humor.Fibbage XL is a fill-in-the-blank trivia game where each player gets to enter an answer, right or wrong, and then those answers are shuffled in with the real answer, at which point each player gets a chance to guess.  Points are awarded to players who get the question right, and to the players who are able to ""trick"" the others into guessing.  There are a few problems with Fibbage, mostly relating to the use of the language.Fibbage's ""true"" answer can easily get lost in the mix.  For example, say the answer to a question is ""Grand Canyon"" and you type in ""the Grand Canyon"" and your friend misses a letter and types in ""Gran Canyon.""  You now have three VERY similar answers, with two of them being functionally correct, and the game won't detect it as being the same as the ""correct"" answer. This is both the source of fun in Fibbage, and a source of frustration.Lie Swatter is a pseudo-trivia game where players must either answer True or False to the statements given.  Some of the ""lies"" are remarkably difficult to spot, and players will enjoy trying to guess them.Drawful requires players to attempt to draw things from the given category, and then other players will try to guess what has been... done.  After guesses are made, players must determine the true name of the category.  Like Fibbage, Drawful suffers from answer ambiguity in that adding articles or making typing errors can render the true answer indistinguishable from the fakes, but c'est la vie.Word Spud, the low point of the pack, is a word association game played by taking random turns adding to the words given previously.  So a 5 turn word order may look like this: Banana Split Decision Election Politics. Points are awarded by players voting on whether the given words were acceptable, so basically the points don't matter.The games scored as individual games:YDKJ - 9/10Lie Swatter - 9/10Drawful - 10/10Fibbage - 9/10Word Spud - 6/10So why No?Pseudo-technical issues.  This game doesn't have actual local multiplayer support.  Internet connection is a MUST, so no taking this game to a party center unless they've got wi-fi.  The game requires that you sign each player into Jackbox.TV - admittedly not that difficult since you can do it from desktops, laptops, cell phones, tablets, toasters, etc. and use your ""room code"" to start the game.  However! This connection to the online servicedoes notgive you actual online multiplayer, either.Players have to be able to see the host's screen in order to see the questions, the answers, and hear the awesome Mr. Mastersonand streaming services have a significant enough delay to where YDKJ players would have a significant host advantage... sometimes by more than 10 seconds.It gets hairy in practice, though - the people playing the game have to be comfortable with their individual devices, or one of you has to be technically inclined enough to be able to make sure everyone's devices are operating as expected for the entirety of the game. So if you've got a friend or relative or partygoer who doesn't have a cell, they're not playing, making this the least casual-friendly party game to date.This leads me to my next problem - while I understand the need for the screen for Drawful, Fibbage, and Word Spud, I can't figure out why YDKJ and Lie Swatter aren't controller compatible.  I should be able to hand each player an Xbox 360 controller (or use my Big Button controllers) which require LITERALLY no technical experience to use and put each player on an even playing field.Xbox 360 controller support is only for playing You Don't Know Jack in single-player mode.That's ultimately my biggest problem with the system as it stands at release - in practice, the game is literally unfair.  My parents are in their fifties and my mother's an amputee.  We can't really play on an even playing field because my ability with the phone doesn't match theirs.So, if you're going to get a group of friends together and they're all on equal footing in the smartphone world, then fine - this is a great game.  If you're going to include anyone else... nope.  Nope nope nope."
,Recommended,331670,13188310,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,AROAH The Cuckboi,"This is hands-down the best party game I've ever played. For the price of You Don't Know Jack alone, you get multiple great games, including an amazing Pictionary-style game that manages to not only have its own identity, but exceeds Pictionary in some ways, mostly in terms of quality of the prompts. I can't say Pictionary has ever asked me to draw ""words"" or ""#throwbackthurs.""Meanwhile, Fibbage manages to take the YDKJ-level of trivia questions and combines it with trying to fool your friends into choosing your convincing yet wrong answer. Would you guess that there's a group of people who celebrate by bashing each other with bags of fire ants? Neither would I, which is why I got 1000 points by tricking my friends into thinking it was feces.YDKJ is, of course, the best at what it is, and 2015 keeps with the trend of ""ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUS"" trivia, so while there's nothing really new about the gameplay, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Don't fix what isn't broken, after all.Word Spud is the only game that really falls flat for me. The description really doesn't explain what it is, so I'll attempt to do so. Have you ever played the driving game where you say a word, and then your friend has to say a word to go after that one that still makes sense? It's that. That's the whole game. They made a video game out of that. There's scoring, but the points are based on your friends voting on whether or not they liked what you said. There's literally no incentive to say ""yes"" to anything, so the game falls apart. I see the potential for a Cards Against Humanity-style ""everyone puts something in and then you pick the funniest answer"" game, but they instead made... this. It's fun for one round, but I don't plan on coming back to it.Lie Swatter is essentially something you can put on to fill time at an actual party. Since it's the only game that supports more than 8 players, it works well for larger groups who don't want to leave anyone out. Unfortunately, since it's been designed to accomodate such large groups, the gameplay suffers, and it's essentially a game of True or False. It's certainly more fun than Word Spud, but nothing to write home about. Definitely reserved for things like family get-togethers, weddings, and the like.For those concerned about how multiplayer works, don't be. While a couple of reviews have groaned about the smart device requirement, it really shows how creative the people at Jackbox can be, given the right tools. A game like Drawful has always required you to either play a Flash game on your computer or use some kind of accessory on your console, but in this case, if your device can run a modern web browser, you can probably use it to play these games (while I haven't tried using the WiiU gamepad, I would not be surprised if it worked). Fibbage would be outright impossible with any other input method, simply by design. While I can understand the frustration with YDKJ not using controller input, and I don't know why they didn't increase the amount of players thanks to bypassing the controller limitation, it's a small price to pay, when smartphones and tablets are as ubiquitous as they are.Oh, and if you're looking to play online, I've found a solution (requiring multiple monitors) that involves using Google Hangouts to broadcast your screen that's hosting the game and having all of your friends play by watching the Hangout. Skype, unfortunately, has such terrible video quality that it's unwatchable, but I'm sure many other video conferencing applications will do a similarly good job. The game runs in Windowed Borderless, so you don't have to worry about constantly alt-tabbing, or anything, and the latency from Hangouts is short enough that you can all laugh at the same things at the same time. If you really want to have fun, you can even broadcast the game on Hitbox.tv, because the latency is short enough to where your viewers can competently play, albeit with a 4-second delay. Twitch is functional for playing Drawful, since you have so much time, but Fibbage and YDKJ are far too time-focused. I'd personally recommend streaming on your preferred site and then advertising the Hangout somewhere in the chat or on the page, for anyone wanting to join.While I'm concerned about the amount of content, considering multiple-hour play sessions are a regular thing, I've been playing a combination of only Fibbage and Drawful for nearly 8 hours with not a single repeated prompt, yet. I would definitely purchase add-on content, if any became available, as well."

It's easily one of the funnest party games I've played in a long time. Fibbage and Drawful obviously being the two gems in this pack, but the You Don't Know Jack additions to this easily make it worth the money.I guess the only issue is you kind of need friends to play most of these games with, or a family that doesn't hate you and your gaming habbit. The game definitely works / is funnier with more people.Either way, I'd definitely reccommend it. Asuming you have a sense of humor and some people to play this with, you'll be fine."

It is easy for players young and old to get involved in, and even fun to simply observe. Everyone in the room is always laughing when this party pack is pulled out. The best part is – if one person purchases it and broadcasts it to a TV or even through Skype, anybody with a tablet or cell phone can join in the fun and play along.The only downside is that you do see a lot of repeated questions/prompts in fibbage and drawful. That means that once you've played it enough, you'll know all of the answers.It'll make you look like a big shot when you introduce the game to a new group of friends, but insideyou'll just feel ashamed.Fibbage – Trivia based game where you try to fool other players with your lies.Drawful – Always brings out the most laughs in my experience. Drawings aren’t too precise, but that only makes things funnier.You Don’t Know Jack – Another trivia based game, more head-to-head action and ability for another player to interfere with your game.Word Spud – Word associations and a lot of laughs. Can be nonsensical, so it isn’t always a family favorite.Try making a rule to use quotes or song lyrics to make the end result flow in a hilarious fashion, or try telling a story. I find that this makes the game more exciting and interesting.Lie Swatter – A true or false style game that is good for playing with larger groups of people. It moves pretty quickly and can get boring, but you can learn a lot from playing it while showing off your trivia knowledge."

You'll play it once and then it'll turn into a Bad Rats-style joke. The game I played devolved into my friends and I typing ""gay Alexis is gay"" over and over. 2/10 standard rating 10/10 from IGN.Lie Swatter:A mediocre game that you won't play much. True or false gets boring after a few rounds, even with categories like ""Shaq rap lyrics"" and ""butt holes.""

However, I know how the game works. It's a silly gameshow, and it looks good. Approximate rating: 8/10 standard 10/10 IGN.Fibbage:This game alone is probably worth the full $25. Although it's slightly easier to play in the same room, you CAN play this online, and I recommend you do if you can't gather your friends. This game will create inside jokes for your friend group, such as when my friend said that Twister's original name was ""Gay Games For The Family"" and then later claimed a man had an addiction to ""Gay Twister Games,"" while I determined his addiction was to ""Sex With Small Animals.""

I can't speak for all of the games, since the ones we played were Fibbage XL and Drawful.  After playing only those two games, and knowing how good You Don't Know Jack is by itself, I knew this would be worth it for myself.Drawful plays like a more ridiculous version of Pictionary where you also want to try and trick others into believing that the answer you provide is the correct one.  Have you ever tried drawing the phrase ""Baseball glove is setting my hand on fire""?  Those are the kinds of things you get to try and draw, and the outcomes/answers can be hilarious.Fibbage XL is where we spent most of our time, and it's amazing.  You basically get a statement/sentence that has a blank, and you need to fill in that blank with what you think is the correct answer.  All the answers from the players appear, along with the correct one, and you need to try and choose which one is right.

Full of laughs and enjoyment, the party pack contains many of those games that are reminiscent of the classic party game such as ""Drawful"" being similar to pictionary, ""Fibbage"" being similar to two lies and a truth, and ""Lie Swatter"" being similar to a classic game of true and false trivia.

Had no issues with the game itself running on the HD4000 in the Surface.  Miracast has a delay, but wasn't enough to be problematic in a game like this.Fibbage was definitely the biggest hit. Most people complained that Drawful was a little too slow (and nobody's drawings made any sense). Lie Swatter was mostly a filler while everyone was waiting for others to congregate for Fibbage. YDKJ was enjoyable for me, but most others weren't into it (and the 4 player limit hurt this one too). Didn't even bother with Word Spud, nobody thought the concept was worth the time.Fibbage alone though is great (and I'd buy this even if it was just Fibbage and YDKJ).There were a couple occasional issues with people's browsers getting disconnected from the game.  Sometimes they would be able to put the same username and same room code in and immediately get reconnected, and sometimes they would try that and it would tell them to wait until the next game.  And worse, when someone gets disconnected, that means you have to wait for the timer to run out completely before moving on to the next question.  I think it should be a little more lenient in allowing a reconnect when it's the same username as someone who is already in the game.Still, the game is highly recommended for large gatherings (and keep in mind that it's designed for local multiplayer only)."

And while I think it's a great game, I feel like it could be improved upon.I don't know if you remember this bu the 2011 game that used to be on Steam but no longer isn't had the option to play two player games. That's the major issue that I wish was there. I understand with the technology system being more advanced they are changing everything so that you can play with a phone or tablet. But if they had ran a similar system to the 2011 version, with the game mechanics, then I think it would make for great competition for local players who don't have the advanced technology option.Having said that, the humour in You Don't Know Jack 2015 is full of banter, hilarity and humility. I really like the new soundtrack and audio commercials for the game and just wish that Jackbox would release the audio files for them. I mean, they did that for 2011, so if we could get a downloadable soundtrack then that would be great because we could then compare and enjoy.All in all, depsite the fact I really play the Jackbox Party Pack for YDKJ 2015, I can safely say that this set of games is a great party favour for any set of gamers, whether that'd be casual or serious!Give it a try and see how you feel.

The use of a phone (or similar internet-connected device) as a controller is genius as it allows friends to play easily and without the need for additional hardware.Most of the games are incredibly fun too, with only two of the five games (Word Spud and Lie Swatter) being ones that you will soon forget about due to them simply not being particularly fun. Out of the remaining three Fibbage and Drawful stand above the rest and can be played for hours and still have you and your friends wanting to play more. They both lead to some hilarious moments as you laugh at each other’s drawing skills or silly answers. The two also remind me of the fun had playing Cards Against Humanity, which is very high praise indeed. You Don't Know Jack is decent too, though it will get picked less due to not being as entertaining, it is still enjoyable every-so-often.Perhaps the only real complaint that can be made about Jackbox is the limited amount of content for each game. While it will still take a while to see repeat questions for Fibbage and Drawful (which ruins a lot of the fun), or to complete all the YDKJ episodes, it will still eventually happen. And when it does there is unfortunately no DLC or Steam Workshop support to add to the longevity of the product. Hopefully this can eventually be patched in.That one problem aside though, I would definitely recommend you play this game next time you have friends over.

The game requires a local internet connection to play, but here's the kicker: you play the game on your phone! That's right! That means your Mom doesn't have to fiddle around with an Xbox controller, and you always have enough devices for everyone to get in on the fun!Playable on any tablet or phone with a web browser, The Jackbox Party Pack is hands down the most non-gamer friendly party game I've ever seen, and it's about thirty million times better than trivial pursuit or other similar packages.The five games are drawful, fibbage XL, You Don't Know Jack Trivia, Lie Swatter, and Word Spud.Drawful is a sort of pictionary inspired game in which you draw on your tablet. I haven't played a lot of this but it is great fun. Between 3 and 8 players can play.Fibbage XL is my personal favorite, and is a spin on a balderdash type game in which you are given a trivia question and have to write a lie. Players then guess between all the lies other players made and the truth. Between 2 and 8 players can play, and it is totally hilarious.You Don't Know Jack Trivia, aside from one amazingly stupid question involving Ralph FIennes in episode 3, is a very funny and well put together trivia game for 1-4 players.The other two games are pretty weak, and largely ignorable. Word Spud is a weird game in which players just try to write funny phrases with a prompt for 2-8 players, and Lie Swatter is a game for 1-100 players that probably wont interest you unless you're really determined to try and get a zillion people together to play trivia.Overall the package is amazing value for money, and a party game that is actually a party game (an amazing rarity in gaming nowadays).Unconditional recommendation here."

This amount of content you get for the price is an incredible deal which is worth it in the long run. This party pack is only good for people who have a family game night or play with a group at home. You can play with people in a different home but the comedy and experience is taken away from it. Now short reviews on the games themselves1. You Don't know Jack 2015: Honestly I played the 2014 version and compared to that one 2015 falls on its face. It's more awkward and the jokes dont hit as hard. It is a solid trivia game and is good for the price it is. This and the 2014 version have a lot of ""episodes"" which is a game session that has its own set of questions. So if you play this a lot I hope you don't memorize the answers otherwise its fun.2. Fibbage: This is a lying game. The game gives you a question and there is the real answer buried amongst a group of lies created by the other players. If other players pick you lie you get points, and if you find the truth you also get points. The questions are good at getting some ridiculous answers out of people and it is good fun.3. Drawful: This is by far the funniest and most solid game of the package. It is Pictionary and Fibbage combined. You have to draw the picture for the other players to guess and if you get them to guess the correct phrase you get points. The other players will create new captions so people will pick their answers and get points. You don't have to be an artist; honestly it is much better if you aren't.4. Lie Swatter: It is a game of competative true or false. It has some good moments overall its a nice quick game.$. Word Spud: This is a game where you connect words and the word I use has to be in the phrase you say next. I say Hammer you add Time and the next person says Piece and so on and so forth.  Honestly this is boring. There is no host to commentate and explain unlike the other games, its quiet and unless you have a really good chain of words it just isn't fun."

,Not Recommended,331670,13903688,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,Wild Matsu (無法松),"I really enjoyed previous YDKJ games, but this version is so bad as to be unplayable, because it does not have controller support. Controllers are fast, precise, and offer tactile feedback. And for god's sake, let players use the keyboard. If the keyboard has n-key rollover and all four players are willing to crowd around it, let them do it. It wouldn't be fun, but it might work better for them than using smartphones. Or maybe I have controllers incompatible with the game and I want to use JoyToKey to kludge them into working. Even that would be sloppy and lazy on your part, and you failed to meet even those low standards. But, not only does this game not allow you to have more than one player to play using the keyboard, it actually allows NO players on the keyboard. That's right, this game lets NO ONE play on the computer hosting the game. A minimum of five devices is needed to play this game with four players. Good job!The point is this: give your players options.Trying to play this game using smartphones, the ONLY WAY the game works, was an awful experience. It was a decent idea, but it does not work well in practice. The lag is a serious issue, which should not happen when everyone's in the same room. Minimal lag is acceptable for most of the game, but completely ruins the Jack Attack. We tried more than one phone that didn't work, which led to one player being forced to use a laptop. She was at a disadvantage because clicking a button with a mouse is slower than on a touch screen. Even that's no picnic, though. It still takes a significant amount of time to look at the phone and press the button, something you DON'T have to do with controllers, as they offer tactile feedback. It's a little thing, but these little things add up. Even worse, oftentimes when we would press the button, the input would simply not register. Some players were at a serious disadvantage because they had more lag than other players. Our phones, like most people's, are set to go dark after a few seconds of disuse, which is the desired behavior at all times except when playing this game. This is distracting and frustrating, because enough time passes between each question for the phone to turn off, and it's not uncommon for you to get caught with your phone off when it's answering time. And god forbid it's locked by then. You have to remember to turn your phone on ahead of time, or continuously rub your finger on the empty area of the screen to keep it awake. You think it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it really does significantly detract from the experience, knowing you have an unreliable piece of garbage in your hand that will screw you over unless you pay constant attention to it. Changing the setting is a hassle, needs to be done again once the game is over, and results in your battery dying even faster (which this game does a pretty quickly already.)The idea to use smartphones was clever, but flawed in execution. Failing to support ANY OTHER INPUT MODE, even the DEAD SIMPLE keyboard, was a catastrophically bad decision, and it ruined this game entirely."

These two games, Drawful and Fibbage, are so great, that they make the whole pack worth it. Wordspud can be funny, sadly it has very little meaning. Most of the games are also much better if you can gather a lot of people. I'd say 5-9 is good.You Don't Know Jackis the center of the pack, it contains all the earlier You Don't Know Jack games, how ever, it's a ""quiz-type"" game, and for three Norwegian teenagers, it was pretty difficult, so we had to guess most of the time.Lie Swatterhad the same problem, and it was pretty cheap.To conclude, buy it because of Drawful and Fibbage, try the others, end of story."

If you're buying this for the other games included in the pack, kindly skip this review.For YDKJ 2015: A lazy attempt at best. A lot of the dialogue (and by dialogue I mean ONLY Cookie Masterson. No other characters other than the Dummy have lines) is ripped straight from YDKJ 2011. The game is oddly quiet with only Cookie voicing, and doesn't have the ""TV show"" charm the previous games had. The new questions were okay but not as gut-wrenchingly hilarious as it's predecessor. Also seems to be way too easy, especially in comparison to the classic games.In short, I don't recommend this at all. Pick up the 2011 version on PS3 or the 360 in your local bargain bin, or get the Classic pack here on Steam if you're looking for YDKJ. The only reason to get this is for the other games which may or may not be fun."

Drawful is the best thing in here and is arguably worth the full price alone: everyone laughing at both eachother's terrible drawings and terrible answers to the drawings. Fibbage was fun in the same ways the Drawful was, but just less of it I guess. Being able to play the game on any smartphone or tablet browser is an amazing idea, and a way better method than any pass-and-play party games I've played before.Sadly the other two new games in this pack aren't very good. Word Spud is at least a good idea - an off-the-rails word association game in theory - but gets boring pretty fast and the whole everyone-gives-points-if-they-like-the-word kinda makes no sense being there in the end. Lie Swatter just isn't enough of a thing to stay interesting for long at all, though it's understandable it wouldn't be too involved or complicated if it can incorporate 100 players.That said, I do think that this pack is absolutely worth it for Drawful, Fibbage and You Don't Know Jack. I think it goes without saying but this might not be a good purchase if you're not the kind of person who plays much local multiplayer, although I can totally see people putting this up on something like screen share in a skype call and playing like that. That'd work too."

I've been playing this with a few mates over skype with me sharing my screen to them and it's been a blast, it's so great that other players don't need to be in the same place and that anyone can join, i even tried it with one of my american friends and they where able to connect to the room and play.but i would really only recommend it, if it's on saleas only about 3 out of the 5 games are worth it and at £19 (well £18.99) it can be a bit pricey for the games you are playing as the games feel like the ones you would find on NewGrounds or a similar site.Here is what me and my mates did when playing and what we agreed they where like:Drawful and Fibbage are the two best games in the pack and we played many games of Drawful without ever getting bored of the game and continuesly laughing, Fibbage was the same.You Don't Know Jack is very good, quick fire triva had us all entertained and confused.Word Spud was alright, every match ended up as a tie and it was very boring while playing but when shown the 'sentence' we had done at the end screen it did give us a lot of laughs.Lie Swatter is just plain old boring and became a frustration, half the questions didn't make any sense to us and it was all a 50/50 chance of getting the right answer."

I do NOT recommend this game if you are not going to play it with people locally. Nearly everything in this pack is meant for playing with friends and family in person--not online. There is no online multiplayer for this title, and there is not enough here for a single player experience.Now, this first Jackbox Party Pack is kind of an amazing value proposition if you play with friends with any level of consistency. Usually a board game will run you around $20 and a few play throughs of that one game. This is around that price but offers many more games to play and is something nearly anyone can get into.Also, all of these games run off the browser of a supported mobile device, and you can't really play otherwise.You Don't Know Jack is played with 1-4 players and is a wacky trivia game that is insanely fun to play. The game is seperated into the actual trivia and a buzz in section that can lead to great times, along with accusations of unfairness due to taps on the phones and tablets. This is a great game to play after you've played another game, it's not so great as a ""warm-up"" title.Fibbage, on the other hand, with 2-8 players is a game that is great as a warm up title or actual game. Lying to friends and family is always fun, but this game gives you the chance to actually win for it! It's a weird combination of trivia, and a lying game. Pretty much everyone I know loves this game, while they may dislike most of the other games in the pack.Drawful is one of those games that sounds amazing on paper, but in its implementation could use a ton of work. You and your fellow players are given a word, and are then expected to draw whatever that is. However, the word or phrase could be ""midget santa claus"", which, is awfully hard to draw on a mobile device. Not being able to erase further makes the game frustrating to play, and with some phones or tablets not scaling properly can lead to a very tiny space for actually drawing. That being said, this is one of the games in the pack that I nearly always end up playing due to the second portion of the game which is titling the picture, and then picking the correct title from a pool of choices. This game is a blast to play--so long as you're given reasonable phrases or words to draw.Word Spud is a game that has left me scratching my head in its design and inculsion in the pack. The game starts with a word, like ""the"" and you are tasked with writing words after it, which your friends then vote on. That's it. The person with the most points by the end of the game wins, and that's that. You can make the game more interesting by creating a topic like ""poltics"" and voting based on how close they are to the theme, but that kind of funcionality isn't present by default. It's definitely the second weakest game in the pack.Lie Swatter is a game that was obviously meant for a streaming service like twitch and not a game that's meant for a few people. You're given facts, and vote on 'em. The one with the most points wins. Sometimes this game is a blast, but most of the times I've played it it's been pretty boring for everyone involved.

We were looking for it because we wanted to play You Don't Know Jack (and I love the original version!) but we didn't want to crowd around the keyboard. We specifically had controller support in mind.Well, this Jackbox Party Pack goes above and beyond controller support and cleverly utilizes the ubiquitous smartphone. It turns a mobile webpage into a digital controller, with buzz-in and Screw buttons. And the 2015 version is great. For the most part, it all works well, but the Jack Attack is frustratingly reliant on a lack of lag and fractions-of-seconds difference in buzzing in, which drags the experience down a bit. Otherwise, it works great.And the other games included in here are surprisingly fun. Specifically, Word Spud and Fibbage are brilliant, making use of a phone's keyboard for clever input. They utilize creativity and reward it, and are  honestly just as much of a reason to buy this as YDKJ! Plus, they accomodate up to 8 players.The games load quickly for each mobile user, and thankfully it's as easy as entering a 4-digit code in any mobile web browser.Fun stuff for parties.P.S., for some reason the drawing game refused to work for us...

At the first gathering, we tried Drawful for about 5-10 minutes before giving up, because it turns out that while we were on a reasonably servicable internet connection it wasn't good enough. Luckily, when I tried it and Fibbage out with family we had a more stable connection and everything worked a lot better; both Fibbage and Drawful were fantastic fun. This makes it even more disappointing that there's no offline mode; I don't know about console ports, but on the PC you should be able to set up a small webserver running the same site as jackbox.tv to provide a LAN version.On the whole, I would recommend this game only to those with good (not even just OK!) internet connections."

I had a lot of fun along with my family, and I'm sure that I will play it again in the future with friends. Just make sure that everyone has a device that will be able to connect to jackbox.tv (e.g. tablets, phones, laptops, etc.) as it will act as their controller to all of the games within the pack! (Being able to put the game on a big-screen (e.g. AirPlay to an Apple TV) is also handy, although you can all just cramp around a computer in your office...)By far my favourite game within the pack, as there are 5 games inside, was Fibbage XL. Basically, everyone would input a lie as an answer to the question on-screen, the lies would be shuffled in with the correct answer, and then everyone would have to choose which answer they thought was the right one. Fool someone and you'll get points. Find the truth and you'll get even more points! There is a lot of fun to be had with it!Next I would say Drawful was also very enjoyable. It has a very similar concept to Fibbage, only you have to draw a picture of something and then people have to guess what it is. Their guesses are shuffled in with the correct answer, and, just as in Fibbage, you get points for fooling people or guessing what the picture actually is.YDKJ 2015 was also quite a bit of fun, but as I only played it with my family (of whom there are a few kids) it didn't last long. Yes, the trivia aspect was fun, but there were some more mature questions that left our six year old quite puzzled and us embarrassed... But aside from that, Lie Swatter and Word Spud really aren't that great. Lie Swatter is decent, in that you have to guess if the statement on the screen is T/F, but Word Spud's scoring system is broken. I say this because the other players get to vote on whether your word is good or not, and so someone can rig the system.Overall, as I said in the opening of this review, this game is a must-have for people who want to entertain their guests or friends (or even family). You are bound to have hours of laughs with Fibbage, Drawful, and YDKJ 2015. And the best part is that everyone's controllers are their phones!(Note: the game requires you to be connected to the Jackbox servers in order to play, which is a drawback for people wanting to play without internet)Enjoy! :D"

My friends and I use Skype's screensharing function to play in real time. The only thing you lose is the sound but it's fine since everyone will be chatting. Playing locally is fine; we just hook up the laptop to a nearby tv for the best experience.Best games are Fibbage, Drawful and You Don't Know Jack! Fibbage is a great game to play even if you're not a trivia buff since it also relies on your bluffing skills.  Non-artists don't have to worry about having great drawing skills in Drawful, since the concepts are way more complex than your average Pictionary words. The end results are hilarious though. You Don't Know Jack is your typical 4 player trivia type game.As for the other two, Word Spud would be best enjoyed by people who love word puzzles/games. Lie Swatter is the least fun in my opinion since you're basically playing ""true or false""."

While we had a lot of fun playing drawful, I think the references and 'jokes' are aimed at a much younger audience who are familiar with popular US culture. Admittedly my mum did try her best to draw ""that sylvestor stallone arm wrestling movie"", with hilarious consequences, but still, it would have been nice to have more UK focussed content.As there were only 2 games in the bunch that were good, I felt paying < £10 for the product was a fair price, I think I would have been annoyed at paying £19 that it was priced at before the sale."

While the comedy and taste may not be for everyone, there is something in here that every single person who plays will enjoy.While my personal favorites are Fibbage XL and YDKJ 2015, the other 3 games are great at being good conversation pieces (ie in, drawful: ""Did you really just draw a♥♥♥♥♥♥and say that that was lucky charms without the marshmellows?"")

,Recommended,331670,17652627,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,Avatar,"Just a quick review on what the games actually are, because this isn't really well explained in the About section. Probably worth it, but only on sale. Definitely not for $25; I paid 50%.The good:You Don't Know Jack: the classic quiz show, 3 rounds, 12 questions. Made a little better with the use-your-phone buzzing in. 1-4 players. 'Screwing"" a player (forcing them to answer the question) gives them only 5 seconds to answer a 4-answer question. Whyyyy?Fibbage: One person picks a category, the game gives you a fact with a blank in it. Everyone enters in, on their phone, a good-enough blank lie that they have about 30 seconds to come up with. Then all the answers, including a true one and a preset lie are given to you, and everyone chooses what they think is true. Really pretty entertaining.Drawful: I don't know yet, this requires at least 3 people (up to 6). My guess is one person draws and the other two have to work it out, but don't quote me; I'll update this review later.The bad:Lie Swatter: Probably best played on your own, and even then not much fun. It gives you a fact or lie and you guess which it is and get scored for it. That's the whole game, and they didn't go to great lengths to make this entertaining at all. 1-100 players; I'm not sure how that works. Something to do with social media?Word Spud: I thought this was garbage. It's like Cards Against Humanity, sort of. The game starts with a word, and one player chooses a word/phrase that matches up with it (like mirror... image), and then the next player goes off the word you made (like image.... crop) and that's the whole game. It relies on you playing along with the game and entertaining yourselves, because you can put in anything you like. Minimum 2 players, I don't know why."
,Recommended,331670,29191205,Posted: 11 January,all,GreenPowerStar,"You Don't Know Jack 2015 is just as fun as its predecessors, Drawful is Pictionary taken to an amusingly absurd extreme, Word Spud can cause clever word play, Lie Swatter can be interesting and tricky, and Fibbage is an entertaining game of BSing everyone else."

Probably wouldn't be fun with less than three people, so it's not something you can play every day. No compatibility issues across 17 different mobile devices so far, so I'm impressed. If you're hosting a gmae night, it's certainly something different, and I would recommend it.Fibbage- You make up lies. So does everyone else. Then you guess the truth.  It's hilarious.Drawful - You don't have to be an artist. It's better if you aren't. This game had us keeling over in laughter.Word spud - Meh. We didn't like this game as much, but it still got about half of us laughing. It needs an anonymizer somehow.You don't know jack 2015 - We had 8 players on one night, and 7 another, so couldn't try this.Lie swatter - The other games were so much fun we didn't get to this either.Honestly, I'd recommend it just for fibbage and drawful. They were absolutely a hit, and cheaper than spending 30 bucks on a real card/board game."

I felt like I was struck with a bolt of amazement. I decided to buy all 3 during the holiday price drop, and I love them. Although... I should probably go through the games one at a time...YOU DON'T KNOW JACK 2015: It's just classic You Don't Know Jack. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED YDKJ 2011, but if you played that, you kinda know what you're getting in 2015, except for E, P, AE, or U?! and Foggy Facts. The music, intros, questions, they're all great, though, so if you're new to the franchise, you NEED to play this. If you came straight from the 2011 release, there ARE new questions, but don't expect many new elements.FIBBAGE XL: I once played Fibbage 2 in the 2nd pack with some friends, but it seemed like you couldn't be smart AND funny at the same time. But... I played it again, and... you CAN?! Yeah, it was actually really fun, coming up with lies to bizarre prompts. Not all of them were winners, but some of my prompts (and this game) definitely take home some Olympic medals... metaphorically speaking, obviously.DRAWFUL: Clever game. Drawing pictures and making up titles just goes to show how awesome your friends are... or how sucky their art skills are. My only complaint is that the drawings can get a bit glitchy, since I'm on a tablet, not a phone, but it's only a minor annoyance. Definitely better than Pictionary.WORD SPUD: This is the least favorite for many people, but I actually really like this game. It's like that game show Chain Reaction, but with other people to judge you on your word skills. I especially enjoy reading out the messed-up paragraphs at the end. It's not really a game for winning, just a game for laughing... at others.LIE SWATTER: While the 100 player cap is fascinating, this is sadly the weakest in this pack. Yes, the facts and lies are weird, but you can easily do that for free. And besides, Fibbage XL is EXTREMELY similar and a better experience, anyway. I'd play this at least once or twice, but maybe not more than that.This package, despite not having the Family Filter and Audience features, is still a great one. It's not the best of the Party Packs, but I still enjoy it nonetheless.GAMES RANKED FROM WORST TO BEST:Lie SwatterYou Don't Know Jack 2015Word SpudFibbage XLDrawful"

YDKJ playing more on sound and reaction time screen sharing feels favored to the host.Absolutely worth it. Word spud is usually never worth playing though.
