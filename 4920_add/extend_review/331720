Real-Time Chess-Esque ""thinking man's"" Action Explore-Shooter, Fun, tactical action packed ""out of the box"", somewhat minimalist art style (depending on your opinion/preference) but deep-rooted strategic gameplay. Glad I picked it up when I did, only thing I would like to see for the game is to expand, grow and thus become richer.If you like top down shooters, which on itself is an old genre that has been around since the first computer(s) [games] but hasn't seen popularity in PC-gaming except of few [niche] titles like for example; this one; (Survivor Squad: Gauntlets) among a few more, this be yer pick! Harr..PS,'best' thing about it might be there is a built in Editor, so if Longevity might be an issue for you. Qualiy stuff, interesting fan made missions included."

I emailed the developer some months ago asking them to add an option to disable the screen juddering but didn\'t receive any reply.  :-("
,Recommended,331720,24785993,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,BlueOrange,"Gauntlets is a massive step forward for the Survivor Squad titles.  The handcrafted levels built by the developer are well made, and the 'build a level' challenges are an inspired way of helping the community provide more content for the game.  There's a lot to see and to explore, and a number of interesting challenges to play through.  Levels can get a little grindy, and the developer-made campaign is not a 'casual' experience, some levels will take over an hour to complete."

Love the game, BUT, man, there are SOOOO many bugs in this game, its basically unplayable.  I thought it would be fixed over time, and i'm back months later, and still no fix.Wish i could play more, but the game was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and despite it sold a bit, they decided not to fix anything.  Not a good thing to do to customers.  Willl not buy from them again until game is fixed."
,Recommended,331720,15697757,"Posted: 5 May, 2015",all,limes,If you enjoyed the original Survivor Squad then Gauntlets is more of the same. The campaigns have a lot more interactivity than the original game's randomly generated levels but the developer made ones can go for a bit longer than desired. No doubt some of the community made gauntlets will really make this game shine.

,Recommended,331720,15738058,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,Zekail,"So far so good, its survivor squad all over again but this time its shorter individual missions called gauntlets.The editor is a very powerful tool that allows users to create and share their own gauntlets, be it a simple survival mission, or a lengthy story driven mission full of danger and puzzles, the editor lets you make it.Love it so far and look forward to more editor tools."

But the control scheme frustrates me to no end.  In the end it plays too much like an RTS without super tight control schemes like an RTS.  It's not a bad game, but it's not for me.  Have some more thoughts in the video, although since I'm not even recommending the game, only watch if you want to disagree?  Still worth it on sale, because of the level editor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXjSlO3zSBw&list=PL5XNK29huoDRnqDb7u98XWHDah6saYi2a"
,Not Recommended,331720,32631230,Posted: 21 June,all,mech619,"Game story is brief but fun.  I dislike the controls on moving your guys around.  Even if you instruct them to walk backwards to continue shooting at zombies, they tend to continue looking forward.Sometimes it can get annoying to place them on a pressure panel correctly when solving a puzzle.My biggest dislike toward this game is when you instruct one of them to search something like a crate and they discover a gun, they may switch to it automatically and when you heavily bombarded with zombies, you may not notice that you character is no longer using a particular gun you wanted him to wield until later.Its an OK game but I would not recommend it."
,Not Recommended,331720,20258124,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,lite,"Bad graphics. I don't mind bad graphics in general, but here it makes it hard to differentiate between doors and other types of textures.Annoying sound effects. You are going to kill thousands of zombies and all of them have same splash sound effect when dying. Everytime you move or select your unit, they say same 2 confirmation messages over and over. It will get annoying fast.Unrealistic sound acting. Either they are too tryhard badasses, or too southphark kenny like. There is no normal middle way where you can believe this can be realistic voice of a person.No story. Story basically is ""Zombies attack and you are killing them"". Characters have no progression, no specialization, no emotion and they can't be killed (that's right, death of your unit in this game just means that unit is stuck and some other unit needs to revive it). You don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them.Line of sight is not as important as game tries to make it look and trying to control it is terrible anyway. Your units rotate automatically to enemies even if they are not in the focus. You can't just rotate your unit. If you want to rotate your unit, you need to make it move to that direction. There is some concept of rotating to marginally different way when setting waypoint, but it's unusable.Scavenging. 90% of storages are empty or filled with junk. Only thing you can scavenge and is useful are guns. Also game is stupid and if you have more than one unit selected and scavenge, it selects same unit everytime, even though he is full, so you need to select manually different unit. Scavenging is just repetitive, useless and boring in this game.No strategy. Most you can do is set different position of units. This basically makes this a tower defense like game.If you are like me and are type of person who likes xcom or doorkickers, you are probably not going to like this game. If hovewer, you like tower defense games, you might."
