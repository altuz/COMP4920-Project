And on Febuary 24 2015 they added 10 new games and I went to go and buy it as soon as I saw it but it wasn't in my Library until I checked today. This game is a game I will treasure for the rest of my life. I just wish Disney could add the Ratatouille game, another game that I remember was the Radiator Springs game."

I was really happy when they released it on steam on February 24, 2015. You play as a robot who travels across the universe to help humanity save the earth and to solve puzzles that an unthinking robot couldn't solve while all at the same time he is craving love. WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN THAT??? This game holds the title Wall- E(rated E for everyone) so well. When they made this game it was definitely for the excellent gameplay."

I Absolutely loved it. I played for hours on end and i loved the music, locations and the unique puzzles it had. Its such a shame barely anyone remembers this game. The nostalgia just makes me cry. I love this game so much, and i will remember it as the game of my childhood. Ahh... This game brings me back."

There's platforming stages, exploration/collectaphon stages, speeding stages, flying stages, and shooting stages.And while it starts pretty easy, it does get more difficult later on, as platforming will get more difficult, and enemies will try to prevent you from making progress.Most of the stages also have collectables for you to find, which consist on BNL crates you can break, and Artificats you can collect. This adds a lot of replay value if you're into those kind of things.My only complaint is that the later levels get pretty long, and the checkpoints are few and far between. Which means, if you have to quit, you might not have enought time to reach the next checkpoint, and therefor have to leave, erasing some progress.The ""video cutscenes"" also don't look very well on modern computers, and the fact that you can't scip them can get annoying. However, the cutscenes made on the game's engine are very well made, and althought they don't give you the feelings you would get from watching the movie, the story is still very well presented. Both the Earth and the Axiom look great, giving you 2 very different enviorment styles - the junk that has piles up on earth, and the cleanness modern coridors of a space ship.Overall, this game is a very enjopyable experience.Just remember that this is a 2008 game, and a port of a PS2/PSP game, so expect to see PS2 graphics.But they still look great."

,Recommended,331750,29160243,Posted: 10 January,all,Rofl47,"Throughout my life, and perhaps many other lives that people have had, there's always this one phase related to a movie, TV show, or video gamebut perhaps that's just meand you just can't shake it off your mind. WALL-E is the biggest example of a game AND movie like that. And to be completely fair, this game ISN'T shovelware, unlike most IPs based on movies and shows!Introduction and TL;DRWALL-E is a game published by THQ and Developed by  Asobo Studio, and man does it impress me. Whilst the story is a bit rushed in the cutscenes in game and it doesn't exactly match the movie it's based off of, this game is amazing not only for the fact that it's not shovelware, and that it plays extremely well. The real ""Flaws"" I call in the full review are really just nitpicks.GameplayIf you aern't aware, in this game you take control as the two main characters of the movie, WALL-E and EVE. Most of the time you're playing as WALL-E, but there are certain sections that you can play as her aswell. The pacing is pretty dang good, having the action segments and collecting item segments keep you engaged. And truth-be-told, the experience is pretty absorbing. Even though there is very little replay value, it does a good job of keeping you in the whole way through with the secondary objectives other than to go through the WALL-E Story, playing with friends. Overall I really feel the gameplay works, and doesn't feel too gimmicky or bland when playing through the story. One gripe I do have, is the way the secondary objectives work on action maps and sometimes the more confusing collecting item maps. If you miss one thing for those secondary objectives, you can't restart and you have to go back out to the chapter menu first then pick the mission you missed all the crates for. This can take a lot longer, since you actually have to play the level and re-collect everything. Itteration time is not a friend here.GREPHICSI actually can say I owned this game before it came out on steam, and came out for the PS2/Original XBOX. There is another game for the PS3/XBOX360, and they are completely different. If it ever comes on steam, I might do a review. Since I never really played PS2 for games excluding this one, I can't say for certain if the quality of the graphics are good enough. Although, I do feel the game is capped at 30FPS and the graphical settings are turned down (Minus the fact they are set to 'high') since the PS3 and XBOX360 were out by this time. Even though this is the case, I gotta say, either because a GTX 1060 wasn't even a glimmer in NVIDIA'S eye by the time this was first release, I do like how there are no loading times AT ALL. Either that, or the manditory unskippable cutscenes do a good job of fooling you into not paying attention to load times. Which was a smart move, I gotta say.Robot Cruelty PSAOne thing that makes me hate this game with a passionJust kidding, I love itis the fact that every time you die, you always get these super cruel cutscenes showing WALL-E falling into oblivion, looking up at you in the light like a ASPCA PSA, and it really hits me in the feels, man. Zenyatta would not be happy about this.OverallIf you're a fan of the curious little robot trash compactor, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. It may have some small flaws, but it shows how shovelware is beginning to slow down and that good movie games do exist."

Seeing it on steam eight years later, I was thrilled to buy it and try it again. Although this isn't one of the best games out there by any means, I enjoy playing it as much as any other game, mainly for nostalgia, and also because it's just an overall great game! The puzzles, while not difficult, are fun and exiting, and the gameplay couldn't be much better! This is one of my favorite later-childhood games, and even as an adult, it's still very enjoyable!"

Instead there is an extremely small level around the truck and the only thing to do is break 30 boxes. Son would have been happy to have control of the tv in the truck (press E and play a small clip or something) and be able to open and close the truck's cargo door. Alas.Graphics are worse than PlayStation 2 Shrek the Third from ~2007 and the camera controls are a little too hard for little kids."
