,Not Recommended,331790,17848868,"Posted: 2 September, 2015",all,Blank,"I played this game, and got into it. The class system is fun and I enjoyed the time throwback to old school JRPGs.That being said:There were a lot of small glitches that made things weird at times, walking through walls comes to mind immidiately. I've been unable to access a good part of the game, and I'm not sure why. The developer has spotty response to the forums. I'd like to reccommend this game, but I can't. There's no reason I shouldn't be able to get further in the game, but since I have no idea why not, the game is done.It may be a limit of the engine used to create the game, it was frustrating, and the major reason that I can't reccommend this game."
,Recommended,331790,14910148,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Keldien <TWM>,"Please note that this is an early access/beta review.Reboot is already a marked improvement over the previous games of the series, while still retaining both the story and customization charm.The story picks up with a new character, and you are shown the aftermath of Corruption's finale through a fresh perspective.  It is still useful to have played the previous games, but does not seem entirely necessary - at this point, there is no save import feature to reward those that have completed the saga up 'til now.The combat is, visually and mechanically, improved over the previous games.  It is smoother, more detailed, and less prone to crazy RNG.  In the previous games, having a gunner in your party was very nearly a sure-win against most bosses, due to the insane critical rates allowed; thus far, I have yet to run into any equivalently overpowered build.There are a myriad of classes, branching out from a base class - the Novice.  Each class is divided by Grade (general level of power) and specialization (Magic, Psychic, Physical).  Characters can advance along any path, picking and choosing classes to level as they go.  Characters have an overall level that dictates their general stats, and a class level that dictates their abilities gained, stats gained, and a few other bonuses.  Leveling lower grade classes, like the Fighter, unlocks higher end classes like the Knight.  Abilities gained from these classes remain with the character regardless of which class they are currently leveling - thusly you could be a psychic focused character that is listed as a Knight and is learning Knight skills.All of the above give a great amount of customization to the party.The audio in the game is also vastly improved from the previous Data Hacker games.  Combat music is far more fitting of the setting, and ambient music is much more pleasant than previous games.It is an early access game, however, and is not without issues.Crashes are not common, but do happen and can rob you of quite a significant chunk of time if you are not a compulsive saver.  Getting stuck is also not uncommon - thankfully, this is easily remedied by recalling out of an area and re-entering it, but it still wastes a bit of time.There is also a large disparity in difficulty between the zones available to you at the start of the game.  Going north from town into the forest will set you against creatures that give a moderate-to-good amount of experience and hit your characters in the range of 10% of their hit points while on-level; meanwhile, the other zones you have access to might have creatures that hit all of your characters for half of their hit points every turn.  Without knowing where not to go ahead of time, it can be a bit dicey.All of that said, I highly recommend the game.  The pros far outweigh the cons, to me at least, and I feel that many of the issues are things that can and will be addressed, as the developer is very quick to respond to issues on the forum and take steps to adjust things as requested."

Game crashed a few other times on trying to load an area. Plenty of ""bitmap failed to loads"" in this game if your into that kinda thing. I'm not.I really wanted to like this game and kept playing even after multiple crashes but after the last 2 crashes, I'm done. The game has other issues as well but I could have overlooked those.Hate to give this a negative review because the developer seems to really care about this game and is very active in the community it has but I feel like I've wasted money on a game I can't stand to finish due to the crashes."

76561197997421698,Recommended,331790,20051490,"Posted: 28 December, 2015",all,Kerican,"This game was a fun title. I enjoyed playing it so I figured I would give it a decent review.While I do recommend the game, I will start with the games short comings first.Cons:Buggy - Their are definitely bugs in the game. The game is not as polished as it could but, but thats not from a lack of trying (Read Pros later) This is probably the games biggest fault, and that unfortunately has scared alot of people away from the game.Vague - The game does not hold your hand, you are dumped into a world, and your expected to figure things out on your own, their is very little in the ways of tutorials for alot of the game features.  And their are actually alot of features.Underdeveloped - It seems their could be alot more added.Pros:Unique: Between the three games in the Data Hacker series, a unique world, with a decent amount of story and logic put into its creation. While many parallels could be made between this and a couple other story ideas out there, their is enough in the story and plot of the entire series that sets this apart.Improvements: Writing, and Characters, have all noticbly improved since the first game. The character you get are decentlly interesting, fairly unique, and if you have played the other two games in the series, I do believe that things are heading in an upward direction.Invested Developer: The Developer has been fairly active on the Discussion Boards, and has dialogued back and forth with almost every comment.Potential: This game would really shine, if and when it gets just a little bit more polish.Overall Opinion:The game was worth the Price of $5 Having gotten 30+ hours out of something that cost me less than eating at a Fast Food resturant. I'm pretty sure most $8 meals have not given me 30 hours of enjoyment. So at its regular price I think its a good deal.Overall what I would like to see in the future is simply More. More Polish, More Content, More Character Development, More Side Quests, More Character related side quests. (okay, their might not be a need for More classes, the game already has a done, but definitely more development to make them all unique.) I definitely look forward to more content, maybe a DLC, or even a Squel to continue to story."
,Recommended,331790,14698671,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Drakzen,"Retail Release:Thought I would make an update on my review since it is out of early access now and my opinion has not changed. Great game, nice sound track, a good continuation of the storyline where you can jump right into without having to play the previous 2 games (Though I highly recommend that you do play them) with a good cast of characters. It is class based and to unlock higher quality, and more specialised versions of that class all you need to do is level it up until it unlocks plus the option to use skills from any class that character has previously learnt. You have a smooth transition between areas, no feeling too weak when entering a new area after finishing a previous one plus if you think the encounter rate is too high then you can get an item from a merchant in the main city that can reduce the rate by 50% or even by 100%.Another plus is that if you find an issue and let them know about it, they will actually do something about it and are quite quick to respond and if you think of something that you think is needed or could help improve the game then they will listen (Like with the encounter rate item I mentioned)I can't tell you enough how much I enjoy this game and the series as a whole it is great, 11/10 xDEarly Access Review:5 hours of play time so far and I have found it a great game to play, Has some issues but it is still in early access so these are being worked on (In my experiance I have only encountered one bug where I couldn't move after opening a chest in a dungeon). Continuation of a good storyline with improved visuals and sound track. Has been good for the short about of time I have played and with the updates is getting better all the time, well worth the price."

,Not Recommended,331790,19185909,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Faustitas,"I really don't want to give this game a negative review, the art looks nice and as far as I can tell the developer is active on the forums, and I like the idea of a flexible class system. However after seeing my graphics glitch as i walk through objects, getting stuck in walls, jumping over a gap that is identical to the landmass i was standing on, and the game's seeming love of a grind, I have a hard time saying its enjoyable. Most of the time i spent in the game was grinding. Didn't feel like I went very far, and for quiet a bit of it there wasn't a good feeling of direction or need to go in a certain direction.The class system is maybe a little too splintered because to an extent some classes could easily have shared abilities, especially when you can only have 3 characters fighting at a time. You also can't view a class ahead of time to see what exactly it does. Starting out i had no idea which class gained healing abilities. Its possibly my own ineptitude, but I had trouble finding out what the stats do. Strength probably has something to do with damage, but persona and fortune weren't spelled out very well.Currency in the game is also a bare looking. After all my hours of grinding, I had less than 5000. I couldn't afford the land someone was selling in the town, buying armor for all of my characters would bankrupt me or possibly even be out of reach because the starting armor was just that much more expensive than what I'd made.Lastly the story didn't really draw me in. The setting looks interesting, but the direction the game sent me was vague and I felt like i was being kicked into a dungeon instead out on an adventure. There was also a bit with a character with a time traveling booth that wasn't all that entertaining to me. I got the reference, but it just wasn't entertaining to me."
,Recommended,331790,15509370,"Posted: 23 April, 2015",all,ZodiacDragonStar,"since i like rpgmaker games, and this one series, the data hacker series. atm i am playing dh reboot, and it gives a nice challenge, where i have to try a lot of stuff just to get stuff done, the rpgmaker games, have both made me more active on the forums, since i occasionally get stuck, and the strategy guide pdf is not out yet, but it helps keep me from getting bored, by helping the dev find a few bugs to fix. it is a complex and well written story, and fun gameplay, at least for me.  while sometimes 3d images, characters and worlds may look neat, sometimes you just need an oldschool rpg fix and data hacker reboot, and a slew of other rpgmaker games that i have,  gives that fix satisfactory. well that's about it for this review. well what are you waiting for? go download and play it now, lol."

The first hour of the game I'm sleeping at the keyboard with tutorial minions following the character's chore of a game day, only to be lead a lie when the ""first mission"" comes into play. The minons jumped having twice the damage and stunlock my party to death! This isn't a game its a test to see if you like wasting hours grinding only to be ground into the dirt yourself."

This game is an evolutionary step up from the previous two, in all categories... story, gameplay, balance, etc.Only bug I ran into is the rare crash when teleporting.The game has *TONS* of classes... unfortunately you'll never unlock most of them, because of how short the game it.  15 hours, doing all the sidequests (except the one you litiarlly get JUST before the last boss).  I beat the game at ""core level"" 25, with my 2nd tier job at lvl 35.  I JUST unlocked third tier (at lvl 35) right before the last boss.There was obviously supposed to be a sequel... but no one's heard from the dev in two years, and his website has vanished.  (Guess he shouldn't have kept playing ""online world""!)"
