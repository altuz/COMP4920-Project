,Recommended,331880,15645965,"Posted: 1 May, 2015",all,Fulysic,"I will recommend the game for the fact that it is different, but I can't help feel disappointed that it has been made on CMS 2014 engine and not the new CMS 2015 engine if it had been built on 2015 engine it would be whole different gameGame plays well and smooth but needs some more optimization in my opinionIf you're looking to buy this game it is similar to car mechanic simulator 2014Pros:differentTrucks look goodFair amount of detailEasy to use pretty much same as CMS 2014Low system loadCons:Built on CMS 2014 engineLimited truck modelsSame level system/work orders as CMS 2014Some parts are hard to remove due to camera position"
76561198276155326,Not Recommended,331880,33570611,Posted: 15 July,all,ttower,"This game was cool to start with, until I realised that every truck had the same engine, and there was only a few trucks. It all went downhill from there. Many of the jobs had tons of bugs and glitches. I often had to do research in the commmunity to be able to pass a level, because a random part, not damaged, and not on the repair order, would have to be replaced for the mission to be finished. And theses problems really only start after 3 or so hours, so if you dont listen to the reviews, you run into major problems only after you have passed the returns limit. English translation are also flawed in some major ways, and the game is an obvious convert of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, as in the Test Path, the overhead icon showing the tires being tested shows a car. The game is not worth it, even the 2.49 I paid for it. There is more, but I dont want to write to much. Just dont get the game."

I have been motivated by improvements made over the Car Mechanic Simulator between 2014 and the new one - 2015 and I bought Truck Mech Sim 2015 too. But made a mistake. Running a triple monitor setup, this game has same flaws as Car MS 2014 - running about 30-45fps with everything off on 5980x1080 resolution using NVidia 980 GTX card. Its definitely not a bad game. If you havent played any MechSims you can try it. But Car Mech Sim 2015 runs 4x better and is better.So from my opinion ""No"" to this budget improver, reskined CMS 2014. Now we have end of 2016 and nothing changed, its shame, nothing else"

,Not Recommended,331880,18077329,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,derpface76 DANKSTOP.COM,too expensive for what it is. Would of been better as a dlc for car mechanic sim 2014. Or if the devs spent more time and made it more like car mechanic sim 2015. If got on a good sale i would recomend getting it. Other than that not worth it

I think if it has the same functions in all aspects of car mechanic simulator 2015 it will run and be as good as car mechanic simulator 2015 instead of 2014. hopefully an update will come and change the functions and make it more fun to play

76561198059605092,Not Recommended,331880,31210299,Posted: 17 April,all,TheRangersEdge,"I want a refund.  I can't even complete the game because it won't register that I replaced the starter on repair order 46.  I tried repairing it, replacing it, rebooting the save but it still won't register.  Also, seeing that this game was made around the time CMS2015 was made, I was expecting the new engine and better graphics.  I've played other titles similar to this published by PlayWay including CMS2015 and CMS2014, Train Mechanic Sim, and this.  This game was by a mile worst than any of the others.  They didn't put much effort into this game at all, they never even bothered with DLC.  Games like this are really just hit or miss, and this one was an awful miss."
76561198040552578,Not Recommended,331880,31919241,Posted: 23 May,all,Tanzier,"As others have said here this really doesn't compare to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, a game which I love and have nearly 200 hours into.  The graphics are good, but the gameplay and UI is very slow and clunky.  Mouse movement is very slow and inaccurate, making it difficult to tag smaller parts.  The camera angles are the biggest problem.  They're very awkward and limiting - in some cases you have to get to a very particular angle just to see the bolts you are trying to remove.  Also the order of parts during removal is a bit off to me.  In order to remove a head gasket, which required removal of the manifold, I had to remove the entire exhaust system all the way back to, and including, the stacks.I only paid $3 for this, so it's hard to feel ripped off, but I don't see myself playing it much more than the hour I've spent on it.  Pass on this, get CMS2015 if you don't have it."

This game should been A beta version. Its trying so hard to be like Car Mechanic Simulator. Its like the little brother that keeps trying to be like you. You can work on the Rigs which I loved, but its not alot of parts to fix. Most parts come off in a chunk. So less to fix so most problems with trucks are basically the same. But if they fix the bugs and add more content it might be a winner!"

Gameplay is a little stale, and you can take items off you shouldn't be able to if proper sequence is observed.
