The disc came with a trailer for Kingdom Hearts, a music video for I'm Still Here from the Treasure Planet movie, and some images/desktop backgrounds. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much from an incomplete, licensed game demo bundled with a Happy Meal.Boy, was I wrong.I played the demo for many, many hours. It defied my expectations with thrilling action, simplified but tight strategy mechanics, and an above-average soundtrack that really puts you in the mood for, well, being in a ship out in space. I remember being astounded the first time I sailed through a nebula, eager to find whatever mysteries lay behind the pink clouds. I remember watching in fear as a black hole swallowed ships, tearing them asunder. All this in just a demo!Jumping back into the full release, I thought that nostalgia would have dulled my senses, or maybe I wouldn't remember how to play, or maybe I would be biased. Again, I was wrong. I jumped right back in (speaking to the ease of the gameplay) and was immediately surprised to find that it was just as fun as I remembered! That's something that can't be said for many games.To sum up, I really enjoy Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon. It enhances the story of the original film and raises the bar for licensed games everywhere with stunning space combat done correctly, solid voice acting, graphics and sound that really put you in the world (or in space, if you prefer), and just being plain fun to learn and play. I wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of action-strategy games, space combat, or video games in general.TORPEDOES AWAY!"

The game gives more depth to the treasure planet universe and, to be honest, is a bloody damn good example of a RTS ship game. You can board and steal enemy ships, set up skirmishes, and play a very well put together campain.It kills me this game didnt end up a classic in the minds of all gamers. People should scoff at new games and say ""Dear god, why couldnt you do what a disney game thats demo was given away for free with kids meals at mcdonalds do, why cant you even manage to be as good as ""Battle at Procyon""In the main game you can only play as the Royal Navy, as jim hawkins, however in skirmishes you can play as any of the three factions (Navy, pirates, or ""Procyons"" the raccoon like massive military empire that specializes in badass warships) and you can individually construct your fleet and crew with the minutest details under your control.Just some examples of the things you can have happen in this game, often at randomLure enemies into a nebula where their sails stop providing energy and they must be tugged out or be left as easy prey.Steal enemy ships and use their talents to help you win battles.Stick a ""REALLY BIG GUN"" on your warship and blow anything within 10 parsecs to a billion pieces, you can fully customize your ships firepowerDefend forts in space and use their guns to aid youCommand everything from a torpedo boat to the impressive Fast FrigateGet sucked into a black hole and legitimately be scared to death as you watch your ship vanish from reality, or even better, get sucked into a supernova and have the same experience, but on fireAmelia is back for all the people like me who had a crush on her in the movie! she leads you through the campainBig ship thinks your torpedo boat is whimpy? knock out its engines (Yes you can target specific places) then launch a line into it and tow its♥♥♥♥♥over to a black hole, or better, to your own fleet and let them ravage it.While this is a RTS game, the projectiles move realistically and arent ""Click, auto hit"" meaning you can dodge things, or put guns on your ship dedicated to shooting down enemy projectiles, you are very free to mix actual talent for naval battle with talent for military tactics, think of it like playing Black Flag's ship segments while controlling a whole fleet in the background. You are also wholly able to move and touch any vessel with your own, letting you push around ships and block fire with your bigger, stronger ship if you so desire.And so much more! seriously this is a classic and you dont even know it, if you love strategy then bloody get it and wonder why your AAA title cost 60$ and is half as good as this game"

76561198071561121,Recommended,331970,23908681,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,SafetyCop,"Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is one of the most underrated games of all time, I'm dead serious, this is one of the best things to come out of a movie tie in and for it's position, a movie tie in in the 2000's and one by disney of all people, it's simply one of the best.alright, let me take a breather here and tell you why this small little game would provoke such a responce out of me. this game as I've said befor is a 2000's era movie tie in, usuallly these are compleat shovelware, and, uppon it's release, it was surrounded by shovelware compatriots, crappy one trick games that did nothing new or special, this game, however, DID do something special, be origional. origional story, origional music, origional gameplay.Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon is a naval combat simulator set to continue the story told in the movie, Treasure Planet, it follows Jim Hawkins uppon graduation from navel acadamy and into service of the royal navy. a new threat, however, has arrisin in the far reaches of the empire, Ironclads. these formidible ships sail with no sail, leave no trace, and no survivors. it is not up to you, however, to chase these down, you are to report to the admiral and obey your commands, sail the seas and follow through this game's impressive single player storyline. the single player and the story of this game are inseprable as every mission shuttles you through, wasting none of it's time on pointless sidequests or grind. Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon earns a great recomendation in the singleplayer/story department for it's well designed layouts filled with a impressive amount of unique hazards, obsticles, and beautiful scenery as well for a story put together extrodinarally well I am very impressed.In the gameplay space, there too is an suprising amount of complexity and a fair ammount of depth. you, yourself don't command a fleet, but rather a flagship that commands the other ships in your armada. this is very unlike other naval combat simulators where you controll the whole fleet from a god's eye perspective. in Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon, you control a flagship from which you order the fleet under your command around. the controll of your flagship as well as your fleet is where half of the depth and complexity come from, micromanaging is at whatever level you want it at, controll every ships course and plot or just orde them all into a ""v"" and everything inbetween, it's up to you. movement is nice, ships have momentum and a speed and size determaned turning radius, combat is engaging with a suprining amount of weapons that all function in ther own way with some weapons getting a unique targetable aoe charge. dammage and stat are more that just a healthbar, your ship state and even how well you can operate is fully fleshed out with dammage dependant systems. and even beyond that there is ship and fleet costimization allowing for compleat controll over not just what ship and what guns, but also the crew  and captian itself. a points system is in place with better crew, guns, ships, and fleet size costing more from the sae shared pool, forcing critical thought and disision about your how you wish to play.the systems, however ahead of their time are by today's standards, above avrage, but for the 2000's? amazing.the solid gameplay foundation earns an applaud from me. I am impressed with a bonus applaud.in presentation, there is not much to say but the ui is competent, graphics  themselves may not hold, but the ammount of detail from sea(space)gulls, sea(space)whale, islands decorated with sand, trees, shipwrecks, you know what, now that I think about it, everything is deatailed. all of it, from spaceports to spacegulls, the presentation earns a rating of moderetly impressed to very impressed with towns and spaceports taking a notible exeption and earning a very impressed. (side note, the main menu itself is rather underwhelming, being a vague picture layed behind some high quality buttons)side-sidenote, the tutorials are topist of top notch for seperated experiencees. (like the tutorial from the origional half-life, where you have to click a menu option to get to it)in the sound department, everything is a 9 or a 10, music is very fitting and well composed as well as well sounding. voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a while, all of it is very immersive. the enviromeental effects are absoulutly amazing. the blackhole sound effect being one that stands out in my mind, it's encreadably eariy and fitts them to an astounding degree.ui and menu noises are short and satisfying. I'm very impressed.multi-player is everything it aimed to be, just perfect. available in lan and internet. shame no-one's online, even so, with many maps, well made bots, and the astounding gameplay to back it up, this mode can afford to live off of it's dm only note. a well made compliment to the main story mode. I'm impressed.overall, Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon is not a hyper platnum best of all time revolutionize everything omgomgomg, but is it a gem of outstanding, unbelievable quality and should be a must play and must play again for any hidden jem hunter. I'm very impressedtl;dr one of, if not the best hidden jem on steam, yes, buy it, even if it's not on sale.(as for why I'm gushing over this game with little playtime, I've owned it for the longest time on CD.)"

The game and world files can easily be edited in notepad to create all sorts of weird inconvieniences/improvements. There were official modding and map tools made for the game when it was released, however these tools have never surfaced.Online multiplayer has been broken since (insert year here) when DIsney shut down the servers. But it is possible to play long distance on Tunngle.Simply put: It's a good, simple, nostalgic RTS space battle game based off of a good movie. Although it's still identical to the retail version, the biggest difference is that it's more accessable to fans and people who have never played it.(P.S. Shoutout to Kerberos Productions, as many of the developers from Barking Dog Studios/Rockstar Vancouver that worked on this founded Kerberos, which still makes games today)"

The campaign is pretty interesting, with a decent story and not as terrible as you'd think VO. Definitely worth looking at no matter your age, but I would definitely get this if I had a kid to let them play this. If you really like this game, you should look into the Starfleet Command 3 remake and play it, as the games are similiar."

This game shortly came out after the Disney movie Treasure Planet. As a kid I loved this movie, it combined space and pirates! When the game came out I went nuts. Sadly, Battle at Procyon never started a series of games, which could have happened. In my opinion, the developers nailed this game, simply, a masterpiece.Pros:-Great storyline (for a game at that time)-Pirates-Space... Ships? (instead of battling through space from the future, you battle with ships from the pastMan-o-War, Iron Clad, etc.)-Lengthy missions, where it is entirely possible to just explore the map.12 missions-Skirmish mode-Surprising textures for a game from the early 2000's-The ships actually take damage instead of static textures!Cons:-Cheesy voice acting (adds more humor to the game in my opinion)-I had some performance issues with Windows 7; glitchy mouse (would stutter at times when precision was needed), and some broken textures in max resolution. These were fixed when I ran the game in XP compatibility mode, and then running the game in XP-Multiplayer is pretty much dead. If I remember correctly, there is a LAN mode for skirmishing-Unfortunately, there is no windowed mode but that is only a nit-pickBottom line: Nostalgia! If you can get this game on sale, buy it. I love this game, and I am sure I will come back to it now that I have the digital version."

The combat gameplay is fast-paced, with everything from cannons to mortars available to arm your ship with, each with its own set of models, sound effects and animations, and based on ship-handling as much as simply carrying the best weapons and crew."

The mechanics are simple but effective, giving you just enough control over your ships to make the game fun, without the unneeded complexity other strategy games have.

I did a little research and found out it have a game. Excited, as the Lunar New Year sale had arrived, I purchased it without thought. Review points : -Pros : -- Great if you're a fan of the movie and wanted to know more- Pretty darn good story- Voice acting is nice- A skirmish mode to keep you playing the game for a while- It's an old game, so it runs very smoothly on high settings on a modern day computer.Cons : -- The ships don't have people walking about like in the movies (imagine boats, talking to other boats)- Ships are slow AF. (No seriously, I run faster in TF2)- Some parts have weird color combinations, but tolerable.- Disney still hasn't made a sequel to the movie, and to this game.- Combat can be quite repetitive (just spam and ta-dah).- Old game, so no online play with others.But if you're willing to spend a bit for a game. It should keep you here for about 3 hours or less. And even longer if you continue playing the skirmish mode. As a fan, still a pretty fun game while it lasted."

It looks like it was slapped together in less than an hour using a couple of leftover assets. But more importantly it fails to provide basic information; there is no way to determine the firing arc of a weapon other than feeling it out; a selected ship's health values are displayed as three not immediatly obvious meters just off the bottom center of the screen between some camera options and a chat log; unselected ships only display a rough approximation of hull strength in the fleet window, no information relating to weapons or sails are dsiplayed.- the game's speed is also an issue, often campaign missions will ask the player to travel across the map from point A to point B taking about 2-3 minutes assuming the ship is both very fast and travling at maximum speed, during this period of time absolutely nothing happens. This issue could be corrected if there was some way to change game speed during play, and it would only need to be there for singleplayer, I can't really say anything about pacing in multiplayer, but I assume its fine.- not that many keybindings, you can cycle through ships or change a ship's speed and thats it, everything else can only be accomplished with mouse clicks.- unskippable cutscenes, but dialog in cutscenes can be skipped.- most of these issues and then some would be fixed if the game had a better modding community, there's alot of potential but it dosen't have much of a follow through.tl/dr: game's good, not great.- maybe get it if you like AssCreed BlackFlag, but wished it was more strategic/focused/involved.- must buy if someone manages to mod some anime boat girls in."

I own the origional CD and played this game when it first released and I know it was in there. Also, Disney's Online multiplayer support is long gone; thus if you want to play multiplayer, you'll need to run LAN games and start tunneling LAN; which even the tunneling is more difficult than it sounds, especially with this old game.The choice of Voice Actors to represent the crew from the movie, I will not say were the best picks; nor is some of Jim's Portrait art when issuing commands.Despit all of the problems, it's worth the $10 and worth picking up if you want to go all sapce pirate."

The story (which I will not be revealing much of here) has it's twists and turns and leads to a climatic conclusion that will test your knowledge of the game and your abilty to control the fleet that you command. There are tough spots in the game (my least favorite being those of missions 4 and 6), but none of these are beyond the capacity of the player to beat. I'd advise saving well before significant combat.My favorite part of the game is the comparison between the still largely wooden ships of the Royal Navy and the mysterious Ironclads, which reminds me (history buff that I am) of the battles between fleets still made of wood and new, steam powered vessels covered in iron and powerful weaponry.Overall, great game, and, as I said before, seems to be a great sequel to the movie."

The amount of hours I put into this game is a number I cannot count. All I do remember is that this was truly my first PC game and that I had a blast with it!"

Also highly moddable, but missing the modding tools, which is a shame since it could be so much more with them. Has a great community backing and multiplayer is still alive through a virtual network. ie Tunggle, Evolve, and Hammachi.Join the Etherium Forces group and Discord if you get this game, a lot of active members and we play regularly."

It is a must have for any fan of the movie."
