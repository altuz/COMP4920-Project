,Not Recommended,332070,30102119,Posted: 22 February,all,PeptoDismal,"0/101) game looks like a potato.2) constant lag/long loading and crashing.3) controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥4) devs do nothing to update the game or do bug fixes. They only release new dragons and quests.5) only worth playing if you have a membership and even then why would you spend money on this game?[this is a joke btw, hakuna your tattas]"

76561198079486629,Not Recommended,332070,29828637,Posted: 10 February,all,RayRyan,Ok so i am not the type of person to hate on games or bad graphics but this just looks like the first game to ever be made minecraft has way better graphics and that is just blocks i loved the 2nd and 1st movie. It also makes you buy a memebership so you can get more dragons get to a island and get toothles i think its unfair because people who have memebership get so much things and people who just play the game get nothing

Was stuck on the title screen for about 15 minutes trying to escape but my mouse was lagging so much i couldnt exit. I was so excited to play this game seeing as the movies are amazing and they are literally my favourite movies of all time, but seriously, the lag is terrible."

76561198053533975,Not Recommended,332070,29744143,Posted: 6 February,all,Function (Malee7),"I can't say I recommend this which honestly makes me feel down as I quite enjoyed the series, movies and original books however the massive amount of lag renders this game unplayable and I'm not over exagurating about that, I literally could not even register because it was lagging so badly it took 5 minutes for my mouse to move to the register button.This game must be horribly optimized or have some kind of basic issue like that because I'm capable of running games like Subnautica with little to no issue and I can't even get into this game.Also from my perspective on the menu I saw advertisements for at least eight different pay to get packs and whilst that normal for an mmo this one is targetted toward children 5 and under which makes the whole thing rather... sketchy in my book. Not to mention the obvious fact that it's not free to play if everywhere you look the game is asking for you to pay to get this, that or the other."

76561198306303230,Not Recommended,332070,30066757,Posted: 20 February,all,Wraith Master,"I've allot of Hours logged into this game and roughly almost every dragon in this game there's pros can cons of this game for one it costs money to unlock areas and get better items and dragons unless you've at least 3 boulder dragons for stable quests near Titan Level it's almost impossible to raise Gems without real life Cash getting Involved as well the Membership for this game isn't worth the Buy WhatsoEver don't pay for membership for this game EVER! for 30-60$ one can easily buy the whole game via area buy with Gems and a couple dragon egg chests as well while the membership costs around 10$ monthly and there's at the moment no way of Canceling your membership with a 1 click system so it'll continue to take money off even if you don't want it too unless you create a forum page and actually spend the time to write back and forth to a Admin isn't a admin for the game but just gives the Info to another Admin so it literally takes about a week to cancel a membership a normal Kid will have no idea how to do this in my honest opinion.2nd The Game is CPU Intense instead of GPU intense there's no way to change the Graphic Settings they're Perma Locked at 1 Setting and your CPU will do almost everything for the game instead of say your dedicated Graphics Card.3rd Glitches upon Glitches in the 125Hrs I've played this game I've gotten locked out of my main Viking at least 3 Times for Several Weeks and i had to go though forum admins and normal admins several times to get back into the Viking, and at 1 point no one in the world could Age up a Dragon because there was a Huge No Age Glitch unless you used Gems to age them it was impossible and it wasn't Fixed for a 2 Week Time Period and there's tons of more glitches in this game that aren't noticable tell they effect your gameplay for Example the Telescope Glitch that wont let one click on the telecope on the Ice Island that hasn't been fixed in around a Yr so then you've to do around 20 quests to be able to finish it and click on the telescope in Berk to finish the Quest on the Ice Island.I don't Recommend this Game for Children for these reasons.I only Played it for so long because I Love How to Train your Dragon So Much, and Own all the Books, and TV Series, and Movies."
