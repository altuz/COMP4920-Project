I really hope they create a sequel or add more content!tl;dr:+ Gameplay is fun!!+ throws constantly new situations, playstyles and conditions in, never gets monotonous+ good presentation: cool graphical style, fitting music+ feels a bit like a mix of F-Zero and R.C. Pro Am+ good difficulty: starts easy, ends with lots of challengeso if you expect racing, this may not be for you- controls need some time to get used to- the camera is way too close! It's really hard to see anything, this makes the game more about memorizing than racing- unlocking bonus missions is wrongly explained in the game- short, took me 2.6h to beat the singleplayerLong version:I love games like F-Zero, but there hasn't been a sequel since a long time. I played some topdown-racing games in the past, so I knew they were fun, too. Anyways, after watching the trailers, I was convinced this game should be fun to me. The camera looked really close, but since a screenshot showed the possibility to zoom further out, I bought the game anyways.First of all: this is not a racing game.It contains several levels where you have to be faster than others, but it feels more like a fast Arcade-Puzzle game. You cannot accelerate or brake, instead the focus is more on figuring out where to use which weapon.Every world in this game has 3 levels, of which 1 is a racing level. If I remember correctly, there were 5 worlds with a Racing-Level.The other levels are obstacle courses where you have to make use of your weapons, time trials or bossfights.While the bossfights look really good and are well designed, for me it was always about figuring out how to recharge your energy so you have enough power to beat the boss. Once you know the pattern and how to get energy, the bosses are not a big problem.The leveldesigns felt very intelligent and the overall experience was quite enjoyable, but it was really short and it took a while to get used to the controls. And the camera... the camera is REALLY weird in this game. Even if there are 3D-Elements, the camera makes everything look flat and 2D. It makes it even harder to control the machine without being able to slow down...Not to mention that the camera is still really, really close on the track - even with the 10%-upgrade. You hardly notice it at all.About the worlds and levels:You can choose which world to play in any order you like. Additionally to that, there are several locked bonus missions, that tell you to get all the weapons first. This is wrong: you have to beat all the worlds in order to unlock the bonus missions.I wanted to do the bonus missions before starting the last levels, but I couldn't find a way to unlock them. I wanted to grind XP to make the last levels easier, but without the bonus missions, it felt stupid to redo the previous levels again.Overall, I liked this game a lot, but I would've liked it more, if the focus would be more on the racing-part. I really miss some kind of Grand Prix-Mode, like in Mario Kart or F-Zero. Stil, it was fun and enjoyable to me."

You can take on any of the challenges in any order. It is challenging, but once you figure out the right way to beat a track you will eventually pull off a win, and it feels damn good to win in this.The electronic soundtrack is a very nice fit for the game and the controls feel smooth. You can spend XP in different attributes which adds an rpg element to the upgrade system in this game. The visuals are just right. Considering the fact this was made by just one person, i tip my hat off to you! This would make an epic arcade cabnet game."

There seems to be a ton more left to do.This game feels triple A to me, even though it was made by one man. I can't count how many layers of polish there are in this thing... it's fantastic. Most importantly, it's a lot of fun. It controls great and the weapons/powerups are well thought out. It looks great and the audio is great also. I'm very impressed with this game and happy I picked it up.Gameplay wise: it's a racing game with weapons and obstacles, bosses and lots of cool stuff going on. Some of the levels are not linear. Your primary resource is energy which you use and gain various ways."

You unlock upgrades and weapons for your racer/ship by completing levels with gems you collect.   It's really got that SNES F-zero vibe to it when you turn and skid around and use your boosts and stuff. Nice one.   I want to play F-zero again on my old SNES console.Do keep in mind, in the story, something happened to Penelope's racer which causes it to not use brakes anymore due to a techical error or some sort...so yea, fair warning, so i'd imagine the only way to stop her ship completely is to turn the engines off.I'd recommend using an xbox controller though."

I feel the perspective difference (top down) alone is enough to not, but there are clearly F-Zero influences in The Next Penelope. While many of them are obvious in game-mechanic behavior (energy charging strips and boosting), there is also new abilities introduced, with the most notable and fun, weapons. While the game-play isn't too original, this game implements them spot on for a very fluid and enjoyable experience.While I can't say it's a F-Zero successor (again, due to perspective differences), it most certainly seems to be for Micro Machines. Micro Machines was a great classic game from the NES I never really got into too much. However, The Next Penelope grasps my attention for a racing game immediately. With great art, music, and game-design, it's hard not to recommend this game."

It has racing elements, most levels are on tracks, and some are actual races against NPC opponents, but most levels are about combat or survival focused. I personally wouldn't mind this dynamic if the combat wasn't so deeply flawed.The health mechanic in this game is one of the worst health implementations I've seen. Energy (their term for health) is used up whenever you take damage or whenever you use a weapon; this could provide an interesting balance of risk/reward, but health is doled out so rarely that you are constantly budgetting your weapon use. One small slip up in a match will leave you in a situation where you still have half of your health, but are forced to quit because it takes at least 2/3 of your health used as weapon energy to kill the boss you are fighting.About 1/3 of my playtime was retrying because I didn't have enough energy to beat a challenge/kill a boss, about another 1/3 of my playtime was just crashing into walls because the screen is so zoomed in that you can't see far enough in front of you to avoid damage. I discovered near the end of my playthrough that there is a RPG style leveling system that allows you to level up to zoom out the camera, but its an expensive upgrade for a feature that should be in my default."

The Next Penelope is a top-down racing game that is essentially based on a future sci-fi Homer's Odyssey. Which is really cool, because it stands out in that respect! The art style is gorgeously bright, the sound and story are spot on, but I'm hesitant to give it a perfect review. I think that's more because A) it came out just a month ago and B) I suck at racing games than anything else. This game is ridiculously brutal, and yes, unfinished, but that is something which will change and I'll get better at it. The controls are good (using a keyboard), and it runs smooth! Definitely going to be playing this more, especially as it updates.So end result: 8/10. Crazy difficult, but crazy good, and completing sections are oh so good!Also, writing a Mythology paper on it, so we'll see how it goes ;)"

It has the same reckless cornering feel as in wipeout as also gives the same rush.  There's  a few niggles but if I had to give it a number score it'd be an 8.5.  And is this the first time I've fought a boss in a racing game and it was actually fun and didn't feel tacked on? Yes.

Though if you aren’t willing to replay a boss stage a dozen times in a row then you should keep in mind that unless you are a top-down racer/shoot ’em up vet, that’s going to happen. And I do have to add that the core game is rather short and won’t take you more than three or four hours, even with many restarts. But that just means you’ll be on to the next awesome indie game on your list, right?"

Story mode is fairly short but there is many things you can do after. As a heads up, you can only play it in french and in english. If you can read this, you most likely know enough english to play the game. Some of the bosses I think are a little unfair, and you need to upgrade your ship to be able win without being a master at this game. Also It is going to be on the Wii-U once it is finished so, thats cool. Whats fun is you can take on the planets in any order! (Other than the first and last level) As a warning there is a upgrade shop. I did not see it until after my 3rd planet. You need to grid a little for the exp needed to upgrade you ship, but its perfectly understandable. SPOILER: Also look for short cuts on the ""impossible"" level, and the warping level, if you don't there is little chance it will be easy for you. (For the warp level you can also just upgrade you ship to be faster). Also the Suitors are all idiots, they don't care if the universe is in trouble as long as they have a chance to marry you. Umm.... 4 player mode looks fun. WAIT IMPORTANT! You can't turn off music, and If you're in the middle of a world and you leave you have to start the entire world all over.7/10, just a little to short."

The races remind me somewhat of Nintendo's F-Zero series, but with the camera from a birds-eye view instead of from the rear of the vehicle.  The storyline is creative, where it is a futuristic version of Homer's 'Odyssey', but this time... the lady is in charge.The game is HIGHLY addictive with tons of action and tons of suspense where I've even caught myself yelling at the other cars to slow down or explode.  The game is very creative where the vehicle runs on an energy bar, which is spent on weapon firing, boosters, landmines, and protection from crashes.  It is really awesome, because you can progressively supe-up your vehicle and make it stronger with newer and cooler upgrades.The controls are smooth, even with only the keyboard, which makes me think it would be perfect for a touchscreen control system or a console system like the PS3, etc.The graphics are very good for a 2D arcade racer but plays well even on computers with lower-end graphics cards.I highly recommend this game.

The character artwork, dialog and general story setting (as an almost side view of the odyssey) are fantastic and make me want to see it to the end. But every time i get to a race im just utterly bored. In my opinion there is way too much ""flashyness"" going on, just lights everywhere and I can just faintly tell whats going on, or when im supposed to turn. Then, on top of the disorenting lights at high speeds the camera is zoomed in too close for comfort, which makes me feel like i have even less reaction time. Even more so the game has, in my opinion, a lack luster voice that speakes to you when you win or lose or start a match. I cant tell if its robot or human or alien and it seems so lazily done that I have to ask, why even? I mean, the levels I have played so far are so short that simply postive and negitive sounds would have sufficed. I would have even been fine with  victory /  failure reinforcing sounds be left at just the sound of the match start and when you get ""Wrecked"".Any how, these things to me would not necessarily be a deal breaker. The main issue that I have with this game is the steering. Now perhaps I just suck alot, but even after playing with both a gamepad and keyboard, I find the steering to be clunky and lazy. Its a mission on its own just to get my ship moving in a straight line while racing and I feel like that is a huge deal in a racing game. Sure I could just slam on the boost and sloppily bumper my way through levels, but that just doesent feel right. Polishing this more would have totally saved this game for me.TLDR; This game has some great asthetics, but the racing aspect seems to just be a means to an end to have active gameplay to an otherwise interesting narrative."
