Great art style, catchy music and sweet physics puzzles, only down side is not enough people playing online. Definitely recommend you pick this one up!"

If playing with liquids and gasses is your thing, while you dodge bullets, save people, and find an intreresting story being told, this is your jam."

,Recommended,332330,29071229,Posted: 6 January,all,✪ JonnyD,"Played both of them on the PS3 (as this version combines both PixelJunk™ Shooter 1 and PixelJunk™ Shooter 2) I can say that this game is pretty fun, especially if you have someone to play coop with. There's no reason in buying PixelJunk™ Shooter from the steam store, as this version includes both the first one (which is that one) and the second in a seamless experience, which some more features.The multiplayer, from what I remember, can actually be a fun experience, however, don't expect finding any players online to battle with, and youcan'tactually play coop over the internet, you have to play locally, which can be a problem for most.The graphic remake is stunning, and the 60 fps are awesome, (borderless window seems to be locked at 30, though, but it's fine as I usually use fullscreen).Even though it has its flaws, I recommend the game especially if you have someone to play locally with, would be great if the developers added coop support over the internet (which 99,99% won't happen), that's the only thing that's missing, except for a bigger playerbase, but I guess they can't do much about it."
,Recommended,332330,18676518,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,Imban,"""PixelJunk Shooter is a twin-stick shooter/puzzle game with some neat liquid physics. I found it very reminiscent of indie puzzle platformers, only based on a twin-stick shooter engine instead of, well, a platformer engine, with some tricky levels and fun boss fights at the end of each of the three chapters.The only real drawbacks are that it's a bit on the short side and, when it comes to finding all of the treasures and secret areas, the game often turns into Pixel♥♥♥♥♥ Shooter, with you needing to flail your grapple around in corners, destroy all the soft rock in large levels, and try pushing your ship into all of the dead ends in order to get 100% completion. That's... not quite as entertaining as actually playing the game for progression.Still, it ends up a solid enough game to earn my recommendation.""That's what I said about the original PixelJunk Shooter. Ultimate is twice as long, significantly better-looking, and significantly harder, with the new stages picking up both in story and difficulty where the first game left off and continuing to add new and interesting gimmicks with each set of levels. (Unfortunately, one of those, the Hungry Suit, felt terrible to me. It replaces your controls with very awkward square-based movement and block pushing, in a game not really built for it. Thankfully, it's never used again after chapter 4.)I would recommend it to people who liked the first game, as long as they weren't having too much difficulty with it, and especially so to people who haven't played either, since it's a solid 10-hour game just to complete it, likely with several more hours of content for people who like poking in corners for all of the treasures, which is now required to unlock the true final level. Unfortunately, that's not me - I felt the treasure-poking was tedious in the original, and with the significantly harder levels, I'm very uninterested in trying to get the 26 I missed. If you're a completionist, you should probably keep that in mind before choosing to play this.Even with that caveat, though, it's a solid game and gets a thumbs-up from me."

,Recommended,332330,20272637,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Christoph,"More Shooter!  I seriously love this game.  So glad that we finally get all the levels from one and two on PC.  What's disappointing is the performance.  The original Pixel Junk Shooter ran fine on my bare-bones HTPC with integrated graphics.  This one lags.  The extra eye candy wasn't really needed and just slows things down.  So I'd recommend the game, but with the performance caveat.Update: So I ended up putting a spare discreet card in my HTPC, and the game still chugs a bit on the ""ultimate"" graphics.  But with the old style, classic graphics, it's perfectly smooth now.  Which tells me that the simulation was probably limited by my HTPC cpu as well.  In any case, I think the game plays and looks better in classic mode anyway.  The new graphics make it harder to see what's going on."

I got PixelJunk Shooter first, and liked it so much I had to get this edition too.The Ultimate edition was well worth getting as well. Much improved graphics (to they extent that I can only play the new version on my PC; too much work for the GTX870M in my laptop) extra-decent sound track, and the same great gameplay as the original with more levels.The excellent physics for fluids/gasses are used effectively and interestingly.This game is 30% twin-stick shooter, 30% puzzle, 30% exploration/collecting, 30% speed runner and 20% indication that maths graduates reallycan'tadd up."
,Recommended,332330,25201642,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Jazhole,"I think the joys of good co-op often get overlooked in this age of widespread multiplayer deathmatches. The best part of Portal 2 was the co-op mode, for instance, since it took the established gameplay and spun it into something fresh with a reliance on teamwork.  PixelJunk Shooter is a fairly obscure game with a fairly terrible name, but it might offer some of the most polished and fun co-op of its generation.It’s a twin-stick 2D shooter where you control little ships and navigate underground caverns filled with lava, water and other hazards while rescuing colonists and collecting diamonds. The fun comes from how the different elements interact and the inevitable hijinks that ensue when two players try to work together only to end up setting each other on fire. This is one of those games where failing can be utterly hilarious rather than aggravating, especially since most of the challenge comes from the need for teamwork rather than the levels being particularly hard in themselves. So many times we had to restart a checkpoint because one of us managed to kill the colonist we were trying to rescue while clearing an obstacle.The environmental puzzles in each level start simple and get gradually more complex, effectively teaching you each new mechanic in sequence while still allowing some freedom as to how a level is approached. Then lessons you’ve learned get flipped on you, most obviously when you find the reversal module for your ship that makes you vulnerable to water but safe in lava. The fact that your life bar is a measure of how hot your ship is getting also makes for some nice risk-and-reward gameplay, because firing weapons or getting too close to heat sources will quickly overheat your ship until it crashes to the floor and explodes, but you can save yourself before impact by steering into something cold. Those near-miss moments are another big part of the fun, since your victories are usually snatched from the jaws of defeat.You need a certain number of diamonds in order to unlock each level, and these are fun to collect because they’re often cunningly hidden under the one pile of rubble you wouldn’t otherwise have bothered shooting, although it is annoying that diamonds can hide under the tiniest pixel of scenery, meaning that you need to thoroughly destroy every last bit of rock to be sure you haven’t missed one of the precious stones. Still, it’s a fun challenge to aim for, and I like these kind of games that cater to both casual and experienced players by offering an optional goal that’s not necessary to enjoy yourself.I was delighted to find that both PixelJunk Shooter 1 and 2 can be nabbed on Steam for less than a tenner, as part of the confusingly-named PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate, which is even stranger given that you can also buy the original game by itself for the same price. So make sure to only buy PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate, since there doesn’t seem to be any reason whatsoever to buy the first game separately. Just remember that the co-op seems to be local-only, but you’d lose something without the simple pleasure of hitting your friend when they accidentally drown your ship in lava. Or at least, they said it was an accident…"

However, it consistently crashes in the middle of levels. i.e. you don't get you don't get to save. It's a fun game, but I don't have time to waste replaying levels hoping it doesn't freeze up. If it's on sale and you're interested, buy it; but play it in first few days and be prepared to request a refund if it starts to freeze/crash on you."

See the hand? Talk to it. Do it.""Bought for 3€ even though I already had (and played through) the original. And yes, Ido recommendit. So, why the thumbs down?Because 1) this developer needs some pressure, and 2) you look for technical information in the negative reviews.There is a fundamental technical problem of a kind that just must not exist nowadays in games, the devs have known this for more than half a year, and it's still not fixed.If you have a 4K display, the game will not allow you to change the resolution, only the Hz count. Additionally, and this might be new to them, when you just choose ""fullscreen windowed"" to remedy this by using desktop resolution, the game will still be rendered at the wrong resolution (but will be scaled to the proper size).The scaling has very annoying artifacts. Because even though the users who reported this issue have 3840 x 2160 screens, the game assumes 4096 x 2160, and the down-scaling in ""fullscreen windowed"" for 1920x1080 hasverticalblack bars (Logically one would assume that they are at the top and bottom instead.)andhas stair steps in regular distances on both axes.See this discussion for details:https://steamcommunity.com/app/332330/discussions/0/483368526568197637/It's unacceptable that the resolution settings of a game in the year 2016 have this crass of a bug, especially when this is the spiced-up re-release of the original game. Which did not have such issues.Also, when I tried to open a support account, the email took 2 hours to arrive.Aaaaand ... I just found another bug. After I had played through a whole stage without problems and quit the game, just now when I started it again and played the next stage, there was a persistent big square behind the ship where the graphics were a wee bit darker, and no I'm not referring to the ambient-occlusion-esque smooth darkening around the ship. Only occurred once so far, can't reproduce.Right. I forgot to mention that the music, which is very good, does very obviously not loop correctly, I mean you don't have to have been a e-musican for about 15 years to notice. It only happens occasionally and is bearable, but HOW did this pass testing? *shakes head*It's not my computer btw. - i7-6700K, GTX980 4GB, 16 GB RAMI've just opened three support tickets accordingly. [EDIT: After 1 month, no reaction of any kind.]The game itself is stellar, and the improvements the Ultimate version brings arewellworth the 3€ I paid for it even though I had already played through the original. But these technical issues don't fly. I'll flip my vote once the devs do their job."

The final one in the first half of the game where you battle Alf was boring and frustrating, the game would have been a lot better without that.I started the second half and some of the new game elements were interesting.
