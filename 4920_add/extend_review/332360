,Not Recommended,332360,13333899,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,lemec,"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I have experience in hand-drawn animation, went to school for Digital 3D Animation and draw digitally and have worked for 5 years in the feature film visual effects industry. I've used programs like TVP Animation Pro, SOFTIMAGE, Maya, 3DS Max, Flash and even After Effects.So how does Spriter Pro measure up? In a nutshell, you get what you pay for, but you don't get what you don't pay for either. It will fulfill light animation demands, but I happen to be very demanding.The Good:It's got a nice interface and there's a lot of things that help with many of the repetitive aspects of animating and I think it's well thought out. They seem to also make frequent updates so I'm willing to update this review in kind.The Bad:There's no hotkeys to step through animation frames individually. This is a staple of just about any animation software I've used. The simple ability to hit "">"" and ""<"" to go forward through time incrementally.UPDATE: You can use CTRL+1/CTRL+2 to step through one millisecond at a time.Keyframed movement of objects seems to rail along linear paths. You want to make an object travel along a parabolic curve? Not without manually adding a lot of keyframes to smooth out that path, which renders the program's elaborate temporal tweening a moot point. Without curved trajectories, your characters will exhibit very mechanical and unnatural movement, no arcs.UPDATE: The developer has suggested a workaround for creating arcing/curved movement by parenting objects to bones and then animating their rotation. Movement paths are planned.Minor Quibbles:When I disabled OpenGL support, the program crashed every time I tried to start it up. Fortunately I was able to reenable OpenGL by editing a registry entry, but a less advanced user would probably flip out.UPDATE: FixedThe program crashed when I dragged PNG images onto the canvas. I found I had to resave my PNGs in another program (I used ASEPRITE to do this) so I suspect that Spriter will crash if there's anything in the PNG header that it disagrees with.The Unity Drag & Drop functionality didn't work as advertised. After installing the unitypackage and then dragging my Spriter Project onto Unity, none of the images were properly linked to the character, nor did any of the animation seem to make it into the project.UPDATE: fixedAll the same, I have high hopes for future versions of this software, but until then, I cannot yet recommend it for use."

,Recommended,332360,13878346,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,Reizla,"READ BEFORE BUYING AFTER MY POSITIVE REVIEW!!!Okay, lets start by telling that Spriter Pro is a nice program that allows you to make your animations that you can import into various engines (including Unity3D, which is why I bought it myself). It takes a bit to get used to Spriter Pro, and before you know what bugs and glitches are there and how to work around them. But the result are smoot animations for your game engine.Bugs/glitches I have found:The program is full of shortkeys you can use (CTRL-C / CTRL-V to copy/paste just to name one), but they do not work. Instead you have to use the program's pulldown menu.*SOLVED*after an updateDuplicating bones is not possible. This means you have to create each and every bone before you place them to the right position. This means that for a spider you have to make 16 bones instead of 2 and duplicate them 8 times.*SOLVED*Speaking of bones, the moment you have linked a sprite to a bone, you can not remove this link to correct the bone position. Whatever you do with the bone (resizing, moving or rotating) happens to the sprite. Oddly enough, you can move the sprite without influencing the bone. The work around I have found for this is move the sprite to an other bone and then modify the bone as I wish.*SOLVED*So far I haven't found an option to 'lock' a part of my animation in place while the rest of the animation flows. You have to set that same animation again on the spot where you want to add other animation options. As mentioned above, copy/pase is not working here, so it's manual labour.*SOLVED*From time to time when you're working on your bones, sprites and bones just glitch away from the hierarchy. You have to click around on random parts to get them back.According to author I'm the only one with this problemAs said, I like the program, and knowing these bugs/glitches it can be a very good tool. Honestly, I don't think it's worth the full price asked on Steam right now and I'm glad I bought it during the Steam winter sale."

I have no real technical knowledge, and have only dubiously poked at animation software/sprite design in the past. For this reason I can only review this as a casual user, and can't speak for anyone representing large game projects.Despite being a newbie in regards to this, it must be said that this software is excellent - it is fairly intuitive to use (granted, I still have a lot to learn), and there are countless tutorials available that are relatively simple to follow. It's been great to have the freedom to import sprite puppets from external software (in my case, opencanvas), and thus far it's been quite enjoyable to bring concept characters to life.This software is fun, I heartily recommend it for anyone wanting to dabble in it as a hobby, too."

The interface is simple yet complex enough to create detailed, varied animations, the export function work well, and the learning curve seems relatively low- I'm a hobby spriter and I can see a lot of use for this tool. I was looking for an animation tool that allows the export of sprite sheets, and man did I get a good deal at the current 75% off discount.In all honesty, though, the price IS a bit high to buy SpriterPro just ""playing around with it"" at full price. If you're into game design and want a catch-all tool for your animations, you can't really do wrong with this software. But if you just want to toy around with some animations, wait for a sale/discount.In both cases though, the sheer functionality is pretty damn worth it."

Animating is relatively painless, and export to Unity 5 went well, with only one animation we tested going crazy after import. (Still can't figure out why...) I paid $30 and also bought all the DLC packs for half price, so I view this as a really good investment. If you need the tool to create animations for a Unity 2D project, it is well worth the $60 price.I kind of got concerned after buying the DLC when I read that there were ""Essential"" versions of them already included with Spriter Pro.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of hours worth of artwork included here. It has a consistent vissual style and would all fit together in one game without clashing visually. If you do programming challenges like Ludum Dare, this would be great base artwork to free you time to work on game play instead. To be honest, it is worth the cost simply as an extensive set of examples of how to build your own animations. You could even simply reskin these animations with your own character parts and be good to go. Worth it at full price. A must buy at any discount over 40%."

There are simliar programs-- comparision below, but this program is the best option out of the three main options people use for gaming.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RINik8aPzgAway from gaming-- you bump into programs like Adobe Flash or Toonboom for animation and drawing needs. Manga Stuido is a pretty good option for drawing and making digtial art as Mike also usese it in his tutrorial videos for Spriter. Also, you can find Manga Studio or Clip Studio on sale evey so often."

But unfortunately the macOS version seems like a simple port of the windows one.The full screen is not working properly and increases the chance of crash.The more it's open ( even in idle and minimized ) the more chance of crash.Can't drag and drop scml files to it and have to open within the software.Overal it seems like a very good software and I was lucky to learn about it in steam summer sale which was 50% off."

It has done more for our games than any other tool.  It is so simple to put together animated characters, environment, and more.I have never been let down by it.  It is well worth the money if you are planning on doing animations in 2D.  Don't even waste your time looking for anything else to handle this.  It can do character maps, you can do color variations of characters.  You can do it all.  If you do indie development and art, it is a must have."

,Recommended,332360,33492560,Posted: 12 July,all,The Flaming Pike,"Well, at the beginning of the year I came up with the resolution to make a video game. Like many noob game makers out there, I opted for RPG Maker which seemed like the easiest method to make one. But I didn't like the basic elements it offered, including sprites and overall animations. I wanted to do something by myself. Something unique. I turned to Spriter. It looked good and it seemed like it worked. I always write long reviews and this one won't be an exception, but for the TL;DR people: It works for RPG Maker and it's a good software.First, the presentation. It's not perfect. You pretty much entirely depend on tutorials if you want to get started. The software itself is not very friendly if you are a beginner. The video tutorials are on Youtube. I don't think that part was well done right from the start. First of all, perhaps it would have been easier to simply make tutorial ""bubbles"" pop up inside the software for your first time. Or maybe you could have just put a few tiny demonstration videos within the software, or have things highlighted to guide you. Something, anything. Well, no, it's pretty much all on Youtube. And the tutorials on Youtube, sure they teach you how to use the software, but man... No hate for the guy who made the videos, I know you're doing your best, but you should have given this task for someone who knew how to make tutorials. The videos have terrible audio (quality of a built-in laptop mic) and are unnecessary long. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to explain how to do a walking animation when, about 10 hours through the software, I managed to make a decent walking animation in under 20 minutes myself. The guy looses himself in his explanations so often, it requires a lot of patience not to skip the thing.But that's one of the only negative things I have to say about it. The second issue I have is the lack of buttons. The interface is lacking in content. Some of the core manipulations you can do in Spriter don't have an icon to click on. The software often relies on keyboard shortcuts. But this is not a RTS game. This is a software. Where you frequently have to use your mouse or ( in my case ) tablet. This is a relatively simple software and yet you can make an efficient toolbox like in drawing programs such as GIMP or Photoshop? Erm...Once you forget about those two problems and you learn how to make animations, however, Spriter works like a charm. It allows you to make animations easily and quickly. It does most of the work. To put it simple, you make the beginning of your animation and then the end and Spriter connects both ends. Of course, you can also make more complex animations as well. I really like the various export options at my disposal. You can choose how many frames, the speed of your animation and a few more things. Despite the negative part of my review, I can't honestly give it a thumbs down since it does the job it's made to do. One disappointment I have, however, is that you must rely on another software to actually draw the sprites. To me, it seems like a missed opportunity. Perhaps some people are scared of venturing in animation because they think it's too hard for them. Maybe they could've sold more if they would've introduced Spriter as an animation AND drawing software. I certainly believe that would be interesting. I, myself, would love to be able to rely on a single software instead of jumping from one to another.I know they're making a Spriter 2. I'm really looking forward to this upcoming software and I'm pretty sure that the issues I've mentionned are already in the devs' notebook."
