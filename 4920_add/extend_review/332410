,Not Recommended,332410,18029589,"Posted: 14 September, 2015",all,orpe11,"Edit: Steam is now showing this review as pre-release. I don't know what the publisher of this game did on Steam to make it think it was in a beta before this, but it wasn't. It was sold as a full release, with collector's editions and everything. It is still a terrible game, and everything in this review is still valid.TL;DR: This sort of game is the reason RPGMaker things on steam have such a negative stigma. It exhibits incompetence at every level.I am now honestly surprised this game has net positive reviews on steam. I've been designing an RPGMaker game myself, and was looking around to see what sort of things had positive reviews on here. I have no idea what game the other reviewers were playing, but it wasn't this game.-The writing is atrocious. It reads like a bad fan-fic of someone elses fantasy world. There is no consistency in writing or tone, nor of the world the people were trying to build. In a purely fantasy setting, why is one character talking about her CV(resume)? The opening sequence was so bad that I immediately closed it and tried to get a refund. Too bad I was past my date for it. None of these characters read like real people. The writing was so bad that the best choice the designers made was including a 'talk to party' function, so I could skip past the horrible writing and still be able to figure out where I had to go. You still have to talk to every inane, useless, and pointless NPC in town for fear of missing a quest, so good luck talking to thirty some-odd NPCs with such riveting dialogue that is important to world building such as ""I love this carpet!""-The battle balancing is also atrocious. You can be walking around a dungeon, fighting enemies that look like Hindu gods and Chimeras, and one shotting them easily, but 'deadly snake' can nearly wipe your party with repeated paralysis attacks. No warning or lead up, but I'm so glad that snake was tougher than any boss in the game I fought. You get no indication of what enemies are weak to or what spells work, so whether you choose attack or spells for a new enemy is entirely random, and so many of the clearly 'physical' characters have tons of useless attack spells as well, and quite a few casters don't get any attack spells for several levels that are of any use. You have so many spells to dispel an enemy's buff, but never run into enemies who actually buff themselves.-There is a fundamental level of incompetence in the coding itself. A spell that casts 4 fireballs, will also tick you for poison damage or regen for each fireball. An item that says 'revives and restores 100 life points' will revive and restore you to 1. You will clip right through cliffs and forests in maps. You will cast spells and wonder if they actually did anything, or if the fancy animation was the intended effect alone.-Map design is utterly ridiculous. Almost every map consists of 'overly long corridor, leading to dead end or to the next area, good luck picking'. Several -towns- are behind these dungeons, as well as quest items hidden in the inscrutable mazes that take hours to traverse. Thank god encounters aren't truly random, because I would have quit long before I did. Better finish those quests the first time you are in town, otherwise you'll have to treck through the whole dungeon again to get back...oh wait, the quest makes you do that anyway, because part of it is outside town. Several things are hidden in a dungeon, without any warning that you can never go back once you are finished, including quest items and summons.-The 'deluxe' edition has the official guide, which probably includes maps. I wonder if it also includes the developer laughing at the fact that you bought a 'deluxe' edition of this game.Do. Not. Buy. There are far, far better RPGMaker games for free, and even better ones available on steam."
,Recommended,332410,18744397,"Posted: 29 October, 2015",all,Faudraline,"I've been looking for an RPGMaker game with a cheesy story that would offer some enjoyable dungeon crawling in my library andMoonchildseemed like an appropriate candidate. You know, the ones that you wouldn't spare much mental RAM for... and I've finally found it!Moonchildis a cute game that hails from Aldorlea Games - a really promising RPGMaker based developer team - that will easily offer you 20 hours of gameplay.In a medieval fantasy realm, Queen Calypso's only daughter, Moonchild is abducted! Our honorable knight Gabriel was able to detain one of the heinous criminals, but the man apparently lost his memory. We start our journey to save Calypso's daughter. The word is that Moonchild isn't the only young noble woman who was abducted: daughters and wives of other local monarchs are missing too. During our travels, we'll consult the wisdom of elves, pass frozen wastes to find a Gifted in the ancient arts of mind, infiltrate the domain of our sworn enemy and even find a common cause to work alongside them. What kind of danger a mother wouldn't risk to take to save her child? It seems none...Graphics won't present you anything extraordinary, yet I found environment design to be fitting and beautiful within the limitations of RPGMaker. The game rewards exploring obscure dead ends, so nowhere you explore is an actual time loss. You always find some interesting item or a power up. Soundtrack is pretty, yet it becomes annoyingly repetitive after a while, so I strongly recommend muting the game and playing your own soundtrack in any of these 16 bit games - with some exceptions like ASM or FF series, of course.Someone said gameplay? Oh, it's nothing unfamiliar. We have a 16 bit party of 4 characters at a time - in which we can arrange and alternate with other characters anytime outside of a battle - , turn based battles with basic strategies, enemies with different immunities and weaknesses. We battle, we gain experience and level up, we search for new items to power up and complete a side quest here and then. See, it is your basic RPG. The world isn't that big, neither that diverse, but the main story itself would present you a nearly 20 hour gameplay and its engaging enough. The game also comes with 3 different difficulties for you to pick based on your experience with these kind of games.I'd consider one minus to be achievements. They are mostly based on one specific character having a certain number of kills. It becomes boring to farm characters just for the sake of achievement, and it's a strategic dead-end. You'd already have a party formation that you like better by the middle of the game anyhow.Another thing from the horse's mouth: the ending WAS an unexpected one for me, which is seriously rare in these 16 bit games. I didn't expect that outcome, not at all! You'd like a basic RPGMaker adventure with interesting enough story and cute characters? You've got it.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

The stats and mechanics are poorly explained, battles seem to run the gamut of effortless or tedious, with nothing in-between, and the dialogue is relentlessly awful.That last point is what gets me the most, actually, so I'm going to go in-depth a bit on that:1. Every character seems to have some little snark to throw in to every situation, regardless of relevance. This is tiresome.2. It takes about 6 text boxes for 1 text box of information to be conveyed. The rest is fluffy, unfunny babble.3. The dialogue has no mind for tone - hamfisted attempts at humor are thrust in everywhere.4. The *actions/emotes in asterisks* are the worst. They're lazy. What they're attempting to convey does not even require custom sprites, and could be conveyed with halfway competent writing and eventing.My only reprieve from the tedious, pointless battles is the aggravating dialogue (and vice-versa). This game leaves me feeling more stressed than a leisure activity should. It is not fun, and it is not even a tenth as funny as it thinks it is."

But walking in a specific direction for 10 minutes only to realize it was a dead end all the time is frustrating. Especially when some towns REQUIRE you to go through these mazes.The game does not tell you what enemy is weak to what element. Some powerful looking skill will deal pathetic damage, making you wonder WTF just happened.This game made me avoid all RPGMaker games because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥I went through to complete it.

The Moonchild of the title is an 8-year-old princess, who is kidnapped. Her mother, Queen Calypso gathers a bunch of friends to search for and rescue the child. As well as punish those behind it.If you go into this game not expecting more than the usual, you should be fine."

Moonchild is a great example of such a game.I played Moonchild approximately two years ago, and had a wonderful time. I spend 44 hours playing this game, and had a fun time getting all the achievements and exploring every little corner of the gameworld. I had an enjoyable time recruiting a diverse team of 9 characters, all of which have different skills sets. Out of the 9, I grind my group of 4 (only 4 out of 9 are involved in fights) until they reach very high levels of 40+. I love grinding and there are always lots  of things to do and lots of side quests to work on in Moonchild.I would like to highly recommend this game to any old school RPG Maker enthusiasts who likes a great storyline and a detailed game world with lots of things to do. You will love this game."

This Steam version has some new unique art.While the story in the game is not too compelling, it has enough pace to make you want to see how it unfolds.The game has a few really powerful and, in my opinion, unbalanced spells that could potentially spoil the whole game for you if you get them early on(one of which is possible to get right at the beginning of the game).Those aside, if you are looking for a few hours of fun, go ahead and buy it!"

,Not Recommended,332410,29904516,Posted: 13 February,all,Nax_o,"Skip this title and go for better RPGmaker games.I'll keep this short: Early game is awesome. Good action and decent writing. Later the usual JRPG grinding and massive dungeons come into play and it becomes a test of endurance.  The #1 review of this game lists very accurately the bad sides this title has. (and i am being much more lenient here on the writing)Oh i know fans of JRPG just love this but for me once the interest starts to wane it doesn't get better by throwing more of the same and harder in your face. Let me remind you that on Steam there are some terrific titles here that can either bring you good writing, good combat or both done better than this. Don't settle for sub-par garbage. RPGmaker games partially deserve their bad reputation and this game is here to remind why that is so."

,Not Recommended,332410,28380194,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,Xenon (Xe),"First off, if I didn't have annoying voices imagined for each character, especially the protaganist, or from what I've gotten so far, maybe I'd be more towards this game. It is also very cliche, at least from the start. Typical rescue agenda, with no idea of where to go, so you aimlessly wander until, surprise, you stumble across something. Another thing would be how RPG titles shouldn't do the map in that way, as it can become a bit disorienting, as you're suddenly going from normal scale, to you're pretty much a giant treading through things, and I'm not sure why she said she needed to get the horses? I never saw any- But irregardless of my views and certain wants for a game, this is a decent game if you have the time and patience for it."
,Recommended,332410,22541104,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Lyonesse,"[Neutral Review]Firstly, I must say that I like RPG maker games and my first impressions of Moonchild were pretty good. The characters had strong and captivating personalities and the plotline was intriguing.But as the game progressed, the massive grinding and the unbalanced levelling system made me drop it at some point. I really felt unmotivated, even though I wanted to see how the plotline would evolve.If you really like RPG maker games and is looking to play a new one, this is a ""ok"" one and you should give it a try - even with all it's flaws. I hope you won't get bored as I did."

Couldn't change party members and to go back to town to buy more of stuff would mean wasting quite a bit of time, since it's in a dungeon, not to mention that probably I had to pull the switches in a specific order again = wasting even more time.I thought I had it all.... How wrong I was...So the final battle. I wasted I think 1 hour on trying to kill her. I wasted dozens of healing bottles and what not. Make it dozens of wasted bottles of whatever it is, I had a lot of it ''lol''. Eventually she killed my group off because unlike all the other bosses she just didnt want to go down. Also thanks to her constantly spawning like 5 other strong allies of hers. Almost each and every few turns.... and getting boosted and healed. Oh don't forget her fantastic abilities that kill 2 people momentarily and cripple the rest. Just how I wanted the game to end!X_X"
