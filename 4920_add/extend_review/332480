I beat most levels in maximum 5 tries, except for the last one. OMG!The graphic is nice, the background is moving as you fly, and the colours - ohh, all the pretty colours. O.OThe ending is especially beautiful.Decent prize, steam cards + achievements.Negative PhoenixIt's not like a negative thing, because it's not essential in these types of games. But there were very little storyline - However more than usually.And that's it for the negativity :P rejoice!Closing CommentsI totaly went with the Frozen Chicken. The power to freeze time and neutralise most attacks was so powerful for me, guaranteed at least 1 defeated enemy.The cold never bothered me anyway!"

Might as well be playing a free Adobe Flash game from the mid-2000s.No obvious hitbox indicator— just a few frames of a flapping bird.Constant re-use of gameplay, audio, and art assets. All seem very basic and uninteresting, but they could be worse.No tutorial.No meaningful options— just audio and vibration (which I didn't even notice being on).Can't choose between using keyboard or controller— the game defaults to using any plugged-in controller it detects.In-game advertisement for the sequel.No control over your own attacks— both basic attacks and each bird's special ability are fired automatically. This can cause enemies (fights frequently involve more than one type of enemy, as a way to provide variety) to start using more powerful attacks when the player means to focus on only one.If you really like bullet hell games or you want to try out a very simple and cheap bullet hell game, get this when it's on sale for next to nothing."

,Not Recommended,332480,32045082,Posted: 29 May,all,Juliannb,"This game.... is just boring!The graphics are not bad and I do like the design of the phoenixes, but when it comes to a flying shoot'em up game, the most important aspect of the game is not just moving around, but also mashing the fire button until your thumb breaks appart from killing a bombard of enemies, and the collection of power-ups... this game has none of those.Right off the bat, the only controls you have is the D-Pad (or WASD or arrows, if you please). The game fires by itself, you just have to move around and avoid projectiles and bosses from one-hit-killing you, which I'm ok with, that adds to the challenge, but when the challenge is based on just dodging... where is the fun?And it's considered to be a ""bullet hell"" game, which isn't wrong, but... just fighting bosses really sets a limit, a no-enjoyable one. Sure! There're different bosses, but they tend to repeat them.Do you wanna play this game with a friend? Well jokes on you! This game is single player... and it's not like there's a lack of characters to choose from, but you can only play solo. Just another forever-alone game.Lack of power-ups and lack of enemies to kill (sure, some bosses send minions to kill you, but that's about it). It has a leveling-up system though and each character has their own particularity and special attack, I'll give you that.Again, it is challenging, but it can be even more challenging when you:- Go through a stage;- Kill enemies and collect power-ups (again);- ARE ABLE TO PRESS A FIRE BUTTON. This really pisses me off, it just doesn't give you any satisfaction. And I consider cheatting the power of having a turbo button, that's pretty much the same as auto-fire.And yes, you can say I only played for like 15 minutes, that it's an indie game and that I got it for a really cheap price (I think it was 50 cents or so), but that doesn't make up for what I've experienced here, I played it for that time and uninstalled it, I wouldn't have paid 5 bucks for this.I do see potential, but they need to come up with something better than that.If shoot'em up games from now on are gonna be auto-fire... then I'm getting off this train."

76561198138700608,Recommended,332480,33973813,Posted: 2 August,all,Apollo Trollo,"Brief: Score: 72/100.  A good SHOOT ‘EM UP that’s definitely worth playing.Phoenix Force is mostly about patience and avoiding damage.  The main gun is auto fire, so as long as you avoid damage you will eventually kill the enemy.  The more skillful players, who can memorize the bullet patterns, will be able to take down enemies by being more aggressive and jumping into the bullet hell more often.  Again, patience is the most power skill since one hit means death.  The enemies are basically all bosses. You meet a new boss in one level, then you face off against the new boss and a combination of the other bosses in later levels.  The game is a nice grind, since there are about 100 levels.  The graphics are passable.  Don’t expect to see amazing effects that you might run into in the top games in the genre.  Still, for the price, it’s a very good experience.  In fact, if you can pick it up during a sale, it probably is a must buy if you care about “bang for the buck” purchases."

You use your mouse to move the character around and try to dodge anything that's coming towards you as your Pheonix automatically fires back at the targets without having to press any buttons. for 4.99(0.49 cents at the time of writing this review), it's an engaging action game that's light on story and is certainly more than enough to keep you occupied for a good, long while."

,Recommended,332480,14311992,"Posted: 3 February, 2015",all,Tentacle-Kitty,"Phoenix Force is the tenth game I have played through completely, and the fourth that I got all achievements in. It's a very, very challenging game, and I absolutely recommend it.As for the story, a group of phoenixes is tasked with defeating hordes of enemies, before they can reach a dying tree to revive it. 100 Levels, and 100 Extra Challenges (to unlock the 6th and last phoenix) offer hours of challenging bullet dodging and thinking of which phoenix to pick.Fury, the starter phoenix, is able to elimite bullets directly in front of him, Cryo will freeze all enemies for a couple of seconds, Tupa is able to teleport around on the field, Gaia simply has homing shots (which will always attack the nearest enemy), Gast is able to summon a shield, and Lich gains orbs shooting along with it the more health it drains from the enemies.And with this force, you should be able to clear all the levels - but be prepared to get frustrated at some of the more tricky enemy types!"
76561198027364206,Not Recommended,332480,17529925,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,ikillomega,"This is a hard recommendation for me.  On the positive it is a clever game with a few good ideas, such as the incorporation of RPG elements and focusing the game on boss fights.  However, the game is hampered by a few issues that put it a step behind other, better, shoot-'em-ups like Crimzon Clover.The first is the fact that there is no slowdown button.  There is no control button to slow your phoenix down to navigate the more complex fields of bullets.  Instead, the analog stick is pressure sensitive.  So, when you're using the lighter touch on the analog stick you're sacrificing maneuverability for movement safety, hoping you can maintain control.A second big problem is the way the game is structured.  Since you only have a single life per fight, if you get hit, you have to go through a continue screen that allows you to exit to the map or select another phoenix.  These menus are animated.  Overly-animated menus are actually a huge pet-peeve of mine because they add that 1 second that's just enough to be irritating between bouts.  On later fights where death is a regular risk, you will go through this a lot, especially due to the often imprecise controls.Thirdly, there's the repetitive bosses.  You will fight the same bosses over and over, ad-nauseum, throughout the game.  As you move forward, many of these bosses with become harder.  Either their attack patterns will change, their bullets will move faster or start homing in on you, or you will see some combination thereof.  When the ideas for tough bosses run out, the game is padded out with fights against two bosses simultaneously, which is fine, but still repetitive.  After seeing the same skeleton boss over and over through the game it got pretty old.Finally, and arguably the most important, is this is a very, very simple game.  Unlike a lot of the best shooters ever made, Phoenix Force does little in terms of gameplay.  You auto-fire during the fights, so your job basically becomes ""dodge the things"".  The bosses all move the same way, waving left to right across the top of the screen, and while their attacks are varied, simply moving in a U-pattern following them and focusing attacks on them between their pattern cycles will win you just about every fight.  What I'm saying is, there is no really unique concept here.  There are a ton of bullet hell shooters on Steam now and given the quality of so many of them, I cannot justify buying this game unless you have all of the other good ones in your library already.Not to say Phoenix Force is a bad game, but in all of its simplicity and attempts to be a progressive experience rather than a flashy arcade game, it loses a lot of the fun factor so many other games in this genre have.  The reason people love games like Giga Wing, the Touhou shooters or the masterpiece that is Ikaruga is BECAUSE they are varied and challenging arcade-style experiences.  The lack of simple RPG elements does not make them lesser games, just as the presence of those elements in Phoenix Force does not make it great."

This is worth.This is a Boss-type SHUMP, so if you don't enjoy shooting up fodder like in most games, this will suit to your liking.Every level helps you learn something about each specific boss, which is important because the later levels will have you fighting multiple bosses (up to 4) at once!!Each boss has a unique yet simple moveset and usually have 2 phases, forcing you to make decisions on who to focus in multiple-boss levels.Plenty of content - 100 normal levels, and 100 challenge levels (4 random bosses at once)6 playable birds, each with unique abilities like teleportation, freeze, fire wave, homing etc.Replayablilty - even after the game is over, the challenge levels are random 4 bosses so they can be replayed forever.Weaknesses:I wish there was a level-editor because I have very intersting boss matchups in mind. For example, I want to fight 4 Blue serpents at once (that would be truly bullet-hell challenging)- best chance is to play a challenge level to see if you get multiple serpents.The 6th bird is unlocked by beating the 100 challenge levels, but is very underwhelming, I wish the rewards are more meaningful.The leveling and upgrade system, while cool, is minimalistic and could use more variety and options.Overall rating: 9/10"

Start again, do it over. No forgiveness, and that's great. It has you holding your breath as you need just one more second, to avoid one more bullet, to finish a boss before he finishes you.Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the beginning. As more and more bosses show up in the same round, you're going to start to feel the weight of the challenge.I can't believe I only spent 9 hours on this game so far. It feels like so much longer because you really  have to slow down time to ensure that you can dodge those bullets with the one life you're given. It really helps train focus.It's a great game to pick up for a few minutes, dodge, kill, and then leave it for another day.Although there are a limited number of bosses, they combined in many different ways making each fight is unique.If you enjoy old school, one life to live, inhuman dodging... you'll like this game.... edit ...(From what I see, most of the negative reviewers, who say the game is too easy, are from people who have played this game for only a few minutes. Of course they are going to think the game is going to be easy if they never make it past the first few levels! It's kind of like saying a game is too easy because they *crushed* the tutorial. Although, in the end maybe they game wasn't for them, because if they don't have the patience to get to higher levels, they probably don't have the ability to focus intensely and deeply, without distraction for a few minutes, which is an essential skill in higher levels)."

Reminds me of Dragon Spirit on NES.Small variety of enemies, but simple epic music and good gameplay makes up for it!+Xbox controller support - that's always a nice touch.By the way PHOENIXES ARE AWESOME! :PFor 0,50 Euro this is bang!This should be awailable on mobile."

For those who already played the game in a phone, this conversion is very good: better controls, higher difficulty but more rewards to improving your phoenixes.This is not an easy game and there are no difficulty levels so take this into consideration before buying it."

,Recommended,332480,17347021,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,Minzoku Bokumetsu,"Phoenix Force is a bit slow to start, and it doesn't feel challenging until North America (Level 21). Even then, it feels like a Boss Rush RPG, since you can go back to prior stages and grind for level-up points if your power level is too weak. I don't know if that's really the idea with shmups, but I'll give it a recommend because it has cute artwork, I like the semi-transparent player fire (Touhou influence?), and I guess it'd be fun on a mobile if I had one that would run it (though maybe only South America since handheld shmups are kinda awful to control). Can't get the hang of using Tupã's teleport, though, and I needed a friend to tell me that it was a teleport power in the first place (yay being thrown into the game without any kind of instructions to explain the autofire and autobomb)."

They are pretty much really simplified.But beware as the difficulty curve is pretty much random, you will be doing the same thing over and over, and there are glitches here and there.Grab it only if it is in some sort of promotion."
