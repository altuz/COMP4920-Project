76561197991765695,Not Recommended,393390,21216155,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,koberko,"This is not even a demo!!Here is what you can do in this ""game"":- walk around- touch rats to get 100 points (there is no ""action"" to catch rat; you just ""touch"" it)- knock over various objects to get pointsAND THAT'S IT!You get ONE level, with 3 things to do, and that's it! Once time runs out, you can either exit to main menu or replay level.And even that little they managed to mess up; there are various bugs regarding clipping (you can fall off map quite easily), objects physics don't work properly (all objects fly off in same direction, now matter from which side you push them), rat's just randomly walk around or stand still (they don't try to escape from your to give some challenge)And worst of all, THERE IS NO CATS IN THIS GAME! Only cat you see is one on main splash screen and that's it! Occasionally in game you can hear ""maow"" sound, but beside that, there is no other indication that you play as cat.Don't waste your time with this POS, no matter how much you like cats!P.S. Don't trust all those ""positive"" reviews; they are all fake and made to fool you to waste money on this!"

May become better as it develops but at the moment there is one lvl and you knock things over, which would be more fun if there was better sound, I dont even think it has music, and when you knock something over it already has a pre-determind way that it is going to fall, so when you walk into a book to push it over it knocks you off as your in the way(most of the time) and from what ive seen there are no leaderboards or anything. Don't buy it at this time unless you have lots of faith in this game and want to get it for a cheaper price, as there is almost nothing to do. Now thanks you if you were able to read through my wall of boring text."
,Not Recommended,393390,21234933,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Scarlette Rose,"This game is broken and is in a barely pre-alpha stage, the game is full of bugs and in its current state only serves to make Early Access in general worse off than before by adding yet another poorly ""developed"" game here.CONS* Broken Physics, all the objects only move in one direction when your ""cat"" collides with them in ways that make no sense, if you approach them from the wrong side the ""knocked over"" objects will actually fly right at you and move your character in a completely immersion-breaking way.* The level is small and ten minutes of digging on the unity store I found that most (if not all) of the level was actually bought from the Unity store under the name ""Top-Down Interiors"" and since this asset pack was designed with top-down levels in mind, there is no ceiling at all despite it very clearly being a room. It is worth noting that developer isn't doing anything illegal by doing this but it would be nice to see if they had added onto the assets for a bigger and better map.* Multiple times throughout my own personal playthroughs I found that my ""cat"" would fall through the floor that required a restart to play again only to fall through again.* In its current state the game is extremely boring with the small level and lack of content beyond some books, a couple rats and cups that frequently knock your ""cat"" over.* The developers don't even care enough about the game to fix the skybox's black dots, an issue that is apparently easy to fix and shows how little attention to detail the developers had given to this ""game"".Overall I would steer clear of this game as it will most likely never leave early access in order to justify how little content and nemerous bugs are in the game. Do not buy it even on a 95% off sale."

The developer has even said in a news post on the store page, "" DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUPPORT US"". Take this crap to kickstarter and get off Steam then!I gave this a full work up on my channel here.https://youtu.be/UKyrygLAgZE"

,Not Recommended,393390,22512088,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,mushy924,"At the moment I have to not recommend this 'simulator'. As it stands it's a $4.99 demo with one very small map nothing to do but catch mice and knock over stuff. The game hasn’t seen an update since I bought it about a month ago. If the developer reads this please add more content in the game, PLEASE, this game has sooo much potential.I want my 3 hours of my life back."
,Not Recommended,393390,32051591,Posted: 29 May,all,finmide,"This is just a knock off of Catlateral Damage. Except this only has 1 level, 1 cat model which u can't really see anyways, and nothing else. If you beat the level it just restarts. Very cheaply made and not really worth it."
,Not Recommended,393390,30281547,Posted: 2 March,all,TheViking,This game...not great.   Try Catlateral Damage instead.
,Not Recommended,393390,28169057,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,L O B A ❤,"I'm really upset with this game. It doesn't worth your money, no matter how much you love cats. It should cost less then $1.Basically, the game have a shallow objective: chase mouses and drop objects off the top of tables and etc. Thats ok, its a 'cat simulator', so whatelse a cat does? 'you think'...but...The game happens in only one scenery, some kind of house (like you can see in the store page screenshots and video), that has no roof! And the jump is buggy, you spend like 15-30secs to jump on something, for example.It doesn't have another modes to play. Its just that! I can't believe they're selling this♥♥♥♥♥♥in this price. I'm feeling fooled, 'cause the video and screenshots seems fine, but don't fool yourself, and believe in this review. IT DOESNT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! DOESN'T EVEN HAVE STEAM TRADING CARDS OR ACHIEVMENTS!!!"

There is just one level and nothing much to it. There isn't even any sign that you are actually a cat besides a little meowing in the background. If you want a fun game that is not disapointing, I'd reccomend Catlateral Damage instead, you can do much more in that one than this one."
