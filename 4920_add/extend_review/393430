76561197970537749,Recommended,393430,22526884,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,kingbobcat,"Good game. As an ice fisherman myself, I can say that it is exactly what it says it is... Ice Fishing. I think the graphics are OK for what it is, the gameplay is good, and I'm enjoying my time with it so far.One downside is that there is no tutorial (at least that I noticed). Meaning, if you don't know ice fishing already, you could be lost. Some simple instructions would go a long way.A couple of tips for starters: You need to run out on the lake, pick a spot, drill a hole with your auger, BAIT your hook/jig (there are grubbs that go on the hook or you won't catch anything). You can vary your depth using your mouse wheel (where I live, slightly off the bottom is where you fish, but other depths can work). There is a strainer next to the hole to keep ice out of the hole (click on it, I think I caught more fish when the hole was clear). Watch the end of the pole, when you get a hit, hit the F button on your keyboard or use the reel icon on the screen to pull up the line. Lastly, there is a bait shop near where you started for bait, etc. and when the time is running down, get back to that area to have your score count! Not exactly ""review"" material, but I hope this is some help to you.All in all, a good ice fishing game that I'd recommend to a friend. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet..."
,Recommended,393430,22523302,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,Stephen,"First off, its not bass or ocean fishing, its important to keep that in mind when playing it. Ice fishing is not fast paced or about the fights, its about the right lure in the right location.Graphics could be better but honestly they are better then alot of other $12 games out there. Animation motions are smooth and did not experience any clipping issues.Multi-player is a fun idea, seeing others running around digging holes and jumping spot to spot on the ice.The sounds in the game are accurate and good.Did not seem to be drawing anything from my second video card but the game ran very smooth with no crashes or hang-ups.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fishing, we dont have enough fishing games out there to pick from and to the collectors of group multiplayer games."
,Recommended,393430,22545837,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,juhnu,"Is it the most realistic ice fishing game? Definitely not. Is it fun? Absolutely! Especially when played with friends over voice chat.The devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing. For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition. Does Ice Lakes provide the competition? I'd like to think so. It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it.Ice Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front. Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks. Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect. But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm  optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates.If you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed. The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times. 1.2kg ruffe.. that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out!5/5, will recommend!"

76561197997923781,Recommended,393430,22568021,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,L4zz1,"Ice Lakes is exactly what I hoped it to be: a modernized version of popular ice fishing games. You can finally go ice fishing in 3D. Ice Lakes keeps the focus in fishing and there is more customization than in the previous ice fishing games I have played: you can change different hooks to your jigs or you can drop some baits in the water to lure a specific fish a bit better. Meanwhile you can scoop off the ice from your fishing hole. These little things really improve the atmosphere. You can upgrade your gear in the shop after you have earned some money from the games.It is also noteworthy that the developers in Ice Flake Studios are listening the community and applying hotfixes fast. The biggest problem I found was that fishes' weight was too high, but a hotfix for this was applied on the next day. There is still some tuning in fishes' weight but it is already ALOT better.I actually sent the developers an e-mail where I asked about future plans and I listed some suggestions that I personally hoped to see in the game. On the next day I got an answer from one of the developers where he took the time to separately answer all of my questions. For example online stats are in the to do -list, as well as adding information of current lake's species so you can see them while fishing. I also said that at the moment it is too easy to reel in bigger fishes and developer answered that they are currently working to improve this, and this should be one of the first improvements they are applying.All in all I would recommend this game for everyone who likes fishing or fishing games in general. Lets face it, there really is not enough fishing games so Ice Lakes is a very welcome addition.Lastly some tips I suggest:- I am fishing holding down ""Mouse 1"", moving the mouse trying to lure the fish. You can reel in the fish pressing ""F"" or moving the mouse to the top of your screen and releasing ""Mouse 1"". I changed the ""F"" key to ""Space"" so it is possible to just hit the keyboard to reel in your catch.- If you want to hunt for the biggest fish or you prefer the ocean maps, I suggest you save your money for the heaviest equipment to be able to catch them.- I changed to third person and preferred that immediatly. Using ""WASD"" to move is the most convenient.- If you can not catch any fish, try scrolling your mouse to try from a different depth."

,Recommended,393430,28509238,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Bob Lee Swagger,"Love this simulator!Being from Northern Minnesota I'm a huge ice fisherman and when I don't have time to get out this is a fun way to get my fix. Multiple lakes, ponds and rivers to try and fish along with a plethra of different fish species (half I've never even heard of but that's becauese they're European fish species). So far it's a pretty simple game. I like to compare fishing to golf, a day to learn and a lifetime to master. I think I've had more luck just using a baitless balanced lure over the baited types as long as you are jigging like a madman the fish seem to come flyin up the hole (assuming you found a good spot). Graphics leave a bit more to be desired and I have no idea what the point of the jump feature is but it's there. I've never had much urge to try any VR but this game makes me want to.Some funny points:-The animation is a bit on the basic side but for $15 what can you expect.-I would pay to watch someone take off at a full sprint wearing a snowsuit, carrying a hand auger/drill, all their fishing gear, a chair and whatever fish they've caught (sometimes 20+) running all around a lake like Usain Bolt. If you've ever ice fished you know that equipment isn't exactly light. Your character must be a well conditioned, finely tuned athlete to sprint a mile, hand auger 10-20 holes and carry all that equipment. Just cracks me up.-The wildlife running around on the lake is a funny addition. I've read there's apparently a bear somewhere in this game as well.Cons:-Online mode. When I looked for online action the 3 servers offered were all empty. However, if you have a few friends that own this you can set up a tournament for all of you to play in.-Music. This game could really use more than the one 15 second loop that will drive you insane if listened to too long. Also reminds me ALOT of Golf with my Friends music.Being a pureblood Minnesotan I've been ice fishing ever since I was a wee lad. Here I am at 29 years old still doing it whenever I get a chance. However, there are many days I just don't have time to make it out on the lakes so when this was brought to my attention I was immediately interested. I was hesitant to buy this but the large majority of the reviews seemed positive and it happened to go on sale for $10 while watching it so I decided to pull the trigger. This game has yet to disappoint and already provided me more entertainment than I anticipated. So I highly suggest this to anyone who enjoys some simple ice fishing or has never tried it even.Side note: My brother came up with what I thought would be a funny idea for my Live-stream and to get a VR setup outside in the Northern MN elements... Sit outside in the real cold winter weather while fishing for fake fish. Really want to do that once haha."

This game isn't cutting edge or ""best ever"" but it is a good game.   I've never ice fished in real life so can't speak for the realism of the game but it is a good way to pass some time if you can't actually get out on the lake.The downside is it's kind of repetitive to have to earn money to buy equipment, but you do have full access to all the lakes in the game from the start.Worth a try, especially now that it's on sale."

Initially, I was ""THIS CLOSE"" to asking for a refund, but - wanting a relaxing game experience - I stuck with it. Note: Long tournaments and short competitions are NOT actually relaxing. But free-fishing is digital zen.I haven't ice-fished (in real life) for decades, but it was something I loved doing when I was a kid. Sigh, nostalgia... So, I gave this game another shot. After maybe an hour of play, I began to figure things out. The equipment you purchase (with in-game cash earned by catching fish, by winning competitions and tournaments) makes a HUGE difference to your success. This is not instant gratification - its a slow burn.I am 40 hours into the game now, and I haven't yet explored a third of what it offers. While I might not always win - I always feel that my failures are my fault, and not because of the RNG. This is a game that I feel I can play for years. Go back to that old map... try this bait... catch that slightly bigger fish... break my record...I will admit that it is hard to get a grasp on the controls in the beginning - it is not very intuitive out of the gate. But Ice Lakes IS worth taking your time with.AND... I just caught a 32 lb sturgeon so WOOHOO! YAY ME!10/10 Will buy games made in Finland again."

She asked me what I was doing.""I'm ice fishing in a duck pond outside some major city.""/pause""Oh, ok.""She presumably walks off puzzled, now imagining she just experienced something akin to interrupting a 5 year old during playtime.

,Recommended,393430,22587247,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,tim.,"I remember the days when I was out there myself - the long days in the cold, cold African glaciers, wearing nothing but a pair of Adidas Air Jordan Hiking Boots™ and a tank top sewn by my late grand mother. I would sit there for hours, completely still, waiting for my prey. I remember it like it was yesterday - I caught the Eel out of the corner of my eye as it sat there, under the ice - taunting me. But was I affected? No. I was as still as ever; waiting for the right moment. The Eel, that I had lovely named ""Eel"", obviously thought I had frozen to death as he started moving towards my perfectly placed ice fishing hole. I watched him get closer and closer, still staying completely unmoving. Eel crept along carefully and as soon as I saw the little trickster's nose - that was it. I lunged forward, using all of my preserved strength - I dove into the water and grappled the eel around it's neck immidietly strangling him.I thought that was the end - but oh, was I wrong. Only hours after the strangling took place, me still holding fast around the eel's neck, to make sure it was completely strangled and also dead - his friends came. A hugh murder of eels (a group of eels is called a 'murder', I know because I am the king of eel fishing and sorts) came out of the dark, dark waters and attacked me. It only took seconds for them to knock me unconscious and bring me back to their lair. They kept me there for six and and half years.When I finally managed to escape their inprisonment, through the help of a fantasticly helpful man, who said his name was 'Captain Bingo', the first thing I did was to log onto my Steam account and look for a new cool game. The first game I saw was ""Barbie & The Revenge of the Clubhouse"" but I had already played it. The next one was this one; ""ICE LAKES"" and I immedietly got massive PTSD of the time when I got caught by a viscious group of eels. (Want to read that story? I have a book coming out soon).I soon recovered though, bought and installed the game and I can honestly say, as I person who obviously knows his way around a fishing pole and/or rod that this game is quite realistic. There is snow, which is usually a sight that you see while you go ice fishing (which is not actually an activity where you fish ice, but you actually fish for regular fish just in an icy environment). There are also several types of fishes and even a type of eel. I'd have liked too see all the different types of eels, because there are definately a few of them - almost five to be more exact, they are; The Siberian Swanktail, The British Eelfish, The French Fisheel-eel, The Pan-American destructive dongus and the wildly disputed West Canadian Winterveil which some delusioned people actually think is a form of undersea Golden Retriever variant.Otherwise, the game is solid. There are quite a few friendly Finnish people on it - they might be a bit shy and reserved, but as soon as you get them on your side, they'll be your friend for life.That's cool."

The ice fisherman who wrote a good review is lying. You know what they say, you can never tryst an ice fisherman. 1/10 would not ice fish again."

I re-purchased the game to give it another shot based on the latest update.  The developers did a great job in moving toward a true VR experience.  From the very moment you select a spot on the ice, you manually drill the hole.  You can move items around and manually scoop out the ice which I was expecting when I first purchased the game.  I didn't catch it my first play through but they also added a fish fight feature which is disabled by default.  In addition to the variations in vibration intensity based on fish size, you now can be prompted to lift the controller at certain points while reeling in the fish which is a nice touch.  I am changing my view to ""recommend"" as this is no longer just a 3D version of a gamepad style game and the efforts making this more immersive experience you could expect from a VR ice fishing game is appreciated.  I made an updated gameplay video of this game to show the new features:https://youtu.be/HEpSVjCNFX0Original Review:I purchased this game for a VR experience not knowing anything else about the game.  As a fishing game I'm sure it's fine but as a VR experience not so much.  Since this was for the HTC Vive, I thought there would be more immersion.  The bottom line is one controller is a mouse with laser pointer and the other is just a way to move the pole with motion and press buttons to control your reel.  Even with the goofy Gear VR game ""Bait!"" you have to hold tension on the line and release a bit if it gets too much tension to successfully reel in the fish.  In this game you tap the tigger once to drop the line, and tap the trigger once it vibrates to reel it in.  There is no immersion or technique what-so-ever.So again, the only reason I'm not recommending this game is for the VR expereince/expectations.  The game by itself for a non-VR expereince is fine for what it is in my opinion.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL0R30TvsGM&t=0s"
