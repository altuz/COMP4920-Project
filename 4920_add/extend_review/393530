I mean a clicker game is pretty obvious. You click constantly to get ""points"" to level up.But there are elements in this game that have NO instructions on how to use... or when they become available... or what they do...  or why they are even there. As a matter of fact there areNO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL!!!!!One tab ""ILLNESSES"" is (so far) permanently greyed out. NOT ONE PERSON in chat can even tell me anything about it.Oh and GOOD LUCK finding ANYONE speaking english in chat anyway... seems to be ALL Russian!!!There is an EQUIPMENT tab where you manage and craft clothes from parts you can get in the game for your character... great... so... HOW DO YOU GET THEM? From where? When???Also there is a PVP element... fantastic... HOW ABOUT SOME INSTRUCTIONS instead of dumping you into a pvp with no idea what to do and getting annihilated because of a TOTAL lack of understanding of the objective!!!""SINS AFTER AMNESIA""... wtf??? I got ONE point in that... it appeared after i got slaughtered in my first pvp attempt. NO extra points after my second pvp attempt tho... so.... wtf is that all about???PLENTY OF PAY-TO-WIN opportunity... as expected in ANY ""free"" game. (even tho there is NO indication wtf the crystals are for or where you use them!!)Overall, a great concept but the developers have obviously ONLY considered the possibility of lining their pockets and havent given a flying F**k about instructions, a guide or even ANY explanation for anything in this game.The only thing this game is good for IS wasting time. Set up a macro and let it do the clicking for you faster than you can. Level up your ""Minions"" when you can, but let the macro do the work. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME OR THE DLC!!!Apart from that...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!!  and DEFINITLY NOT ANY MONEY!!!!"

,Recommended,393530,29407222,Posted: 21 January,all,Styles,"Similar to Hero Clickers; I enjoy this as a casual, time passing, inactive game to play more than I would an active and consistently played game. The graphics, effects, and artwork are all really neat, but it feels a little convoluted in its design for player readiness and easing people into what to do."

I spent months playing, i managed to get 100 sins, from saving over time! and then the upgrade minions is broken, so it took my sins and then lost all my sins and then when i clicked the minus and thats broke as well... I can not reccomend this game, you also get stuck at level 150 and its near impossible to get any further."

,Recommended,393530,29709590,Posted: 4 February,all,SPESHULL EDD,"I play it every once in a while. It is a great creepy game, but it's like every other clicker. If you are bored, and doing homework, you might as well open it and look at it for a break every hour."
76561198245276064,Recommended,393530,29746474,Posted: 6 February,all,Burnin',"As far as clicker games go, Insanity Clicker is really good! It has a good upgrading system, good PvP that's fun and addicting, you can use Amnesia (Which allows you to go back to level one and you get an in-game currency called sins. Sins can be spent to upgrade your guy or can be used to give you a damage boost,) and your in-game character is highly customizable. Another good thing about this game is that you can run this game while running other steam games. this means that you can pretty much play this game at all times! My biggest problem with the game is that when I'm starting it up, it will randomly crash, this can happen once, or it can happen multiple times. I would highly recommend playing this game if you enjoy fun and free addicting clicker games."
