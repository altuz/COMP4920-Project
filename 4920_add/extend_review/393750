For 10$... maybe.It's a story-driven exploration game, and although the progression is meant to be by discovering everything for yourself, some things are heavy handed while others are far too vague. Overall not too bad and a decent little mystery in space. The number one thing that bothered me though, was the ending.You go through the gamefinding out how this ""entity"" slowly drove the crew mad and killed them. The game ends when you finally confront it. However, the ending is quite literally a fractal sequence. For ten minutes. Followed by a starscape. For another few minutes. Followed by ""THE END."" It started as a let down that felt out of place and quickly became an annoying fifteen minutes of my life watching a bad fractal music video unfold. Minus serious points for taking what looks like default unity screen effects and just spamming them along with it. The whole thing felt awful at the end of this game, and by the time it was over I didn't even like the game anymore."

Meaning there are future technologies present but it's a retro future, somewhat reminiscent of the Alien franchise and Space Odyssey.ProsIt has great atmosphere and visuals, I myself played it on a monitor but with a VR headset I believe the experience can be enhanced futher.The world is very interactive, I had lots of fun taking polaroids of bees present on the Colony.There is a decent amount of content in the game that tells a backstory of what happened on the base and Minefield Games did a great job giving personality to the base occupants.ConsIt's very short, very very short. Not worth the 20 Euro's I paid for it. I'm going to be brutally honest here the price does not reflect the amount of playtime you can experience and is somewhat on the same level as Dear Esther.There are many items in the game that you think you can do something with but sadly cant, such as electric welder/solder irons and other assorted tools. Wich is a shame because your character supposedly does have a technical engineering background because the  RAMA corporation assigns you in that field.Final verdictThe game is good albeit short however at it's current pricing you wont get lots of bang for your buck, I finished it in around 2 hours. 2 entertaining hours though."

Basicly, you open doors and move unit to unit in space and space station by finding required material such as keys. You have to solve some simple puzzles using electronic devices. The best and great feature of the game is it has very detailed objects, maybe almost everything in a space station and its worth exploring these with the great environment. Graphics are very nice. Gameplay is not bad. Note that i dont play VR, i play normal.However i cant recommend this game. It has terrible optimization: while i play 60+ fps, it feels like 20 fps. Another problem is some crashes to desktop i experienced. Last one is the price should be at least a bit cheaper.Summary: Assertive and beatiful game with optimization problems and a high price."

Pick it up when it's below $10, and even then, don't expect much.I spent 20 minutes trying to implement both ""solutions"" to destroy the entity, provided by clues left behind. I first tried to overload the reactor, which was Pohl's idea, and then tried to use the anti-gravity beam, which was the doctor's idea. It appears that neither solution can actually be implemented. I also tried to send the train carrying the data on its way (finishing what the crew of Station M started), but this isn't meant to be done either, it seems. Maybe you can do these and I just missed it, but I don't think so. I was so frustrated by these dead-ends in the story that I finally just opened the door to the entity and got it over with.A couple thoughts about the story;What happened to HQ once you arrived at the station? They contact you once after you reestablish communications, and then you never hear from them again. You are still in the main reality/timeline for much of the game, but HQ never says another word. Does the storm knock out comms? If so, they should've said it would happen or demonstrated that it happened.There is also no explanation for why Karen was in the entity at the end. Her last message talked about ""confronting"" the entity. This presumably was recorded YEARS after she disappeared from the station. But in the real timeline/dimension/reality, Karen's clothing is laying on the ground in front of the entity, and there are charred remains like those of the doctor in the lab.  Why does the crew say that Karen ""dissapeared"" or ""jumped over the platform"" when they could clearly see her suit on the platform in front of the entity, with the same charred remains of the doctor in the lab? The doctor died the same way, shortly after Karen. Why do they refer to him as dead but Karen as missing?Another thing I really don't understand; Ion Lem's helmet, the doctor's leg, the cat's collar - basically every object that takes you to the alternate dimension/timeline/reality, takes you to the place in which Karen was stuck. Although the doctor, Ion, and the male Dr. Pohl all seemed to ""die"" the same way that Karen died, and they die AFTER Karen, none seem to exist in the same place as her, and picking up their ""infected"" things don't bring you to where they are. They don't have their own notes or recordings; only Karen does.So again, huge unexplained holes in the story. They should've just made Karen ""disappear"" and make the others die or be killed in other ways, and just use something else to trigger the jump to Karen's area.Lastly, the ""ending"", where you float through some fractal shape for 10 minutes, is utterly boring and disappointing.I would say ""I don't understand this story"", but it's more than that. It was boring, there are a ton of loop holes and dead ends, and it's completely unsatisfying when you finish."

The setting of the game takes place on the largest moon of Saturn, Titan. This is the only moon with a significant atmosphere, hence why in the start of the game you can see bronze windy conditions. The level design for the brief walk you have on titian is very accurate to what Titian MAY look like, so this gives us a good look at how well the level designers of this game can carry their artistic ability into the realm abstract vagary by utilizing scientific evidence and is a HUGE plus in my review.Now, in terms of game mechanics it felt very smooth on a keyboard and mouse. I had the ability to pick up most objects and interact with them with ease. The subtle detail that the prop design team added into this game made it utterly fascinating to just play around and get lost in exploring what items were. I was actually engrossed in messing about with the environment most of the time. This general curiosity is what fuelled me to inspect every object, and find my way through the puzzles.The puzzles of the game were not easy, but they were not hard. They were very balanced and if you have a keen eye and a good attention to detail you will find that this game will be very enjoyable for you. If you are more of a straight to the point, give me the puzzle on the wall type, you may find yourself a little frustrated because the game promotes you to look around and mess about with things.Now as far as the ending of this game? Utterly surreal and I will not spoil this at all for you but I daresay that It will allow a LOT of room for players to make their own theories which is GREAT for any story loving gamer.I did feel as if there was a lack of an actual story, most of it was left very vague, I’m not entirely sure what happened at the base or why I was even there but I didn’t find myself having to rely on a solid, linear story to get me through the game. It allowed me to embrace curiosity, rather than just following what a voice actor tells me to do which is something no game has really done to me as strongly as this game.I will recommend EVERYBODY to play this game, explore, learn, and get curious. You will NOT regret this if you are looking for an eerie atmospheric game to take to you to another world entirely."

This is a slowly paced game where you look around to find clues what has happened in a slightly scary surroundings. This is not an action game by all means, so don't expect to get to shoot anybody. The game is themed to have technology from 90s so it brings a nice retro feeling to everything.I played this with Oculus Rift CV1 but this works just as well without."

The whole atmosphere is set very well and you really feel being there and finding out what happened and trying to find out more.The slow pace suits very well the story and feeling immersed in the game.Without reading the majority of documents/papers or listening to most tapes it took me about 4 hours to finish. I'm often not bothered much by the stories in games so also here I skipped most text/tapes. Still I liked the game very much. The puzzling and finding out how to get in another room I like a lot.I must say that I don't think I would buy or like this game in 2D. It's the VR that makes this work for me.When it was the end I was sad there wasn't more. I look forward to more levels/expansions of this type!About the price, don't forget VR is a whole new way of developing and there for still costs much more than normal game development. Don't compare it with normal games and at this moment the price vs quality is right.Of course there are things that can and should be improved. For high graphics the game is very demanding so that should be optimized more.

However, the compatibility with Vive is to be patched in at a later date, so I played without using VR.The core of the game focuses on exploration, and learning information about what happened in the base and the people who lived there. You learn about the story through various tapes with audio recordings from the characters, as well as other notes and books left around the base. I liked the audio files, and learning about the characters that way, but I found it very strange that for all the object interaction that this game has, I don’t understand why I have to bring the audio tapes to a static location to listen to them on a tape player. I really think I should have just been able to pick up the tape player, and bring it along with me to use, and listen to while I’m still exploring.At first I was really excited about being outside on the surface of Titan with the threat of an approaching storm, but I am slightly disappointed that this opening was the only time I got to experience the outside, and everything else takes place inside the base. Don’t get me wrong, the base and everything inside looks wonderful, but I still wanted to be outside more with the storm approaching.Pros:intriguing story, and you will appreciate it more if you take the time to explore as much as you canyou can interact with almost every objectaudio voices, music, and other sounds throughout the game are done very wellimmersive atmosphere, and the environment looks really good both inside and outside of the basedepending on how much you want to interact with things, and how much you explore, the completion time of the game can varyCons:even though you can interact with so much, most objects serve no purposeyou have to find a tape player to listen to the audio tapes and wait around while they finish playingsometimes long delay when opening doors I hadn’t used yet, and stuttering when I first went into areas for the first time (after I had been to the area at least once, everything seemed to load normally, and without delay)some very noticeable texture issues - when moving towards and away from them, the textures change (it was really weird, and a bit distracting - I feel like it hurt the immersion a bit)very short game for its costConclusion:My biggest complaint about P·O·L·L·E·N is how short of a game it is. It took me less than 3.5 hours and I found almost all the collectibles that were relevant to the story. But still, I feel like the cost of the game is way too much for how short it is. I don’t really feel the need to replay the game, but I might replay it anyway, just to see how it is when it becomes compatible with the HTC Vive. Overall, I still enjoyed the game, but I do regret how much I spent on it.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

There's audiologs, puzzles, mystery, all the usual stuff. One thing this game does very well is object interaction, and setting up logical systems for how it's world works. Sometimes these objects and systems are used for puzzles, but very often they're simply there to make the world feel more real. For instance, I discover that a panel in the control room actually controls the locks on every door in the base. Game progress does not rely on using this panel to open any of the doors, but it was still fun to see that this system existed within the gameworld. There's also plenty of tools you can pick up and use. Totally not necessary in any way, but the fact that when you hit the use button while holding a flashlight it actually flicks on and off is a small thrill. Being able to pick up and interact with non-essential objects is of course something that's been around for a long time, but this stuff feels especially nice in VR.So how's the game beyond just tinkering with random objects? It's ok! The touch-control implementation is a bit janky, but useable. Storywise, it gets off to kind of a hectic and messy start where it's difficult to take it all in, but once it slows down and starts letting you uncover the mystery at your own pace it's good. The ending was pretty great too."

This game is probably a trend-setter for me. Nice attention to detail. Graphics are very good and the storyline meets whats needed. You play a recruted astronaut embarking to base-M on a moon near saturn. What starts as a support-mission quickly transforms in a solo-how do i get out of here scenery. The story is about finding clues and finding out what happend there. An amazing search-game with loads of interacting. Gameplay is amazing and although there is no shooting or any threat at all it kept me somehow intertwined with the plot.

Bear with me for an instant and I promise that this will make sense in the end.The atmosphere is amazing. I really dig the retrofuturistic aesthetic of this game's world. The sound design is stellar and excellent graphics really do their job at immersing you into the game. The story and backstory seems to be solid so far and the environments are exceedingly (in a good way) interactive. Almost verything can be moved, nudged or toyed with.BUT performance-wise the game is a complete mess. I know it is a very demanding game, but I have a pretty decent rig and yet still manage to run this game with major stuttering and unnaturally low FPS. ""You should lower your graphics!"", you might say. Well, the thing is that even if I put every graphical option at the lowest value possible it still stutters like crazy to the point where it's almost unplayable. I'm someone who rarely complains about performance issues in games and am quite lenient in letting these kind of problems get into the way of my enjoyement, but this is simply absurdl.Unfortunately due to those aforementioned issues I feel sad to say that I currently DO NOT reccomend this game. This is not in any way an attempt to bash the hard-working folks of Mindfield games, by the way. The game is amazing but I can't play it.

I just love the retro futurism in POLLEN, just picture 2001: A Space Odyssey and you are pretty much set.The colour tone, physical buttons, the tech that feels really old school, it all builds up on this retro feeling, and I just love it!There are physical buttons and levers that you can push and pull everywhere, granted not all of them has a function, but I still think it's pretty cool.The good retro vibes continue with polaroid camera that print out the picture you take, and collectable audio logs you can find in the form of classic cassette tapes.To play the audio logs you have to find a cassette player, put the tape inside and press play. There's even a lever that let's you fast forward and rewind. It's such a simple thing, but it feels great!Some of them are even cleverly hidden, and it then becomes a sort of treasure hunt to find them, and to me that's fun! I get to search for them, and when I find them, I get a little bit more of the story.This felt different from a lot of other games with audio logs, and I think it's because most of the story in the game comes through these tapes, and I think the tactile feeling of putting them into a cassette player also helps elevate them in this game!You get this type of rich attention to detail throughout the game, granted it's not a big game in terms of square meters. If you know what to do, you can probably ""speedrun"" it in 30 minutes or less, but that's not really the point of the game now is it? I still used a respectable seven hours to complete the game, and another two to 100% the achievements (with a bit of help from the forums to find the last collectable tapes). That said, during those seven hours, I used a lot of time to look for those tapes and just exploring and reading everything I came over. Seems like most people use about 2 hours, so if that's important to you, keep that in mind.I  also like it when there are simple small games within the game world that the player character can play, and POLLEN has a pretty good arcade game. It's the easy to learn, hard to master kind of game. This one's even tied a little bit to the story!There are a few negative points though. The game crashed hard two times on me, and resulted in even stream crashing at the same time. Had to login again to steam with password prompt and everything. I also experienced a few bugs related to lights, and a few with the physics engine (mainly items jumping around when entering a room). There was also a few places where the fps sank like titanic, and wasn't that well optimised, but it really didn't bother me that much overall.I wish there were a few more instances where the game autosaved, for instance when you enter a room, or pick up an item to inventory that goes into the inventory. I had a few instances where I had to redo stuff because of this."

The developers say they were influenced by Tarkovsky's Solaris and Kubrick's 2001: these influences show, in a good way.  The game experience is immersive and feels that it has real depth.In its favour, the game has gorgeous visuals, lots of detail in the world, some nice puzzles, an interesting and touching story, good character acting, and (I know not everyone agrees with me on this) a satisfying ending.Against it, it loads slowly (though the rest of its performance was fine for me), there aren't as many puzzles as you might like, and it certainly isn't long enough. I wanted to stay in this world much longer and have more to do there (I wonder if that was a budget constraint - what about the trains??).I bought the game in a sale, but it's worth the full price."

,Recommended,393750,33171810,Posted: 3 July,all,rogermorse@tablet,"This game was in my wishlist a long time ago, I removed it later because it was getting mostly negative reviews. It went finally on sale and a friend let me play it through family sharing, but seeing that I really liked and I think the developers surely deserve this 3 euros (ridiculous price for a game), I bought it, even though I played it through already.Let me start with: you need to have your own interpretation. I recently played Conarium....I didn't like it. I normally don't like  when things are left unexplained or ridiculously abstract with lots of nonsense in it. To say one, I didn't like Mulholland Drive when I watched it. Probably now I would think differently, who knows.That said, I mean that the game is not easy to understand, but it is possible. All the elements are in the game and the ending has a meaning, though you must put your effort to connect some dots and add your own dots where you feel something is missing.This game deals with the unknown, so you can't expect it to take your hand and explain every detail of the story like with a child. You will be left with some questions that will/can not be answered, but the game has the ability to do this with balance, so that you should not feel ripped off.For this, you really need to pay attention to the environment, read as many notes as possible, listen to as many tapes as possible and be aware of how objects are placed.Are there puzzles? Not really, those few are very easy and you need them to unlock certain areas. Is there a lot of walking? No, there is one single map where you can freely roam and is not very big and easy to navigate. It is very atmospheric and very well made, with a lot of attention to details. Graphically it pushes all the right buttons but it is somehow not very well optimized, I was getting 35fps in 3440x1440 and miraculously it stuck between 80 and 100fps when I lowered to 2560x1080 (there should not be such a huge difference). The sound is amazing, and physics as well (not that you make any use of it but it helps with the immersion while interacting with objects).I really enjoyed the game, probably until now the best 'walking simulator' set in space I've played...you will get vibes from great classics of the past while playing this. There are also some references to old sci-fi big hits.Although I really liked the game, I must say they could have made a great improvement if they used the physics as part of puzzle solving. You can interact with basically anything in the game, and every object works (things as little as electric toothbrushes and solderin irons switch on, flashlights as well, instant cameras shoot photos showing exactly what they were pointing at etc), so it's a pity this kind of detailed interaction was not really used efficiently, it's just put there, it works, but is in a way useless."

While the game itself is short, it is not lacking on content. If you enjoy classic, thought-provoking, science fiction movies and books, you will enjoy this game.I lament not having a VR device to play the game in as I feel that would only increase the joy. I am glad, however, that someday I will be able to replay the game in VR.Pros:- Beautiful setting- Engaging story- Easy and intuitive controls- Fairly good selection of settings customization (a must for PC gamers.)- Framerate was mostly stable 60fps even on max settings on an i7-4790k and GTX 970Cons:- Insufferably long load times for saved games - so long you might think your game has crashed.- Memory leak or other problem that results in the game stuttering after an hour or so.

There was this huge setup about the big mystery with hints of conspiracy done throughout the game (and done very well), only for it to end up in nothing once you actually get to the bottom of things. The game is festooned in instances of Chekhov's Gun, and not a single one of them got fired(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun). Basically, you get a lot of information delivered to you, in a very detailed world with interesting characters, and then it's all pointless because instead of an ending you get a2001 Space Odyssey throwback, complete with trip through the monolith,used as a cop-out to providing an actual ending.That said, there is some pretty imageryof fractals seend from the insidethat is probably very enjoyable in VR."

Gameplay and story failed to catch my attention within an hour.  It's hard to figure out what the game wants me to do when it comes to figuring out how to progress. It often felt more like sifting through 20 usless interactable objects until I'd find one that was useful, and with no way of really knowing which is useful... it feels like lot of trial and error rather than clever puzle solving. Being repeatadly stuck because I don't know what the game wants me to do next, isn't particularly fun, but frustrating. I'd say the game tries too hard to be non trivial, without having a core mechanic, which just results with gameplay being convoluted rather than challenging. VR interface and interactions being badly explained and generally clunky and feeling unreliable only excerbated this problem further. When it takes me 5 minutes to figure out how to open a door, and one time I die trying due to a time limit, it makes me wonder if this game was ever tested in VR by testers who have never played it in flatscreen before. Another thing that bothered me was that antialiasing in VR didn't work well at all. Regardless of which AA method and VR resolution combination I tried, game always had severe aliasing issues."

The price, which is way too high relative to the game's length.2. Not a lot to do, which also ties in with the game's length.3. The ending, which is utter crap.Addresing the first point, I played through 90% of the game in about 5 hours, and that's because I explored almost every nook and cranny. I didn't find all the collectibles, although I got the vast majority of them. The problem is that most of them don't actually give you any insight into the game's story - they're music tapes, or other useless crap.If you were to ignore the tapes, notes, and not hunt for collectibles you could probably blow through the story in less than an hour, which makes me feel like the devs tried to distract the users from the game's lack of actual content.Similarly, while the atmosphere is amazing, and the premise of the story is fantastic, at one point you start to get a little tired of it all. Nothing ever changes; the stakes are never raised. In the beginning the environment feels foreboding, like some threat might lurk in the shadows. Then you realize that literally nothing is going to happen, and all you have to do is find some keys, at which point all the suspence and atmosphere evaporate.The puzzles players are faced with are sometimes kind of cool, but they're not exactly challenging, and leave you wanting more. However, you'll be waiting in vain. For example, at one point you have to manually bypass a locked door. You take an access panel off the wall, splice some cables, etc. You do that exactly ONCE, and never again. It would have been nice if we got to do some more ""hacking"", etc. in order to feel like more than glorified blood-hounds. Our problem solving abilities aren't exactly strained, and there's a lot of similar one-off events which left me feeling like it's all a little too simple.However, I could have brushed everything else off if it wasn't for the utterly unsatisfying ending. After setting up a very interesting situation, the game falls utterly flat on its face in the final 5 minutes. I am honestly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about the crap cinematic I had to sit through, only to end up at the main menu.For those of you interested why that is, spoilers:What the hell happened to the team?

Ich hatte wieder mal zu Grosse erwartungen an ein Spiel das SEHR Viellversprechend aussah. Lieder wurde ich vom Gegenteil überzeugt da es mich irgennt wan nur noch Gelanweilt hat.Diese 20Euro sind es nicht wert.

Within the first 10 minutes, they broke about 5 ""never do that"" rules for VR comfort level movement controls.  I'm not new to VR and usually don't get sick, but this game made me incredibly nauseus.  Controls were unresponsive at times as well.  This is my first review out of hundreds of games owned, I felt that pasionately to speak my mind.EDIT:The updates for POLLEN have greatly improved the user experience.  Locomotion has an ""Onward"" feel to it now and is much better.  Being able to reach out and grab object would be great but the added motion controller support is pretty good with a ""teleport into your hand"" kind of style."

Interior exploration can be a particularly pleasing pastime in VR, and they've laid on the level of detail and the hand-crafted convincers here to make it involving. Uncovering the echoes of the astronaut's past efforts, and getting my hands dirty in the dust of their traumatised base, were genuine pleasures :)Backdrop & Design:Pollen's timeline uses the slightly silly conceit that computers never took off even as interstellar travel did. It doesn't bear too much scrutiny, but I can see why they did it. The paper notes & giant push buttons come with two benefits. One is that you feel like you're in an early 70s sci fi movie where people were still using clipboards (and it's consistently done). The other is that things like paper notes with the watermarks of past scribblings, and things like analogue counter wheels on old tapedecks, are very satisfying to scrutinise and prod. (I can see Minority Report style interactive screens being just as fun and detail-rich, but this is still a cool retro approach).The Journey not the Destination:I'm not sure the game would merit lionisation in normal circumstances, but the attention to detail is the stand out aspect in VR. There are a fair few tropes used (recycling of locations etc), and the story goes in for some eccentric swirls by the end, but I really enjoyed just flipping everything over and tracing the actions of the missing astronauts. Take your time and you keep seeing dev efforts put into making little aspects function and little incidental moments convince. For that I can forgive the odd crash, spaced out save points, and the horrendous initial load times ;)If you speed run things, you could brute force the base puzzles here in under 2 hours. If you fancy layering up the stories and relationships in evidence across these locations (and if you don't mind a lot of the surrounding engineering and info ending up as errata, or esoteric twists meaning not every thread is neatly tied off) then there's plenty to enjoy here :)"
,Not Recommended,393750,35503883,Posted: 5 October,all,KngRichard,The vr version is really not that great. A lot of framedrops while all other games run fine for me on top of bad interactions with objects / puzzles. Can't recommend.
