As for the nudity that everyone was expecting... Well I found none.Granted i didnt go through all the girls, but I finished about 20% of the game without anything that was over PG 13 tops.The most I got was a swimsuit... so pretty much any slice of life anime cliche out there.Final thoughts:Is it a good game? Not for that price. God not for that price.Is it using that nudity tag to bait buys? Hell yes.[Update]After reading the replies to this, I've got to say that:1. I am aware that full hentai is not allowed on steam, but there are some games out there with partial nudity. That is what I was refering to with the ""nudity"" tag. And yes, I see that it was removed now. Some people like ecchi in their games, and that tag is misleading.2. Although the tags on the games are placed by the comunity, they are still misleading at times and can get people into wasting money. I guess I should have rephrased how I talked about the tag. I'll keep that in mind next time I review a game.3. A few people are laughing, trolling IDK about spending a significant amount of money on this game. There is a return policy on steam. I used it and got my money back. However, steam reviews exist in order for people to know more about the game before buying and saving them the time it takes to explore the game themselves and (if they end up disliking the game) the time it takes for the return to go through."

The boards are layed out very good and are pseudo-randomized on each start, but never in such a way that they are unsolveable.The game loses points because of how the boards are stacked combined with the top-down view: sometimes tiles that are adjacent and appear to be on the same level are actually on different levels and therefore both selectable. If there are no other tiles next to it this can be very easy to overlook.The gimmick of the game is that you have an anime chick next to the boards who is moaning and saying Japanese things as you progress. After clearing three boards you get to a clothing change level where her moans become sexier and a slider goes down her body which reveals a skimpier outfit. There is no nudity.If you mess up the girls yell some kind of insult that sounds like 'F Off!' but I'm probably mishearing that...At it's current price with a huge discount, I can recommend it for the solitaire as it's done very well and the gimmick is amusing. Don't pay full price for it though."

Or the most shameless?Anyway, this Mahjong Solitaire is a short - and rather un-optimised in terms of gameplay - version of Mahjong, with typical Japanese pop-culture stuff such as gals with big eyes and enormously big breasts... As a way to somehow reward player for his effort to beat that quite generic solitaire game.In truth, I haven't felt all enjoyed, as I'm quite tired of those specific J-features, when they are not followed by something really inspiring. Gals in the swimsuits? C'mon, it is summertime, I can get to the beach and see much more explicit goodliness - and even touch some... So, as a game of ""guilty pleasure"" - the one you wouldn't play in front of your Ma/wife/kids - ""Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire"" fails miserable. As I was really ashamed only with constant ""ouh"" from the girl picture on left part of the screen, when I'm moving tiles... maybe she thinks I'm tickling her? I muted those looped sounds quite fast, playing with my own music to ""smooth the corners""...As of mahjong - it is not fun as well, being heavily luck-based... your skill and your quick eye usually will be of no use there... And no, you can't choose/change the tables, there are just the ""story"" mode - without any story, where you play only those tables as developers supposed you to... I have about dozen of much better free-play Mahjong games in mind, and to pay the full price for this - I'd considered a rip-off!Do I Recommend the game? Not really, even with the thumbs up. Buy it only on the lowest price possible, or in some bundle, farm and sell the cards...

,Recommended,393980,20880926,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"There is no story here. But it's a simple game of Mahjong Solitaire. I love this type of game, since I played a version of it on Game Boy. So, yeah, every type of it is interesting me. Even if it means girls in different clothes and states of undress. Anyway, let's focus.I was afraid that because of the fan service theme, the game will be easy. But I found it pretty hard by moments. Some levels required more than 10 tries before finally getting around. Each restart is a different challenge, as it's not the same dispostion of the tiles. I really appreciate it.Each stage has three rounds: two normal rounds and the final one, where the girl's clothes are being revealed by removing the tiles. Some of the clothes are ""normal"" if you're expecting exciting disguises. Sometimes, it's bikinis. And sometimes, it's... well, aimed for fantasms. While I don't mind the erotica, I don't like when bodies are exaggerated. You're under the impression that the more you advance, the bigger the breasts are. And that's not my stuff. If I have to look to erotic representations, I prefer something close to reality - when I have OTP, I'm not attracted to some of the erotica because of the exaggeration. Thanks god, the last character was normal - it was my favorite one, along with the first.The game is very colorful as it's in an anime-style. As for the soundtrack, it was enjoyable, though the girls speaking Japanese or making weird noises annoyed me as I couldn't understand them or that I don't need to know that they're clearly embarrassed to reveal themselves in the finale round. I should really acquire the reflex to check audio options in that kind of case.The game is also having a dressing room, where unlocked clothes can be viewed with the girls. It's just a nice feature for those that love looking at them, otherwise, it's not really adding any interactivity.Anyway, the game is a good moment if you enjoy mahjong solitaire. However, at full price, it's a waste, so, wait for a discount. Oh and if you're here because you love hentai, you should pass the game, there is no full nudity or any sexual scenes, even if the representation is clearly aimed to excite the players in a sensual and sexual sense.And if you're asking yourself if a girl can enjoy it, yeah. You can enjoy it. You don't need to be a boy to appreciate some of the erotica presented here if you're focused on this side of the game. If you're here for the mahjong, anybody can enjoy, whether you're a girl or a boy. Myself, I've focused on the mahjong, not on the girls, even if I did pay attention as you can't totally ignore that part of the screen.Anyway, like I've said, if you want this game, buy it when there is a good sale."

For starters, it's very relaxing, especially if you put the game on ""easy"" so that you're not running on a time limit.  I really liked the girls, too.  They weren't overly sexualized and the costumes were tasteful rather than just pure fanservice.  I didn't keep the voice audio on however, simply because I didn't like hearing the occassional moans from the girls.  It kind of saddened me because I did really like the voice acting for the girls and hearing them when they made the odd comment here and there.  I know the moaning is supposed to be part of the appeal or whatever, but it just put me off and distracted me.  I did like the background music, though!So yeah, all in all I really like this game and I recommend it~♥"

,Recommended,393980,23173552,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,silversuriv,"ReviewPretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is an innovative way to bring character to playing the traditionally classic game of Mahjong Solitaire (Match 2 unrestricted tiles). Similar to HuniePop's strategy of playing Match 3 games in order to progress a ""date"", PGMS utilizes Mahjong to progress a characters story. There are 5 characters with approximately 3 Stages each, containing 4 Rounds in each Stage, that must be completed in order to unlock all outfits for each character. The 4th round in each Stage will progressively undress the character, revealing a new outfit underneath. Every tile clear will make the character elicit some sort of response/noise.The actual Mahjong gameplay is fairly similar to other games of its kind on Steam. Progressing to a point where no more moves are available will end the round prematurely - there is no shuffle feature. Running out of time will also end the round prematurely; however continuously matching tiles will add more time. You may save the round to return later, and pausing the game will hide the faces of the tiles.There is only a moderate amount of difficulty faced to clear a round. Veterans of Mahjong will have no problems at all breezing through most of the rounds. The difficulty does increase a little bit further into the later rounds of each character. The game options are pretty basic: fullscreen and music/sfx sliders. There is also a gallery that is essentially a dress room containing all of the viewable outfits unlocked for each character.VerdictSome of the other Mahjong games can get a little boring to play after a while due to the monotony. PGMS at least brings a little bit of color into the gameplay.Before You Buy– analyses of newly released indie games"

It's the more, in the west, common match-the-tiles-game, and start off fairly easy, but once the difficulty starts rising, by god is it rising. Beyond the obvious failstate that is ""no more tiles to match"", you also have a timer ticking down. In addition to this, when the tiles get randomly placed there's a major risk that you'll get a setup that you cannot win, no matter skill, and in my playthrough half my losses was due to this. That said, the game evoke the same feeling where every loss makes you more determined that many find in games like Dark Souls after enough losses. In fact, I for one forgot the whole ""Pretty Girls"" part of the game until victory was mine. Be warned though, you who are here primarily for the anime images, there's no gallery for the various outifts after you beat the required stages, which is a bit of a let down.So all in all, it's flawed, but I recomend it.

,Recommended,393980,24319002,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,genkipro,"OVERVIEWPretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is an anime-themed solitaire mahjong game from the same developer as the other Pretty Girls games.Mahjong solitaire is the single-player, tile-matching mahjong game most familiar to western computer mahjong players. The Pretty Girls variant spices it up with timed rounds and the opportunity to see a number of anime girls in 'sexy' costumes as a reward for winning rounds.GraphicsThe interface is clean and tidy and the tiles are easily distinguishable. Background graphics are nice, but not overly interesting. There's a weird little 'thing' driving round with a lance that's a bit weird, but it maybe an inside joke that I don't get.Most people playing the game are likely to be most interested in the girls themselves, however, who are nothing special. The anime art is attractive enough, but it's certainly not 'Pretty Girls gone wild' as stated on the Steam store page for the game, and most of the costumes are very tame and not overly sexy.SoundMusic is rather loud and grating, but somehow fits the game. Sound effects are also loud and mostly the sorts of electronic bells and bleeps one might hear walking past a pachinko parlour. There are also various exclamations in spoken Japanese from your chosen girl, but these just seem to increase the sense of depravity from playing the game.All in all the sound is well produced and appropriate enough, but I found it annoying enough to simply mute my PC most of the time I played.GameplayPretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire plays like any other solitaire mahjong. Each stage begins with stacks of random mahjong tiles laid out to form a pattern, and the player has to remove the tiles a pair at a time until there are none left, at which point the round is won. If there are tiles left and no remaining visible pairs, then the round is lost.You start with access to one girl and one stage. As you complete stages (three rounds, or 'hands' of mahjong), you unlock access to further girls and their stages, and each completed three-round stage also reveals a new costume for your current girl. It's essentially solitaire mahjong strip poker, but very tame and without any nudity.Unfortunately, though, some of the rounds are unwinnable and as you progress through each girl's stages the tile layouts make it increasingly likely that you'll see such a round. This makes the game more about luck than strategy and can be rather frustrating, especially if you're an achievement hunter wanting to get to 100%.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Easier to get into than the other Pretty Girls games+ Steam achievements that are simple, but time consuming+ Trading cards with reasonable valueCons:- RNG used for tile layout produces unwinnable rounds often- Limited costumes and interaction with the 'Pretty Girls' of the title seems likely to disappoint the target audience- Timer can be tough, although that's probably intentionalCONCLUSIONPretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is a relatively fun solitaire mahjong game, but is rather disappointing as an anime-girl game. Pick it up on special if you're after the trading cards or achievements, or if you want to play a few rounds of solitaire mahjong, but don't bother if you're only interested in it for the pretty girls.5/10"

You are timed but you can bypass the timer by using print screen, pause then tab out and paste into an image editor. If you come to a point where there is no possible solution you will not be able to reshuffle the board, instead you lose immediately. In some cases you'll fail after the first few moves. There is no Zen mode, no undo button, no retry with the same placement option. There is also no hints for specific board layouts. As far as Mahjong goes, and anime teasing goes this game fails in both.

The idea was pretty straightforward.  I'm not the biggest fan of anime, but I'm always up for a good game of mahjong, so I decided to buy it.  Was it worth it?The short answer is yes.  For the price I bought it ($1.50), I got my money's worth and then some.  I found a fun mahjong game that was short but challenging.  The anime girls were just a bonus, but they were worth seeing after each round.  Sure, some of the sounds the girls made were a bit strange, but at least the music was pretty catchy.A message to potential buyers: if you want this game, get it when it's on sale.

,Recommended,393980,17711577,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,sonikku2008,"Edit 5 Sept. 2015: Recent updates have touched on some of the bad things I have had to say about the game. New opinions reflected accordingly.First off, if you're looking for nudity, look elsewhere. The devs even said in the product description this game has none, the nudity tag is a bunch of idiots assuming the girls will eventually strip fully naked for you. (They're USER DEFINED tags, after all.)Second, I'm rating this game based on the game, not the women, because I feel like the game deserves a fair rating based on its merits and faults.The game is basically Mahjong Solitaire, the probably more well known version of Mahjong as far as the United States goes. This type of thing has probably been remade a bunch of times in many different forms for Facebook and Flash. So what makes this one different? Not much, unfortunately, aside from every third round being a level where the girl to the left of the game field changes into a different outfit.It still does Mahjong Solitaire properly. The rules aren't any different, so if you've played it before, you already know how. All of the stages are different, though none of them use the full tile set (only one season in play at any point). Originally, the game did not have a resume function, thereby forcing you to do all three rounds in one sitting. An update fixed this issue, as well as allowing you to see the girls in their outfits you worked to earn, so the game gets points for the devs paying attention to what we're saying. This makes some of the other issues less of an issue.Pros:- It's the Mahjong Solitaire you probably know well.- Some of the outfits do pass off as sexy.- Ability to suspend play in the middle of a stage.Cons:- Time limit prevents you from thinking about moves too long.- Limited music variety; everything gets repetitive before finishing the first girl.- Uneven difficulty toward the end.- Some of the outfits feel reused with minor aesthetic changes.Overall: 6/10. With the addition of the suspend mechanic, I can deal with not having an undo or reshuffle mechanic, as if I get frustrated and want to do something else, I don't have to redo everything I just did. It gets just enough of a score to allow me to recommend this game."

Obviously the gameplay is still the same since it's based on a real, old chinese game but it's always a fun game.There are not a lot Mahjong Solitaire games, especially on Steam so I bought it as soon as it was on sale. I would advise to do the same if the game interest you. It's a solid game but it's still simple with a few drawbacks, enough to give you a few hours of play.As far as I could notice all the stages are in different patterns. The tiles are also randomised so each game should always be different. There is also a good progression of patterns, at the beginning it's hard to lose and at the end it takes multiple tries to win.The music is entertaining and there are a few different tracks while background are diverse and the girls have multiple costumes. But it feels weird in a Solitaire/Patience game, it should be to relax but there is a time limit, the music is upbeat and the girls keep making noises while trying to get your attention.+Multiple Patterns+Good Art+Easy to Difficult-Not really relaxing because of a time limit and upbeat music.-Later stage are a bit too difficult and it can get annoying.-Only one game mode, can't play without time limit for example."

It's a Mahjong solitaire game, and apparently some people have no idea what that means. Sometimes, you're going to farckerberg your tiles to where you end with an unsolvable puzzle. Sometimes random generation can do this to you, same as any solitaire game (or so I understand it, because when I couldn't finish a puzzle in this game it's been wholly my fault for not playing different combinations, etc). The nudity title is wholly misleading, because there is no nudity, and having cleared all five stages I can tell you the most revealing outfit is a bikini. This is NOT a game to play if you're looking for nudity; it IS a fun Mahjong solitaire game though. Is anyone else old enough to remember Taipei? It's Taipei with anime girls. After clearing the five stages though it definitely loses appeal; I think a random puzzle shape generator would have increased the replay value for me. All in all, a fun game at a cheap price.TL;DR: For playing, not for fapping. Occasionally requires mental effort on your part."

It's a very challenging and solid Mahjong title. Be prepared to be frustrated in a good way. The girls are a fun addition as each set of costumes is based around their given personality, as are the backgrounds for the boards.The only downsides I have found to the ladies thus far are just typical anime problems: one lass I wanted to belt in the face due to her irritating voice (thankfully, you can just turn off the sound effects) and some questionable porportions that gives one the ladies massive man hands (probably to hold her♥♥♥♥♥♥better?

Antrider,"I have mixed feelings on this game because of some design issues, but it is a nice pick-up at a discounted price.The Mahjong aspect of this game is solid.  It is very challenging... to the point where you may rage quit once or twice during the game.  That being said, why would anyone rage quit during a game of Mahjong, which typically should be a very calming/meditative experience?That brings in the number one complaint you are likely to hear in review of this game:  The timer. In a game of Mahjong, one would do well to make some informed decisions about which matches to ""Pick"", as choices you make in the game can ultimately become a factor in whether you win or lose.  Mahjong has a strong element of chance in it, but there is quite a bit of well-intentioned thought that it also requires... the timer albeit negates all of your efforts to make such informed decisions.  Ultimately, I think this game would have been adequately challenging from the tile lay-outs themselves and would love if the creators did away with the timer, but it's not necessarily a complete deal-breaker.Another complaint I would add is perhaps an important one considering that this is a game whose main asset (at least from an advertising perspective) is its ASSETS.  And by assets I totally mean♥♥♥♥♥♥  As with a lot of anime-themed games, the paper-doll work is a little boring.  Well, very boring.  Instead of having different poses for the different character dolls, there is only one pose per girl that gets re-used, the artists just drawing different outfits on the doll (sometimes even borrowing the same lines from other outfits that don't always make sense).  A more important artistic criticism is that two of the dolls have chests that are very clearly misproportioned from an artist's perspective.  Not disproportioned in the sense that real women wouldn't have such large breasts... disproportioned in the sense that the right boob is bigger and at an awkward angle compared to the left.  I think it's unfortunate that anime artists responsible for only 5 characters cannot work in any dynamic aspect to their character art and are rather using these copy & paste method of art that we're seeing in most of these games...  The outfits aren't even that great for most of the girls.  They often seem more fully dressed after stripping, which is disappointing after the already crippling disappointment of there not being actual nudity in this game.Did I play through this entire game?  Yes.  Did I enjoy playing it?  Mostly :-).  Do I recommend it?  Yes... with the above stipulations added.  When you factor in the fact that there is no nudity--YES, I am disappointed as ♥♥♥♥."

But it is what it is.  The girls are really just there and they shout random Japanese things at you.  No real use for them at all, outside of collecting outfits to say I beat this level.  But, that's what achievements are for, right?That said, this game goes on sale for 80-90% off quite often and 3$ vs the price of Huniepop is adequate.  You get what you pay for so to speak.If you like solitaire style mahjong to relax, and don't mind being called a ""hentai"" every time you succeed at round 3 of a stage this is pretty good.  As the puzzles actually provide some difficulty and failing puzzles due to poor choices or random chance can happen (which is common in complex layouts in mahjong).Very good solo game to stress relief.  No innuendo implied, but the music is genuinely upbeat, repetitive, but the focus for my brain at least goes to racing the clock (which isnt really a big deal in honesty) and finding the best move possible.It's not overly perverse at all, outside of some J-Cup style girls, most of the outfits are cute and at most role play for the imagination.I would NOT buy this game at full price, and the fact it costs more than huniepop and offers LESS (in adult content, storyline, unique puzzles, more girls, easter eggs, unlockable characters) is quite honestly a big mistake.  Worth it completely on sale, the cards are cute, and if you like crafting badges, consider it.Overall verdict: Generic boobs to sell mahjong solitaire game.  But the puzzles and layouts are actually difficult. A solid 6 of 10.   If you like the girls add a point, if you expect more content remove a point.  But 6 for me is quite high praise for anime girls used to sell a game.  It could have been made into so much more.PS: I would love a dating sim mixed with more girls, a bit of plot, and ""plot"", and mahjong puzzles it would have drastically added some sort of use and meaning for the girls in the game besides a ""sex sells"" point.  Would have easily made paying more for this game worth it, and would up the recommendation at least 2-3 points."
,Recommended,393980,20480843,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,JapanGamer29,"Mahjong Solitaire is a classic, and this version is faithful to the original, tile-matching game.What makes the Pretty Girls version better than the free games on your phone is the incentive to unlock all the costumes for each girl. There are five girls with 4 or 5 costumes each - note that we're not stripping the girls, just changing their clothes. There's no nudity here, and no patch to unlock it (unlike Hunie Pop) because it doesn't exist.The gameplay is fun, but expect to have to replay the puzzles dozens of times in the later stages to solve them. It took me 90 minutes just to unlock Ayame's second costume. It's addictive, though, I couldn't put the game down until I did it!When you've unlocked every costume, which took me 7.5hrs, there's little reason to play anymore. And for that reason, I can't recommend the game unless it's on sale - I got it for 90% off in the Steam winter sale.Speaking of price, it boils my balls to see Zoo Corporation mark up the price for customers in Japan, and I was THIS close to giving the game a negative review because of it.TL;DRAddictive, tile-matching game with pretty girls to motivate you. Not enough content to warrant full price. Buy on sale only."

In the third round you're playingto unlock the outfit for that stage.Beyond that, there's not much else. Ifyou're looking for something to do torelax with a pretty girl to look at, get this.Unless DLC is in this game's future, theprice is not justified.

The timer is an interesting and arcadey component to beating the puzzles, but I find it largely unnecessary by the end. I don't feel like the amount of time you have to solve puzzles scales to the increased size of mahjong boards. I only once found myself losing to the timer, but in a game where you have to strategically make your matches, the timer doesn't allow for much thought and deliberation on which tiles to match.There was one game where I made exactly 1 move at the start and the board had to reset because I had no more moves to make. It happens in solitaire games (very easy to see in Pyramid among others), but it didn't help any more with the annoyance I had started to have with the game.Of the girls, 1st girl Rin was best girl, but the rest were meh. Ayame's character didn't seem to have the polish the other girls had, like her art was done at a different resolution from the rest but scaled up.I got to 5-2 second round before I decided that I'd had enough and deleted the game.Edit: removed an unnecessary ""with"" from a sentence."

,Recommended,393980,24118685,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,Animus Furandi,"Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is a fun, addictive, and challenging Mahjong solitaire game featuring big ol' anime tiddies. Don't be fooled, though, this game isn't as shallow as it looks. There are 5 girls and 17 outfits to unlock over the course of 51 puzzles. That's a decent amount of content, and the puzzles start getting tough in short order. On top of that, the tile placement is randomized, so there's considerable replay value for those who might find themselves inclined to play more than is necessary to undress all of the girls. The level of difficulty I encountered here took me quite by surprise, and I ended up slipping into that rare, blissful state where you swear you'll give it just one more try and end up looking up at the clock 30 minutes later. That said, It took me almost 10 hours to 100% complete this game, and as much fun as I had for $1.99 when it was on sale, I can't imagine what was going on in this publisher's head when they priced it at $15. Pick this one up on sale and you'll have fun."

76561198027853169,Recommended,393980,33773443,Posted: 24 July,all,Commander Douche,"This is one of those games that is completely luck based that even if you were skilled, the game will go out of its way to screw you over to make you do the stage again. Some of these cases may have you repeating the same stage either 2-10+ times the further to get. One case I actually lost because the last matching pieces were stacked.What doesnt help with this is that you cannot take the time to think strategically, the game presses you so hard with its time limit that you may even lose for this reason. On top of it all, if you get blindsided the 3D perspective may confuse you. i.e. you may not see what may even be right in front of you, combine this with some of the small japanese text pieces looking almost similar. Granted this is supposed to show you what's underneath, but the main point is the perspective is what may cause the confusion (EX: a stacked piece may cover a lower tier or bottom piece)So do I recommend this? Honestly it depends, i'll let this slide for the fact this was I believe only about twenty cents when I initially got it on sale. I'm just giving you fair warning if you go for this, also dont expect anything spectacular if you're in it for the lewd stuff.Note: Easy Mode does remove the time limit and gives you a couple options to help you out, but you can only use them a few times and you may still lose anyway. Regardless the review is mainly on if you're aiming to do this throughout Normal."
