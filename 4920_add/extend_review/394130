,Recommended,394130,22274284,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Forgiveness,"Water Bears VR is a polished and easy to get into VR game. The VR environment is wonderfully bright and colorful, don't let the cartoony-style fool you, this game is immersive. The puzzles are fun and there are enough things to warrant the $9.99 USD.The game most closely resemblesCaptain Toad: Treasure Trackerin terms of the action being centered around a winding blocky mountain you have to traverse around. With the added VR it makes Water Bears VR entertaining and not invasive, a really good place to start with VR.The puzzle difficulty is quite basic at first and then starts to ramp up with different pipe types and needing to mix colors together for certain Water Bears.The biggest downfall of the game is its 3m x 3m room requirement. I didn't have enough room (about 2.6m x 2.8) and it still worked just fine so I'm not sure what the need for all that space is (you don't even use most of the edge space).ProsGreat aesthetics to experience in VRFun puzzles akin to Captain Toad: Treasure TrackerCute interactions with the Water Bears gives added VR depth.Great price point of $9.99 USDPerfect for demoing VR in a non-invasive and interactive way.Cons3m x 3m room size requirement (I wable able to play with less)Lack of passive interaction with the enviroment.All in all I'd say this is a must-have VR experience."

The puzzles are interesting, the environment is quite pretty and the water bears are really cute.The game worked perfectly fine in my 2.2x2.2m play area. I beat it in about 1.5h, would definitely buy a DLC with some harder levels."
,Recommended,394130,22481998,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,King,"This is a cute puzzle game that's intuitive to play. There are only 4 stages, with a bunch of levels that get progressively harder (but none of them were very difficult) and a few challenge levels for each stage, which I was able to complete in slightly under an hour.I was able to play it in a 2.5m x 1.5m space, although it probably would work in a 2m x 1.5m space as well. 1.5m was very slightly too narrow for some levels, so I'd recommend a minimum of 2m x 2m.If you're looking for a fun game to demo to others, Water Bears VR is a good pick."

The water bears are exceedingly cute and will come out to play with you after completing each puzzle.The VR controls are intuitive.  The game is playable in a smaller than recommended play area, but in that case some puzzles may not be viewable from all sides."

It's not particularly difficult (so far) and seems fairly short, but it's a good use of the technology, allowing you to wander around the puzzle and view it from different sides and angles to figure out how to solve. A good choice for some easy, casual fun."
,Recommended,394130,24966799,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Haeriphos,"So I bought this game for my daughter who is about to start second grade. She likes the Vive and I figured that I would get something that would make her use her brain. Obviously I had to test it out to make sure it was age appropriate and so that I could explain to her how to play in case she has problems. So just one puzzle, maybe two.Yeah, an hour later of playing and I'm already making plans to finish out all the levels while she's at school so I don't lose my progress when I reset it for her.For $10 this is a great little casual puzzler. Probably only 1.5 hours of play but it's a well-done product and is appropriate for younger children.UPDATE: One problerm with this children-themed game is that the virtual table that you play on is actually too high for most younger children to play on. Even my seven year old, who is tall for her age, has to stretch to reach some of the upper levels of the puzzles. This also puts her at a severe disadvantage because she doesn't have a very good vantage point to look at the puzzle from. There are some later levels where looking down on the puzzle is almost a necessity to get a good picture of how to solve it. Hopefully the developers will add a calibration or ""short person"" option in a future update to address this."

In the extra-challenges that is; the basic chapters are a bit of a cake walk.

They definitely ARE not. If you are curious enough to want to check them in google, don't. They are nasty little monsters, the matter nightmares are made from.Other than that I really love this game. It's fun and challenging for adults, despite the kiddo ambiance, and it has quickly become one of my favourite games on the vive (roomscale for the win!). I hope more games like this reach Steam, even if they aren't as bling-bling or AAA, or whatever gives a game the right to be popular now. I recomend it to any VR headset owner that wants to understand what VR can bring to the ""table"" as a new medium."

It seems rather simple at first, but can get a litlte complex.  Still not a ton of levels - but fair at this 9.95 price. Controls work SO well and the world and graphics are so smooth.  (Some games seeem to try to push teh sharpness over the top and instead look like anti-anlaising problems).  One of the best looking games I've tried so far.

The navigation to pick the puzzle to play is nice, the mechanic of getting into a teleporter to go to the next level is clever. I think this game is worth the money.

The puzzles are pretty easy and straightforward.  I think I only struggled with a couple puzzles but even those I probably beat in about 10 minutes.  I appreciate games that force you to use your brain to solve a problem and this definitely fits that category.  The one main gripe I have for the game is that it makes you stand in a particular spot in your playspace to transition to the next level and that spot is not always the same.  My play area is kind of cluttered so I ended up having to squeeze up against a cat tower in the room just to get to the next level or push some chairs and things out of the way so that I could continue the game."

The water bears themself are also well animated, cute little things that you naturally want to help out. When they fly around in freedom after a puzzle, joyfully float around you with and shower in the habitats you helped make for them... It's pretty satisfying to solve a puzzle for this reason.In terms of the puzzles, it's really solid. Super simple concepts that build up very gradually. As thing progress you'll need to plan carefully and actually manage your building materials properly. Alot of the later levels have just enough to make a proper habitat for the water bears. It gets challenging enough towards the end of the main game and theres actually a whole bunch of challenge levels after that. I'm sure they will really test me.As a VR experience, it's very pleasant and intuitive. You will be moving around the habitat, instinctively, crouchign and wanderign around to locate the water bears and take note of thier needs. Then you of course work out how to improve the habitat to complete the puzzle.For the price, you really can't go wrong here. I'd recommend it to young, to old and everyone in between, even those people who aren't usually puzzle fans. I feel like this game could make anyone into a puzzle fan. Highly recommended."
