76561197970692620,Recommended,394140,17727557,"Posted: 26 August, 2015",all,Mr_Stereomd,"Sound Shift is a game based on the generation of a play environment by the interpretation of music. It doesn't have an in-built music player, I played it by putting on some music using Itunes in the background, then starting up the game. I also tried this successfully with Spotify, so it will probably work with your preferred streaming service too. If you start the game up without some kind of ""audio output"", the game will give you a message which instructs you to ""play some music"".Sound Shift has two modes; Arcade and visualiser. Arcade is a simple game where you shoot at moving white blocks with your ship at the bottom of the screen. Firing is automatic and hitting blocks generates credits of various values. Your ship also powers up over time and when full, it fires a larger bullet, emptying out your reserves. All the time, your music generates visuals on screen.The second mode is a traditional music visualiser, generating patterns on screen to the beat of the music you play. You can change how it looks using the Function keys on your keyboard.The credits you earn in the shooting game can be spent in the mods section to unlock changes to how the visualiser works.When you start up the game, it gives the impression that it can only be played using a gamepad but it does have keyboard support (WASD or Cursor keys, plus F1-F6).Sound Shift is something to do whilst listening to your music but game-wise, Audiosurf or Beat Hazard are currently much more diverse and engrossing examples of this kind of game. I enjoyed listening to some good music while playing around with this. Has potential and is currently cheap."

I don't dislike it by any means, but if you're looking for a new and interesting game to play, I honestly wouldn't recommend it. This is the only game Matthew Brown has ever put out that I had to think about recommending.The game is like a mixture of two other popular rhythm games,AudiosurfandBeat Hazard. Alone they are both great games to play as they take advantage and create unique experiences based entirely on the strucutre of the music you chose.Sound Shiftuses this concept itself and feels like a mixture of both of the forementioned games, but is less interesting in terms of it's execution.There are two gameplay modes: Arcade, which is a simple shooter, and Dodge, similar to the dodge mode inAudiosurf. Both modes can be fun in short bursts, but the feeling is more or less the same regardless of the music you chose to play along to, I guess my biggest gripe would be the lack of variation when it comes to the actual gameplay, it gets repetetive very quickly so there isn't much to go back to.One positive factor though is that the visualisations and modifiers are excellent, it's really the most unique and interesting thing aboutSound Shiftand would be great to have set-up for house parties and such. I'd see this as more of aninteractive visualizerthan I would an actualgame.For it's price, I'd say it's interesting enough to pick up and give it a try, but I just don't think there is enough gameplay here to recommend it to rhythm gamers."
76561198006541362,Not Recommended,394140,19480856,"Posted: 4 December, 2015",all,stranger1982,"Sounds Shift takes any song played by your system and uses it to estabilish the rhythm and speed of the whole game: you'll get two game modes where you either shoot at targets ( both static and moving) or have to dodge them while moving close enough to gather points.While sporting decent visuals and being fun in quick burts its gameplay is sadly too shallow to have any kind of staying power making Sound Shift a pretty bland and forgettable experience.PROS:-once you unlock a few visual mods (and the ability to mix them) the game will look quite pretty-being able to choose any song played on your system, regardless of source, gives you lots of freedom-gathering the points to unlock all visual and effect mods will take a few hoursCONS:-very simple gameplay with little variation and basically no way to fail, it can get dull fast-no leaderboards, no high scores or any kind of purpose to gameplay except gathering points-doesn't work too well with low tempo songs as your fire rate is also tied to the music-the lack of mouse support was a big surprise for me, keyboard or controller work decent enough but lack the smoothness a mouse would have and this is something that the ""dodge"" mode sorely needshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=568301008Sound Shift isn't an horrible game at all, it's pretty decent actually and the first few songs'll be fun as you slowly gain points and unlock new visuals: but after an hour you'll realize there's basically no variance in what you're playing as there's just one flat path and only a few types of blocks coming your way.The game is also infinite as it goes on and on until you quit, the fact it streams whatever your system is playing rather than single tracks means you can forget about online leaderboards or even just local high scores: after a bit I felt as if it simply lacked purpose and even more so once you've unlocked everything thus making gathered points useless.Ultimately I can't recommend Sound Shift due to how bland the gameplay feels, there's simply much better rhythm based games out there: still it might be a decent purchase (especially at its 1$ sale price) for players looking for a simple game to play during a break or people wanting a very easy game to try and get into the genre."

I love how it can pick up anything you're playing, But at the same time if you dont have something with a huge amount of bass it doesnt seem to work very well. But it's free and worth a try. Achievement is easy enough, just boring to get."

,Recommended,394140,30155941,Posted: 24 February,all,The Featureless Face,"A decent way to mix up some messed up visuals. Variations to the arcade style shooter and dodge tables would be wonderful additions, but in the current state they are far too repetitive.I experimented with different genres but after only two hours the only thing pushing me was my own music and a single achievement."
,Recommended,394140,17753493,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,S P O O C B O I,"This game is simple. Targets pop up, your little square automatically shoots them as you move around. The thing that got me to buy this, though, was the fact that you could use your own music. Sure, a good soundtrack is nice, but there won't be many occasions where you can jam to Dragonforce and shoot things at the same time. The backgrounds all look beautiful and match up with the music perfectly, dimming when the music gets quieter and slowing down. Essentially, this game is a pretty rhythm-based light show with a little arcade diversion thrown in. Definitely worth $2.99."

Despite being pretty to look at, it's not that intencive.  This is Unity at it's most streamlined, I think.Uses external audio, so you can literally use anything.  Go for it.  Literally any website, format of audio/video, or anything like that is usable.The Bad:Movement controls. What made Audiosurf so playable was the quick, mouse-based controls.  It made moving left to right easy, sharp, and accurate.  This is simply clunky in comparison.  Even with a gamepad, the analogs just don't feel ""good"".Uses external audio.  While it can use anything, it's also not user friendly.  Being lightweight isn't an excuse to force the player to use another program to play music/media.The Ugly:Firing controls.  Firing is music-based.  And the special secondary weapon is time-based.  Everything is automatic.  Which means theres no chance to actuallly use skill, because the only thing you can do is go left or right.  Sniping blocks or even destroying all of one block becomes a chore as you pray that this riff causes enough shots, and hoping that you don't ""run out"" when you have a strong on 10c blocks.Zero consiquence for missing blocks.  This makes some sense as firing is automatic, random and skill-less, but theres literally no insentive to play this.  Just fire up a random playlist and let it play itself on repeat while you're at work and sleeping.  I bet you'd have all the upgrades in a few days or so.  Idle games can be fun, but this could be so much more...Uses external audio.  Yes.  It's greatest flexibility is it's greatest weakness.  Being able to read off the audio output is a nice feature, but it shouldn't be the ONLY way to play.  It ruins immersion, and really makes it feel more like what it is; Not a game, but a semi-interactive visualizer.I'd recomend it simply because it is pretty, and makes music fun to watch... But as a game, it's kind of a flop.Visuals: 11/10Gameplay: 1/10"

I think it's worth the buy.EDIT: did not get any form of special content for buying the game before it went Free2PlayI spent money on this not only for myself, but I had also bought it for a friend.I am going to set this as a negative review until I get something, at least. setting a game as Free2Play is unfair to people who payed for the full price game."

It has nice video backgrounds that synchronize to whatever audio is coming out of your speakers, and you can add some effects and filters like bloom, motion blur and color filters to them.The playable part of this title only serves as a mean to unlock new videos, effects and filters for your visualizer. Once you finish unlocking them all, there is no reason to go back and play.If you want a pretty VJ visualizer for your party, this might be it! Specially at this low price.Note to the author: please use your knowledge to create a ""VJ Visualizer Creator"" that allows the users to import their own short video loops. You could also sell some ""video banks"" and effects as DLC. Think about it! ;)"

,Recommended,394140,30096813,Posted: 22 February,all,miezkatz,"Sound Shift is an enjoyable, almost no skill demanding visualiser. Despite that, it does not fit with every kind of music and it certainly is no rhythm game. There are two game modes, an additional visualiser mode without gameplay and 20 visual effects to unlock with points earned in the two game modes.Arcade, shooting blocks, is kept simple and forgiving making it the ideal mode to relax to. Dodge, dodging blocks, though feels a bit clunky and more challenging to control, requiring more attention. The unlockable visual effects are an exceptionally engaging way to alter your experience during the rides. Players with the right music at hand and in the mood to get lost in a tunnel vision can use those effects to enhance the sensation.Playing Sound Shift with trip hop was my approach to the game. I tried a few different genres and uptempo tracks but came to the conclusion that the gameplay doesn't mirror my inner drive for a faster pace. Rhythm has a vanishingly low effect on gameplay, which doesn't necessarily diminish the enjoyment. There are certainly better games for twitch gameplay.Sound Shift is great if you're up for light-headed tunnel vision listening to chill music."
