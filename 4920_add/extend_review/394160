Unecessary HD main menu and few other things that graphically doesn't fit at all extremely increased the file size from around 25KB game to almost 1GB."

Still , this is the basic pac-man game. There is nothing wrong with it. It may be  not to everyone's standards nowadays due to simplicity of graphics and such, still a great game.Also, be aware this does not support widescreens on pc, and uses the original artwork from the cabinents to fill in the other parts of the screen. The size is actually the size it is in the arcade.I do recommend playing it for nostalgia value and fun. If your into graphics only , avoid and get the championship editions sold on steam. This game is also great for young children as it is good old fashion clean arcade fun!"

It's a classic for a reason.Pac-Man Museum may be a better deal, especially for the never released on PC elsewhere Pac-Man Championship Edition (Not DX), but that game is locked to some ridiculous resolution settings. This will run just fine in a window with no complaints. Ms. Pac-Man as well is probably a better product too, but, hey, this does what you expect it to do."

The gameplay is addictive and iconic, and as soon as you hear those jingles, beeps, boops, and waka wakas, you'll very likely find them stuck in your head for the rest of the day, if not longer.So how's this PORT of Pac-Man, then?Well, as far as the game itself is concerned, it's Pac-Man! Looks nice, plays great, sounds like the Pac-Man you'd expect.That said, the ""ARCADE GAME SERIES"" version of Pac-Man here does have a couple of kinks in it, the main one I found being that you do have to play it while most of the screen is taken up with artwork like an old school arcade cabinet, but the game itself is as playable and addictive as it's always been.Despite that, if you want some old school arcade fun to pick up and play without having to worry about the modern video game stresses of story modes, load times, and so on, then this is definitely worth the purchase."

Lag and random unresponsiveness plagues this game, much like Ms Pacman.  I found myself wondering why it's going left when I pushed up on the joystick.  Or why it does nothing at all at times.Great for nostalgia and the game looks great.  Seems to play much like the original.  Just needs work on controller / input.
