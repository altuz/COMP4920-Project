,Not Recommended,394220,23374387,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Nantes,"I was torn on whether to give a positive or negative vote to this game. While I did have good fun, it only lasted for the hour or so it took me to complete the first 4 maps, which are pretty similar to each other. The other 2 hours of gameplay  were from trying over and over, and repeatedly failing, to complete the game's fifth and last map, which is absolutely frustrating.The difficulty curve in this game is so ♥♥♥♥ed up you might as well call it non-existent. The first level is a bit hard because you're still figuring out how to properly land. After you learn that, it's a walk in the park for the next 3 levels. On the fifth and last, however, the game basically becomes Dark Souls, only more unforgiving. You're being constantly chased by ships which fire lasers and guided missiles at you, with no way to fight back. When you do manage to shake them off, you're already low on oxygen and fuel and need to land on a planet to restock. Problem is, almost every time you land, the game's God punishes your insolence by summoning a bunch of asteroids that get attracted by the planet surface and rain upon it, meaning you have to quickly leave before you become space milkshake. When it's not the asteroids, it's more enemy ships coming from absolutely out of the blue already firing at you. There's no way to avoid drawing the attention of these ships, as your field of view is very narrow. By the time you're able to notice them, they're already firing at you.With all that, you end up not having time to get enough resources, and you eventually die of suffocation or lack of fuel. Thus, I decided not to recommend a game with such a poorly thought out difficulty curve."

Hop from planet to planet, avoid obstacles, gather reasources, and reach the objective. It's simple, straightforward, requires a bit of skill and finesse but is very calming. It's a great game for sitting back and relaxing. There's not a vast quantity of content, and is probably good for a couple of hours total here and there. That said, the sub-$5 price tag is just right, I think the $4 I spent was a good deal."

I love how the gravity fields are different on each rock, and that the landscapes range from really easy to land on to a royal PITA.  This is good.  Buy it, you'll love it."

I had trouble getting the resolution to work correctly. At first the game was a fullscreen window where almost everything was cut off and in the corner, I later discovered you can press ""F"" to switch the game to fullscreen. Since the part of the menu that shows the keys was cutoff I had to discover this by trial and error. There is no other way to set the resolution if it doesn't set correctly.Unfortunately the game doesn't remember your resolution setting and you have to manually set it everytime you open it.Steam overlay doesn't work and steam achievements aren't working. The Windows download of the game interestingly includes a useless Mac system file: .DS_Store and the steam_appid.txt file is missing until you first run the game and Steam generates it for you.I had a lot of hope for this game. I really like the artwork and the gameplay premise but wasn't expecting it to have the unpolished and unfinished prototype feel.In the forums I can see others have trouble with launching the game, getting achievements, and setting the resolution. The developers talked about fixing the game but that was several months ago (nothing has been taking place) and the more recent posts from them talk about working through them if Steam won't provide a refund.The music is nice but gets repetitive quickly. I noticed they are also selling the official soundtrack and state it includes 5 tracks not featured in the game. They could put those 5 extra tracks in the game for extra variety.Intel Core i7-5820K1920x1080 resolution16GB RAMWindows 10 Pro x64Nvidia GTX 970"

76561198365236399,Recommended,394220,29866924,Posted: 11 February,all,Awai,"I rarely play this type of game mainly because I get bored and tired of the steep learning curve. The instructions to play the game is pretty clear, but hard to master. Even after successfully landing several times, I can still mess up landing. After a few more tries, I got the gist of the game and I can say the game is fun. It's simple (minimalistic to quote) and offers varying difficulty in terms of how the game progress and actually performing tasks in the game. Yes, it is easy to say you will land on this planet, but doing it is actually hard as asteroids fly at you/you were going too fast/don't turn your ship fast enough/there is a freaking hill or body of water that will wreck your ship if you try to land there. I do wonder if the gravitational pull of a planet varies or not based on the planet's size as you approach the planet. I didn't notice it, but if there are variations, that would offer another layer of difficulty for players.Simple to say, I didn't play the game long enough to master the techniques, but I do see the value in this game. Overall, good game for those with patience and wanting a short game to complete. 8/10."

Maybe I'm biased, loving every Pixel Jam game I've played. I'm terrible at video games. Last Horizon is a nice mix of not being so easy it gets boring, but not being so hard it's incredibly frustrating. It's a nice game to play and listen to podcasts too. It's a nice game to relax too. It's just a nice game. It's so rewarding when you achieve what you set out to do. I love you, Pixel Jam. I lvoe you, Last Horizon."

More content would help, such as more random easter eggs, more objects, more mission types such as supply runs for ore, search and rescue, treasure hunt, wealth accumulation in a given time, possibly even weapons, and so on."
,Recommended,394220,29218070,Posted: 12 January,all,Hybrid,"It only took me a few minutes before I realized this game would have a special place in my heart. The gameplay is simple, but addictive and fun. There is a distinct feeling of exploration within an open world, despite having a linear destination. There are only a limited number of levels to play (at the moment), and although they are only slightly different from each other, they are quite fun with a surprising amount of replay value.Best money I've spent in a while. I recommend it without reservations!"

I play it primarily on my laptop I bring to school because it runs smoothly on low spec machines. Great time killer, and pretty addicting.One thing I would love to see, though (I'll probably shoot an email to the devs) is some sort of scoreboard to keep track of the top scores for each mission. That being said, the achievments are plentiful and worth working towards.Overall, I didnt expect a game that downloaded in 5 seconds to be worth playing, and I was very wrong. Love this game, and can't wait to see what is implemented in the future!"

When I first started playing I thought wow.. I've just wasted money but the more I played I found myself drawn to playing more.. How much further could I get? Could I get to my destination world? (No, I still haven't) but that's what makes Last Horizon interesting and fun.. trying to beat this game has become a quest for me. Do I wish they'd update it and add a few things? Sure.. It'd be nice to see how you did compared to others.. gravity could be nice to help you land easier on planets rather that flying by them when you're in desperate need of oxygen.. although it was cool in my last game I was about to die.. running out of oxygen and instead of dying my ship landed.. and the game continued! Found myself smiling which is what I would want to know if I had developed a game is that people did smile.. did try to keep going to get to the end of the game.. and people buying the game should inspire the developer to add more content.. 'cause the game in its own weird little way is just cool! Will everyone like it? Who knows but it's worth the cost I believe.. but like anything if you don't try.. or just give up.. you'll probably never know the intent of the developer.."

The mechanics are not well tuned (like playing bumper cars trying to land your ship).Fun as a brief diversion if you liked Solar 2 (that game where you became a black hole) but only worth $1-$2 due to the veryyyy short gameplay.Rated 3 out of 5 planets.

But the basic premise is that you are the last human and you have to abandon Earth and find a new home. You must get to the 'Sanctuary' but at the same time harvest planets and maybe rescue some other humans on an other-worldly colony. From what I understand, for you to get a high score you have to land on planets and take as little damage as possible. I rate this game an 8/10. It's fun to cool off to, but at the same time you could rage pretty hard. Also I hope the devs update this game, because I see lots of potential for this game.P.S.
