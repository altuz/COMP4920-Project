,Recommended,394550,17865729,"Posted: 3 September, 2015",all,ThatCleverFox,"More Worthy Than it's PredecessorAfter just a few levels, I've come to the conclusion that THIS installment of Gunman Clive is better than the first. As much as I love the first one (and still play it every now and then on my 3ds) this one is just vibrant with more beautiful colors, music, and textures. Not to mention the more challenging gameplay, which is bound to make you get tons of retries on your first playthrough. Plus, with the extra challenges like ""No Damage"", as well as 4 save files, and 4 playable characters (with one locked) each with their own abilities, it's bound to keep you interested in it for a long time. Plus, it's cheap."

But for $3......this game is borderline Epic!......for the price.I've payed 10x that price, for games I could not even finish, they were so bad!Two Thumbs Up for this one though! Need to go back and play the original Gunman Clive I guess."

The level design is much better and just plain awesome (you never know what you and Clive will be doing next), the enemies are very varied and well-done, the visuals are f**king fantastic, the music is kick-a**, and the bosses are extremely cool.  This game is longer than the first game, it takes abouy 2-2.5 hours to complete, and tougher, but very fairly so.  It's one of the best games i've played recently, and at 3 dollars it's excellently priced.  I HIGHLY recommend this game; a lot of heart, soul, and creativity was put into it, something you rarely see in games these days, and it shows.  BUY IT NOW!!!"
,Recommended,394550,17888165,"Posted: 4 September, 2015",all,Deon,"Gunman Clive is honestly my favorite platformer of this year. Played it on my 3DS and enjoyed every moment of it. Sure, I got frustrated when I couldn't get through a stage, but that satisfaction of beating the stage you were stuck on for the longest time is amazing. Soundtrack made it even better going through the stages and the boss battles were challenging and that's a good thing. Now Gunman Clive 2 does everything bigger and better. More variety in boss battles, different types of stages compared to the first one, and there's more color! COLOR PEOPLE! The soundtrack is still on point with everything you're doing. Probably the best $3 spent on Steam ever."
,Not Recommended,394550,21731586,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,iN008,"Gunman Clive 2 is the sequel to one of my favourites from 2014. What happened? I'll get the good out of the way, so what does Gunman Clive 2 do right? To start the soundtrack is as good if not better than the original, featuring more varied tracks. The controls are fair, though this might just be me adjusting to the steam controller, but I feel the original had tighter controls. Bosses are more interesting and the difficulty has increased overall with both Chieftain Bob and the Duck offering a mix-up to the regular gameplay all of the above is what I appreciate from this game.So what do I feel Gunman Clive got wrong? The clear crisp sketch like visuals are now muddier than before, where previously colour was limited to enemies, various effects and the occasional bit of background scenery, now that everything is in colour I feel something has been lost in the transition. World and level design also feels off to me, devoid of originality. No longer does the stages feel concise but rather littered around the world for the sake of ""more diverse environments"". The stages suffer as a result, becoming both unoriginal and forgettable.I think the worst part is one of my major complaints about the original title still stands. Difficulty levels are meaningless, yes the difficulty of the game has increased but the choice of difficulty is pretty inconsequential, especially if you're going for the no damage run.I'll summarise for the sake of clarity, I don't think this is an inherently bad game, but as a sequel it has left me disappointed. If you do want to get this, I would urge you buy the 3DS version if you can as it is pretty much better than any other version of the game. I didn't want to give this a negative review, it's really deserving of a mixed review. So I guess I'll be the one to leave the first public negative review."

Short, but rich in variety. And just very enjoyable and very much worth the small price they're asking for it. If you ask me, they can make 5 more of those. I will buy them all. Highly recommend both titles!"

76561198016596277,Recommended,394550,25704911,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,davatorz,Totally awesome.  Better than the first (which is also great).  It's a very well-rounded platformer with a healthy mix of enemies and obstacles.  Gameplay is not too long and not too short.  The difficulty settings and varying attack styles of the different characters give it a nice amount of replay value.  It's the right amount of challenging for something to enjoy - not excrutiatingly difficult but not too easy.My new favorite game.  The animation - especially in the dinosaur world - is awesome.

I'm surprised that there are so few reviews for this one compared to the original (which is also excellent).  Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of people have missed this gem.  I would highly recommend Gunman Clive 2, especially for fans of 2D platformers."

I'm having trouble hitting the enemies. I believe this is because these levels were designed for the 3D mode for the 3DS.

It's quite short - 20 levels, 6 bosses - but there are 3 difficulty levels (don't bother with easy though, play first with medium and then with hard) and four characters which all play differently, giving the game a lot of replayability. And even if it was just the few levels, it's damned cheap and worth that money."

If you like Mario, Donkey Kong Country, Shovel Knight, etc. you will enjoy this.I played this without playing the original Gunman Clive. There isn't any story so it didn't matter at all.It's a short game - I beat it in 3 hours (on Easy) - but you can replay it with different characters if you want to.Some of the stages are quite tricky, but every time I died I felt it was because of my own mistakes, not bad luck or bad design. (Actually the levels are very well designed with plenty of variety to keep it interesting.) You have unlimited lives so you eventually learn how to complete each stage, and it's very satisfying when you do.Note that when you die you go back to the beginning of the stage, which can be frustrating, but the stages are quite short so it's not such a big deal.My only real criticism is the Steam Achievements are only awarded on finishing the game with different characters. A few mid-game achievements would have been nice.I give Gunman Clive 2 a 9/10. Highly recommended!"

The game dev(s) definetly experimented with new types of challenges in this one. Just overall very good especially for the price and a steal when on sale."
,Recommended,394550,30079502,Posted: 21 February,all,Purple Funny Joke,Gunman Clive 2 is one of the best Tactial shooter this game is for the fact that the look of the game is beatuiful and how the game plays some or more then the time is weapons and how great some of the weapons were in the patches but it is a real fun game of you want to get scared or killing this game is for you but. of you don't like that then leave but i leave you with this get busy killing or get busy dying.

The levels always manage to stay fresh and interesting, and they never overstay their welcome. Having to replay whole levels each time you die may be annoying to some people, but the levels are just short and fun enough that I never found it annoying or repetitive.Over-all its more robust and fleshed-out than the first game, and I definitely recommend it, sale or not, because either way its a super cheap price for a pretty solid platformer!"

Even if you own the 3DS version, this is worth it just for the graphical improvements from that version.It's well-made, it's fun, it's got good music, it's got a panda, and it's three bucks. Buy it. Awesome job, Mr. Horberg!"
,Recommended,394550,30209835,Posted: 26 February,all,Maki,"Gunman Clive 2 continues the zany nature of the original with more creative, well-designed levels and gameplay.  I highly recommend it, as well as the original, if you're a fan of Mega Man-style platformers.The game packs a lot of variety in locations, enemies and gameplay mechanics.  Compared to the original, it's more colorful, it has an even better soundtrack, and the levels are expertly paced to throw new and clever gameplay ideas at you constantly.  Not a single screen is wasted and everything feels meticulously planned.I really have nothing negative to say about it.  This is a textbook example of a great platformer."
,Recommended,394550,30349692,Posted: 5 March,all,Sterling,"I described the first game as, ""Megaman, as a western, except for boss weapons. Fantastic music!"" And in true Megaman tradition, the next game is much the same, and a little bit better. Beating the game was enough for me, but if you consider yourself a pro, there's opportunities for speedrunners or beating the game under different circumstances with different characters.(which the first game also allowed you to do)"
