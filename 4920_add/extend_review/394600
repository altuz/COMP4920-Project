Female Students have been abducted and no new couples were formed!It's now up toGunvolt,EkoroandBeckto save the day and ...L O V E.... sounds a bit weird eh?GameplayMighty Gunvoltis a spin-off title of the gameAzure Strike Gunvoltand was offered for free for people who bought the latter in the first month of release. Which is why it's seen as a DLC even though it's a standalone game.The real beauty of the game is the throwback to abetter timeand to theGolden Ageof gaming: The SNES Era.If you're familiar with theRockmanakaMegamangames in general then you know what to expect: Precise jumps. Difficult levels. And a bunch of fun.So here's the deal with this title.The game's relatively short and easy. You don't need a lot of skill to finish it in roughly 20~30 minutes per character.Maybe a tad longer if you go for the achievements.You have three different characters to choose from.First up isGunvolt. The dude's able to double jump and can use a chargeable lighting attack which you can move up and down. You have to stand still to do so though.Next up is the lovelyEkoro. This gal's able to float in mid-air, like Princess Peach in Super Smash Bros., and to befriend various enemies in the game to aid her in battle. She's a character from Inti CreatesJapanese-onlyGalGun.Last but not least is a lil' fellow we've all seen by now and can't wait to play him in his own game:Beckfrom the upcomingMighty No. 9.He's alot like Rockman. He has his lil' pew-pew as well as a dash which you can use to access new areas and a chargeable attack which lets you charge through enemies. If you kill them with the attack that is. If not you just bounce back. Boing. Sorry couldn't resist.Anyway. The game features five stages. Nine if you include the ones you have to use the warp function to get to.The game's pretty straight forward. You can either go for a high score and collect and kill everything you see or you can just speedrun the levels. There's no penalty to either option.The reason why I said that you need little skill for the game is the following: generous healthbar.You have such a big health bar in this game and health drops like the whole time. Not to mention it's often found in the levels as well.The real challenge of the game are the bosses of course. Just as usual they're either hard or easy to beat depending on whether or not you pay attention to their attack pattern.Other than that it's pretty fun despite being so short and simple.VisualsGraphics are quite good and colorfull. I mean it looks a lot like a Rockman game and the graphics just give you that special feel.I have to say the level design isn't boring. It's quite good actually since every level is unique and has its own theme.You have to be careful of a lot of things ... EvenLovecan hurt.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=584666533AudioPretty much the same as above. Everything just sounds and reminds me of the old games.What else can I say?It's a sweet game for a sweet price. Maybe a bit too sweet given how short it is.But if you find it on a good sale go and grab.It sure makes me want to dive into more of the genre right away."

While Mighty Gunvolt isn't of the same hi-bit art pedigree as it's big brother, Azure Striker Gunvolt, Mighty Gunvolt does something that another platformer which may or may not cameo, does not.It manages to be a damn good Megaman Classic game.The difficulty isn't too tough, but it's challenging enough for veterans and newbies alike. The end product is a reimagining of Gunvolt, Gal*Gun and Mighty No. 9 as an 8 bit platformer that keeps the pace tight, the controls tighter and the boss encounters extremely tight. The level design ranges from standard to rather innovative, borrowing stage gimmicks usually found in Sonic or Mario games, which function surprisingly well. The music does feel uninspired at times, but is always thematically fitting. It won't jam a tune into your head but it'll get you in the mood for jumpin' and gunnin'.It's worth at least the marked down sale price, and platforming junkies have no excuse to miss out on it. Don't let the 4:3 put you off, and while I do wish the game made more use of HD screen space, the blocky nature of the rooms actually turn this into a strength. It's tight, concise, to the point and varies just enough to be fresh while being everything you love about Classic Megaman."

This game sports 3 characters; Gunvolt from Azure Striker Gunvolt, Beck from Mighty No. 9, and Ekoro from Gal*Gun. All of which have different abilities to offer to the table in every run, with each character allowing you to finish levels differently and sometimes reach secret areas! Making every playthrough seem a little different each time!With nostalgic visuals, a wonderful soundtrack and solid gameplay, you'll never go wrong with Mighty Gunvolt! My only gripe is it isn't very long, but for such a short game it really makes up for it in the gameplay!9/10 !Edit! This game comes with the 4 DLC levels included!!"
,Recommended,394600,26575214,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,William Shakesman,"An 8-bit demake of some chunks of Gunvolt, a few Mighty No 9 levels, and a few original levels based around Galgun, which you likely haven't heard of unless you saw the Galgun Double Peace release on Steam recently. Gunvolt is the star, most levels and bosses are from his game, but the other two get their licks in too.You can literally finish this game's main story in 30 minutes. The levels are cute, and the bosses are faithful to their varied sources, but the game is trivially easy and there's nothing here but mega buster only Mega Man style play. The three characters don't bring much different. A slide, a double jump, or being able to ""charm"" enemies into a floating turret.This includes the 4 additional DLC levels from the 3DS version, which are far harder than the main game, accessible from the ""Portal"" option in the level select. These add an additional 30 minutes of play.You have three characters to play as, and the levels play well enough and the bosses are quite fun. So if you don't mind the short length, it's a solid buy."

,Recommended,394600,33164914,Posted: 2 July,all,Assholemon: Eijo Joestar,"Solid megaman style game (although easy) with simplistic controls and well put level design, the sad thing is, this is by far the best game that features beck from mighty no 9. And it's a very short game that you can easily finish in like 30 minutes or an hourGameplayThis is basically megaman but a lot easier since most of the level stages are easy to follow, the item appearance ratio and enemies are forgiving (though they're parts that can be kinda challenging). Though a few of the stages (mostly in the portal section) can give you a bit of a challenge.Most of the bosses are very easy and their patterns are easy to follow, but they're like 3 of them that will give you a challenge (mainly brandish, the twins and the final boss). But that doesn't deter that they're very fun to fight against since all of them have their own moveset.The characters that you control are the followingBeck: From mighty no 9 (what a let down) he's basically the megaman of the game and plays very similar to him, with the exception that the charged shot is replaced with a dash that deals damage, that dash can help you in getting some items and in dealing more damage to the enemies, however there's also the risk that it bounces and if you don't time it well you'll get hit by something while the bouncing animation finished.And finally he can subdash which he can use to get to those small places.Overrall a fine character that you can use if you want this game to be dificult and to get the megaman experience.Gunvolt: From azure striker gunvolt this is basically the bass (if you have played megaman and bass, though without the automatic shooting) of the game. he can shoot with his gun and double jump, and if you hold the attack button he will use a small electric beam that you can move to attack the enemies and it very useful when you want to reach to a certain enemy while hidden or in the air.He's basically better than beck in everyway and you'll most likely going to use him in your first run. And the fact that he appears in a good game instead of beck.Ekoro: From galgun she kinda plays like megaman, but with the exception that she can float for a couple of seconds and that her charged shot can charm enemies and they will fight alongside you untill you decide to use a charged shot again, when that happens the enemy will dash towards the closest enemy and it will disappear.She seems to be the easiest character to use because both using enemies to fight alongside you and floating will help a lot in many stages, and also she shoots fast.So basically you're more likely to use gunvolt or ekoro.The game doesn't have replay value (unless you count as playing the other characters as replay value).Which brings me to something I didn't like at all. The game will force you to choose a certain character and you'll stick to it for the entire game untill you decide to erase the save slot, which is a bad thing since I do want to use all of the characters instead of being forced to the entire game with only one.Other than that the gameplay is fantastic and does recreate the megaman feeling, though easier than the actual games.ControlsTight, responsive and work as they intended.Both the controls for the keyboard and gamepad work well. Though you might prefer using the gamepad for a better recreation of a megaman gameStoryIt makes no sense whatsoever and It's not important.It's about a cetain corporation wanting to get muses and thus take some girls with them and that includes highschool girls and thus love can't happen, which grabs the attention of ekoro.While in the case of gunvolt and beck it's about the fact that they're taking the girls for their evil plans.Also the story is in engrish, so have fun with thatGraphicsThe typical 8 bit graphics that you see in these kind of games, the details are quite nice and they look very distinguishable. They do look nice but to be honest I would've prefered some 16 bit or 32 bit graphics.SoundtrackBy far way better than mighty no 9 (which isn't a hard thing to do), but not as great as the megaman games, which do have a lot of iconic songs like the metalman stage, dr willy stage from megaman 2, crashman stage, the yellow blob (i hate that thing), etc.The songs are mainly the stages from the games so it all depends on which ones you like. But the ones from gunvolt and galgun are the ones that i did like.OverrallGet this game in a sale because it is worth a shot if you like your megaman platformers, while the game is very short it's a good timewaster and can fill that fix for some megaman games (that is if you want to try a different one rather than the actual megaman games).Solid 7/10"

It is clearly reflected in Mighty Gunvolt that they know their way around an action platform game. Controls are tight; Levels are varied and fun to play; & the option of 3 different characters to choose from, with slightly different abilities, makes the game a joy to play over and over. My only complaint is that some of the bosses are too quick with their attacks and even knowing their patterns, they become difficult to predict or dodge. Everything else is fantastic and would love to see more of these retro-style cross overs."

It tries to be a Mega Man-esque platformer, but sadly enough it does not reach those lofty heights. The levels feel a bit bland, generic, and while bosses can be a bit challenging on the first attempt, their attack patterns are not especially hard on the player."
,Not Recommended,394600,30348245,Posted: 5 March,all,madd.dawgg,"I'm half recommending this game... If I were to I put a thumbs up, it would almost entirely be based on the price and the fact that I did enjoy it. However, it is too simple and there just isn't a lot of game here. The disappointment is that I think there was a lot of opportunity to make a great game, but instead there just isn't much here. It is very possible that I am missing the point, and that it is overly simply be design. And if that is the case, with the content that is here, it's pretty darn good and you should maybe try it if you're a fan of classic action platforming.There is a save game file, but there is no real reason to save  your game. You can complete the game in under an hour. There is nothing that you 'save' aside from lives which don't really matter that much. There is a certain appeal to having a save game that reads 'clear' on it maybe.You pick one of three characters to play the campaign, but there are certain areas in each level that are clearly designed for different characters to access. In this, it's a shame that maybe the game's campaign had you 'meet up' with the other two characters and maybe going back to revisit the levels and getting to those unreachable areas might have been interesting.I'm not against a 'score' system being a metric for guaging how a player performs. In fact, I like that you can't just die from hitting spikes (a la Mega Man) or falling in a pit, rather you just lose your score multiplier. I feel like this is a good system implemented just fine here.Bottom line is that it's just too short and even at a low price, there's just not enough content here."

You get 3 playable characters: Beck (Mighty No 9), Gunvolt (Azure Striker Gunvolt) and Ekoro (Gal*Gun). Each having their own movesets with strengths and weaknesses that differ from one another. There's 5 main stages, each with a boss at the end. The stages and bosses are mostly from Gunvolt. There's also 4 additional stages that were originally DLC stages from the 3DS version, but they are now included along with the full game. The stages and bosses are mostly from Gunvolt, but theres a small handful of stages and bosses from Gal*Gun and MN9.Pros:-Playing the 3 characters gives a bit of variety in running through the stages and fighting bosses-The 2-D sprites look clean, yep simple-8-bit music helps to bring out that old nostalgia from the NES days-Easy enough to pick up the gameplay but can be challenging to fight the bossesCons:-Game length is lacking, even with the extra stages-No resolution or even a windows options-Controls felt slightly sluggish but responsive-Loading screens ( Seriously....theres loading screens in an 8-bit style game at this day in age of gaming)-Could of used more stages and music from Gal*Gun and MN9Overall: For the little time I put into the game along with its mostly minor flaws, I say wait for a cheap sale. The game does offer some variety and replay value with its old-skool gameplay, but it just doesnt last for long. It's a decent distraction for those waiting on MN9, but there are other games of this specific genre that do it better. If you got this game free when buying Azure Striker Gunvolt I'd say give it a try. But I wouldnt reccomend buying Mighty Gunvolt at its current full price. Also i think this game could use some optimization."

Why's he writing a review about it?""Well, the problem is... two hours is pretty much all that was needed.So it's pretty obvious from the get-go that this game is trying to be a callback to Classic Megaman, but with a little bit of a twist, by adding multiple characters with different abilities. While it's an interesting concept, this game is really lacks the energy needed to bring it to life. The levels are short, and the bosses are extremely easy. The only really hard part is the final boss; here, the game spikes up drastically in difficulty, which is rather jarring.There also isn't really anything to keep you invested, either. The gameplay is kinda barebones, which isn't a problem in itself, but the level design doesn't really do much to challenge you. It almost feels lazy, which is disappointing, considering the legacy it's attempting to live up to. You also don't really get anything for beating the bosses except passage into the next boring level. The only remotely engaging thing(not counting the achievements, which are mostly just there as a courtesy) is the points system. As you defeat enemies and collect candy and fruit(?), you have a multiplier which goes up steadily. However, the points don't do jack sh*t, and there's no leaderboard, so you don't really have any motivation to perfect your play.And on top of that, the game is incredibly short. Even if you're not really excellent at this style of platformer, you'll probably be able to beat the game within the hour. And while there are a few bonus levels, they have pretty much the same issues the main levels have. In fact, they're almost worse; they feel sort of empty, as though they're just there to make the game a little longer.Overall, this game just feels slapped together. There's no soul in it, and nothing in it is memorable or even really that fun. The only reason i ended up playing this game was because i got it bundled in for free with Azure Striker Gunvolt(which is a fantastic game). I don't know if they're still doing that, but if they're not, then don't waste your money. Even considering how cheap it is, it's just not worth it unless you can get it for free."

The soundtrack is great but I cannot justify spending $5.49 CAD on a game that is both less substantial and far easier than even the first mega man game.  Hazards are not really hazards if they literally do zero damage.  Refunded this trash, and I will pirate it if I feel like playing the game again.  What a ♥♥♥♥ing disappointment."

Beautiful graphics and great music, with very smooth gameplay and controls. It's pretty short, with five main levels in linear order, and four extra levels that can be played any time. The levels are easy, but provide some challenge in the bosses. Probably too easy for hardcore gamers, but it's good to have something for less experienced gamers too.+ Great graphics and music+ Solid gameplay and controls+ Bosses are challenging, but not impossible+ Achievements- Short- When you start a level, you can't exit it- The warp levels don't show any indication when cleared, so it can be hard to remember which ones you've finished- The story doesn't make sense, but I guess it's intentional Engrish.4/5"

And I'll say, for the price you can get it, it's worth it.Great 8-bit graphics and music that perfectly simulate the NES feel, 3 unique characters to choose from, easy to master controls and nice enemies and boss patterns (even though a bit easy) makes this game the best 8-bit you'll get this cheap on Steam, hands down. Also, the extra stages kind of make up with a few challenging moments (especially the bosses Elise and Mighty No.7).If you do want a longer and more hardcore Mega Man or similar titles, there are many fan-made Mega Man games you can grab for free around the internet like SFxMM, or you can buy Azure Striker Gunvolt or Shovel Knight here on Steam as well, but Mighty Gunvolt is a short, though sweet trip."

If so, this might be the game for you.Aside from the condescending intro, that's essentially what this game is. Its a Megaman clone with a substantial decrease in the difficulty and much more simplicity in the level design. Each character takes about 30 minutes to complete. There's 3 of them, so at best, the game should take you one hour and 30 minutes to complete.Each character plays slightly and I do mean, very slighly different from each other. One has the power to control enemies, one has the power to sit in one direction and wave a laser and the other is literally just megaman. Game gets a bit boring one hour in. Its a fun game, just a little lackluster. Pick it up during a sale or something, like I did. If not, is still cheap."

You're running, you're gunning, you're dashing, you're blasting, good times to be had by all. A little rough around the edges sure, but for its price it is definitely a fun (but brief) ride. Unfortunately, Inafune has made it evident that the times of Megaman are have passed; yet we still have hope in games such as this. Mighty Gunvolt is a nice little dose of foreplay before Mighty No. 9 comes out and hopefully delivers the climax we platformer fans await."

76561197969228435,Recommended,394600,23542706,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,Felix :),Pretty good Mega Man inspired game! Nice graphics and music and three different characters to choose from. The only downside to this game is the small amount of levels (only nine). Five of the levels are part of the story. The other four are optional and don't need to be finished to complete the main game. Compared to a real Mega Man game the difficulty of the levels is pretty low. The bosses on the other hand can be very challenging and have quite complicated patterns. Lots of fun!

The boss fights were challenging enough to make the game fun. The game can be beaten in 30 minutes or less but for the price I don't think that in itself is a big deal. Everything else about the game I loved. It is a great game for speed runners, retro gamers, and Mega Man fans.Pros:- Great controls- Good graphics- Interesting enough level variety- Decent music- Amazing priceCons:- There is not much challenge in the levels themselves. Only the boss fights.- Very short. An average player can be beaten in 20-30 minutes and 100% the game in under 2 hours."

You have three characters, including Gunvolt, Beck and Galgun, each with different strengths and weaknessess as well as exclusive stage-paths to help keep replay value up. And this is the closest to an NES style ""fo-retro"" game I've played, moreso than Shovel Knight (even if its extremely easy). The graphics, sound and controls are spot on, adding to the fun.When you want a fun and carefree Megaman style game, Mighty Gunvolt will fit the bill!!"
,Recommended,394600,33152179,Posted: 2 July,all,wyulf,"it feels more of a nostalgia trip than anything else really. it's a really really short game (about 20-30 minutes per run with each character if you know what you're doing), with fairly limited depth (only a few essential stages, and you dont get boss powers or anything like the megaman games).however to make things a bit more interesting, all 3 characters do have different and unique abilities of their own, which makes replaying a particular stage feel a bit different, as certain areas of the same stage are only accessible to certain characters, and as such, gives the short game a bit more replayability. not only in exploration, but even in boss fights as well, as you have to think of and employ slightly different strategies depending on which character you use.i've probably played all the inti creates megaman games from the gba to the ds days, and i really loved them. but this definitely feels like a side project to kill time for them, rather than something they're trying to flesh out properly.overall, it's not a bad game, especially if you've got an old school megaman itch to scratch, although maybe not so much at the full price."

,Recommended,394600,22817138,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Rukumouru,"Looks, sounds and feels exactly like 8-bit Megaman.The normal levels are pretty good, but the bosses are significantly harder. Many of the patterns will require repeat tries, memorization and good reflexes. Unlike in basically any Megaman ever, there's nothing like sub-tanks, E-Tanks or weapon weaknesses to make stuff optionally easier, so you're gonna have to git gud. While I'm fine with the fact that the bosses are tough, I'm sure many people would have appreciated some optional help.If you're a skilled Megaman veteran, this'll be right up your alley. If you're not, you're probably gonna be fine with some practice, but it might be a little bit frustrating.For anyone who has enjoyed Megaman in the past, and especially for 8-bit Megaman vets, this is highly recommended."

,Recommended,394600,33639997,Posted: 18 July,all,Jdude330,"This game isn't amazing, but it's a solid platformer that's good for about 50% off, depending on how much you like Megaman or the featured series. It's got fun levels, decent content for it's asking price, and three characters.One of these characters is an abomination to this planet and should never be played unless you want to speedrun horiizontal levels or not have fun.Beck.Beck has a ground dash that doesn't hurt enemies, and a charge dash that does. the issue is that the dash that's supposed to hurt enemies IS NOT INVINCIBLE. this means 9 times out of 10, you will hurt yourself using the dash.However, the other two characters are great. Ekoro can charm enemies to use as shields and projectiles, as well as float over gaps. Gunvolt has a stationary laser that shreds enemies, and can also double jump.The game has 9 main stages. however, each character can go through them in different ways. Not only that, but each stage has an interesting boss. The bosses do have poor difficulty spikes, but they are fun nonetheless.Overall, the game is fun and is worth a look."
,Recommended,394600,31408409,Posted: 27 April,all,Kinzo きんぞ,"Is the Mega Man Legacy Collection too much money for you to afford right now? Play Mighty Gunvolt! It has the old classic Mega Man gameplay with 3 playable characters from 3 games: Gunvolt from Azure Striker Gunvolt, Ekoro from Gal*Gun Double Peace, and Beck from Mighty No. 9! Play through many different levels with familiar bosses at the end! Each character plays differently and so you can play the same levels different times with different characters and have a new experience!(In all seriousness though, this game did Beck justice better than his own game could.)"
