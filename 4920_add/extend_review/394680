76561198141404871,Recommended,394680,20097712,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,joan4003,"A murder mystery written like an early Agatha Christie novel, presented like an Alfred Hitchcock movie, with the solvability (and continuity) of an Ellery Queen mystery.  Engaging, intriguing, heart pounding.  Keeps the gamer enthralled and guessing until the end.  I felt like I had read a thrilling murder mystery without actually any reading involved.  Excellent pacing with just enough time to almost catch your breath.Storyline: Dr. Philip White (one dark and dangerously stormy night) is called to the newly renovated White Wolf Hotel to examine and attend to a Mr. Grey.  When he arrives, the bridge washes out leaving him stranded.  He discovers there is no Mr. Grey and a hotel filled with other guests also invited to this grand opening by Mr. Grey.  (And Then There Were None ~ Agatha Christie, anyone?  And no that is not a spoiler.) The mystery begins when the body count begins.  Who is Mr Grey? Does he even exist?  Why are these people here, unknown to each other yet have a connection?  What is that connection?  And why this requital?  As the body count rises, the answers are revealed.Gameplay:  Hidden Object puzzler with point and click elements.  The hidden object scenes instead of being find lists, are picture finds (somewhat like a silhouette).  The HO scene opens and small pictures form a circle of the things or pieces needed to be found.  Not as easy as it sounds since the objects needed to be found blend into the surrounding objects (which are appropriate for where the scene is).  For example looking for desk items, on a desk covered with items typically found on a desk.  Also there are generally several of the same item and like a matching game the gamer needs to pick the correct one.Puzzles: Sliders and logic, or maybe better stated: logic sliders.  For example the typical moving of X number of one color object to the opposite side of a board/grid while the x number on that side are moved to where the other color is.  Typically found on locks.  Also there is the finding of keys, which are usually found behind some type of logic slider puzzle.The Point and Click element is just as important to the story and in true point and click fashion there are plenty of puzzling obstacles to overcome.  However this element is so intermixed with the Hidden Object aspect it is hard to tell the two apart.Note: No map (not needed), no penalties for game hints or puzzle skips.  No achievements but trading cards for those who care about those things.Conclusion: Enthralling and believable murder mystery, and like all excellent murder mysteries when the pieces start to fall into place, it is an avalanche.  Definitely worth full price."

But for the price of $5 it's a good game to get. I remember playing this game a long time ago actually. There is a map that shows you where you have stuff still to do but no fast travel.I don't know if they ever did a follow up to this game as it leaves you hanging a bit at the end wanting to know what happened next.
76561198042646749,Recommended,394680,29255654,Posted: 14 January,all,kris.aalst,"Mountain Crime: Requitalis the first 'hidden objects game' I played. I'm very familiar with the 'point & click adventure' genre but the idea of hidden objects never appealed to me because it sounds like a pixel hunt.I have to sayMountain Crime: Requitalmostly plays like a point & click adventure game: you collect items and use those on items in the game world to advance the story. Occasionally, you'll get a 'hidden object' screen in which you need to find some items but they're always hidden in plain sight, so there's no pixel hunting involved. Even then, there is a hint button. If you really can't spot that last object on the screen, it'll point it out for you.The story is a basic detective story. You're a doctor who's called to a hotel to examine a patient but when you get there, it's clear a murderer is on the loose. So you start an investigation by examining the hotel, its residents and its surroundings.I liked the setting, the mystery and the way the problem-solving needed to be tackled. The solution to advance the plot is always logical if you think about it. There are some puzzles to be solved, too. At first these are very easy, but in the second half of the game they can be pretty challenging.You're never stuck in this game: if you don't know where to go or what to do next, you can click the hint button. If you can't solve a puzzle, you can just skip it. In both cases, there is a time restraint: after clicking the hint button, it needs to 'recharge' before it can be used again, and it takes some time before you can skip a puzzle, so in both cases the game does encourage you to try before giving up.Without using spoilers, the story turns out to be a pretty basic detective story but it's interesting enough to want to discover what's going on. On the other hand, the 'personal story' of the main character turned out to be very cliché and became pretty predictable towards the end.All in all,Mountain Crime: Requitalwas a positive experience of about 4 to 5 hours. It certainly isn't a mind-blowing, life-changing experience but it is worth its price. If it's on sale, I think you shouldn't even doubt and buy the game if you're into 'point & click adventure' games. I'm not sure if it's a good 'hidden objects' game because the hidden objects scenes were quite easy and because I can't compare it to other hidden objects games."
,Recommended,394680,19008674,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Usagi,"An old abandoned hotel, a monstrous storm, a mysterious invite and lots of murder...it's like the movie Clue only not as funny.You play Dr. Phillip White and you've been summoned to a hotel to help a person in need. Then a storm hits and your car crashes leaving you stranded at the hotel. You'll meet lots of characters but honestly none of them matter since they all fall over dead like flies. The amount of murder in this game is just ridiculous. It honestly got to the point where I'd expect to find a dead body in every room. However, the story itself isn't bad but it quickly takes a predictable turn and the ending is down right hilarious. I laughed out loud at the end just shaking my head.Of course, the game doesn't intend to be funny. It takes itself seriously. The voice acting isn't perfect but it's passable. The graphics are dated but not hard on the eyes. The game play is where the game shines. I enjoy the hidden item scenes because you go into each one with a list of items to find that go together to form something actually useful. So no finding random gum wrappers or etched hearts. The mini games are very standard fare; sliding puzzles, memory puzzles, pipe puzzles, etc. They're fun but some are a bit vague when it comes to instructions.The game lacks achievements which is a shame but it also makes playing the game more relaxing. It's an old game at a cheap price and a good one for fans of the genre. Though the story isn't amazing it's funny and I enjoy laughing while playing a good game. So I say you should buy it and give it a shot.Lunar Productions"

I got a few hours of play for less than a dollar, though, so I'm not complaining too much!  The storyline kept me guessing on a couple of points, although the 'twist' of who the protagonist is became obvious fairly early.I enjoyed the puzzles, and most were not too difficult although I had to use some trial and error for a couple.  The hidden object scenes were a little different from most other games of this type that I've played - instead of working from a list, there is a 'wheel' of objects to find that will result in either putting together something you need, or causing something else to happen in the scene that reveals your objective (I did have to laugh at the hot air balloon!).  In most scenes there were several similar objects, so you had to find the right one - for example you need a glove, but there are a few gloves strewn around so which do you choose?  As far as I can tell there were no penalties for misclicks (and there are no achievements), so if you have trouble there's no harm in clicking all the gloves!All in all, a fun game for the price although I would probably recommend picking it up at a discount if you can."
76561197971341065,Recommended,394680,20008671,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,sfnhltb,"Another decent hidden object game, but as with many in the genre it has its problems, which while not game breaking annoyed me more than normal, but overall it had an interesting enough storyline and the gameplay was fairly decent, so still a fairly decent game overall, especially for the fairly neglible price (especially when on sale).The story has you as Quincy MD crossed with MacGyver trapped at a hotel during a storm where you almost died getting to your rich new patient. People start dropping like flies around you and you have to investigate and try to stop the killer before he runs out of victims. The plot is a bit of a mixed bag, a lot of it is shown in news clippings and details of the history of the hotel and all the people being killed who all seem linked back to an arson a couple of decades previously, so you have to race to uncover the identity of the killer. At one point there is the hint it might be an interesting denouement in the nature of identity/memento or some other psychological thriller, but in the end it feels more like a daytime soap plot (except for the body count).Still that part is okay enough to provide the background for the gameplay, so that breaks down into the hidden object scenes which are of the construct an item style of HOG, which is where you go all MacGyver and construct all sorts of items from things found in one place, so at one point you collect a safecracking kit (and then proceed to use the screwdriver to take the entire safe door off ignoring the rest of the kit you painstakingly searched for), some sort of miniflamethrower, a hot air balloon (because you didn't want to just lift/push the basket off the item you needed).While very inventive it all feels pretty bizarre (more so that normal for the genre even, which is pretty bad by and large). The imminent peril of people dying of snakebite, or being strapped into a chair at the mercy of the killer, and then you go around repairing a globe, or a piano, most often just to get common household tools - that you generally discard after one use so there can be another convoluted puzzle to get yet another screwdriver or whatever later in the story. You rarely get any explicit story hints of why you should be interacting with these objects, just they are the only things on the map which can be interacted with left, so that must be where the latest essential tool can be found.Anyway that gripe aside the scenes play fairly well and feel somewhat naturalistic, the puzzles also tend to be unexplained - I guess the hotel owner likes messing with his employees and forcing them to play puzzles to open doors and otherwise do their job. No wonder all the staff seem to have disappeared before the story starts. The puzzles themselves are mostly fairly easy, with a reasonable variety, but the controls are frequently wonky and things don't always move how you want them to - this even forced me to skip one puzzle as I couldn't move the piece far enough right to finish it. There were a couple I found more difficult but I think it is more down to me being bad at those types of puzzle (the 4 shape overlapping rotating puzzle right at the end being the main one). Of course with no achievements you can actually use the skip/hint buttons if you really get stuck without it forcing you to replay it later to get the last couple of achievements (and forcing you to find a way to do those puzzles or consult a walkthrough anyway).Overall it is a recommendation, especially given the price, but don't expect too much, it has a lot of flaws to go with the good points. Also I laughed out loud (literally) immediately after freeing the Senator from the chair - I don't think this is the intended reaction...anyone else do the same?"

But, upon arriving, you soon find out that something sinister is taking place at this sleepy residence.You can compare the story to that of the 1980s film Clue, but with slightly darker undertones.No, really, you play as a guy who goes into the middle of nowhere and everyone else (except for you) is a complete and utterly clueless fool. Murder in a big, beautiful mansion, the works.The only difference is the fact that you're a beefy doctor with a penchant for solving puzzles and...Well, the cheesy ending; but the game is pretty fun to play so I won't spoil it for you!+I've played quite a number of HOGs and I was pleasantly surprised by the unique spin in this one.Instead of going through hidden object scenes full of stuff that has to be picked through to cross off a list, there's a ring of six or seven items that, once filled in after finding and dragging the items into the bubbled ring, will create or repair a useful tool or key item to progress the story - like a vacuum cleaner, blow torch, etc.This aspect of the game alone was very refreshing and less time consuming compared to the repetitive formula that other HOGs use for gameplay.Puzzle-wise, though, I'm happy to say that there's a good variety to play with; though, I think more would've been appreciated because the HOG scenes can be a bit tiring after awhile.My favorite aspect of the game was exploring; the hotel has a large number of rooms and each one has its own theme and unique charm. The hidden documents, weathered walls and furniture made me wonder just what kind of history the place had.Sadly, I feel that the story was a bit too predictable and fell short of its potential towards the end; but it was really fun to play and the game is sold at a great bargain - so I got what I wanted.I'm not so sure if Mountain Crime has replay value, but I will say that this is something that HOG fans can enjoy."

,Recommended,394680,32554098,Posted: 18 June,all,osirish,"Mountain Crime: Requital is a murder mystery Hidden Object game where you play a doctor who finds himself trapped in a hotel with guests dying around you. Initially you try to help the guests as a doctor but as more backstory reveals itself, you start trying to solve and prevent murders before you eventually realise you might not be there by accident.The graphics and sound are a little dated but otherwise good enough. The voice acting is ok, and the animations are terrible! (Particularly where characters walk around the scene, they look as if they were modeled on a ape walking around on two feet.) There is plenty of story and backstory, most of which is revealed in text format through letters and clippings, so if you tend not to read text or skim over it, the story might be lost on you. The puzzles were easy for the most part, and there are plenty of HO scenes although most of them are quick. There's a map that shows actions needed and locations but there is no fast travel.Overall, the game is above average thanks to it's story which tries to be a little original and not follow the tired ""find a loved one missing due to supernatural events"" that most HOGs can't leave alone, and the only real annoyances are the large amount of back tracking you need to do, revisiting the same locations again and again, and for the first half of the game, it feels like you only carry one item in your inventory at a time, the item that you need to progress to get the next item, and so on ... if you can get through 90 minutes of that, the game opens up a little. at over 3 hours to complete, it's a nice length, not too short and not too long.

Even with the low price, I would advise you to stay away unless you're okay with mediocre gameplay, horrible storyline, and cheesy acting.First of all, the gameplay wasn't bad; I'll give it that. The puzzles are decently challenging with the offer to skip and ask for hints on what to do next. That's all fine. For most of the puzzles, I didn't need the hint or skip buttons because they were simply too easy for me. I actually found myself using them to get through the game faster. There isn't much hidden object searching in this game though, so if that's what you're looking for, search elsewhere. The HOG system for this game isn't great; I'd rather the system in Mystery Case Files. The items are shown for this one and they usually don't even look the same when you find them because of the angle they're in.The storyline, however, was out of a soap opera. It made no sense and there are way too many holes in the plot. Oh, someone's dying? Great, let me just solve a bunch of puzzles before I save his life even though in real life, he would be dead in 2 minutes. The cheesiness is REAL. The brought in a bunch of random characters for no reason and made some unnecessary choices to bring the story forward. The game DRAGS ON just for the sake of being longer, not because of storyline. And even with the dragging on, I still finished it in under 4 hours. It was just an unpleasant 4 hours.The acting is cringeworthy. I muted the game pretty much the entire time I played because I couldn't stand the voice acting. The ambient sounds of the game were fine, but that's ALL you can hear. There's music once in a while, sure, but it was the same damn music each time and it's not even great music. Just decent, although kind of reminiscent of Goosebumps the TV Show.Overall, I give this game at most a 5/10. The story makes absolute no sense, gameplay is mediocre, and acting is really horrible. The only thing keeping the score up is literally only the mediocre gameplay and mediocre graphics. I'd rather play a Nancy Drew game or Mystery Case Files."

I think it's maybe a little above average than other games of the same genre and especially considering its price.The storyline is okay. Coherent and put together (maybe even more so if you're the type to really read documents and pay attention to the details). It's a bit cheesy, a bit predictable if you're used to the genre. Not exactly the most suspenseful, but it's got enough ""mystery"" to make you want to finish the game.The puzzles were just rightly challenging. The steps taken to progress through the game is logical and challengingly enough, but it does become ridiculous at times because it doesn't really have the amount of urgency that the story is supposed to have.The animation was pretty great (especially the cut scenes), the voice-acting could do with a little more emotion sometimes (but the background music and ""ambient"" sound supplemented the drama of it all).Personally, I think there are plot holes that need addressing (or maybe I just failed to pay enough attention to key details). It's deserving of a sequel, not only because of that cliffhanger ending, but also because the mechanics of the game is already off to a great start.I think this is one of those games that needs a ""so-so"" button. I wouldn't actively recommend it, but I wouldn't not recommend it either. But since I'm leaning towards a more positive note about this game, I give it a thumbs up."
