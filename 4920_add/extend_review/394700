I played it entirely using touch screen controls, though at the start of the game some baffling keyboard/mouse controls were communicated to me without any dialogue. I ignored this and kept touching things intuitively on the screen, which seemed to work just fine.In the first 40 minutes I met a guru, dosed my eyeballs with a psychotropic substance that let me see spirits and a new world of colour, then I jumped inside some kind of travel monster that took a blind man to eye-land, and then went to a beach rave with a flying saucer.The only puzzle I found tedious was jumping through holes in a leaf to try to find the correct exit, but otherwise most things went smoothly without requiring trial and error or repetitive searching.I can't wait to see the other two thirds of the game..."

Jolly little monsters live in a bizarre world not unlike those made by Amanita, but with its own flavor - and many puzzles that could be somewhat difficult to solve without the walkthrough because of their, well, somewhat illogical nature. But it is very funny indeed - and every little bug, moth or flower is drawn and animated with special care and love.And after the recent huge price-drop, this game is actually a must-buy!"

It's colourful, cute and surprises with a lot of new ideas. If you already liked the demo, the full version is not going to let you down when it comes to graphics and a lot of lovely little details that will make you smile. I am already looking forward to the next part.some little details I did not like that much: sometimes you are stuck in the game because you have overlooked a small detail, so far, i did not find out if it is possible to save your progress, so when you have ♥♥♥♥ed up your karma, you have to start the level again (which is not a huge problem but a bit annoying sometimes)but overall great value for money and really enjoyable!"

And while the textures are not as polished, the flow of movement from the characters is lovely and particularly well done. And the music score is great as well.Some mechanics (like being good and evil) could have been implemented better, the save system is far from good, autosaves and lets you replay huge chunks of the game if you want to try out handling affairs differently. Also it should be mentioned that this is part 1 of the story.All in all I had a blast playing it. If the pictures and trailer get you, you probably will not be disappointed."

It's very interesting how your moral choices have an impact on the actual gameplay, and how you must redeem yourself in order to progress. The music is nice as well and the graphics are very funky and pleasing to the eye. It's too bad the game was so short, but I expect the next part to be equally amazing."

Very beautiful and unique artstyle, with lush colourful environments, cute characters, and a sweet if simple storyline.The ""puzzles"" are pretty easy to solve so there's not much of a challenge, however the main draw of the game is simply exploring this creative and imaginative world. A lot of times I found myself clicking on objects over and over again just to see the funny animations! And there's a decent amount of content available, considering the game easily lasts around 2 hours (without counting achievement hunting).The style reminded me a lot of Botanicula and other Amanita Design's games, though obviously less complex than that. Still, for such a cheap price it's definitely a more than satisfying experience. I bought this on impulse and I don't regret it one bit!"

Incarnation 1 is well worth your time and the few petty cents they ask for the privilege of playing this piece of art.I give it a 9/10 for nearly perfect enjoyment.
,Recommended,394700,28273652,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,Hostile Hippo,"I was able to play this at PAX West this past September and I’ll be honest, it was frustrating and confusing at the time I played it. Coming back to it however, they definitely refined a lot of small, but major gameplay elements such as hints, and providing more of a tutorial, which definitely made playing it today a lot more enjoyable.The game is definitely one of the more unique games I have played, and for a point and click, I found it fairly well done. My only complaints would have to be there are no settings (the volume is rather loud at times), controls would get a little bit buggy (trouble with click response times), and you can’t skip past animations (which was more of an issue when achievement hunting). Aside from the few negative things I mentioned, I really loved how the story is presented, because it does leave room for interpretation and imagination. Additionally, the art style just makes the game visually appealing and interesting in its own way. Together the some-what vague story and art give you a sense of curiosity which for me made the game very intriguing.Overall I really enjoyed the game and can’t wait for the story to continue."

,Recommended,394700,31548088,Posted: 4 May,all,ThatRandomKat,"Going through steam on a Saturday, looking at what's for sale, and I find this little colorful point an click game, with a very strange name, for less than $2. I had never seen it before, never heard of it before, so I thought ""why not"" and got the game and started playing it. I had only wanted to spend an hour on it, but it ended up taking over the rest of my day. The sound was a little strange at first, but it ended up fitting the game well, for it is a strange game. The art was phenominal, and absolutely outstanding. The monsters looked nightmarish and groteswue, but at the same time rather beautiful. The puzzles were a moderate challenge, and the story had so much depth for never using words. The characters personalities felt like actual people, even if they are just happy little creatures interacting around you.. I wished the astral sight could have been required more, and that the radius was bigger, or that it could be moved around. Sometimes it took a while for the main character to trudge from one side of the screen to the other, othertimes it would refuse to move and I'd have to restart the game, but thankfully it has a save system. Overall, absolutely enjoyed it. :D"

76561198014473461,Not Recommended,394700,33348848,Posted: 7 July,all,Genghis Pawn,"There's a lot about this game that is trulybizarre, not just the art style. The game seems to be cobbled together without much care for the player's experience, and the result was that I was frustrated with gameplay, felt like I was fighting the game to play it, and felt like the game did not respect my time. (The ~7hours I've logged in it are only because I'm an unrelenting achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.) This made it difficult to enjoy the game, and so I don't recommend Incarnation 1 -- though I am hoping the dev might tweak things for later chapters, and am eager to see where all this goes.A few examples of why I found Incarnation 1 a chore to play:1) Within the first ~10-15 mins of gameplay *after* the intro, you'll encounter a truly frenetic and bewildering sequence of load screens (!?) and short vignettes where there is little meaningful gameplay.(I'm thinking especially of the first time you get into that weird little living elevator that lets you travel to different areas. You're forced through a vignette in which you have an interaction -with no options-- with a blind character. You never see that character ever again, and you pass through a few areas of the game you never see again. if this is foreshadowing for a later episode of the game, it comes at the expense of enjoying this chapter.)It's exceptionally difficult to start feeling at home in the world of Karma when, right at the start, gameplay is constantly being interrupted.2) You've got an inventory that displays items you've collected. However, you have no ability select items from your inventory to do anything with them. You can look at them in your inventory, but you learn nothing new by looking at them, and clicking anything in the inventory is not in any way a direct route to interaction in the game. If you've got the right item in your inventory, then when you approach the place where it can be used, the game will just tell you to use the item. And you then use it without actually accessing the inventory at all. This turns the familiar presence of an inventory into a distraction with no relevance to gameplay, and sends mixed signals to the player about how they are supposed to accomplish anything in the game.3) Using Astral Sight appears to be just a gimmick for introducing (more) psychedelic art. There's very little going on in the spirit world that seems to matter for gameplay. Moreover, Astral Sight helps bring out some weird design decisions about the mechanics. Normally (without Astral Sight) you can pan around the whole screen and see what's going on far away from you. But Astral Sight only works for a small window around your character, so your world shrinks a bit when you use it (presumably the exact opposite of the experience it was supposed to provide of transcending a more mundane plane of existence or whatever). And yet, it's not quite so jarring, because...4) The world you can see (without Astral Sight) is decoupled from the world you can interact with, nearly all the time. You can always pan around a screen and see what's far away from you, but you've typically got no option to interact with anything until you walk right up to an object.The one exception is the forest, the one screen/area where suddenly, you can interact with objects at a distance. If you're like me, you discover this by being lost and bored and clicking anything you can. And most of what you can click at a distance is irrelevant. The whole experience is a bit hackneyed.When you are close to objects, the game simply tells you how you interact with them. As a result, being able to look around the whole screen at any time is basically meaningless for gameplay, since you only get information about which parts of the world are relevant once you've walked up to them.5) Many of the hand-drawn animations become more irritating than charming, real quick.Especially in the forest and the leaf-maze.The same animation plays every time you perform an action, and just eats up time: cute the first time, maddening the 30th time. Also anytime you are traveling to the left and click to interact with anything to your left, your character will pause, turn to the right, then turn back to the left and do what you wanted. This just seems like lazy programming."

(In fact, if you find the screenshots appealing and like the genre, don't bother with the trailer as it does contain some spoilers.)This game had me hooked from the first few steps (or should i rather say hops) as a freshly incarnated blob in a artistically gorgeous world. I'm finding it hard to put into words why i liked this first episode as much as i did. I guess it's partly because of how the different characters you meet behave towards you (receiving you with open arms with a divine innocence in their souls; unless you decide to be evil oc).I absolutely love that this game doesn't try to be serious, quite the opposite actually. Details like how a blob without arms or legs pulls or gathers large objects is simply charming.Most of the puzzles are fairly simple but one actually really kept me guessing for some time.Another plus is the sound track which fits perfectly (imo).10/10, can't wait for the next episode!Not recommended for people who:- like serious/fast paced/action packed games- don't care much for this type of graphics- don't enjoy exploring"

If you enjoy games like Botanicula, Machinarium or Samorost, I daresay you'll enjoy Karma Incarnation 1 as well. I loved the different worlds [gorgeous artwork] and found myself pausing to look at the artistically-stunning backgrounds and to find all the different characters/thingamajiggies to interact with. I definitely got stuck once or twice - missing a directional arrow or an action bubble, here or there, and although some of these misses were perplexing, once I figured out what I was missing I enjoyed the ""oh, duh..."" moments. There are multiple ways to go through this game, and given it's name, I somehow failed to put it together at first; the choices you make as this worm-blob-Pacman-on-drugs-guy,doactually effect how you end up - I legitimately felt like a s**t head of a character a few times when I didn't realize at first glance that there were multiple options in terms of the actions I chose....  and I did, in fact, connect with the little guy and wanted him to do well in the end! All in all, I would definitely recommend this to friends and those of you who like the above mentioned games, and I not-so-patiently await any follow up game/s within this series."

,Recommended,394700,28366998,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,Tresden,"It causes a good first impression with it's great sound effects, beautiful graphics and creative animation. The game does a good job telling a story without words, however it's easier to miss information with pictures  than with texts, which is always frustrating in point and click game (specially when it's puzzles involve more creativity/observation than logic, which is the case), that point is mitigated by an inteligent system of tips available if the player asks for them.About the story, I didn't felt much immersed at first, and what kept me playing was mostly the aforementioned technical aspects. The final acts, however, make up for the slow beginning, ending at the perfect spot, making me want to play the part 2. I only wish they could keep the story more homogeneous, in a way that the first parts doesn't feel like filler to the main story.About the mechanics, the ""spirit view"" (not a spoiler, it shows up very early in te game) could take a higher role in the game, it doesn't feels deep, it reveals another issue that I will talk about later, and it could take inspiration on similar mechanics, like The Legend of Zelda on how to show paralel universes interacting, it's mostly an x-ray view and adds close to nothingbesides some achievments and solution to some puzzlesit has so much potential. The moral choices make a very, very small part on most of the game, which was a feature held high by the devs on their page. It's not bad, and shows up in a very interesting way, but again, it will make no difference during 90% of the game.And lastly, the controls. It's pretty clear that the game was meant to be played on a tablet, and I had some minor issues controling the character and the camera due to that, If you click a bit over the spot you wish to go, the character won't do anything, not a big thing, but anyone can see it. The big issue is that I feel like the tablet plataform is what limited the ""spirit view"" mechanic, it could be very different if it was made to the PC plataform.And that's it. Karma. Incarnation 1 made a great debut on the series even with it's issues. And I say that because I feel like many of it's problems could be solved in part 2, which is what I like about the ""3 chapters"" system. If part 2 pick up right from where part 1 left off and don't drop it, instead of reseting the story and slowing it down again, that alone will make the sequel a very good point and click game"
