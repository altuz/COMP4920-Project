It's clunky in every way you would expect a mobile port to be, and while it's cool to see some of the techniques and solutions they applied to a mobile platform, they do not carry over to the PC.  Ultimately, that's unfortunate, because while the production values are fairly low, it's not incompetent."

Then Dead Effect 2 VR was published as a big surprise to the VR community. And for the reason I already own the ""normal"" version I got a 75% coupon for the VR version. So it is was definitely worth having the original game in order to get the VR version for only 4,50 EUR. Good job.And by the way. Game is a lot of fun. It is a decent FPS with RPG elements. It takes a lot of good mechanics from other games and mixes them together. It's not this typical AAA title you might expect, but it definitely fun.GET IT FOR THE VR COUPON and also if you like CoD Zombies."

It has low production quality across the board but tries to put on a show for some reason.  Overly long tutorial that assumes this is the first time ive ever played a game of any type.What will probably kill the game for me is the combat.  Melee feels just aweful, zero feedback, one cheezy swing makes zombies explode.  it just doesnt feel good.also only 3 generic preset characters.the screen shots of this game do NOT represent how it looks and feels to play.  looking at the screen shots as i type this im getting the urge to go back and play...but i was just playing and got the urge to quit just as fast....i get that feeling.Also the reward after the match was a choice between a health pack, energy pack, or ammo pack....it was all legendary in quality....how boring...undecided if ill refund it but im leaning towards that right now.  bottom line the combat feels too unfun for a game like this to work.  if your going to have me grinding short missions for loot the game rides on the combat gameplay and there isnt any here."

If you enjoyed playing Borderlands and Dead Island with your friends then you will definitely have fun with Dead Effect 2.There are tons of great aspects of this game, including smooth and satisfying combat, lots of loot, and several game modes to extend the life of the game.The feature that most impresses me with this gem, is that the maps and mobs therein are dynamically affected by the level of each player. So as a level 20, you can play a game with your level 2 friend, and the enemies will be level 20 to you while they are level 2 to your friend. Likewise, the drops are scaled for each player in the same manner.I really appreciate all the quality-of-life coding that went into this game. Other game developers should use this game as an example of how to do co-op right.Here's hoping that the devs have a Dead Effect 3 in the works!"

,Recommended,394760,28963994,Posted: 2 January,all,AbedsBrother,"Like the first game, Dead Effect 2 is a first person zombie shooter set aboard a large spaceship. It fails to shed the B-movie persona of its precursor, but believes it does, making the story-based campaign oddly unsatisfying. Gameplay is good, though, and cooperative campaign, online multiplayer modes and some decent weapons & armor leveling means there is quite a bit of fun to be had. A good effort by Badfly Interactive, but stops well short of becoming a classic.Total size on my hard drive: 10.7 GB+ Guns are great. Not Battlefield level of gun design, but whoever designed and animated them did a great job. Badfly must have made this a priority when developing Dead Effect 2, and it shows.+ Weapon upgrades are great. While there is no attachments system, there are a number of things that can be purchased to make your weapon of choice more powerful. The weapon does not change visually, but the damage progression is very noticeable.+ Same for armor. There are dozens of varieties of armors available. Each suit is divided into feet, legs, chest, arms, and helmet parts, allowing mixing and matching. And each part has one or sometimes two slots for additional components.+ Graphics are decent. Bluish light and black shadow splash across the screen often, leaving a cold and dark feeling.+ Decently optimized. I had to reduce shadows (to medium) and bloom (I have an R7 260X), but after that I had no trouble playing the game @1080p 60fps.+ Drop in / Drop out coop works well. Not too many random matches to be found, but they work well when they’re there.+ Decent soundtrack (which is included as MP3 files).+/- Headshots are OP as hell. The length of your longest killstreak in multiplayer translates directly into the post-mission bonus multiplier (a kill-streak of 50 will result in a multiplier of 50). It can be very easy for a skilled player to earn a ton of credits fast. Aim and accuracy modifications to the armor can help even more.+/- The armor customization does demand focused specialization. If you try to create a “good at everything” build, the bonuses will be too small to make much difference.+/- The story is actually half-way decent. Wake up in a ship, have to survive while a classy English voice tells you what to do. Do a few missions, then discover that you, the player-character, are considered the result of an experiment, and if the “relief ship” (containing lots of soldiers) catches up with the Meridian, you will be taken captive and disposed of as just another of Wagner’s clones. Danette, she of the classy English voice, has an interesting story that could have delved into all kinds of ethical concerns – but doesn’t. Not that Dead Effect 2 needed to be like The Walking Dead, but there is potential for additional depth which isn’t explored at all. Disappointing.- The story ends too soon. You fight some creature, then – “Surprise! That was actually the final boss! To be continued!…”- The voice acting, with the exception of Danette, is poor. Dr. Bielik sounds like a highly exaggerated Chekov (from the original Star Trek) and is annoying as heck any time he opens his mouth. And if you choose Jane as your player-character, well… Some of the worst “voice-acting” I’ve heard in a long time.- Level design is small. It’s tight, confined and claustrophobic – so tight that there isn’t always room for two players to run past each other in a corridor. If never feels like we’re on a huge spaceship.- Few enemy varieties. Your standard zombie, puking zombie, grenade zombie, and giant zombie. There are some good-looking bosses, but unless you’re playing a shotgun build (which risks getting close to the boss for maximum damage), it’s easy to keep them at a distance.- There is a huge amount of loot. And I mean HUGE. I would barely get my character upgraded (which cost some serious credits) before some really epic loot would drop, making all my careful upgrading seem worthless. I expect this to happen once or twice in a loot-based game, but here it happened 4 or 5 times (more frequently as my character’s level was higher).- Character appearance never changes, despite equipping some awesome armors.There are definitely some talented people working at Badfly Interactive, and while Dead Effect 2 improves in many ways over the first game, it’s not the masterpiece that will launch them into the mainstream. Hopefully their next game in the series, Tau Ceti, is already under development and they make it as big and B-movie as possible. If they want to go the ""serious"" route, get better voice actors, open up the levels. and don't be afraid to tackle some serious issues with the story."

Some hard mode ones are so easy it's a snoozefest and some generic easy missions♥♥♥♥♥♥me dead all the time... I retract my positive review. This broke the fun or me SO HARD I will probably not play this again. Same for future titles from these devs since the same ruined part 1 for me :(It's like a really good scifi trash movie that you are the main character of. It knows itself and characters overact just right to make it feel coherent. The action is great fun and they learned from many of their mistakes in the first title of the series, such as terrible pacing and difficulty spiking (as well as often switching from ultra high to very low). Also they got rid of the sometimes ridiculous hacking mechanics in part 1 and replaced them with (sometimes too easy) ones. Graphics are nice but not great. The music is mediocre and can get repetitive and gun and monster sounds are average as well. Controls are above average but not perfect, but it's good enough. The RPG elements are integrated nicely and the loot and upgrading are satisfying. Being able to choose as many missions as you like while also choosing difficulty, the game will go at the pace you choose yourself, which is very nice.All in all this is worth the few bucks you have to spend for it and you will easily get a dozen hours of fun out of it."
,Recommended,394760,32959333,Posted: 28 June,all,Osiluss,"Overall Dead Effect 2 is fairly decent port. The gameplay itself works fine, there's a fair amount of zombies and other enemies, lots of guns to loot, upgradable equipment, and a leveling + skill system and quests. the main problem though is the upgrading is linear, skills are fun but a few stand out as the clearly optimal choices, and the guns could use a bit mroe variety between them.The graphics are plenty fine for what's needed, even pretty snazzy at times. The story does what it needs to; a bit silly and obvious sometimes but it gets you from palce to place. The voice acting meanwhile is bad as is the dialogue; hilariously so sometimes. But there's a b-movie charm to it.The game probably won't blow your socks off and isn't revolutionising anything but there's enough gameplay to easily sate you if you're in the mood for a zombie filled romp. On sale it's easily well worth the price of admission."

They shouldn't have released a game with awful frame rate problems. Also the developer commented on this review saying that they don't deserve negative reviews just for it being a mobile port. Most people aren't reviewing negatively because it's a mobile port. They do this because it's a awful mobile port.

,Recommended,394760,33575231,Posted: 15 July,all,Ktasz,"TL;DR at the bottom.So, I never played the first DE, and I never played either on Mobile, so I don't know really how similar the ports are to the original. For a port though, by a small developer, it's very good.Graphically, the levels are quite busy and cluttered, nothing overwhelming but I prefer a bit more simplicity. Models look fine, textures are detailed enough, some weapons like the Relic and Synergy rifles look completely untextured, while other weapons have elaborate designs, so there is a bit of inconsistancy on that front. Otherwise, it looks a lot like a bright Doom 3, which is in no way a bad thing!The game actually doesn't run super great, especially for the maps mostly being very small. I have a GTX 960 and I never went below 40 frames, but I never consistantly got 60 frames outside of the hub on High settings. I believe the shaders and effects were the main culprit, it's perfectly playable even with some dips here and there.Sound is pretty average, the voice acting is atrocious for pretty much every character, Deanette probably had the best performance, props to her actress, she did well. Minikin was okay as well, though, he just repeats his name the whole time so... Weapon sounds are very generic, but they still sound nice, I really like the sniper rifle sounds, very satisfying to shoot, Melee sounds very impactful as well.Gameplay is where this title shines. The combat against zombies is fun and fairly relaxing, there's a good variety of them to keep things interesting. Grenade zombies early on are annoying until you learn to prioritize them, banshees are mostly a distraction from hordes, Minikin clones are pretty average ranged dudes, the chainsaw zombie is tanky as hell, Pain Lenders are basically beefed up Minikins, and the gatling gun dudes hurt!The firearms in this game I felt were awkward and not very impactful (I only used revolvers, assault rifles and sniper rifles.) The animations for them were very average, they were mostly outclassed the bow and melee anyways. The bow feels incredible in this game, huge damage, lots of ammo, accurate and not very slow. It's a powerhouse and bar-none the best weapon in the game. It's biggest flaw is the lag of crowd control, which the Ultimate variant, the Rocketeer, fixes, adding penetration.The explosive weapons in this game are pretty much useless, a full upgraded Mythic 24 M79 won't even one shot zombies on Hell difficulty, barely doing so in Nightmare. Crossbows are just grenade launchers with more ammo pool and slower reloads.My biggest issue with the weapons in this game is there is some light auto-aim that you cannot turn off. Sometimes my shots to the head would curve into the chest of my enemy, or a complete miss would just go into their head. It's very inconsistant.Story in this game is incredibly bland, I didn't follow it after about a quarter way through, and none of the twists were surprising at all. Do not pick this title up for the story.I actually didn't even complete the story until my last 3 hours of play, there is justso much to doon the side. There is a lot of game modes, around eight! They're quite fun, side-tasks are fun to complete, so is ranking up weapon proficiency. My biggest gripe is the crafting. It's done through side-tasks and ins clunky as hell! You only need to do it enough to get full custom armor, some codexes and your ultimate weapon.Abilities in this game are largely useless, you have a few good ones like Giga Shot that gives you around 4x damage, a shield, slo-mo, and more damage.Multiplayer is pretty basic co-op, enemies sort of scale with the number of players ala Killing Floor, and it's all co-op, this game is an absolute blast to play with other people! Co-op is up to 3 players.TL;DR: Graphics are okay, performance could be better, gameplay is great, the bow feels amazing, 3 player co-op, story is pretty boring and cookiecutter, voice acting is god awful, a ton of modes to play aside from main story.Overall - The game is very fun and fairly addictive, I'd go as far to say pick this up at full price if you like loot based shooters, if you see this title at half off or even less, don't hesitate! It's a great game!"
,Recommended,394760,30679124,Posted: 22 March,all,TEKnowledgy,"Not bad little game I actually quiete enjoy it. Don't expect a triple A title you probably wont find that.Weapons upgrading and veriety is pretty good kinda reminds me of hellgate london weapons (not the upgrading system though just rarity system and veriety) Implant and armor upgrades systems are fine they serve there purpose think of any RPG game on stat stuff you know what to expect.Taking my time 6.7hrs into game bout 35% through main story missions but there is alot one can do that isn't directly tied to story survival modes couple other modes with different rules and enemy types and objectives plenty of side missions ranging from killing set number of enemies with weapons to certain set number of specific enemies. Some of these missions reward you with perma bonuses to your char be it decreasing prices of upgrades to adding perma  bonus damage to weapons.You'll have plenty steam achievments to the game has 177 total to unlock so if you like doing them I'm sure that would keep one busy for awhile lol.Overall I'll personally give it a 7/10 I've played better but I've played far worse.Hoping to get some co-op going soon so after I give it a go I'll update my review.I gave $3.59 for it and so far i don't regret it.  i'd even give $10 for it $15 idk depends alot better for $15 out there.Finally got some co-op in with a friend.rewards no matter who hosts higher or lower level will still match your level including any loots and money bonuses you pick up will all be scaled on your level so thats a good thing.All preset loots on map is shared so if you found a money stash hollar at ya buddy he/she can loot it aswell. So it all equal on terms like that also ammo pick ups also shared. Only thing may not be equal is the RNG loots which is fine and makes perfect sense.Overall this game is fun to play even funner with some friends co-op is 3 player only so keep that in mind and getting into co-op is little tricky until you learn it.This developer forum post was invaluable to understanding how to get into co-op.https://steamcommunity.com/app/394760/discussions/0/412447331646891466/Also I want to throw this out there as game options don't have a settable key for it.

This is a $10 - $20 game, depending on whether you get it on sale or not, it's easily got a good 20 hours of gameplay if you play through the story and numerous other modes it has.   It appears to be ported from a tablet game, but it still supporters directx9 at least.  The graphics won't knock you off your feat, but they are good enough and get the job done.   The major setback the game has, is a very weak ending.  It just says thanks for supporting us and you get a few more lines of dialog from the NPC's.   The story is but one part of the game though.This game has a similar setting to dead space, but plays more like a single player killing floor if killing floor was ported.  It has a level system with skills to advance and weapons also have levels as well as customization abilities.   You can pick enegry weapons, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and a few others.   YOu can then level them up and customize the weapons.    There is also an armor system, same applies with customizations.  Then there are augments you can also install and customize.   The game really has a lot of customization.There are several game modes.  Story is the campaign, it's decent, but has a weak ending.  There's survival where you have to survive for usually 6 minutes as the game throws hundreds of zombies at you.  There's biohazard where you have to survive 5 waves of zombies.   There's infestation, lone wolf, and generic, which all tend to be objective based missions.  There's a lot to do here, it'll take you between 15 - 20 hours to beat all the missions.There's supposed to be a co-op aspect to this game but I have not tested that, single player, I enjoyed every one of the 15 hours I played this."
,Not Recommended,394760,23024060,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Revisor,"I was very positively surprised by Dead Effect 1 and I bought Dead Effect 2 shortly after release. As it stands now, the game has too many flaws and I cannot recommend it.Cons:- The biggest flaw is the wrong hit detection. Whatever goes on under the hood, many shots and swings feel like they should hit but they miss. This is unfortunately applicable for both shooting and melee combat, but amplified for shooting because of the strange ballistics model. All shots are very slow, kind of like darts, so you have to lead the shot even when shooting for a short distance (10m). Hit detection is the one thing that a FPS should get right, and DE2 unfortunately doesn't.- There are technical problems. The game stutters from time to time and sometimes there is a lag between your shot landing and the zombie body reacting - eg. you shoot the zombie in the head and half a second later the head explodes. These problems are intermittent and hard to reproduce but when they appear, they're very annoying.- HUD and the whole UI is clearly created for mobile/touch devices and not changed for the PC release. In-game menus are a mess of horizontal scrolling and unclear buttons. Sometimes the button ""Back"" will return you to a previous menu, sometimes it boots you out of the menu altogether.- The art design is horrible and completely relies on huge contrast, oversaturation and heavy postprocessing. The amount of bloom and lens flare makes it seem like you look through the cheapest and worse camera ever made. The postprocessing can be luckily toned down, the oversaturation and contrast cannot.- The leveling and loot aspects are badly thought out. The level cap is 20 and the level of a gun is its most important number. The levels come very fast, which means that you shouldn't invest in any gear until you're level 20, because you outlevel all lower lvl weapons and armor during the next mission. Once you hit level 20, it's just a game of chance until you get the highest rarity gear - ""Mythical"". The rarities however are a complete joke, because mythical gear drops as often as regular one, which means in two or three matches you have everything you need. To summarize: The loot is quickly obsolete until you reach the maximum level and after you reach it it takes you about 60 minutes to get max rarity+max lvl gear.- The story might be interesting, but most of it is hidden in datapads, small black, almost invisible tablets. The rest is told through the most atrocious voice acting I have heard in a game.Pros:- Many weapons have a good feel. The melee swings feel heavy, machine guns and shotguns have meaty sound effects and proper impact, sniper rifles tear everything apart.- There is a good game hidden in there somewhere, but right now it's too deep.I recommend Dead Effect 1 instead."

Graphics are much more polished, missions are more enjoyable, overall much more fun is to be had.  The addition of armor / implants and upgrades makes me REALLY want to go back through and get all the things.  The upgrade system is VERY well done, and the inclusion of CO-OP means hours of fun for me and my buddies.  This is (from what I can tell) 4 times (or more) larger than the orginal DE, and by that I mean more content and bigger missions.However, there is a con that somehow carried over from the first game: the characters talk way too much.  I understand needing to have the story (I'm a story♥♥♥♥♥ myself...) but these characters LITERALLY never shut up.  Luckily the dialogue is skippable and you can turn voice volume down, but it can be a bit of a distraction at times.Overall:  very fun, very co-op friendly, very addictive gameplay!

Gun balance, honestly I do like the fact that the dev has made melee play somewhat rewarding, however this should not be at the cost of a gun user's experience. This is yet another example of why (RPG-ifying) accuracy is a bad idea unless excuted WITHIN appopriate boundaries. When operating a weapon it leaves a bad taste in one's mouth when having to deal with the fustration for the few hours of the game making me feel as if I'm on a ship floating around in water. I understand that adding a large margin to create a better sensation of progress, but it does need to be tuned down somewhat.INCLUDE ACTION INTERRUPTION. Please, I understand that this is early access, however being animation locked into reloading in a FPS (Especially with some animations being so slow, here's looking at you shotgun.) is a very uncomfortable and irritating experience.All in all, this game certainly seems like it could be a good one as the promise is there."

Dead Effect 2 was released on Android and Iphones late last year, and now we have a ""premium"" version on PC, so to speak. I spend only a little time playing the android version, mostly because I can't aim with thumbsticks even if my life depended on it, so I can't say too much about the differences. What I can say is that once again, the developers removed all the microtransactions (Thank god for that!) and this time around they really have pushed the Unity engine.Yes, the game uses Unity 5 but you couldn't tell that just by looking at the gameplay or screenshots. The textures look really sharp, it has all the bells and whistles from depth of field to SSAO to bloom. It really doesn't look like the same game that I have on my Samsung S4 Active and that I played for few hours before giving up.The gameplayitself is a mix of FPS and RPG (Think System Shock) and loot hunting like in Borderlands or Diablo. Each weapon comes in Common, Regular, Treasured, Legendary and Mythical ranks. With Common being the lowest and Mythical the highest. They also come in different levels and flavours, with option to upgrade the damage, reload speed, accuricy, magazine and add slots for ""enchantments"". The same is true for implants and armor, with armor also having sets that give bonuses with more parts of the set equipped.There are three classes in the game, each with their own class skills. And although the Jane for example is an ""assault"" class the game doesn't restrict you from using equipment based on the class.On top of the story missions (At the time of writing the EA version has 9 and the developers have stated there will be 20 by the time the game is released) the game also features ""Generic Missions"", that range from fetch missions to NPC protections to hacking. Biohazard pits you against increasingly hard waves of enemies. In Survival you need to survive for given time and Lone Wolf missions at the time of writing make you get through soldiers and activate consoles, after which you need to survive an enemy assault.From missions you gain XP, loot and credits, that you can use to buy new equipment or upgrade to old ones.I haven't tried the coop, so I won't comment on that. Although on the forums people have stated that the coop mode causes FPS drops by the time of writing.So would I recommend the game?If you liked original Dead Effect, this one is bigger and better. Much better. For people who haven't tried Dead Effect, you might want to read some more reviews, but take note that on ""teh interwebs"" most reviews are of the mobile phone version.Personally I'm loving it. Sure, it's missing content, but for me it runs flawlessly and it's in early access. And the gameplay is addicting as heck. I have tried to hunt for bugs but the worst one I have found was enemy spawning inside a tank and had to be killed by shooting it's legs. And that happened twice. During 18 hours of gameplay. Pretty damn good for a game that has been in early access for less than 48 hours if you ask me.The developers also are really active on the forums and are working on the first patch already, so I can see the full game coming out ""before the summer"" as the developers have intended."

The most notable one i have noticed is the campaign feels more than go from one area to the next. There are upgradeable abilities and weapons, something the first game didn't have.

Here is my take of the game so far (Take it with a grain of salt)Pros/Cons+I could see this being something I could sink some hours into at a time. I don't get tired of it quickly+Does have some replay value in the singleplayer, since there are different abilities and specs, etc.+Decent graphics, but not eye candy+A few charming characters (looking at Minikin)+Many types of weapons to choose from+Many different gears/implants+Diverse hacking minigames, actually enjoyed them. Some games make hacking consoles a chore+/- Alright upgrade system. Would love to see customizability, rather than just paying to increase stats+/-Enemies seem somewhat stale, and seem to have little character: basic zombie, evil soldier-y type guy, demon thingy, etc.+/-The voice acting is pretty bad. The only reason I dont find this as a con is that it's quite amusing to hear the poorly done stereotypical accents, etc+/-Not sure why Danette's nipples need to be poking through her shirt. Just a thought.-You feel sluggish in this game. The low movement speed paired with the very limited sprint time makes you feel like you're walking through honey or molasses-Poor level design in some areas makes it difficult to figure out where to go-The above problem mixed with the fact that the follow markers aren't really guiding you, but redundantly saying ""you're in the right spot"" when theres the only exit in the area.-The only voice acting that makes me want to stop playing is Dr. Bielik. Why. Oh God why. Why it's neccessary to make it so he sounds like the most stereotypically eastern european accent is beyond me.-As stated by many people, it seems like it's some kind of obscure movie that REALLY wanted to be a movie, but couldn't get funding so they just kinda used the movie aspects and turned it into a game.All in all, if it's on sale don't hesitate to pick it up. If it's full price maybe consider waiting."

He actually got into position behind me when an enemy showed up, so it wasn't me getting in his way, rather it was him putting me in his way.)- Though the models for enemies look alright, their attacks and movement look rather cheesy- When you approach NPCs, though they'll look in your direction, the camera is much lower than their face making it appear as if their are staring into an endless void- Can't jump (Probably to prevent the player from getting to certain areas, but still...)- Puzzles to open doors can be quite annoying.- The game constantly hands out legendary and mythic items to you so acquiring them never feels special. (for some reason it also ranks normal items like max ammo packs as lengendary and mythic)- What you're supposed to be doing or where you're supposed to be going isn't always clear when doing missions- Feels overall like an extremely generic shooterPros- Good game for when you feel like playing something where the only focus is on shooting up zombies. This is exactly what I was looking for, and is the only reason for which I will occasionally play this game.- Lots of weapons- Plenty of achievements- The music isn't too badI believe the game attempts to parody multiple games (Mass Effect and generic zombie shooters?) but it simply falls flat on its face in trying to do so. Designing the game as if it were a B-rated movie sounds as if it would be comical, though unfortunately the joke does better as being just that and not being represented by an actual game.I would only reccommend getting this game if it is on sale and you want it for the same reason I stated in the 'Pros' list. Buying it for any other reason will likely leave you very dissapointed."

The story is, as many people said, B-series worthy. That said, who play zombie games like this one for the story ?The accuracy system is a bit strange but you can overcome it quickly with the implants of your characters. The weapons selection is pretty wide. Want to use a shotgun ? Want to use a sniper rifle ? Want to use brass knuckles ? Want to use a laser rifle ? Want to use the goddamn Mjollnir ? Damn right you can. Upgrading the weapons costs quite a lot at the end but considering how much money you'll earn in the mission at the end, you'll be able to afford it. And like in all games, each weapon has a situation in which it is more useful.I saw some people saying that you can't access the weapons, gears, implants and abilities menus without talking to a NPC. That is false. You'll be able to access weapons, gear and implants through two consoles in the hub after a while or in the multiplayer lobby directly. In single player, you'll have to speak with a NPC to access your abilities unfortunately but you'll be able to access it directly in the multiplayer lobby.The regular zombies aren't anything amazing but the special zombies can be incredibly frustrating (I'm looking at you, TNT dealer). Bosses aren't incredibly hard but they deal quite a load of damage even with the best gear possible.Amongst the soldiers you'll find ninjas after a while and they strike hard but you can usually kill them in one shot.What pains me the most is how crap is the online stability, suddenly dropping your fps from 70-80 to 5-10 and simulteanously increasing your latency from 15ms to 700ms for no reason.Overrall:Long story short, 7.5/10. Defo not GOTY but not as bad as most of the negative reviews claim it is. It's an enjoyable game, alone or with friends. Story is full of cheese though."

So the first levels are more like an introduction tutorial.This is a great zombiegame in general and Its more like classical zombiegames and it does not follow down the same DayZ path as many other early access zombiegames.There is alot of blood and gore and its satisfying killing the zombies.The story is a bit deeper this time since you get to meet characters this time around.The voices of some the characters sound pretty silly.

The main story is only a few hours long but the amount of side missions and challenges def fills in the time blanks. Building up your weapon arsenal is where at least the real fun for me is.......running through a mission with a sub machine gun is a completely different animal than switching to say a shotgun or bow.......This is by no means a AAA 60 dollar game......but for the 12 bucks theyre asking  I can def say Ive paid more for way less in the past."

Yes, there are plenty of ""loser PC games"" but this isn't one of them. You know up front that DE2 is an FPS, RPG, and an Indie--and dirt cheap when on sale. Personally I think this game is worth full price, and an absolute steal on sale.DE2 follows a tried and true formula and it works. If you played the original DE, this picks up immediately after it but stands on it's own with some back-story exposition. You'll find DE2 made a lot of improvements, especially in customization. The graphics are gorgeous and surprisingly atmospheric. Game play is very smooth and the controls are straightforward and remappable. The story line is good, you can get as involved as you want or just ignore it.On the downside, the AI is somewhat rudimentary and the voice acting is not great--Bielek and Miniken are goofy stereotypes and as player you are prone to some ignorant and inappropriate comments. But I'm sure it's done for laughs and to keep some elements of the game light.I haven't tried multiplayer yet but looking forward to it. There's nothing revolutionary here, but there's a lot to offer. Good old-fashioned seek and shoot fun!"

The ""big end scene""  is a text screen.But the game mechanics, the gunplay, weapons and movement (no jumping though) are fun and well implemented.Graphics aren't outstanding in any way, but certainly good enough and sometimes even pretty.Basically this game is ideally suited as ""the game you play when you get home from work and just want to relax a bit by shooting things without much thinking"". I have played it as that for about 24h and have now completed it. I don't think I will replay it, but it was fun while it lasted.This is certainly no ""A"" title, but I had a lot of fun with it.

,Recommended,394760,26525016,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,JamesMcNasty,"So. This game is not what I would call ""good."" The graphics are sub-par, and the inventory and progression systems are clunky. The voice acting is literally laughable. There is a character that sounds like the voice actor couldn't choose between a Russian or Polish accent, so he decided to just get really drunk and wing it. I couldn't say anything really about the story, because after the first two lines of dialogue I skipped every subsequent line as fast as I could hit the A button.But, god DAMN is this game fun. Have you ever genuinely enjoyed something you knew was terrible? Liking this game kind of feels like hearing a song you're really feeling on the radio only to find out its Nickelback. You know you should hate it, and you don't want anyone to know your true feelings, but you still throw it on the playlist late at night and hum along.The gunplay is solid. The upgrades are fantastic. You have guns, gear, equipment, mods, and all of them are upgradabeable or slottable in some way. It really scratches that RPG level-up itch. The missions are varied enough to allow for something that feels fresh almost every time you jump in.Playing this game is like popping a pimple. It isn't pretty, and it's not something you are necessarily proud of; but when everything lines up just right and you get that last shot off, you just feel so satisfied.I recommend it."

,Recommended,394760,29373110,Posted: 20 January,all,Itchybum,"First of all i want to clearly state i only recommend this game if you can get it dirt cheap like i did during a sale. Paid about 3€. Anything over 5 and just don't bother what so ever.So for what i paid i got a super generic zombie blaster that was a mobile game ported to pc. The gameplay is ok and the graphics are slightly better than an old 8 bit game. But blowing up zombies and completing challenges is sorta fun to me and the game delivered that.The story/campaign is a total dumpsterfire fueled by horrible voice acting and not much of a coherent story other than something is gonna happen in the distant future and none of it will happen in this game.Sound is at times just terrible and the rest of the time not entirely driving you up the walls. It adds nothing to the atmosphere and is at it's best just annoying unless you turn the volume way down.The weapons are not very diverse although you do get a melee class to choose from at the start. but in reality only a few weapons are actually viable in this game and the upgrade system is super symplistic and does not change the look of weapons at all.So buy this only if you're looking for some mindless zombie blasting, and only if you can get it dirt cheap. It's not the worst game ever but it's certainly not worth the full price."

Most of the enemies move slowly too(no, thats not frame drop, its just SLOW). In fact there are times when you feel like you're playing in slow motion at 60fps. Its wierd to see some robo-zombie-dog-thing ever so slowly ""running"" at you. Theres no tension or sense of urgency, unless theres gun weilding enemies in the room, then your greatest challenge is overcoming the spotty hit detection(they have no such issues and NEVER miss a shot). Sadly, this dev managed to make firefights on a zombie infested spaceship boring.Graphics are good. Yay for dem graphix. Everything else is just boring. The bannana clip on the starter machine gun has about 4 polygons, its oddly low poly for an fps. Theres a level system in place as well as some sort of loot system but even that is dreadfully dull. You get special abilities that activate iin slow motion, as if the game doesn't move slowly enough. I got some new armor recently but still haven't located a menu that would let me equip it or see my character. I've never played a shooter that was this dull. You don't get any inclination as to where you are, it's just ""generic metal spaceship room 142 with crates"".I think theres a story but I'm pretty sure I blacked out from bordedom. This feels like a free to play game in Alpha that I paid for. Stay away, there are much better zombie/space games out there.EDIT: So, theres loot and upgrades... you just can't access any of it while in a mission. I could understand that if these items had to be crafted, but they don't, you just have to wait to equip them...??? Character speed has to be upgraded. I mean, if you're really into grinding, I guess you could level a character to the point when it feels you're moving normally, I just don't see why you need bionic upgrades to move the same speed as a normal human being.Apparently, if you die, you have to pay for a respawn with in game currency. In a single player game that is not F2P. WHY? So many odd design choices completely drown out the potential here.It kinda picks up by the 4th mission. Kind of."

,Recommended,394760,30689526,Posted: 23 March,all,Ducain,"I was surprised how much I liked this game!For some reason, this game reminds me a little bit of the Alien Breed series (even though that’s a top-down shooter about killing aliens).  The story is plenty and good enough to drive the action without being bad (glad they have voice acting, and the characters are interesting).  You blast zombies, marines, and mutants (lots of different movement and threat types too which is great) while taking many missions from a hub base where you upgrade your gear, rest, talk to the characters, and plan/pick your next mission (plenty of side modes and whatnot to mix it up during single player too, if you like).It’s an Indie developer, yet they do lots of things that even AAA tend to screw up, which is awesome.  Just ONE example of their design choices that really keep the game interesting (there are plenty of other examples):Interacting with objects (and some doors, not all luckily) is interesting:  some are little simple puzzles, some you bash in with key spam, some you have to circle swipe around for a valve, one where you just click and hold to show fingerprint and it shows your combat stats, instead of just boring PUSH E BUTTON TO INTERACT.Some thoughts for Dead Effect 3 just in case devs read this (which will go on my list as soon as I see it):Needs a melee attack not reliant on having a melee weapon (or just see my next point and always let single player pick a melee weapon).Single player needs access to more than 2 weapons and more than 2 abilities, if they wanted to keep it limited to few weapons in multiplayer, that’s fine, but it would be a lot cooler, fun, and interesting being able to switch to different weapons.  There are TONS of cool abilities and weapons, but you can’t really focus on them because they have gaping limitations (which I’m sure works great in multiplayer, but makes single player much, much less interesting).  For instance, on the final boss, it would have been more fun of a fight if I had a grenade launcher, or those exploding arrows, or even a shotgun to swap out.  But since I had full upgraded an assault rifle for my weapon, I guess I have left the level, buy a different weapon, and then go back in, bu tthat just doesn’t feel like an interesting decision (especially since all I did was just circle strafe around the boss with my weapon and he died pretty quickly, but that’s the only thing that was really effective, because I get hit as soon as I peek out to start peppering him).  Long story short, it’s much more fun of a game with more than 2 weapons.Don’t get me wrong, this game has satisfying head-shot explosions, and most of the zombies react great to the weapons fire.  However, sometimes enemy reactions to weapons are weird.  The marines you fight seem to be able to aim perfectly through my peppering of them with gunfire (unless it’s a head-shot, and then they definitely stop shooting).  Also, for some of the larger enemies, it seems head-shots or aimed shots just seem to hit them in the body and don’t do that much more damage (you’ll be aiming at their head and you see blood spurt out of their chest)?  I’m not sure, but it seems a lot different than how the other monsters react (maybe that’s by design so that they are bullet sponges)."

Somehow it's grown on me despite it's many flaws.Pointless minigames is one of the flaws that nearly stopped me from playing this game.  I don't understand why these minigames are even included--it makes no sense to me!  If you need to turn a valve you have to click and spin your mouse around.  If you need to unlock certain doors you have to spin pieces around like in Skyrim (except there's no matching).  Other doors have to be ""hacked"" which require basic math skills.  The most annoying minigame involves changing waves.  I just don't understand why these things are here.  It's like interrupting the game so players have to listen to some boring speech, like the time this Turkish dude was telling me the real native Americans were actually Turks.  Maybe I'll make a fast paced FPS someday and force you all to listen to his lectures.The story is not even b movie level, but it beats the Turkindian theorem, and there are some amusing moments.  I am not really playing for the story anyway.  By the way, there's no real end, it's one of those ""to be continued"" stories.I've seen complaints about the graphics, but I really don't have a problem.  They're fine, except some of the character models look a bit odd, with the exception of miss pointy♥♥♥♥♥♥  Well, the points, anyway.  Face looks odd.This game is basically a FPS Diablo.  There is a bunch of loot you can snag and upgrade, which you constantly have to do.  Unlike many FPS games you can't finish the game with the weapons you start with.  You'll be ditching your first weapons pretty quick, for shinier ones.  I never really cared for leveling enemies this way, as it just seems lazy.Aside from the campaign, there are various side quests and other missions you can complete to snag more loot and xp.  This adds a lot of replay value to the game.There are different kinds of zombies and monsters, which add a nice variety.  You are basically dealing with a story involving genetic experimentation, so some of the monsters are a bit out there.There are a lot of things I wish were different about this game, but like I  said, it somehow grew on me.  I think for the sale price, it's more than worth it.  When I first saw the opening video for the game I was psyched.  I was hoping it would be like some mix of Dead Space and Mass Effect.  It's not.  Not even close.  It wasn't the game I was expecting, but it is fun.  I hope the developers ask for feedback from fans for their next project."

Now that doesn't mean Dead Effect 2 is not without its flaws but then again even AAA games have those.The question is do those flaws totally out do the pros and ruin the game? Well for me they thankfully didn't but we're all different so I can't say they won't for some.Its a solid game for the money asked and probably a steal if you get it on sale for even cheaper.TLDRLets dive into more details.Pros:+ The Sci-Fi setting puts a slightly new spin on well used Zombie FPS genre.+ Flexible play style (no matter which of the 3 characters you chose you can ultimately use whatever weapon types you want).+ A impressive amount of weapons and weapon types (Katanas, Chainsaws, Broadswords, Compact Bows, Plasma rifles, Miniguns, Gernade Launchers, pump-action and double barrel shotguns, Magnums, Axes, Baseball bats, Semi auto pistols, Explosive Crossbows, Sniper Rifles, Assault Rifles, Arc Guns, Machetes, Saw Blade Launchers, Gatling Lasers, Thor's Hammer, Chemical Launchers, The huge battle hammer from Halo, and thats just what I've come across so far there might even more that I've yet to come accross).+ Various stat boosting armor pieces and implants for your cybernetic body.+ A item rarity system no doubt inspired by Borderlands, which makes looting and item purchasing all the more fun.+ All armor, implants and weapons can be upgraded and have bonus stats installed into them for extra awesomeness.+ Enemies scale with you so game is always a challange even when you rerun older levels.+ A healthy selection of abilities that you can unlock as you level up. You can switch and swap them out as you please to give you give you whatever special edge in combat you like, be it bullet time, mind control, stasis fields, massive area attacks, etc.+ Fair amount of story missions (for a Indie game) along with a respectable amount of side modes ranging from clearing out Zombie hordes from certian maps survivng a set amount of waves to name a few. Almost all of the modes can be played Co-op.+ A decent amount of various enemy types, ranging from your standard shuffling Zombies to hulking mutants with heavy weapons. On top of the Zombies and monster types you also have to deal with human foes ranging from your standard assualt rifle grunt to fast stealth ninjas.+ Hidden items that can make exploring each map fully more worth while.+ The music is surprisingly well done and is set up masterfully to seem perfectly in place for areas and events.+ Has controler support.Cons- If you play the story only, don't back track and take no detours to level up or farm for more items the game can rather short. (Though keep in mind this is a indie game not a huge budget project so you shouldn't be expecting some epic 100+ hour saga anyway)- If you're not a loot fiend the game might get dull and the need to sporadically get newer gear might get annoying.- Enemy AI isn't best, even human enemies can be some what predictable. (once again this is a Indie game so you shouldn't expect top tier right off the bat).- Missions some times feel repetitive.- Not being able to detect Gernades tossed by Zombies till they are about to blow can get annoying, and can lead to game essentially getting some cheap deaths out of you.Neutral-+ The voice acting isn't gonna win any awards and the dialog can be cheesy at times but its not nearly as bad as some of the reviews are making it out to be. Some of its actually rather witty (in a B-movie sort of way) Though to be fair I play as Kay (he sounds like a gruff, grumpy Jet-Li with sarcastic tendancies, priceless imo) not Davis (the supposid legit main character) so maybe Davis's voice actor was just horrid, I can't say.-+ The plot is a bit cliche but not enough to ruin the game.All and all its good game, I've sunk 20 hours into the game and haven't even beaten it yet, mainly due to loot and side modes being so much fun. Dead Effect 2 is a great time killer and you'd be hard pressed to find a more deverse Co-op Zombie Shooter with as many weapons and skills as it offers.9/10 (If I find a light saber its getting a solid 10)"

But it still has some issues.Plenty of guns to use, but most seem outshined once you get a decent melee weapon. I beat the entire game but the difficulty spiked way too fast. Enemies that once went down fairly easy with a strong gun, suddenly take entire clips to the head to put down, forcing me to use a 160,000 damage machete.The human soldiers seem really unbalanced in strength, they deal so much damage but take so much too, even in headshots.If they balanced the enemy levels a bit where completing a few loves didn't make the new guns you just got trash. Other than than enemy leveling, it is fine.The weapons are decent, and plenty to use, the melee can be useful(though Thor's Hammer has a bug where if you don't swing it, it vanishes.)The special skills are useful, though I heard everyone uses different skills, I only used Gunnar so far. Upgrading isn't a grindfest because you can sell your loot for good money if you play on higher difficulties."

If you've played the first game then you know what to expect from this one. The graphics, though not great, aren't half bad and there's a vast amount of armor/weapon types and upgrades to acquire this time around. These all have various stats and rarity designations, such as legendary and mythic, so that's pretty cool.  And just like the last outing, don't expect much from the story as there isn't much of one. However, the voice acting is top notch too.....nah, I'm just kidding. It's actually pretty horrid. Basically only 1 character has decent voice acting and that's Danette.Now to finish this review up I'll go into a brief description of the characters:THE PLAYER CHARACTER: (there are 3, 2 guys and 1 woman to choose from - I went with Kay so that's who I'll describe). Kay is a berserker type class so he likes him some melee action. Also, he quite possibly has some of the most craptastic voice acting in the game as he sounds like he's trying to be a cross of a video game version of John Wick and Solid Snake.MINIKIN: he's a dumb engie and I literally mean dumb. Something is wrong with his neurological functioning so he talks like a caveman but that's ok. Also, when you initially acquire his services in the game he says ""f*** science"".BIELIK: He's a scientist and a total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nozzle that's waaaaaaaay too Russian (don't know if the voice actor actually is Russian or just a dude trying to sound Russian - whoever you are, if you are Russian I'm sorry...)DANETTE: She's basically the brains of the operation and she has nice boobs. Any other qualities that she may have really don't matter....just her boobs...............and I guess the fact that she has brains..............................maybe   :DSo that just about sums this game up. Lots of achievements and they're pretty quick and easy to unlock and when this game goes on sale for less than $4 that's also a plus in my book. If you liked the first one then you should like this one too."

They made it clear if they were reviewed harshly then they wouldn't come back. Apparently it's a crime to not want to return to someone who didn't like your product. So for all the whiny children who didn't bother to think about it and are down voting this game, do us all a favor and do some research on the subject or keep your misinformed opinion to yourself.On to the actual review, since that's what this is ♥♥♥♥ing for.Dead effect 2 is a first person shooter with leveling, loot systems, and zombies. Yeah that's a heck of a bundle. It's kind of like dead island, but good. The long and short of it is humans go into space and perform a ton of science with no budget or moral restrictions, cuz that couldn't end badly.You play as one of three characters. Not a huge difference aside from personality. Which they do have. Gunnar, who is basically sarge from RVB or your standard gun happy sergeant type character. Constantly makes passes at your quest giver/commander type chick. Who's got some serious nippage going on btw. Oh and there's a hodor type character who's awesome.This game gets props for having the single worst Russian impression I've ever heard in my entire life. That's an experience in its own right. It's so bad that it's genuinely a bonus to this game.The gunplay is... well it's kind of in between good and bad. The guns all sound good so far but there's a couple types that I personally find to be pretty worthless. The game does get big bonus points for having military grade baseball bats.Loot system is generous enough that you'll be getting good gear fairly regularly without needing to grind for hours to get a good weapon. But you can do so if you want.This game has not 1 but 6 different modes of playing side missions with 6 difficulties. And the loot gets better with each difficulty. So crank it if you want the good♥♥♥♥♥♥ Or turn it down if you want to feel like the super human bad♥♥♥♥♥you are.This game is a definite recommendation from me. I'm not going to give it a rating because I don't care about that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is it good or not, keep it simple. And this game is good. It really is. The art feels like a mix of doom and deadspace but doesn't lean on either too heavily. The guns are actually fun to use despite the jank. And it's one of those games that unity should be proud to show off, because this game is built with unity and man it's the single best one I've seen yet."

Yeah I know it's early access but to pay £12 for a part story and I have no doubt we will be paying for the updates, is a bit of a let down to what is a good game.I still would recommend this game.

I had to mess around with Sensitivity, Smoothing and Acceleration to make it playable. Initially zeroed the acceleration and smoothing and lowered sensitivity: really uncomfortable. Then played around with acceleration and smoothing: umplayable. Added a bit of sensitivity as mouse was moving fast when I moved it slow, and was moving slow when I moved it fast: aim was jumping around the place: unplayable. Then ended up minimizing the sensitivity, acceleration and smoothing: really uncomfortable. I think its the game engine problem, really feels like Unity? The same one that Rust has?- The map really has a lot of reflections, flashy lights etc, but doesnt have this real environmental feeling to it.- NPC models looked like I was playing Half Life 2 again.All in all, this game can be good with its RPG element, different items with upgradable stats etc. I wish they remade the game with a proper engine, to run smooth, great controls and so on..... this could be really great..."

I have never played Dead Effect, but as I read different info, saw the pictures in the store I had a feeling this may be the FPS I have been searching for all my life. Sure enough IT WAS!!! It isn't even don't yet? Really? Well let me get down to it.This game basiclly takes RPG, and FPS brings them together for some pretty interesting gameplay. Weapons are not class locked so even if you don't choose the sword guy you can still go sword crazy with Gunnar even though he starts with a pistol you can just buy a sword later on. Your character will have armor, implants, and upgrades for those armor parts, and implants. You weapons can be upgraded, and have special upgrade items added to them nothing like scopes just like ""more accuracy"" or abunch of items along those lines for all weapons, and armor. So far I have yet to notice if armor effects appearance at this point I don't think so, but would be cool if it did.Co-op is something I haven't tried yet as I have no one to play with, and haven't found any games to join yet.Combat is interesting. Enemies have patterns you can work with. Melee combat can get interesting if you know what are you doing before hand. For example cyber-dogs are fun to fight because you can move in with a heavy attack (right mouse click), and move back quickly after each strike to dodge their attack. I even challenge myself by increasing difficulty to Hell which btw will increase enemy levels.Levels are interesting bit of game changers. Weak weapons are worthless. Always buy better weapons until you get a level 4-5 weapons with which you can upgrade and play around with to make as good as a level 8 weapons. I found you want to build up wealth over time to get better, and better gear. Why? Because the shop keeps changing out its items to some times include legendary, and mythical items with insane prices that make you want to cry when you don't have the money for it. You can get lucky with drops. I once got a legendary shotgun fighting off zombies.Rarity only means more bonuses nothing much outside of that it seems. It is always best to get the highest rarity you can get your hands on. Unless weapons are involved. Then it is a matter of ""Can I use this?"" Because let me just say some weapons are strange, and difficult to use. I had this plasma laser once and it was awful. Had to hold the fire button to charge it up like a mini-gun then it just unleashes a laser of DOOM on your enemies. Problem is it FILLS THE SCREEN, and makes it so difficult to aim that you just end up waving the laser around, wasting ammo, and probably looking stupid to all the delta soldiers in the process.Game saving is interesting. You save the moment you return to the resistance base. Everything you do is saved. So there is no shut off game to avoid things. If you screw up you screw up no take back. All missions can be repeated, and have their difficulty increased. All missions have bonuses to give other rewards. All missions have at least 4 achievements related to each. There are alot of missions. You may find yourself playing many hours of this to beat this game if your playing alone. I am playing alone, and just barely managed level 4 where you have to get the crystal made. Nearly died from impalement by a boss that throws spiked clubs at you, and a TNT throwing zombie... which might I ask... WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TNT ON IN THIS PLACE!? Also how is a zombie lighting TNT to toss at me? Wouldn't it make more sense if it were lobbing gernades at me?The only issue I came across was when starting the game the camera was really glide like, and fast. I had to pop open options drop all graphics to lowest possible, and fiddle witht he aim sensativity until it finally worked for me. Now I aim just fine.When it boils down to it. If yuur looking for a fun FPS to pass the time with THIS IS IT, and whatever it will become when early access is over will probably be the real game changer for everyone. I have a feeling it could be that game you can get into, and have fun with others. At this time you could invest in this game, and enjoy it now, or wait."

,Recommended,394760,21398993,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Miporin,"edit: typosedit2: update the graphic and gameplay partedit3: add more infoI am quite happy for what I get at this price, here's my initial thought after several minutes in;::: OverallThis tittle is an upgraded port, from its mobile-version, not a total remade for PC, so if you are jumping in expecting it to meet your average FPS standard for PC, you might be a bit disappointed.If you have played Dead Effect before, and like it. I am positive that you will find this to be a good improvement over the previous tittle.::: ControlsControls are still showing their origins. It's not bad for a port, though it could use some improvement as a PC game. There are several actions in the controls mapping that is, well, redundant for PC's KB/M, still, redundant is better than missing ;DFor controllers, maybe, though I don't think that I had use the quick-turn action before in any other FPS/TPS game, not on PC.The default mouse setting is kind of floaty, likes in mobile FPS games. Not in a bad way, but more on the preference. (too fast for me)These mappings/settings can be changed. You can remap all actions, change aim speed, mouse smoothing, mouse acceleration in the settings to suit your preference. It just that the default settings are kinds of weird.::: UIYeah, it is a mobile-port alright. UI may need some improvements if the devs are intended to make the game, the PC game.Currently, several UIs are big, really, too big, that it becomes annoyance, which is obviously a result from the game being on its previous platform, so, I feel that DEVs should improve this to be more suitable for PC as this tittle is intended the be a premium tittle for PC.I would love to see more options for the HUD, for example; toggle xhair, resizes hud elements, change colors, and etc.::: Graphic and FXImho, it looks nice and shiny with the improved graphic, compared to the original. The game comes with several settings to play with including ssao, and dof, which can be disable if you don't like it.Performance-wise, my current PC (i5-4650k, 8gb ram, 760gtx) can ultra it at 1080p with a little frame drops during recording. Although, it's start dropping to around 30 when things get messy, and so I choose to have more stable frames than the beauty by lower to high-ultra (still looking good).Currently, there is the weird performance problem when COOP, which can be found much less in SINGLE, dev already announced to fix it.However, there seems to be a problem concerning the graphic settings. When you try changing it mid-game, sometimes, it glitches the game, and must be restart to restore it.The stuttering can be horrible, not that it drops badly, but the drops cause the stuttering, which might be a result from how the engine handle it. On Ultra, my FPS are around 40-60, which shouldn't be a problem, normally.::: GameplayIt is a solid FPS, added a few RPG elements in, game. There are skills / weapons / equipments / upgrades / consumables. There is a currency system, with stores for each category.The game gears toward CASUAL shooter, however, the gunplays / bladeplays are satisfying. Guns are gun, not a toy. Melees are interesting to play with, and it is comparable with guns. Melee can be as effective as guns can be, imho, a little too OP.The game use the Hub system, where you come back to your hub after every mission to manage stuffs. and choose the mission to play when ready.There are 4 modes, which are Campaign / Free Mode / Wave-based Survival / Timed Survival. Each mission can be replayed later, and almost all of them can be played with friends.COOP play is, well, you play the game with friends, instead of playing it alone. There are not many aspect that require cooperation from other players. Currently, it just that you can play and kill things together as simple as that. you cannot trade/exchange, or interact with others.::: Current Statusas of the time writing this review, there are some core functions locked away from players. Player rank is max at 9 at the moment, The dev states that they are working/testing them, and will release more contents later on.Here is the opening missions gameplay. It's 1080p, downsampling to 720p at 60% quality.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756097::: TL;DRIt's a solid game for the price. If you have no problem with it being a mobile-port FPS/RPG, where you cannot jump across small obstacles or a robot-like animations. This tittle might interested you. The devs are working on the tittle, so if you are not ok with incomplete game, avoid this for now."

This plays like Unreal Tournament III, with zombies. Having a lot of fun with all the armor and weapon customization options, the addition of a Borderlands-style loot system really makes the game shine and keeps things from getting repetitive.Couple suggestions, if any of the devs are reading reviews...(1) Add models for the different armor sets in 3rd person. Some of the sets are fairly rare, and take a decent amount of work to get. It'd be nice to display them in coop.(2) Add a functional jump mechanic so you can leap over crawling zombies, and also hop barriers to get to lower walkways.(3) Add a 'lean out of cover' mechanic/animation for both the player AND for the Delta 13 soldiers. Nothing fancy, just something functional. Bind it to Q and E default. Secondly, add use of that mechanic as a separate AI package that the Delta 13 troops switch to when they are fighting the player, but not when they are fighting zombies. Their current package of smoothly advancing/crossing/firing between cover points makes perfect sense for fighting zombies, it's the most efficient and is the same thing that I do. However, that would never happen when fighting an opponent who also has firearms IRL, and these guys are supposed to be very highly trained, no? Have them fight from cover when engaging the player, and not move from it unless they've been flushed or flanked.(Update at 11 hours). Revolvers and sniper rifles are useless in current form. Could be cut from the game entirely, especially the revolvers. Firing rate is abysmal, heavy recoil. For coop, sure, you might want a sniper, but most of the rooms are too small for it.Melee is ok, but could use an overhaul. Too easy to get overwhelmed. This game plays best right now with the most powerful assault rifle you can afford and as many implants for recoil/accuracy as you can load. Headshot party.Other than that, so far this is great fun. Currenty playing with Gunnar, going to try a run with Jane to see if the mechanics feel different."

I mean, I felt so accomplished just clearing levels to 100%. Very satisfying.Now the devs are bringing us the sequel and I'm not going to lie, I was super damn excited. I was looking forward to a beefier experience than the first game, an actual story that implied more depth and reason than the first game, an upgrade system that let us customize our characters a little bit, and, my personal favorite and utmost want, a varied of characters and unique gear types for the various ""classes"". I just cannot tell you how much these inclusion meant to not only me but the overall community because FINALLY we're able to really delve deep and sink our teeth into the meat of our played characters.Let me be brutally honest: As it stands, this moment in EA, the game is amazing in theory and visual ideals but falls quite short in actual application. However, that being said, don't let that intimidate you or put you off this game! There are glitches, performance issues, and some horrible screen stretching and ability issues that make playing a little difficult at times but despite these problems, which the devs have been very upfront about and are hard at working optimizing and refining for us, the game is still a good play.If you're a fan of the first Dead Effect or just horror games that involve greedy corporations, science gone bad, horrifying abominations then you're going to enjoy Dead Effect 2.Besides, do you really want to deny yourself the opportunity to dive headfirst into a throng of rotting monstrosities with nothing but a wickedly tempered sword, frag grenades, a shotgun, and a smile?Of course not."

The handwave is that cloning is the reason enemies have only one appearance.What the game lacks in design, art direction, and creativity it makes up for through doing one thing very well: It is legitimately attempting to tell a story. A poorly translated, B movie grade story, but it has one. It explains that levelling exists because otherwise the strain will overload your nueral net and kill you; it makes you have to rescue NPC's before you can use the shops or menus; and it makes you do some pretty stupid things just to stay consistant.The resulting death-fest is dripping with character and visually if you ignore the lack of enemy variation it can end up looking fairly terryfing (As long as you aren't well versed enough in video games to recognize where they got the assets from)"

It would be one thing to satirize or parody a B-film, but this game has so many problems that I doubt this was the case.The voice acting is grating. The voice acting was actually a big reason why I didn't play as long as I probably should have before writing this review. Yes. It's THAT bad. (Made even worse if you choose to play as the female character).The shooting feels clunky. In early sections, I found myself taking shots at zombies' heads, with my aim PERFECTLY aligned in the middle of the head, only to have every shot miss. I was finally able to hit their heads after my moving my sights downwards more, towards their jaws/necks.I found some kind of electric gun thing that could shoot a couple of shots and then stopped. I would click again, and just get a 'beep' signalling I couldn't fire. I don't know why - the ammo counter said the weapon had infinite ammo, and there were no other visuals to indicate why the gun would stop firing. Apparently, there actually is an indicator, albeit a subtle one. The reticle fades to gray.Movement is PAINFULLY slow, even when sprinting.Menus can only be accessed via NPCs.The first NPC has her nipples showing through her shirt. Don't get me wrong, I love boobs as much as the next guy, but they should have a reason for appearing - Boobs and nips showing up in hentai games? Makes sense. Showing up at the strip club in GTA5? Makes sense. Shows up randomly in a game about shooting zombies? No sense.Game feels like it wants to be a mix of Doom 3 and Borderlands, but lacks the polish and features to come even close.On a more positive note, the graphics and environments looked very good, from what I could tell.Edit: Changed the review so that it seems less like a personal attack on the devs, while still maintaining my criticism.

It's like your listening to Chekov from Star Trek.2. Game will lack staying power to keep your intrest after awhile.  Of the three characters, the only ones I find worth playing out to max level (20), is Gunnar and the melee specialist who's name illudes me.  Both offer distincly different styles of play that are fun.  However once you max them and their equipment  out, there really isn't much to do except jack up the skill level and see how fast you can mow zombies down.3. Graphics.  They are ok , their not horrid, and quite adequate, but if you compare it to Triple A titles, you may find them  lacking.  However, this is a Unity engine game we are talking about here, so there's that......The Ugly:1. Needs more PC optimization."

Firstly, even when running two gtx960's I recieve lag when looking around, which is extremely uncommon. Secondly, the game features no AA so all you see is jagged lines. Although in the screenshots it clearly shows that there is some form of AA. Lastly, I had great difficulty adjusting controls and mouse sensitivity as they just kept on returning to the previous values.I understand that this game is in Early Access, however it should be more refined because it has been out on different platforms.

The story is very bland and lacks any characater development or any real story for that matter. 85% of the game is in the exact same enviroment wiht hardly any changes to your surroundings. The game begins with giving you a choice of 3 characters to choose from - sounds promising right? Wrong. They are all exactly the same besides a few changes in weapons and dialog.

Fast motions will read like slow mouse motions. And no, it's not my mouse. I run a tournament pro spec Corsair mouse, geared for FPS play no less. I can pop fast shots a plenty on other games with it, fine movement speeds on my desktop, but I play this game and the point of view moves very little if you quick motion the mouse.This is a bug that needs to be handled first and far most if it's to be considered a relevent tittle.That aside, it's cheesy. But it knows it's cheesy and rolls with it. Some of the altered versions of quotes are almost kind of funny, but feel like they try a little too hard.The fine aim seems to aim a tad bit low from where starter bullets actually shoot, from the hip almost as bad, and when you start with average joe armor, your sprint is only two seconds to start or so. Yeah, that's a little silly. I know there is a leveling system, but I could run longer than that trying to drag fat age Opera behind me, and she carries a lot of emotional weight among others.So the good? Looks about like the yester year of DOOM. Not cutting edge, but not terrible. It's definately not looking to be a super high end piece, and that's ok, but yeah. I want to like it for it's loose take on the story, and when you get away from the wonky issues, and it's one liner approaches, the story actually feels like it could be something. Not, again something top notch, but lovable for a sci fi nerd like myself.Right now, I don't feel like it's a severe loss yet, but when it can't work properly with mouse aiming, this is the sort that made Deus Ex Invisible War fall short initially, and that was a mouse movement delay. THis is blatantly taking Mouse acceleration and creating a deceleration effect in quick movements, and since NOT ALL OF US are facing it, some will smile, point the finger, and act like it's not happening and so it could be ignored for a while, but I hope they'll fix it.Right now that mouse issue really kills it for me wanting to move forward and test further, and as such I'll be checking in on this one again future. But for what it is, it has a blatantly broken mechanic, and a root mechanic that makes an FPS what it is at it's ultimate core, being able to aim. Fail that, you've failed to make an FPS.Please fix, and then I'll more than likely recomend. Others like it for a reason, it's fun kinda cheesey yet a sci fi design, that if they wanted too, could actually really go somewhere. Just not when my mouse aim in quick movements goes essentially NO WHERE.THE FINAL WORD:I actually want to like this game, probably because of the theme. Hey it's a sci fi zombie fest again, and they give you almost a more basic Deus Ex vibe to enhancing your body. But it's Early Access and the bugs are still very much there, especially the sensativity issue.Right now a lower price tag sale, yeah my thumb is down for now, but not be bad. But as of this writing, play the game with a controller if you run into the mouse sensativitiy that I did. For now it's kind of playable as is, if you use a controller to get past that issue if needed.Don't be surprised if I toggle this game back and forth from thumbs up and down. It's really the closest thing we have to a middle ground rating, and I really do want to see it fixed up and where it all goes."

,Recommended,394760,21721599,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Unforseen Liquid Emission,"I was a fan of the first Dead Effect,  and I am also a fan of the sequel.  But let's get a few things out of the way1.  This game is cheesy and derivative.  It is a mix of every video game cliche you've ever seen in the last twenty years.  It plays out like a mish-mash of Far Cry,  Doom,  and System Shock, without capturing any of the unique magic of any of those games.2.  It appears to be using stock assets, or at least it re-uses assets in jarring ways.  For example, you are tasked with rescuing a particular character who bears a striking resemblance to many of the corpses you find littered about the station.  Coincidence?3.  It's Fun.   It manages to rise above all of the issues it has and become an enjoyable brainless first person shooter.  This is due in large part to the good feedback when you shoot / slice enemies ,  the variety of weaponry you can use, and the robust upgrade system, which encourages repeat playthroughs to 'farm' cash and upgrade points.  It's pretty darn solid stuff.Is this game worth the asking price?  Probably not.  I would recommend picking it up on a sale.  It is selling for about 3 times as much as the first game, which seems abit steep considering that the kind of entertainment on offer is more or less identical, and very basic all things considered.  There is apparently a multiplayer aspect to this game, but I have been unable to test it thus far."

As it stands, it needs some work and a lot of refinement, but it's well on its way.  Don't bank on multiplayer, as there aren't many people playing online.  The loot and leveling system is great and rewarding.  Not very optimized and it has quite a few bugs and kinks to work out, but it's still very playable and overall it's a solid shooter with rpg elements._____________________________Graphics: Pretty good.  I've seen better, but considering this is from a small indie studio (as far as I know) I'd say it looks as good as it needs to.Gameplay: Animations can be stiff or slow, but it gets the job done well.  I have only played 5 hours as of this review, but I have fun playing it.Story: The story is really simple, you're on a ship with people trying to kill you and you're trying to survive.  There's not a lot of content in it right now and even less story content, but the content it has right now is good and complete enough to enjoy.Multiplayer: Worst part so far, and it isn't even because of the game itself.  There's almost no one playing this game online.  I had to wait 30 minutes to find one person, which means that you're probably going to be playing most of this by yourself for now.  It just needs more players.The RPG elements, like the loot and the leveling process is really good and interesting.  I can't wait until I level up to get some new skills."

Nevertheless the game is a lot of fun, specially once you get to the good gear. The loot system is simple and fun, and the perks are no rocket sience. It reminded me a bit of the first KF, you kinda need to get used to the controls(and it's clunkyness)Pros:• Simplyfied loot system• Huge amount of different gametypes (survival, objective etc)• Co-op• Decent GFX• Good Sci-Fi atmosphere with lots of detail• Good amount of different enemy types• Potential to become big (if the devs keep at it)Cons:• B-Movie story, it really is bad...but even this has it's charm• HUGE ICONS EVERYWERE!! Left over from the port no doubt, and hopefully will be adjusted in future updates• Starting players might be put off by their lack of skill to survive... (Hang in there, it's worth it!)• Enemies get stuck in some maps (and sometimes disappear to respawn somewere else)• Some enemies are a bit meh... (the Pinky ripoff from Doom3 is really the dumbest of them all, besides the annoying space Ninjas and Leprechauns)Overal, if you want some brainless action packed Horde survival with a friend... buy it!ps: It's beyond me why there are not more games like this or KF on steam.

There is something about the Dead effect series, its simple but extremely enjoyable. The gameplay, graphics, Weapon / Armor / Implant options, etc. huge improvement over the Dead Effect 1.  The Multiplayer / Co - Op option is a nice addition but unfortunately there are not many people online (Click Create Server people!!). There are also many different game modes besides the Story such as General, Bio-hazard, Survival, Lone Wolf, and Infestation.Dead Effect 2 supports Ultra-Wide Screen Resolutions (3440 X 1440) by default when the game starts up so you won't have to edit the text file like with some games. No Crossfire suport.The game does need more Mythical Implant options in the bonus store as majority of the time they are only legendary. Also, it would be nice if you could continue to upgrade your abilities to max level after finishing the game since your are limited on Upgrade / Unlock points.Overall, don't hesitate to buy. Its worth the $11.99Ready for Dead Effect 3 :)"

The game feels incomplete and kind of a rip off because you never fight your big enemy at the end...you only fight your enemy's biggest henchman and then ""TO BE CONTINUED"".  W....  T....  F....  When I saw that I instinctively felt like this game was a complete cash grab and nothing else.  On the other hand, it was a fun game.  The game lasted quite a bit and had a lot of side missions divided into many sub-groups.  Just that the TO BE CONTINUED leaves a sour taste and makes the game feel inadequite and incomplete.Get the game on sale when it is heavily discounted and you will not feel so bad.

Imagine being trapped on a generational ship going to a different star system surrounded by zombies and evil guards all intent on our doom.  This is essentially the scenario of DE2.  For an indie it has top notch graphics.   Sonically it has great tunes and effects.Game play wise it is go to here kill all the antagonists along the way and then have a mini puzzle game interaction.  Sometimes after which it is fight off a boss monster.You get to upgrade weapons and continually get new armour and abilities to unlock.   My faves are the mini gun and the sword.  I mean what other fps gives you such a diverse range of weapons after a couple of hours play?After I bought this the xbox version came out and I played that and beat it.  The PC version is better with more modes and co op plus death match.  Great fun and well worth playing.  DE3 please BFI.

Currently playing the girl.Did I mention Terrible voice acting?  Would say it was a mildly...very mildy...ok game except that every time you get into the game someone speaks the dialouge and delivery just blows it for you.The actors seem bent on giving you either a wooden monotone, the Russian... I think his accent keeps changing who seems to think he's a SMERSH agent or a crazed valley girl on antphetamines.She sounds like the actress tried to cross a Valley Girl with Ripley.As for Minkin, I kept wishing I could shoot Minkin just for his Tor Johnson impression.This games actor's delivery is so bad, he actually manages to make Tor Johnson (Plan Nine From Outer Space Movie) sound like he was shakespearean trained actor.Combat is lackluster, as for atmosphere there is no sense of urgency or clastraphobic terror like Alien Isolation or Dead Space manage to covey.In fact there is really no sense of anything here at all.  Sort of an assembly line feel to this game.   Generic Zombies, Generic starship, by the numbers quests, that you get no real choices in.No feeling of a sandbox environment.In fact no feeling at all.Save your money folks."
