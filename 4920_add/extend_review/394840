It was a fun little sim with some interesting mechanics.Unfortunately, the developer gave in to the casual crowd this time around and either dumbed down or outright removed most of the things that made Challenger fun.The game is no longer about creating a self-sustaining base for a new colony. It is now a game about which team/base has the highest score. I don't know what the developer was thinking by switching the genre of the game from hardcore sim to adventure/sim light, but that's exactly what happened here.You can still control most of the equipment and systems from Challenger but now you'll start off with a 100% completely built base with a few NPC's littered around it which is just dumb. You can build your own base in one of 4 corners of the map which isn't anywhere near as fun as it was in Challenger. By the way, there is only 1 map included this time. All equipment comes with the components automatically installed now which seriously dumbs down the entire procedure of building a base as well.A lot of little but important things like bladder control, EVA suit temperature controls, buttons on air-locks and much more were completely dumbed down or removed from the game entirely in order to make it more ""accessible"" to the casual crowd and the simulation aspect has suffered greatly from it.Last but not least, there is NO dedicated server for this game as stated on the store page. You have to run the game to host other players, exactly like Challenger. I find it disgraceful that the developer has the nerve to advertise it as such.You can't help but wonder if this was purely a cash grab because of the highly anticipated movie ""The Martian"" coming out next week."

Not very good but ok, a lot of good games have their own little problems.Finally got ingame...Got nothing except 'Go and speak to Benjamin Dover'Ben Dover.... heh... i should have named my character Ivor Biggun.Wandered for a few minutes, found Ben..'Here's 5000 credits, go forth my son and do whatever' (not the actual dialogue but good enough for illustrative purposes.)Passed the EVA suit storage, realised you could actually take off your EVA suit.Took off EVA suit, entered airlock, closed inner door, opened outer door, wandered around outside for a few moments.No horrible decompressive death, no warnings of pending horrible decompressive death, just a gradually decreasing health bar...Seen enough.

It is a simplified yet flashy version of Challenger, which was not perfect itself. The devs talk about ""dedicated servers"" and ""dynamic economy"" as if they knew what that means when it is just silly looking NPC's staring at nothing selling or buying at fixed prices; and the only dedicated thing is the full fist from the devs. It has three game modes, but since they are broken, you can use only one. It pretends to be a simulation and is just a point fishing arcade with delusions of grandeur.I feel insulted. A game like this should have never been released to the public, certainly not as a full release. Beta testing must be some kind of heretic ritual forbidden by the gods in the minds of the developers of this game, whose best solution to EVERYONE's common problem (to name a few, game crashing when entering map, player restarting famished and without EVA outside base (after game has crashed, the bug of the bug), or interacting tool stops working just 'cuz) seems to be a condescending smile and a pat to the back.I waited a bit but no patch, no workaround, not even a fake apology from the devs. So what else to request a refund, and rant about a game so bad it hurts.On a side note, my AVG picked this up as a virus. Must be a funny coincidence, but hey, it's there.Run away from this and save your lives."

Actually it made it worse, because in the first game you at least had isolation as a component.  If you're stranded on Mars, how are there stores to buy stuff from?  Inexplicable and nonsensical.This franchise is as dead as the wooden NPCs in barter town here.  Hyperkat needs to do something else with their time, or hire a consultant that can instruct them on what good game mechanics could be put in place."

You started with a non-functional base, you had to install the equipment, you had buttons to push etc. This version is a dumbed down version and feels like a step back! I was not expecting a Take on Mars type game, but I was hoping for MC:C with base building options with a small economy thrown around.Hint to the devs: MC:C there was nothing like throwing open the airlock doors, hauling in your equipment, hiding out between different periods of high radiation and trying to get the base up before starving to death etc."

It has crashed on me five times already, three before even getting past the intro screens! The devs should not have released this game in such a state. I'm requesting a refund. Shame on the devs for not being upfront and transparent about this terrible buggy game! STAY AWAY - DO NOT BUY!!!UPDATE: Hyper Kat finally admitted something. But I think most would agree that it should of been announced to the public first, the issues facing release and NOT released MC:F, instead of meeting a deadline, which, by the way they didn't do because the game is currently unplayable! To be proud of meeting a deadline instead of delaying UNTIL it is at least playable is not thinking clearly. Just as, in my opinion, the kiling off of MC:C. I think Hyper Kat should of realized the public's attraction to MC:C and taken a step back, and re-approached the project with clarity of mind.  So how can there be trust?"

I have played a game in the Competive AI mode for quite a few hours now and have built a substantial base.  Gone are the crashes and game critical bugs.  It is a good balance between real Mars simulation and game play.  Overcome the challenges our first actual settlers to Mars will face - in 10 years or so! I especially like tearing up and down the Martian mountains and through narrow valleys via my trusty rover.  It is civilization-building in a life threatening environment at its best (think The Martian).  Graphics and tutorial could use further improvements, but Mars terraine and inside base scenes are already great, and I'm confident the game will continue to evolve and develop. For just $8+, this is your chance to get in on the ground floor of what your constructive suggestions could make into a very popular game."

Ignoring stability problems - which I haven't experienced, only read about - the state of this game is considerably less advanced that many games you can pick up from GOG and run in a DOS box.  This looks like a hobbyist's valiant attempt to do something worthy, and I applaud that; but I have found the 'game' element to be catastrophically missing.  If this were termed an Alpha release, that would be both realistic, and fair; terming it a Beta would be ambitious - and would put me off buying the final version.  Claiming this is 'released' is terrible.  Not worth the (admittedly low) price of admission.  Someone may enjoy this, but the only positive reviews I've seen talk about the potential rather than the current state of things - and that reflects my view too: right now, not worth your time (let alone the money)"

My draw to this game was a potential for a deep scientific element combined with imagination as to what life would be like on Mars.  There certainly is an imaginative element to the game, there is understanding of fields of science involved in the processes of crafting items, but it is shallow and lost in the monotony of collecting/buying items and combining them in a game that feels like a Mars version of Minecraft.  Basicially, A+B=C,   X+Y=Z,    Z+C=G,   G+B+B= F,    just a bunch of basic algebra.Again, I'm not a fan of the genre so feel free to disagree with my credibility.  I thought it'd be more about the science.I understand that the game is still under development and that the creators have goals for a more immersive experience.  However, at its current state and based on my experience with the item-crafting genre, there is nothing more that I suspect they will do besides add more crafting opportunities, module designs, a bigger map; none of which will keep me interested long enough to wait for their updates."

It's not exactly a perfect Mars simulator, but ""and then they all died of radiation poisoning anyway"" doesn't make for a good story.  So magic medicines and super-fast growing vegetables are a necessary surrender of reality to make a good game.  What does make it a good simulation is that if you don't gather your air, you'll die.  If you don't feed yourself, you'll die.  If you don't keep on top of things and keep working, something will go wrong and you'll die.There are a number of bugs that are being addressed, some I would assume are quite difficult to track down, since they are intermittent.  Some are even quite annoying.  The greatest weakness of the game is not being able to save against these possible disasters.However, I think the game itself is worth it.  The first campaign segment is done, and the sheer amount of control over all the aspects of keeping a breathable atmosphere, crops and mining will keep the player involved even when the story line is quiet."

MCF also has a few bugs. Sometimes it will crash, and when you update base modules, they will move to the wrong spot.

If anyone out there likes science or has a passion for the destiny of mankind, or simply wants their kids to learn something while playing a game, I highly recommend this one.  I got the last one, Mars Colony Challenger, and I've been looking forward to the release of Frontier for awhile.  It did not dissapoint.  The cool thing about this one is it adds an economy aspect and multiplayer competition (though I haven't tried the multiplayer yet).  I especially like the fact that we can build solar arrays and either make or buy all those little things (nutrients for worms and mushrooms, GPR shots, etc) for which we simply had a finite source in Challenger.  Plus, driving the rover just got way cooler in third person!I was surprised to see a lot of negative reviews, mostly focusing on graphics and lag and a few startup bugs.  Well boo hoo.  I could argue down each of those gripes, but I'll sum it up like this: I use an outdated laptop, so I set the graphics on the lowest setting to begin with.  I have almost no lag at all, the graphics are still great, and in the two weeks since this game was released about half the bugs I noticed have been fixed.  That's better than I can say for most of the games I've played.Keep up the good work HyperKat!  Can't wait to see what you come up with next."
