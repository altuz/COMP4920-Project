,Recommended,394850,25206326,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Strigifo,"I rarely leave reviews, but I was just surprised to see most the negative reviews being to do with bad controller support. I don't know what control pads these people are using, but I've had this game working in 4 player local player using a ps4 controller (DS4 software to use it with PC), my Xbone controller, a cheap Xbox replica controller and the Steam controller. All of which worked right out of the box so to speak, even the Steam controller, and anyone who's had the misfortune to use one of those will know they never ""just work""....About the actual game though, the game is short and not so fun in single player but it makes a great party game."
,Recommended,394850,18628113,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Meeonochi,"In this review, I am going to compare Square Brawl to Nidhogg. If you dont know what Nidhogg is, then look it up.First off, like Nidhogg, Square Brawl (SB) has graphics that are very... square. Unlike Nidhogg, however, SB takes advantage of its art style, and somehow makes it look beautiful. That, combined with the screen shaking and other interesting effects, make the game very pleasing to the eye.Also like Nidhogg, SB is an indie game. That means that only a few people are working on it, and it has a very limited budget. However, unlike Nidhogg, SB actually has a decent amount of content. In fact, it has way more content on release day than Nidhogg has now, almost 2 years after it was released.So, all things considered, SB should cost at least 2-3x the amount of Nidhogg, right? Wrong. SB costs 1/3 of Nidhogg's price, and in my opinion, is way more enjoyable. If I had one gripe with this game, it would be that there needs to be more variation in weapons. I think that the best way to solve this issue would be to create more weapons, and keeping the current ones as well. I think perks would be intersting too.Overall, I rate this game an 8.5/10"

Most weapons are overpowered and have one hit kills, while others are hard to aim and do little to no damage. It was hard enough to play in half speed and i can't imaging trying to follow normal. Had this game offered more than just one mode if different forms (i.e kill enemy, kill enemy with one life so on and so forth) i might have found it fun. Alas it did not, so I must give it a bad review."

,Not Recommended,394850,33681334,Posted: 20 July,all,SquaruS,"First of all: I like this game.Some people say the game is unbalanced, some say it's fun, I say it's both. Nobody plays it anymore, because it gets boring pretty quick. Even people who say they loved the game on comments played as far as 30 hours. The thing is,there is nothing that makes you want to keep playing.I played this game with my friends while it was still in alpha. We generally play quick phased split screen coop/vs games, and we did have fun with Square Brawl. I hoped that new things would come; new weapons, mods, maps, etc. Few months later, completed game released on steam. Bought it immediately. Wow, better graphics, 4 new weapons and bots that actually work!.....aand nothing else. Absence of multiplayer sucks too (but it never bothered me since I always play with friends side by side)This game might have been a big hit on quick phased vs/coop game market, but sadly it stayed still after its release. Perhaps it's better that way, since Landfall made other amazing games after this one."

I've played a lot more hours of this game that you don't see here on various other computers via USB, and it's been tremendous fun with four players. Especially for just the $4 for which I got it. And the soundtrack is brilliant too. The only thing I would suggest is in team modes, keep the number over people's characters so you can tell the difference between you and your teammate. Or something similar, like randomly generated funny names. You should buy this game."

We played it 3 player local on the couch and it's been really fun. The weapons all feel interesting and satisfying and the overall look of the game is pleasing. The movement feels a little unusual at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll see it suits the game's trajectory prediction style duelling very well.It really needs a post battle results screen. At the moment all you see is the overall winner which is a bit disappointing when you play against a few people. It would also benefit from a map playlist. We have clear favourite levels and would like the play them most. If this tied in with post game results it would be great.However, extra points for the level editor. We've already made a bunch of maps which was very enjoyable."
