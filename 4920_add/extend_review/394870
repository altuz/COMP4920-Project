It is the urban dream and this game tries to capture such a wonderful fantasy....There are various modes in this game which generally consist of the generic capture the safe points, survive for XYZ amount of seconds and kill XYZ amount of enemies. Not that original if you ask me.The weapons and armour are original to this game (cardoard box helmet YES PLEASE) although there is a small selection with the majority of them being unlocked later in the game. The more enemies you kill, the more experience to new levels you gain, and the more money you pick up.HOWEVER  - - - This game is boring as sin. It is interesting for the first few minutes until you realise everything is the same. The same enemies the same weapons the same layout. Some games benefit from repetition like Diablo or Minecraft. This game really really doesnt. There are limited rewards for your hard work, and most of the better content is locked behind several hours of mundane play.Buy it on sale, but its a dissapointing game for such a good premise."

The ringleader of the contest is your boss, ""Big B."" If you win the contest, you essential survive the layoffs and become the next ""Big B.""The idea is the same in each stage -- beat up your co-workers and be the last one standing. There is a small variety of game modes available to you to get this done, such as surviving for a fixed time period, holding enemies off from your office, or just knocking out everyone in the building. Every 10 stages you'll enter a boss fight against ""Big B"" and there are 60 stages in total.The big problem I had with the game was that it's so repetitive that there's really no point in having 60 stages. If you complete the first 10 stages you've seen all that the game has to offer. Doing the next 50 is just a mindless grind, and requires you to gain plenty of experience levels and unlock/buy advanced weapons and armor. If you're the type of gamer who thrives on completing all achievements, then this is going to be a long and boring adventure.On its surface the game appears to lack the need for strategy. While in the first 9 stages you can get by with spamming your action buttons repeatedly, you will soon quickly discover that in stage 10 ""Big B"" will thrash your♥♥♥♥♥ So, in order to be successful moving forward you'll need to actually develop some strategies.In terms of customization, there is very little. You can change your avatar's appearance, but I was unable to find any way to actually represent myself. Disappointingly, you aren't allowed to change the appearance of Big B either. Aside from that there's a level editor, but I didn't care for it. I don't think you can even share your creations.At a really low price point, the game is worth playing. I picked it up for $1, but I couldn't really recommend it at anything more than $2."

You fight as an office worker against your ""colleagues"" to keep your job.This increases your player rank, level, and distributes skill points in your talent tree. By the way, you also get so-called coins, which you can spend on equipment (weapon, shield and helmet) or you can use these coins to repair the equipment.Played in a kind of campaign where the following modes alternate:- Capture- Last Man Standing- Survival- Big B (boss battles)In addition, there is still the free mode, where one plays over self-created maps.For the achievement hunters among you: They are all easy to make, you just need something.I bought the main game and the DLC (""Brutal Mode"") for the Summer Sale 2017 for 0.98 € and for this price is worth it!"

It reminds me a bit of a super-simplified Dead Rising 2, though clearly nowhere near as gleefully gory, even if you buy the Brutal Mode DLC (which I still recommend if you don't want a full-blown ""kiddie"" game, albeit one with a somewhat blackly humorous and ""adult"" premise...hell, it's only an extra buck, for a grand total of two bucks, ya cheapskate)!  The controls are simple, you can customise your character with simple cosmetics and skill trees, a few different gameplay modes, etc etc.  It's probably precisely what some of you have been looking for, to perversely fill the lunch-breaks at your own dead-end office jobs which you justifiably hate oh-so-much.In a Steam-y world chock-full of incompetent ""devs"" asking perfectly good money for crappy and/or chronically incomplete games, I find it hard to imagine anyone will have much to complain about with this one, though there's always bound to be a few (and just watch the feathers fly over the one dollar DLC...gamers are nothing if not ungrateful ♥♥♥♥ing turds positively OOZING first world problems, let's be honest here)!  It's all good clean and/or bloody fun, not personally my cup of tea to any great degree - hell, I didn't even care that much for Arkham Asylum, so beat-'em-ups clearly ain't my thang - but for some of you out there, you'll probably get endless hours of highly repetitive joy for the low, low price of two bucks or less.So stop whinging already, and just buy it if it looks like your bag.  Support an indie dev who actually seems to want to give the people what they want (and how ♥♥♥♥ing novel an idea is THAT, in this day and age?)!Verdict: 7/10."

The game is rather basic and does not require much more than playing to advance. While the game is not deep, it does not really mean it is as simple as button mashing, but do not expect to be mentally challenged to play Office Battle.In all, this game is a fun off the wall, go postal and randomly beat up coworkers type game. I recommend it for a funny experience, and is best doing with a few friends to goof around, but aside from that, it is not a very capturing or enthralling game."
,Recommended,394870,34441520,Posted: 23 August,all,Sweep,"About Office BattleOffice Battle is an Indie Beat ‘em up, in which the goal is to defeat all coworkers in order to keep your Job.The player can kick and punch with both arms and also use weapons and armor to achieve this goal. Unfortunately these are the only attack options which are presented. There are two kinds of items which can be found: protective items like shields and helmets and melee weapons. All of them are frequently dropped by enemies or can alternatively be bought at the store between levels using in-game currency. Although there is a large amount of different items, they are all functionally the same and only differ in the amount in which they boost the offensive or defensive stat. Additionally the skill tree also only offers passive power ups, the result of which is, that the the first level and all of the following are mechanically the same with only a minor sense of progression.Release Date: 2 Dec, 2015The GameplayYou may be wondering what about the kick attack? Well it does the same damage as punching, is slow to use and range is the same, not that it matters in this title. It could have been used for staggering an enemy or something of that nature but it is just an inferior attack that you'll likely never use in Office Battle. Defeating foes and completing missions grant you both money and experience which can be used to buy items and to level up your skill tree. In the main menu there is a store where you can purchase said weapons and gear to take into a mission. You can also sell whatever gear you picked up from missions for cash. Weapons do break down so the benefit of buying them is that they are in 100% condition as such will take longer for it to break in the middle of fighting. Protection for the head and shields wear down from taking damage so constantly replacing your gear is necessary if that is the way you built your character.Leveling up grants 1 skill point that allows you to upgrade one of the abilities in the skill tree such as regenerating health, better hand to hand and weapon usage increases to name a few. There is a skill for blocking which oddly enough cannot be activated, instead works like an RPG where it's pure chance if it activates. There are 4 types of missions. Survival where you must stay alive for a certain amount of time and Last Man Standing where you must defeat a certain amount of enemies. They feel pretty much the same to be quite honest. Office Capture is the one mode where you must move since you have to take control of three circles scatted on the map but once you are there it's back to being stationary and mashing the attack buttons so not a huge departure. Finally we have Big B missions that has you facing your old boss in a fight.All in AllOffice Battleis a really nice Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep"

The core gameplay is fun and the ragdoll physics are pretty funny.But this game could have been so much better. The campaign is lackluster, no variety in content and it doesn't introduce any new mechanics along the way. If you played through the first 10 (out of 60) levels - you already experienced everything this game has to offer (just the enemies get tougher). The upgrade system is very bland, many of those skills are not needed if you just want to complete the campaign or get all the achievements.This game is just a big grind (about 10 hours to get all achievements). Even if you maximize your xp gain, you will still need at least 7 hours to get to 55th character lvl. It's because of how the gameplay works. At one moment there can only be 3 enemies max. If you kill one - the next enemy will spawn after 3 seconds. That's why you can't grind the xp faster. You are just tied to the spawn rate of the enemies.The price tag is fair, so I will give it a thumbs up."

,Not Recommended,394870,22301416,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Magnetto Man,"While the concept is very interesting and somewhat original , I cannot recommend this game.The whole game is a repetition of button mashing with three different attacks. You cannot defend enemy attacks. You cannot dodge enemy attacks. You cannot counter enemy attacks.Game dynamic: Stand still or go to a given spot ( the directional doesnt really matter as you will get hit anyway and cannot interact with the enviroment ),  smash the buttons to attack as the enemies runs towards you.  Pick a fewl coins from dead enemies and when you eventually die ( and you will! ) you can shop for weapons or items and start all over again.While there are different "" missions "" , they are all loose with no game story at all and the dynamic is the same ( in one of them you need to defend a spot , in another you need to beat you boss , but gameplay never changes )Too bad as with a few adjustments this game could have been awesome. The basic elements are there - controls respond well, decent graphics , rich enviroment ( I still cannot believe there is ZERO interaction with the enviroment - no hidding , no pushing furniture onto your enemies, no picking up stuff from the desks, etc... )I recommend avoiding this even at an extremely low price.

Each level, besides the capture levels, can be easly beaten by runing into a corner and holding down the attack button. The skills are also a problem, once you level up your character enough it becomes next to impossable for you to die on the earlier levels.The game dosen't look bad and there is a charm about fighting in an office that I love. I think that all this game really needs is a few tweaks to the gameplay and it would be well worth more than just a dollar."

Anyway, you're kicking♥♥♥♥♥ gaining XP (gain levels, spend skill points) and coins (spend them in shop to buy new items). This is basically it -- the whole gameplay, in a few words.I really enjoy ragdoll physics in fighting games, so I may be biased about this one -- I like how enemies are flying around all over the place, if you finish them with a crit.What this game lacks, however, is diversity. Yeah-yeah, I know, there's a lot of game modes, a few difficulties, even bosses... But the core gameplay is the same, really -- you just stand in one place and mash buttons, until the time ends, or all the enemies die, or the cubicle gets captured.However, I played somewhat close to 1.5h, and I did enjoy the game. Will I be coming back to it after some time? Possibly, if devs would introduce some new features, and maybe a tad improved combat."

The achievements possible in this game are not too difficult to achieve but will require grinding but not to the extent where you dislike the game itself. You are able to create your own office however you like as well as play a never ending match in your own office. The campaign isn't too difficult and leveling up your skills is not difficult at all. You are able to gain money just by replaying old missions and gain even more exp from the same one. The equipment available isn't large but is big enough for this game. I'd give this game about 8.1/10 rating overall.

Your boss, named ""Big B"" (what's in a name?) organizes a (fighting) competition in which the winners get to keep their jobs. From time to time, the boss will test the worthy champion himself.The controls of the game are simple: the player uses the arrow keys to move in all directions, while using the q, w and e keys to perform different fight moves. By leveling up, and gathering skill points, the player can upgrade different skills. Think of getting more health points, getting better at fighting or having a higher coin drop rate of beaten workers. Besides getting stronger because of using skillpoints the player can also (temporarily) make use of different items. These items are divided into three categories: hand weapons, shields and helmets. Hand weapons vary from a newspaper to a lamp or globe, shield vary from a bottle shield to a skateboard and helmets vary from a box to a plant pot. Weapons all have different stats, depending on which weapon it is. New weapons are unlocked at different character levels and can be bought in the store.The game has more than 50 levels in its campaign. Every 10th level, the player gets to fight ""Big B"", which is a very powerful boss. For many, it will be hard to beat this boss, being forced to replay levels on and on, leveling up to gain skill points and to collect new weapons, in order to beat him.In conclusion, I give Office Battle a 7/10, for it's humour, simple controls but tough gameplay (in boss battles, which is a real challenge) and wide variety of items and levels. Furthermore, the game has Steam achievements, which is an extra challenge for some players and card drops."
,Recommended,394870,22158173,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,Tablis,"This is neither a fighting game nor a beat 'em up (in the vein of, say, Streets of Rage). It's a casual game through and through. There are three action buttons (left/right hook and kick) and the gameplay consists of finding a defensible bottleneck, turning to face incoming enemies and literally mashing those three buttons as quickly as possible. That's it. There are no special moves derived from special inputs. There are just under 60 levels of this and every tenth is a boss. All of it is extremely repetitive - the offices, the boss, everything.So why the thumbs up? Because I enjoyed it quite a lot for some reason. No, I don't entirely understand why, but I had fun. The production values deserve mention as they are definitely above average for a title of this sort. Visuals, audio (all aspects: music, SFX, voice acting), interface/menus, performance... All of it is polished to a surprising degree, considering how shallow the game itself is. It's a stupid game, but pleasantly stupid."

I saw this and it looked interesting so I wrote the name down in Notepad and continued looking for other games with cards. Eventually I purchased all the games (36) just for the cards.ReviewThis game is only $1.09CAD but I got it on sale for 50% off ($0.54). I thought the game would be poorly made and unenjoyable. These were my first impressions. However, once I actually started the game and read the basics in the tutorial I realized that this is actually pretty well made. It is very enjoyable. However, I think it has a short playable lifespan but what you get out of it is probably a $5 game. The controls are simple and easy to remember, the modes seem fun, and there's a lot of character customization, levels, and modes. Not to mention the game has a bunch of weapons, helmets and shields AND a skill tree you can invest into 5 times each. This game could easily be worth $5 with everything included. Oh, did I mention there's a map editor? There's a moderate amount of items to choose from, a decent selection of walls, doorways and floors too. The game has pretty good physics too. Hair moves around, objects aren't anchored to the ground and can be pushed, enemies have ragdoll effects.. Trust me, don't wait for a sale and don't hesitate. This game is way cheaper than it should be!I recommend this game even at full asking price of $1.09CAD. I stopped playing it after making my first level and completing a few of the missions, but I enjoyed what I played of the game very much and I might even play it more.I have to admit, this game being worth $1.09CAD, it's better than a lot of the $5 - EVEN $10CAD - games I've played."

You can collect and equip power ups like rulers for ♥♥♥♥ing people, and keyboards to use as a shield.There are three 2 types of game when you play the campaign, hold the office and survival. Hold the office involves standing in a particular spot long enough to capture the area. Survival is self explanatory.Controls are very good. After a while the combat becomes a bit bland.

,Recommended,394870,19590652,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,Gamer Guy (In A Suit),"Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action game Office Battle. Office Battle was brought to us on Steam on December 2, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Black Lime Studios.(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key from my own Steam library and was NOT provided by the Developer/Publisher)Video Review:https://youtu.be/YrhjJk5uVagThe ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:For a buck, you can do worse. Good way to blow off steam. Controls can be wonky, though.2.5/5 cause it's a buck.The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Well, this is one of the better kinds of things you can find on Steam for a buck these days. That's for sure. Let's give you some pluses to look forward to. First off, this is a fun way to blow off some steam. Just go into an office and pound some co-workers. Add in the ""Brutal"" DLC (also a buck) and the extra-gory blood really can be a good release. You meander through the levels and meet the goal to move on. Usually the goal is something like ""Survive the wave of Co-workers"", etc. It's a Unity game. The graphics are decent as is the sound. The controls actually hold this one back a touch, as they get a little wonky at times. I had to mark it down .5 for that. It did not play any better with a controller, although if you take your time to re-map the entire control setup, it does get better. Honestly, for a buck, it is worth it and can be a fun way to let loose after a trying day. There are definitely MUCH worse games on Steam right now. This one, while just slightly above average right now, is a fun concept and is absolutely worth your dollar (or two if you go ""Brutal"") 2.5/5. Not too shabby.Happy Gaming!!!"

,Not Recommended,394870,20901333,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","Yet another ""I just discovered Unity, so I'll make a game!"" type of game. Not a huge fan of this one, It's not an awful idea, it's just executed in a really boring manner. The same cluster of crappy 3d models chases you around, when they die their ragdoll death animation is just ridiculous (garry's mod-esque flailing). Weapons that are dropped by mobs will break within 15-20 hits, and from the first 6 skills I unlocked, It's a very boring skill tree to deal with.In the end, this is just a game that was sloppily put together, but if you're one of those ironic gamers who like buying bad games to be ironic, this definitely is the game for you."

,Recommended,394870,34200750,Posted: 12 August,all,Neymarinet,"I'm not really a hack and slash kinda guy, but I like this take on the genre.The player takes on the role of an employee at a struggling business's office. Layoffs are in full swing, and the sadistic boss is letting only the most hardened, tough and brave employees keep their job. The player must crush enemy co-workers through 60 levels of fists and fury.The player gets XP and coins through knocking out other employees. The XP is used to unlock better weapons, shields, helmets, and character customization. The unlockable combat gear includes improvised objects one might see at a regular office building: anything from a flattened watercooler to a flowerpot to fire extinguisher.Each time the player gains enough XP levels up; there are 55 levels in total, and each level grants one skill point that can be used to upgrade perks. There are 11 perks that can each be upgraded 5 times. These range from additional money drops to reduced damage taken to regenerating health.There are four game modes that are spread across the 60 levels (59 if you exclude the tutorial): Survival, Last Man Standing, Office Capture, and Big B. Survival is about staying alive for a certain amount of time;  The goal in Last Man Standing is to knock out a specific amount of people; Office Capture focuses on capturing certain points in the office (indicated by a red circle that will turn green over time), and Big B, which involves the player fighting against the incredibly powerful boss himself (with swarms of other employees working against the player).The game uses the arrow keys for movements, and Q, W, and E for fighting. Q is used for punching, W is used for weaponry if there is a weapon equipped, and E is to kick. It it here that a lot of complaints about this game arise: the fighting is really dull and minimal. I learned early on that you can really spam only one key and it'll do just as good as a job as the others (unless you have a weapon equipped).The music to this game is a small mix of electronic and rock music. It's kind of a mixed bag. I'm a music guy, so I was able to appreciate all the songs (especially that crunchy downtuned guitar one. Props for recording that tune). I can see if people would mute it though.There isn't really much to a plot or dialogue, but whatever voice acting there was was pretty good. The first time I heard some of the protagonist's lines I genuinely laughed out loud. However, outside of this, the only sounds humans make in the game are grunting and sounds of pain.There are 15 achievements in all, and they're pretty easy to get. My only problem with the achievements is that you beat the game long before you get to Level 55 (or, most players should), so grinding to get achievements is necessary. Also, the game does not tell you how to get ""To the moons"", which gives extra XP and, if done 100 times, an achievement. I didn't know what it was until I looked at an achievement guide.Finally, the nitpicky stuff. First off, I've never been a social justice kinda guy, but it's a little weird how the playerhasto be a male player. There are female models in the game, but no customization allowed a female character. Also, this game is made by a Russian based company, so the English translations are a bit wonky. Nothing to serious, but some of the descriptions for the items need a double take to get the gist of.So all in all, this is a pretty good game. Nothing revolutionary, but if you come across this game and want a good time waster, an easy 100% game, and some trading cards, I'd definitely pick this up. I got it for maybe 10 cents, but a dollar is easily worth what this game has to offer."
