You either rushed in or didnt react quick enough.In this game, it just kills you to feign some sort of challenge or depth. The rules also change whenever they feel like it. You might learn one mechanic, for it to change in the next room. And while that may sound innovative, it is implemented poorly.I gave this one a real chance to try and recapture some of the immersiveness I felt from Limbo, but it came nowhere close, and I just left angry and disappointed."
,Not Recommended,395160,20139743,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Marc05,"As it's been mentioned plenty already, this can be seen as an alternative to Limbo, and as such, I'll review it with that in mind. In my opinion, there are very few things the game does right, and there's a lot that it does wrong.GAMEPLAYThere are neat interactive puzzles from time to time which you figure out from clues around the area - or unfortunately, by bruteforcing the answer before you get stabbed in the back. With Limbo, a case could be made for beingextracareful to not die, but this game forces you too many times to guess right, or die trying. It leaves the player feeling like the game took a cheap shot at them, rather than making them think, ""I could have avoided that."" The other challenge comes with timing. It's sometimes fun, and sometimes frustrating. It's fun when it's obvious you messed up, but that's not always the case (as I said, guess or die trying).CONTROLSThe character feels slow, but smooth when it's working well. Sometimes, you may find yourself getting stuck floating on a ledge, jumping very little, or being killed by horrible collision detection. You get teleported sometimes, which didn’t impact my gameplay, but takes away from the immersion and mood the environment is trying to set.VISUALS, ENVIRONMENT, & SOUNDThis game copies the visual essence of Limbo, and changes some things to make it unique. The idea of a more variable color palette while keeping the eerie feeling one gets when playing Limbo is good, but poorly executed. The environments change abruptly between levels, and the overall design feels less interesting and more lazy.Freeing people (read: collecting them), jumping, activating, and many other sound effects seem to come out of the default resource pack that comes with the engine. These sounds pop out in a way that doesn't blend well with the rest of the game. A decent soundtrack enhances the mood, but gets interrupted here and there when going through certain zones within the level. After 18 levels, the game became boring, and the puzzles were not enough for me to keep playing.SO... SHOULD YOU BUY IT?If you loved Limbo and want more of it, wait for Limbo 2. If you're interested in this type of game and haven't played Limbo yet, get Limbo instead. If you just want to play another puzzle platformer that won't take up much of your time, this is a good choice."

Toby is a good puzzle platformer, with a good challenge level and solid gameplay. If you like 2D platformers like Limbo, you´ll love this game. Sadly, it does little to change or expand on the formula set forth by Limbo.

,Not Recommended,395160,23849692,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Butter_Groove,"I really wish I could recommend this game. As you can probably tell from other reviewers, it is a blatant Limbo rip-off, without any of the ambience, mystery, or atmosphere of Limbo. If this game had come out first, it would have certainly had more of an impact. Not to say that it wasn't an enjoyable, short, somewhat challenging platformer. The graphics are also quite nice, and if you are going to rip off a game visually, you of course could do much worse than ripping off Limbo's visuals. The addition of color is nice, but it doesn't save the visuals from lacking the polish, weight, depth, and subtleties that Limbo has. Animation is also much more stilted than Limbo's, and the hidden areas and switches are in some cases too hidden and you only stumble upon them by just running into the edges of structures haphazardly searching where to go next.Also for those of you playing on Steam Link with an Xbox controller, I had a number of issues. Occasionally pressing the jump button would trigger two successive jumps in a row which is killer on some of the more precise platforming sections. Also there was no ""use"" button which made some of the puzzles impossible to complete with this controller, which is ridiculous. I had to go complete the puzzles with my computer mouse in these circumstances. I'm not sure if this is an oversight on the developer's part as I have had a number of issues on various games which say they properly support controllers via Steam Link...and then they don't. I used a PS3 controller attached to my computer and it worked fine, there were no problem's with the ""use"" button. I haven't attempted hooking up the Xbox controller to my computer though so I'm not sure if this was an issue with the Xbox controller and Steam Link, or the Xbox controller in general for this game. Also this was tested on OSX. Maybe less issues on Windows, I'm not sure."

,Not Recommended,395160,20021708,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,Shadowstealer,"For those who look at this game and relate it to limbo, the art style is the same and thats about it. I really wanted to like this game but there is just too much wrong with it for me to be able to.The puzzles are mostly solved either by trial and error or walking into blackness only to reveal a hidden switch, and the platforming is very awkward. Your character has no ability to move forward watsoever. You simply meander in the direction that you want to go. There is no sprint, no walk faster, and no gradual speed increase.I wanted a story. Limbo doesn't have any text and the true meaning is open for interpretation, but it communicates enough through the environment that the story develops itself. It gives us enough to make us wonder, but never enough to give us an answer. This game blatantly wears the motive on its sleeve: Big guy takes your friends, Rescue them. Thats all.Limbo feels more fluid: you start moving slowly but gradually gain speed, so taking a running start helps with long jumps. What really ruined this though is the jumping. Your character can jump almost four times its height. This would justify being able to move slightly faster than a turtle with a broken foot.TL;DRI really wanted to like this game, a spiritual successor to Limbo seemed like exactly my cup of tea, but its just too awkward to play and lacks enough story to be any more than a standard platformer puzzler with the same art style and a few more colors added in."

The puzzles, the platforming, the style, the soundtrack, nothing stands out in a good or bad way.And to be honest, I think it's way overpriced, and that's the main problem. It only took about three hours to do everything the game offers, and it's not outstanding enough for me to play through it more than twice.

Actually I like this style and was up for more of this kind. Toby looks and sounds really nice. It's not the technical side that keeps me from writing a good review. Toby is simply lacking fresh ideas. Everything in the game feels like we've seen it a billion times before. The game play feels half hearted and unrefreshing but most of all, Toby fails to deliver joy. I simply didn't have fun playing this game that is even shorter than Limbo. Three hours - that's not much, that's disappointing. But to be honest, I was glad when those 3 hours were over and the final ""boss"" defeated. I died many many times, and many times it felt perfectly random. Trial and error dominates Toby from the beginning to the very end. Especially at the end as the mentioned boss fight is pretty much a question of good luck. Not ""hard"" in the meaning of challenging, but ""random"". See, I really really love platformers, just playing this one felt like a chore. It's like the makers had a bad day and decided to develop a game to annoy us. Mission accomplished."

But NO this game looks like the photos but the entire time i played it for about 20 min it didnt feel good. Its not what I expected. The feeling of playing the game is completly different than limbo so if your debating this or limbo get limbo. :)

I would recommend it if you enjoy platform games with unique puzzles and atmospheric art. The game has many levels so you won't burn through it in an hour or two and it can be replayed since there are hidden friends on each levels that you can save.

Despite the description saying otherwise, I don't find it very similar to Nihilumbra.Pros+ Great sound and graphics+ Chillaxing gameplay+ Great monster designsCons- Some physics bugs- Some puzzle are only made challenging by hiding the paths and switches- Feels a bit slow and simple after playing Oscura Lost Light"

If you were hoping for Limbo II, you won't quite find it here.That said, I have nothing but respect for the game. The install size is tiny by modern standards yet the amount of artistic vision and mechanics it manages to cram into the game is fantastic. The world certainly looks impressive and coherent. There are oddities, particulary in the death mechanics, but those can be forgiven as the controls are very crisp and predictable. Surface angle seems to affect jumps, but that's just yet another predictable thing to get used to.Where this game falls short of Limbo, though, is the puzzles. They are somewhere between easy and tedious, with none of the atmosphere but an extra helping of ""do it again, stupid!"". Timing is very important, but unpredictable starting positions make this a twitch-gamers heaven and a ""practice practice practice"" players worst nightmare.At this point, where 2D platfomers have already had their renaissance, for all its technical achievements mechanically this game is a bit lacking. Still, if you don't mind a punishing 2D platformer that requires brain as well as brawn, then by all means go for it."

You can finisht it in about 1h 30 mins.The looks are really gorgeous and the music is nice to but too repetitive for me.Also I didn't really like the ending. Though it will have like more emotions maybe little cutscene and change of music but no.Not worth 10 euros in my opinion. Got it for 2 so for that amount it's worth a try.

,Not Recommended,395160,29050533,Posted: 5 January,all,Marquis de Marx,"The game looks great, no doubt about that. The graphics makes me think of Limbo and Badland. The gameplay makes you think of Limbo, but with more traps, but that is where the good ends. The game features almost no real puzzles. The controls feel clunky. The runspeed feels to slow and you always jump the same height, no matter if you release the jump button or hold it in. The myriad of traps sometimes require you to die on them to know they are there, which becomes tedious after a while. You never get a sense that you are exploring, rather just avoiding whatever trap is currently on the screen. The game is short and mostly too easy. The hardest part is probably the last level, because the enemies flinging bombs seem very random, so it's just try until you make it. Halfway through I was bored, but I continued on anyway. An underwhelming experience, to say the least."

The visual style was alright, though the ""camera"" tended to jump and wander around a lot (really annoying after each death...). The puzzles and traps tended not to be very fun. You just died and died until you figured it out, but you don't learn anything from any of it. Besides a few very subtle visual cues (but only some of the time), there's no way to avoid the next trap but sheer dumb luck. The platforming was a little lacking, as well, I tended to get hung up on corners and walls, and it was really hard to tell what was or was not going to be a platform or obstacle. Finally, I found the swinging platforms really annoying, and one time I got stuck to one of them (!) so that when I moved it moved me+platform in whatever direction (I couldn't jump off and couldn't die and just had to restart the level).The best way to sum it up is that I missed two of the ""friends"" on my first playthrough and I don't find the gameplay compelling enough to try to find them."
