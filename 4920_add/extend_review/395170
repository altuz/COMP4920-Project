76561198090900858,Not Recommended,395170,32332670,Posted: 10 June,all,Rimehaze,"Look, I've played my fair share of retro 2D style, pixel graphics-esque indie horror games like Lone Survivor, The Final Station, Claire, Uncanny Valley, Home, Reveal the Deep, Settled, The Last Door, etc.Distraint… doesn’t live up to the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review. I have no qualms about the graphics, sound, atmosphere, or puzzles—they were decent.My issue with this game was THE PLOT. The plot was laughably cliché, the characters were one-dimensional caricatures with no emotional depth, and the symbolism was heavyfisted.Stories that focus on the protagonist’s guilt and horrific manifestations of said guilt actually require the protagonist to have actually DONE something guilt-worthy. Like killing their wife. Stealing from an elderly couple in order to survive only to find that they have died of starvation the next day.… Working for the IRS doesn’t constitute as a soul-crushingly guilty action. It’s a JOB.If my landlord kicks me out because I can’t pay the rent, is he a morally-deprived landlord? Hell no, it’s just business.Same logic applies in this game. Just because Price is the harbinger of bad news doesn’t mean he has to shoulder the personal burden of evicting the residents out of their apartments to the point where blood-smeared elephants are chasing him through endless hallways.The moral of this game is that GREED = BAD. Yet Price wasn’t greedy—he was trying to make a decent living. He’s clearly very poor, judging from the decrepit state of his apartment from the ruined kitchen to the leaks in his ceiling. His parents are dead, despite the fact Price is in his 20-30’s. He’s an underdog, trying to survive in a tough world—and he immediately gets lambasted for pursuing the most unpopular career known to mankind. Sorry, but someone has to do it."

As being Jesse Makkonen's second game so far - yup, a one man made wonder here - it's been completed in 3 months as a challenge. With this astounding time and labor limit, I must say that the result is praiseworthy. The game is short, strikingly disturbing and symbolic with a plot so ordinary, you'd wonder how it came to be found worthy enough to tell as a story. Yet, this simplicity bears the beauty of it all. I personally enjoyed every second of it, and would gladly recommend taking on this 2 hours journey, if you enjoy horror settings and subconscious symbolisms.The name of the game comes to be quite self-explanatory actually. You play as a young and ambitious man named Price, who has been trying to gain partnership from a famous company. He is not a bad guy really, but he bears the burden of choosing one of the least favorable career paths known to humanity: poor little Price is a sequestrator, and he is responsible of seizing people's properties when they cannot pay their debts. As the game starts, our first task is to distrain an old lady's home. Since Mrs. Goodwin's husband is long dead, and she doesn't have much favorable assets in the pragmatic sense, a heartbreaking end awaits her, and poor little Price is tasked with arranging that end. The moment he delivers the news, his guilt begins to take root and this guilt starts to manifest as strikingly gruesome hallucinations. As the game progresses, Price realizes that he indeed sold his humanity rather cheap.Now this game has been somewhat criticized in the community, that collecting debts shouldn't be considered evil since it’s just a job, you know, not the mother of all evil. Thus, business shouldn't be the cause of guilt and a crippled conscience. Right? Now, this is an ethical debate and it is the exact kind of question this game wishes for you to ask yourselves. This context of business is the perfect cover for the proverbial elephant in the room: - which you'll literally encounter more than once in the game - if a deed could be pragmatically indorsed and lawfully justified at the same time, the substance of the action or its end result doesn't reach our conscience. Business is business nonetheless. The narrative and symbolism within the game are quite basic, simplistic even. Yet, they criticize this specific self-justification very successfully. If an action is deemed just, it doesn't also necessarily be considered good or kind.For a 2D scroller horror adventure, character and environment design within the game are really well elaborated. There is a certain sense of desolateness in all places, a neglect and a darkness. Subtle symbolisms of small sceneries are well-woven. Cute, bubble headed character designs used in especially gory displays throughout the game really startle you. As another huge display quality, both the soundtrack and the sound effects are masterfully arranged and utilized to enhance the atmosphere furthermore, even inducing a couple jump scares. The game pace is a mostly low growing adventure, with simple puzzles and a couple of timing actions with no actual threat to you character at all. The whole experience wraps up within 2 hours, and casualTwin Peaksreferences are a nice bonus.Now thatDISTRAINT 2is already announced to come for this winter, I can sincerely recommend this short experience for a silent night. It might be considered a bit expensive for the full price, with this short of a completion time, so the next sale would be as grand as any to try. I congratulate Jessi Makkonen to go under this feat and present us the subconscious of poor little Price.

76561198063237740,Not Recommended,395170,33021137,Posted: 29 June,all,Farkles,"First off, I wanna say, props to Jesse for putting this together in 3 months.  It's obvious a lot of work went into the game, and it's awesome that he was able to get it completed.This game is, artistically, beautiful.  I absolutely HATE retro graphic, 2D side scrollers, but this one really changed my mind.  The music and sound effects were amazing, the characters were well drawn and had neat swaying motions.  The game looks nice.But it does not play nice.  No, no.  This game is slow and a snooze-fest.  The 'puzzles' aren't puzzles.  You walk from point A to point B to point C, back to point B, and then maybe over to point D.  There isn't really a whole lot of logic involved in these puzzles.  The hitboxes for selection can also be wonky at times, so you can easily skip over certain action items.  Act 3, I had to actually use a guide, since there is no map/point of reference to where you've been.  You just wander aimlessly and go down a memory checklist, hoping you are going in the correct direction.Price also moves at a snail's pace.  It's fine at first, because you get to see the art, but during segments like I have described above, it makes the game about twice as long as it needs to be (my playtime was idle, I spent an hour 15 actually playing).  It just gets dull, and the story needs to move along.The writing is absolutely horrendous.  The other negative reviewers hit the nail on the head.  The story reads like an edgy highschooler's emo diary.  It's trying to make some deep statement against 'the man' and how debt collection is somehow inherently evil (???).  Isn't it just as evil to NOT pay your debts?  Yea, moral relativism is a pain, I know.Also, it seems that Jesse couldn't decide on a tone for the game.  Price goes from ""I'm so sorry madam..."" and ""I'm an evil whippersnapper"" to ""[Expletive]!"" ""[Expletive]!"" ""[Expletive]!"" at random times.  It is just all over the place.  There are weird drug-induced mushroom castles one moment and blood covered walls the next.  I did like the creepy ambiance that the game provided though, I am not a big horror buff, so I did jump a few times.All this said, the game was 99 cents, and it WAS an experience.  I do not believe that it is a good game, by any definition of the word, and the Overwhelmingly Positive review is mind boggling to me.  If you wanna blow an hour and play a poorly written, yet pretty game, then DISTRAINT is for you.I do not regret purchasing it.  However, I do not feel like I would recommend it.Edit:  Removed unnecessary vitriol towards people who did enjoy the game."

Money rule the world and feelings are buried under the ground. But, only with money, you will be never fully happy and you will never give a true sense to your life....This short story is more than a game. This is actually a full morale lesson for everyone that will play this game in the correct way.Don't buy this game if you want just to have fun or relax, buy this game because you really want it and you are really intrested in the hidden messages inside of it; because with this game you will learn again to:- Keep a promise- Think twice about your decisions- Don't be greedy- Money don't give you happiness and completeness in this worldThe game is a 2D based ""adventure"" where you play the role of a worker for a expropriations agency.The gameplay itself is pretty much linear with several puzzles in all the situations. There will be only one way to play but I really suggest to play this game twice not only for the hidden achivements but to understand better the story itself.The choice of the music is really sweet and helps a lot to transmit feelings to the player. It will even give you the chills during the ""horror"" parts.Graphically don't expect a lot of ""sweet effects"" but the choice of the colors and the ""noir"" style gives a quite good look to the narration.You can play this game both with keyboard or a 360 XboX controller.In the end: for being a game made from a single person with the help of his wife this is a quite amazing experience. Again, as I said in the beginning, do not buy this game if you are simply looking for fun or you will never fully enjoy this game.Overall:Graphic: 7/10Sounds: 8/10Longevity: 5/10Morale: 9/10"

,Recommended,395170,24580039,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,roa-kun,"Distraint is a good example of a classic indie game, that was created first and foremost for the sake of the story which the author wanted to share with everyone. It combines a bit of a direct narrative, a bit of environmental storytelling and some atmospheric sound design to deliver its message.The message in question in this kind of games games is a highly subjective thing, and if you're interested in the game, you better make your own opinion of it, but my version comes under the spoiler:People ruin lives of other people for what appears a considerable wealth to them, when in reality it's more like 2 cents. They're not making their lives better, as making the lives of everyone around worse, which is why everything declines.Distraint has a sound story, not those pretentious ""boy longes for a girl in a platformer game"" setups you see these days. And because this game is a one man effort, its every component (be it graphics, puzzles, sound, or visual effects) is really consistent with the storytelling, providing a very solid overall experience.Technically, this game is a 2D adventure with a dystopic setting and lots of horror elements.The game has 4 main levels (based on story arcs), with an addition of several smaller levels made for the sake of artistic exposition. Don't worry, though, Distraint is not a walking simulator - you'll have to solve multiple puzzles to progress through each of the main stages. There is also a nice degree of funny interactions you can make by applying items from your inventory to unexpected targets. After each story arc is done, you return to the protagonist's apartments to wrap things up.Speaking of the horror elements, they are made not so much to scare you, as to make an accent on some point of the story or develop a charachter trait. Overall, it works well, the game doesn't create suspense, but rather a feeling of phantasmagoria, and does it quite elaborately, so it doesn't fall apart as a bunch of random nonsense. Also, the game has some really good findings in horror department.THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOMEven though Distraint has a relatively slow pace, it really makes you wonder what will happen next. And what happens next really can come off as a surprise - or as a deppressingly accurate prediction.Currently, SteamSpy estimates Distraint to have around 32k owners, and it definetly deserves more attention. If you miss the feeling of the game made by a single author, you should definetly play Distraint.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steamCRIMINALLY Low Salescurator."
,Not Recommended,395170,31581543,Posted: 6 May,all,Jåzzy,"Didn't think it was all that great. Both the message and the scares seemed hamfisted.There were moments of tension, when a scary noise or ominous thing was going on, but whatever the game revealed as a source of  that tension was never that scary, and I felt a lot of potentially scary moments were thrown away by poor reveals.While playing through this game, I was rather disappointed with it. After finishing it, I suppose I can't be that hard on it. It's a 99 cent game made by one guy over three months. He should be proud to make anything this good.That said, I wound not recommend this game to anyone, unless they really liked... eh, whatever this sorta game is."

That scares people.In all seriousness though, a very good short story with simple and non-repetitive puzzles (At least the ones that make you agitated about having to do it again).

,Not Recommended,395170,33461810,Posted: 11 July,all,♣ Coraline Castell ♣,"distraint (dɪˈstreɪnt)(Law) law the act or process of distraining; distressIn one word,DISTRAINTis ""inconsistent"".ForewordThis review containsmild spoilerssince this title's weaker points, those I chastise the most throughout the review, are plot-related. Crucial aspects of the plot, however, arenotdisclosed in this review.General impressionsI feel it is important to open this review by saying that by no stretch of the mind didDISTRAINTlive up to its ""overwhelmingly positive"" status. I also feel like this is one of those reasonably good, short, often discounted — and therefore cheap — titles that, for those reasons alone, attract a barrage of people that find no imminent reason to give it a thumbs down but instead find easy means of writing a two line review giving it a thumbs up.It is a ridiculously easy task to recommendDISTRAINTby means of a single paragraph review praising Jesse for his one-man handiwork, artistic skills and creativity. It is, however, much more taxing to look past that mask of success and into the misery that must be the life of a badly scripted businessman who can't decide between good, wrong, insanity and sanity and, for the love of me, seems to live in world where every evicted place reeks of a profound degradation, much like his own home.Where it succeedsThe artofDISTRAINTis one that catches the eye even of those who do not normally appreciate pixel art. It is expressive and helps set the sad and hopeless atmosphere presented throughout the game.The premiseis one hardly seen anywhere else. A video game played in the shoes of a businessman had everything to turn out terribly due to its similarities with real life, but Jess put it all fearlessly on the table without making players flinch away.The music, although not particularly noteworthy, works to the game's benefit and its attempt at an atmosphere, rather than against it.Where it tumblesThe script, even if not ridden with typos, is weak and inconsistent. Be it Price, Price's parents, Price's managers or the evictees,DISTRAINTwobbles between their facades as though it wasn't too sure about its own characters. The disharmony in Price's personality does not translate to the player by means of conflicted writing, but instead by writing conflicts. The final straw of that is Price's final decision, which is as predictable as it is final towards completely snuffing out what could have been a brilliant character progression or, perhaps, a light of hope.The puzzlesare as weak as they come as they resort to timing, trial and error (with much grunting involved), and even a terrible word puzzle.The level designwas the source of many difficulties through the game. Sometimes the only thing that made getting from point A to point B taxing was how awfully designed the levels were. They included, but were not limited to: getting off the path or playing longer sequences just to save the game, going round and round due to missing a door by 5 second since Price's mysterious ""narcotic"" wore out (I'm referring to the third distraint, the worst of them all in every single aspect), having to stand at aprecisespot facing the right direction in order to interact with people or things, walking in pitch-black darkness, having to randomly guess the order to do things despite no indication of so and, finally, an inconsistent difficulty balance. I could go on, but these annoyed me the most.The horroris not psychological, is not jump-scary and is most definitely not built around an atmosphere. The horror is just straight-upweak. Sometimes it was gore-related — cannibalism is one example and a Fargo-inspired scene another —, sometimes it took the form of something that moved in the corner of your eye, sometimes it was just a random explosion of sound. During all those instances, my blank expression persisted and my nostalgia of atmospheric games grew ever stronger.Conclusion""Inconsistent""is my word of choice forDISTRAINTbecause even its tiny details do not add up. Price's madness is selective, people hide passwords behind word puzzles — and this isnotPuzzle Agent! —, an elderly woman attempts breaking into a cemetery with a crowbar that you then proceed to steal from her in order to break into a man's backyard while you are trying to seek redemption for your bad deeds, a nursery home is worse than the worst real-life nursery homes just because itcanbe, and there is absolutely no reason, by end-game, to care about any of the characters so shallowly presented.PerhapsDISTRAINT's biggest inconsistency is feasting on the assumption that everyone who evicts anyone for a living is, by consequence, trying to copulate with Satan due to greed. Yes, even when that means finally getting the funds for a morning coffee."

From its unnerving horror, which keeps you at the edge of your seat to its rich characters, 'DISTRAINT' is an unforgettable look into the best and worst of people, and what we do to ourselves and one another.Where so much of indie horror fails with boring design, broken gameplay, bad storytelling or a combination of those, 'DISTRAINT' is a breath of fresh air for the genre.

Yes, he isthatguy. To his credit, he seems to have a conscience, and that is where the psychological horror comes from here. We see him struggle with his own demons and his own decisions, as he races towards a promotion.Distraint will take you to a world that is obscure and ruthless, yet its inhabitants are charming characters with oversized heads while tackling various themes such as greed, compassion and depression in a compelling and unique fashion. It takes some unexpected turns, but doesn’t rely on disgusting imagery to weird you out, as this game has more fun playing with your mind. I wouldn’t say that this is a frightening game, but a few jump scares are executed pretty well. This is a particularly good thing in story-driven games, especially when its aim is to convey a message to the player. No need to worry about dying either; the worst that could happen to you is lingering on a puzzle.Speaking of puzzles, they are relatively simple, yet clever. Some involves a considerable amount of walking back and forth, and some segments also introduce innovative ways to progress further into Price’s living nightmare ( I won't spoil it here). And the gameplay is... well, you can walk from left to right and vice-versa, the controls are pretty standard: W,A,S,D to move, E for the action button, F to use your lantern and spacebar to open inventory.To sum it up, Distraint is short but sweet. It's a game with an intriguing storyline and a decent sense of humour among the horror.  It’s a carefully developed and intriguing video game, made by one man that is worth your time."

It often follows a metaphysical thread, blurring dreams and hallucinations with reality- and really commits to it too, which in essence is vital to its' success.Suspense is king here and at appropriate times it provided a jump, or a dropped a twisted revelation you didn't quite see coming. The moments in between are sprinkled with subtle humour in dialogue and interactions that reminded me of getting the giggles playing games like Final Fanasy IX. The art style is fantastic in my opinion, and the dev clearly has a talent for giving flavour to the environment and characters.The game also provides one particularly excellent and memorable mind bending spacial/ temporal trippy puzzle sequence that rivals Braid at its very best (drugs, all the drugs).There isn't much to criticise, but being nitpicky, I found most of the puzzles and inventory items to be a bit too 'neat' and convenient- not an uncommon problem in adventure style games. All of that is forgiven when it throws out some funny dialogue when you try to put some item where it clearly doesn't belong. I love it when a game has a dig at you, the player, for beng dumb or whimsical.I would highly recommend this one. I got it on sale but I think it's well worth the full price."

I don't like horror games, but here wasn't much of it, so it was just a little bit creepy, especially playing at night with lights off.Anyway, my point is.. This game must be played if you're 18-20 and older, otherwise you wouldn't understand what the game is trying to tell you.The ending was pretty predictable, but nevertheless powerful.

So, how is it exactly possible that I only heard about this game a couple of days ago, 16 months after its first release?DISTRAINT is a small side-scrolling adventure game, with a very interesting psychological horror theme, well crafted using pixel art. I won't reveal much about the story, to let the player discover what it's about, I'll just say it's about life choices, and how much of an impact we can have on other people's lives without us even knowing. The plot is not very complex, but it's well written and always coherent with what I think this game wants to be (just a ""window"" on a difficult topic, without judging really, just willing to say ""hey, think about this sometimes"") so DISTRAINT not being extremely complex is a specific design choice, in my opinion. Puzzles are very easy, more designed to keep the flow going than to give a real challenge to the player, and the italian translation is pretty good. Graphics and sound are extremely interesting, both contributing to create the right vibe, from despair to anxiety or even hope. The use of colors and the dosage of lights and dark spots give life to a couple of very powerful moments.I would not say it reaches the heights of ""The Cat Lady"" which for me it's probably one of the best examples of deep, mature, complex psychological thriller story, but it's definitely in the same ballpark. Thumbs up."

Distraint is an horror 2D game , and despite every horror game on steam that looks like the same , and are just a cheap version or popular horror games ( for example we have seen so many clones of slender man , or the mechanism of outlast and the camera which every single horror game these days have ) ,DISTRAINT even thought is a low budget and not a long game ( probably 1-2 hours gameplay) MAKES the time you play WORTH IT! It has   beautiful atmosphere , and  while i played the game i had questions and it made me think about my morality and whats right and wrong to do while you are desperate or need money or help . The game isnt perfect of course ( well which game is !? ) i have found some small grammar errors  and i am fine with them , the developers have tried really hard and this game clearly is a must buy for players who like  2d horror games.And one final thing abou the price , i think at 5 euros ITS  A  MUST BUY GAME , but i see the game usually at an -75% or more so even if you as a player dont like 2d horror games at such a low price you can try this game for yourself and see how great its senario and atmosphere are.I really look forward for their next game."

First and foremost it’s a small game in every respect. It’s made by a one man team in a very short time and that show in everything from the length of the story and the assets used to the somewhat unpolished UI.Mr. Makkonen is also Finnish and while obviously being quite fluid in his English there are some weird sentences and grammar not spotted in the proof reading. Sometimes it also feels like nuances in the dialogue has been lost in the translation.With those reservations aside however I very much enjoyed the few hours it took to complete. The narrative feels fresh and the characters, while not overly complex, feels human enough to care for.The story itself is about a man whose life choices doesn’t add up to his own moral compass, and the internal consequences of a life lived not true to oneself. The graphical horror could be said to represent his deteriorating self image, and the ending while quite obvious felt like a natural conclusion to the story.Highly recommended for fans of Makkonens unique style and fans of psychological horror looking for something very different."

The games narrative and great pace will surely drag you in, and what's gonna keep you there are the many, many emotional moments. Interestingly enough, the latter manages to be both one of the games strengths as well as a weakness.In my opinion, Distraint's biggest shortcoming is the extremely black and white view on a morally gray situation where in reality, you won't find those cartoony sides of pure good and pure evil. I personally believe that a slightly more balanced and objective viewpoint would have strengthened the story, and it would still have been able to create a just as gripping experience. It might even have made the story even more thought-provoking.Distraint's simple but well made art style, full of personality and just the right color scheme, creates a beautifully grim atmosphere and gives life and a soul to the characters, making you care about the ones whos lives you as Price comes to affect. The gameplay as well as the puzzles are straight forward (though I have to admit that I was stuck in one of the puzzle sequences for an embarrassingly long time). It's a linear game, but because the story and the emotional trips sticks with you after you've finished them, you might want to experience it all a second time.It's worth noting that the game is a one-man project. You can tell a lot of effort was put into this and its price (no pun intended) is low for what it offers. I'm looking forward to see more from this developer!"

The story is very unique, and I wonder now whether that uniqueness is part of what left me feeling like I was just grinding it out in the end, because I was never really emotionally invested in the protagonist's ""victims""? The horror was underdone, and I say that because Distraint starts off strong, but by about 2/3 of the way through it pretty much ceases to exist. In a lot of ways this makes it feel like you are playing two separate games - One that has the bones of a great shock-horror, and then later it is watered down to a semi-emotional scrolling sim with plenty of drug use. Likewise, the soundtrack starts off pretty well, and then just dulls down with the horror aspect of the gameplay.The reason I can't be super harsh in my evaluation of this game however, is that it was only a three month project start to finish. Yes it shows, and yes it is a little more frustrating than if the game was just completely rubbish the whole way through, but it is still pretty well on par for games around the $2-$3 mark even though they would have had far more time invested in most cases. Distraint is solid enough of a game that it asks the question of other games in its price range, ""What did you actually deliver for all that time you spent?""

Depending on the length of the game, they could possibly get away with charging more. As far as I've played, however, it absolutely is worth every penny I paid.The game is very creepy, and the art style on serves to add to that. It's got a simple plot to follow, and the dialogue is excellent. For me, I'm not a fan of voice acting because it's usually done so poorly, and this game is just text, which is nice.When debating on getting a game, you really need to put it into terms like this: Do I get what I pay for? Considering you can pay about 15 dollars at the theater to see a 2 hour movie, I'd say I got way more than I paid for. Great game."

That really takes the cake for me.Although, I can say that the puzzles and such do get boring sometimes.  The one near the end where you get high on green stuff is pretty challenging though.  That one took me an hour or two.In the end, it's really just whether you're ready to deal with the slow movement of the game.  If you can, the horror and story are a plentiful reward.The loop continues."

First off, my internet connection is REALLY slow so finding this game (Which had a download of less than 100 MB) was appealing. I didn't expect much, but what I got was a short but good story and difficult puzzles to solve.While the game was too slow-paced for it's short play time, that is compensated by the beautiful graphics and lighting it has. I enjoyed them a lot as they helped on adding depth to the enviorment, with a slighty creepy touch.Overall, I feel like the price I payed for it was NOT wasted money.

,Recommended,395170,30676502,Posted: 22 March,all,Dark Blue Monkey,"Distraint is a lovely little quirky game.   The game plays through as a combination of 2d walking and talking simulator, with a little bit of Use-X-on-Y puzzle logic problems.   The puzzles are nice and simple, and mostly involve walking back and forth a lot, trying things on things.  For the most part, the puzzles are solved in a few seconds, and don't get in the way of the narrative.The background story is that you're a repo agent, climbing the ladder in an organisation.  The trouble is... you keep being given the nasty jobs, and your conscience is starting to get the better of you. Soon, it becomes a struggle against your rebelling conscience... Or... are you really just starting to see the truth about yourself?The environment is built from interconnected 2d side-on areas,  lovingly drawn  and split between apartment blocks, woods, a cemetary, a hospital and the offices of your employer.  Each 'episode' (i.e. day) involves the same overall goal (serve a Distraint on someone), with the same ""Before you can do it, you must do me a favour"" quest which has kept Bethesda in cookie money for all these years...  However, each day takes place in a different location, and the quests become more and more unusual as the game goes on.At the end of the game, if you've been paying attention, you'll pretty much made your mind up on what's going on.  The game does its best to lay it all out for you on a platter.  BUT, and this is a big but, as soon as you've finished playing it through, go back and play it again.  Some things will start to make a LOT more sense.  You won't regret it.  And believe me, after re-doing a chunk of the playthrough, you'll start to change your mind about whether the game has been altogether truthful with you.The graphics are very pixelly and simplistic, with very charicatured actors.  However, the game uses sprite warping, film grain and other little effects to break out of the ""pixel art"" style that other games (like Home) use.  Most of the levels are grey, splashed only with colour to accentuate certain items, which works exceedinly well.    There's a lot of variety in the graphics.  The game doesn't rely too much on reusing stock backgrounds or items.   Each area is unique, each interaction unique, and there's a lot of nice gfx to show that the artists were really earning their pay (fog, coloured lighting, drifting trails, splatter.. all sorts).  The graphics are genuinely impressive.The background audio is largely that weird discordant strings thing that horror movies use when things are going to hell in a handbasket.  It certainly adds a lot of atmosphere, and there are some moments where you're genuinely on edge, largely because of the sounds.    Occasionally a little music will play, or the background will change a little to highlight the change of scenery.Since there's no vocal dialog, it's all text, there's a little b-b-b-b-b-blip sound which can be changed if the default is too grating. (I stuck with the default).   The text is well written, with few typos, and tells the story of the protagonist's fall from sanity well.   The different colouring of the text is reminiscent of Teletext subtitles, and helps differentiate speakers.The controls are all keys, using WASD, E and space for everything.    This means I can sip my tea while playing, which is nice :) There's no mouse control.  Since the levels are side-on 2d, you just need left-and-right anyway!The game has a lot of 'heart', and you'd have to be pretty soulless not to pity the plight of poor Mrs. Goodwin.  I was geniunely happy when the credits rolled and she makes one final appearance (you'll see).The game takes a few hours to play through, but if you decide to play it through again, you can speed-run it in under an hour by just hammering the 'e' key to step through the dialogue.I can recommend Distraint.  If you're not too jaded, it's a moving tale, with some little jump-scares, some horror elements, and a lot to make you look at yourself critically.  I really enjoyed playing it, and will certainly go and hug the first widowed granny I come across.  OK, it's not for everyone, but I think it's good for the majority.. :)Remember: What goes around, comes around!"
76561197968305227,Not Recommended,395170,32097437,Posted: 31 May,all,ChaosEngine,"I have to give the creator credit for making this in the short timeframe he did. Visually, it's just as professional as bigger studio efforts. It really looks good, and clearly a lot of effort went into the creation of the whole package. Quality looks, quality sound... But something's missing. I'm having trouble understanding why this is rated as overwhelmingly positive. Not to say that I couldn't be wrong, but I felt Distraint missed the mark, and suffers from a bit of an identity problem, trying to be too many things at once.My biggest issue is that is markets itself as a horror game in the vein of something like Lone Survivor. The problem is that, aside from very few disturbing moments, you're never really in danger. The storyline almost completely avoids the horror aspect and instead deals with feelings of guilt, humanity, and inability to cope with the demands of the main character's job. Unfortunately, instead of taking a dramatic tack, that inability manifests itself in horrific hallucinations that are just jarring in transition.I don't know, it could just be me, but I can't recommend Distraint, not when there are more focussed horror and dramatic games out there. That being said, this was also rated as overwhelmingly positive, so maybe other people are getting something out of it that I didn't."

Other people have already pointed out some flaws in the reviews, and I agree with them. For a game with a quite simple and short story, you spend a lot of time just walking around. The distances are too long and checking hallways or other places that exist for no reason is annoying. Most of this can be forgiven since it's a cheap indie game; what my negative review boils down to is my inability to finish the game due to a bug in the last chapter/part. Since there is also only one checkpoint, I am completely unable to return to an earlier save.I contemplated starting a new save since it is a short game, but finally decided that I would get no enjoyment of any kind out of it. And that's why I do not think it's a good game, since playing it isn't fun or exiting due to how slow paced and clunky it is.[MILD SPOILERS BELOW]I do disagree with some other reviews on the story and morale being bad, though. Few big name companies want to draw attention to how companies exploit the poor and how people taking part in it to better their lives are to blame too. The point is that Price realizes he can at least do something about his part in everything, and that's a good thing in my opinion. It is a little hamfisted but still, I don't think it's a bad thing to point out how throwing ill old people on the streets to die is immoral, no matter how much rent or taxes they haven't been able to play."

Over time he begins to question himself over the morality of this activity and this dilemma is what the progression of the game centres around.The game's strong points reside in the aesthetically pleasing pixellated artstyle and colours that tie inwith the main tone of the story, leading to the next point; story. Distraint tells an interesting story that makes the listener want more and concludes very well. As well as this, the game's soundtrack is very well done.Listed as horror, Distraint puts the player on edge at points but never overdoes it, which I appreciate.Although not for players who enjoy a faster paced AAA experience, I highly advise you pick up this game for under 1$ as it goes on sale frequently."

The plot is refreshing and interesting - sort of a humanity vs money theme - and graphics are simple but still charming.The first mission was more about the story and i loved it. The second story started having some pointless running around and then followed a passage with lots of similar doors and that's when it started becoming a glorified memory game. I still powered through because i wanted to see the ending.But the third mission... *sigh*The third mission took the memory & pointless running around mechanics, amplified them and added a timer....... That was the nail to its coffin for me. And although i'm having a difficult time not recommending a game that has gotten so many positive reviews, i'm sorry... but it's just not worth my time."

Many sudden scary moments are very predictable or resort down to Blood, at times this felt exactly like reading your average videogame creepypasta.Considering the lack of gameplay, the short lenght, the very easy puzzles, the predictable story and the rather lazy attempt at horror, i can't really recommend this game, even for it's cheap price, especially because there are way better alternatives out there for the same price."

It never helped that a lot of the times i got stuck it was because i had missed something miniscule, like a sideways door, indicated only by a thin line of pixels at the edge of the screen. This also ties in to the fact that this game is extremely disorienting. Recycling sprites and backgrounds is fine, but when the areas look like the same grainy dark monochrome hallway it ends up boring and irritating having to trudge back and forth several times.Ultimately this was a game that i wanted to like, but between my irritation with it, and the cop-out ending for the protagonist, i can't bring myself to recommend it to others."

Sure, it may be a little overpriced regularly since the game does only last two hours, but there's always sales happening, so it's not hard to grab it at a cheaper price.Storywise, I liked Distraint a lot. The main character is human in his actions, especially with the moral dilemmas that he has. Personally, I liked all the surreal horror. It was done pretty well, and blurred the lines between what was real and what your character was just making up. There weren't a ton of jumpscares, and some of the scares were pretty unsettling (and that's coming from a person who isn't unsettled very easily). There was a great atmosphere that only got weirder as the story progressed.In terms of improvement, the spelling errors and typos should really be fixed, considering how vital the dialogue is to the story. A misspelling really takes me out of the action. That, and some variations in the character's walking speed would be nice, considering there are times that you're supposed to be running away, and the character only does the same little waddle that he's been doing the whole game. That means to me that he's not scared, or everything else is just really, really slow.Other than that, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for $0.99 to any horror fan. It's fun, with a lot of things that you wouldn't expect to see.8/10 would be terrified of capitalism again."

The atmosphere is well, though the horror is pretty much just a gag unless related to the bloody elephant. I'm enjoying the game until I reached the third level, including huffing drugs to travel from room to room. Gives me a headache and the directions are confusing. The time limit for the drugs is very, VERY short considering where I need to go all at once. I tried following the walkthrough but I just ended up getting lost. I'd appreciate it if that level were easier and less confusing.Otherwise, great game. I enjoy the storyline and the message it gives. Just need to find my way through the third distraint...."

76561198067001787,Recommended,395170,32038344,Posted: 29 May,all,The chaser,"Definitely a nice game, 8/10 overall:-The graphics are quite basic, to be honest. It's not the best part, of course, but it definitely does its job. Really dark and unsettling in many parts of the game, with fair contrast between many zones, especially ""safe"" ones.-Sound: Doesn't have much sound engineering, to be honest. It doesn't need it much, anyways. However, music is outstanding in this context, it can get very stressing and can make the player feel nervous, which is good, and it can also make it easy to cry in certain parts (didn't do it, but almost did ;_;).-History: Now, this is where it shines brilliantly. Althought it's really lineal and offers no choice of different outcomes, it definitely builds well and progresses in a way that really gets the player to think about Price's actions. I'm not going to say what happens, just that the player itself can get to hate what it is doing.-Gameplay: It lacks a bit of fluidity. Personally, I felt it way too clunky, in the sense that navigation through the map can be a bit exhausting, and the puzzles are more solved by randomly using items on stuff than actually thinking. Not that it is intended in any way, but at least it was like this for me. Also, it may have gotten way too short, but this is more a personal feeling than anything else.That concludes my analysis. Perhaps I have missed some things, I don't know. In any case, I have said most of the things I had to.TL,DR: Really nice story and music, don't expect much from the rest of parts. In any case, definitely worth."

,Recommended,395170,31984521,Posted: 26 May,all,Sicarius,"The best way I can describe it is delightfully creepy.  If jump scares are not your thing, this game is for you since there are essentially no jump scares.  Instead, this game has alot of double-take moments that further the creepy atmosphere.  At the same time, the playful art style and subtle humor throughout keep it from getting to you too much.  I recommend it to the casual horror gamer."
,Recommended,395170,32001097,Posted: 27 May,all,The Lord of the Shadows,"This is a storytelling horror game so don't expect action or complex puzzles. In fact most are straight forward and obvious. Also it relies quite much on jumpscares with sudden noises and / or light going on or off.Besides that the story is really good, even if so dark, and you should play a second time just to see what you've surely skipped or didn't pay attention to on your first one.Overall is a good game even if quite short. If you play it reading everything and checking every single spot you can finish it in 1 - 2 hours. If you rushed it probably 20 mins would be enough. Since it has non-descriptive achievements, if you enjoy exploring, you can try to find those without checking any guide out and make your playtime longer."

The atmosphere is really thick and the sound design is amazing and it is very clear that games like Silent Hill where a big influence. The ""cute ""bobble head"" style characters also makes things even more creepy. I don't want to speak to much about the game as to spoil the plot in any way but while I did not personally connect as deeply with the moral of the story as some, there are some parts toward the very end that I really loved. Finishing the game got me really exited for Distraint 2!"

76561198069735211,Recommended,395170,32792985,Posted: 25 June,all,DaHotFuzz,"Developed by a single guy in the timespan of 3 months, Distraint is an impressive little package that tells the tragic story of a man who finds himself, as part of his job, expropriating people from their homes.  A big theme explored here is guilt and the story unfolds itself by way of showing the player how the main character deals with this guilt as a result of his job.This 2D indie is a unique experience with an art style I haven't quite seen before.  It has a charm to it that you can easily appreciate.  For me personally, it reminded me of Silent Hill because of the many doors you open during the game and the symbolism all throughout, for example, guilt has a manifestation which you will see playing. There is also a bit of gore in Distraint but it's not excessive by any means.If you don't mind a sad narrative that explores meaningful themes and is thought-provoking, then Distraint is definitely worth your time.  I should note that at certain points in the game you may find yourself lost or have no idea how to progress; it happened to me a few times because the game does not hold your hand.  You need to pick up the pieces as you go and pay close attention in some areas.  If you get stuck though, there are guides that can help so it's no problem.Right now as of 6/25/17 Distraint is $1 and for that price you cannot go wrong."
