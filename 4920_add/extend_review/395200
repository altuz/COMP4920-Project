If you think the trailer looks fun then you're going to enjoy the hell out of this game! The game looks gorgeous with it's bright colors, use of lighting and shadows, and sounds awesome with it's heart-pumping electronic soundtrack. The controls feel tight enough while running, jumping, one-legged hopping, crawling, and head-rolling, but just clumsy enough to feel like you're a zombie. I love all the ways Ed can get dismembered and still progress forward whether he's got no legs or he's just a head! The game ramps up in difficulty and pace rather quickly but you'll have no trouble adapting and learning from your mistakes. You will die a lot, but there are checkpoints that you can respawn at allowing you to keep momentum. If you've ever played Dark Souls, imagine this game as one giant Sen's Fortress... on acid... with clowns... It's ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying and a lot of fun! Worth the $10!!https://youtu.be/Tczl7-H_FxU"

This game was so much fun and Challenging!!I played this game with a controller which I can say... you get the best experience with it than using a keyboard (well for me anyway)If you're planning on playing only 20 levels of the game ignoring the medals or cans, then this game will be fun to you!However... prepare to have your patience tested when trying to collect all 78 medals and/or 320 cans to unlock the 3 bonus levelsBut I wish there was a workshop for this game though...

McDunnough,"First off, just want to say I was brought here by Jim Sterling's positive review.I am really sick and tired of the whole zombie genre.  It has just been done so many times and with so little innovation in gameplay.  Well, this is it.  This is the zombie game nobody asked for but we always wanted.  ""Ben and Ed"" is one of the most charming and fun games I have played in quite a while.  It is a challenging 3D runner/platformer with a twist.  Ed (the zombie) can have his limbs procedurally knocked off from traps and blades.  What results is a hilarious game where you end up either crawling with no legs, hopping with one, or rolling as a lone head to the finish line.  The soundtrack is comprised of peppy 80's synth that reminds me of my mom's old exercise VHS tapes.  In a genre that has been dead (pun intended) ""Ben and Ed"" is a lively and fun indie game full of charm and originality.  I highly recommend it :)"

I bought this game for $4 instead of $10... and for that price I can't really complain. Sure the game glitches/crashes here and there or is difficult at times but its still very fun and challenging. Little over 3 hours in the game now and can't count how many times I wanted to rage... but here I am still playing it xD. Do I recommend this game? Yes I do... It may need a little work on it but its not a bad game.

76561198000230302,Recommended,395200,19574836,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,Yeager,"It feels like, that the hardest part about the game doesnt lie in the obstacles or the map you're playing, but rather in the mechanics. Landing on ur left foot instead of the right, can make u fall to x side, ultimately killing you. Problem is, u have no control over this. Your corpse sometimes have a bit more bounce than other times, having less bounce almost always ends in succes. This u cannot control either. Blades cut u in half regardless where u touch them, not just the sharp part. Just grazing a moving object can send u flying.The simple things like getting severed by a laser feels unsatisfying, when that laser sometimes propels u forward, backward, left or right, like u were hit by a flying mace.The game is definitely enjoyable, but it needs a LOT of tweaking.Edit.Overall it feels like a meh experience. The whole idea behind leaving ur limbs behind and dashing forward, untill u either finish or nothing remains, seems like a splendid and funny idea. It doesnt rly work in the game tho. Rather than running forward, u reset, because progress is no longer possible, simply cause u cant make the jump or cant dodge the income obstacles. Rendering one of the main selling points of the game completely useless."

,Recommended,395200,26462459,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Storveskr,"About the bugs:Now that the game is almost a year old, Ben and Ed has gone through quite a few bug fixes in order to make it playable and enjoyable. As of now, I haven't encountered a single problem in my most recent playthrough, which means that the developers have done a great job fixing all the minor bugs that still popped up every now and then. I have unlocked every single achievement during my playthrough, so I can confirm that all the achievement related bugs (Blockbuster) have been fixed aswell. Luckily, I have never experienced any visual or hardware related bugs, which means that I can't confirm anything related to that subject.Pros- Funny gameplay but challenging at the same time- Great game with quite some content if you're into 100%. There are lots of hidden collectibles (candymeat) and you get a trophy (golden Ed) for every checkpoint you pass unharmed. (see neutral)- Unique visuals with a nice themed level designNeutral- If you're into 100% a game, please note that this game contains an achievement(s) that is extremely hard, if not according to some people, impossible. When you finish the game, you are able to play three different challenges. If you are interested in the achievements, you should definitly pick the challenge ""No blood, no viewers"", as the other challanges will take a HUGE amount of time and skill compared to this one. Your goal is to make it as far as possible on a random generated level with no checkpoints. Your distance (score) will be displayed as viewers. You will get an achievement for having 200 viewers (fairly easy), 700 viewers (hard) and 1100 viewers (very hard). Especially the 700 and 1100 viewers achievements will take a lot of time, resetting (since the levels are random generated) and persistance.Cons- Wonky physics, which can be frustrating from time to time- The game is short if you are not interested in 100% and just want to finish itOverall: 8/10"

I thought that I needed to have the game in windowed mode in order to record it, which is a feature that this game does not have. I messed around with the resolution and it became unplayable as I had accidentally set the resolution so low that it would not display and therefore thought I had been screwed. I have since found out how to record this game by using Full Screen Display (FSD) capture. I was wrong in what I said and I hope that the community here can forgive me.I am sorry.NOTE: do NOT change the resolution settings unless you have to! The screen may go black for the game as a default display setting and you will have to reinstall."

,Not Recommended,395200,33268660,Posted: 5 July,all,Pannox,"Oh, I really wanted to like this game. I really did.Let me premise this, I really enjoy 3D platformer games, that's pretty much what I've grown up with, I also do enjoy zombie related stuff, so playing something mashing the 2 things togheter pumped me up. And it was funat first.STORYThey keep it farely simple but effective: you are Ed, a zombie in an apocalyptic world who made friend with Ben, just some kid. But some evil man who runs some kind of TV live show kidnaps both, trapping Ben at the end of every stage for Ed to run and save him, going through blades, saws, acid and other  deadly stuff.Like I said, its simple but it works, and sets up a really nice tone. Maybe I wish they did something more with it, especially for the ending. Oh god, the ending.GAMEPLAYThis is the hardest part to write about on this review, so I'll try to make myself clear:DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE FIRST 2 HOURS OF THE GAME.It start off so good, balancing challange with fun, making you aware on whats coming before it hits you. It works perfectly fine. But then, the more you go on, the more the levels become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t just to annoy the player, making it just a ""learn and repeat"" kind of game, when eventually that one blade that keeps throwing your timing off somehow doesen't kill you that one time.Not to mention, the controls are painfully floaty: the momentum of the jump really feels off most of the times, which is not a big deal at first, but as the stages go on and they make the playforms smaller it gets really annoying. And not having any kind of shadow underneath your feet really doesen't help understanding where Ed is going to land.I can just go on and on listing all the awful ideas and bugs I encountered during the course of the whole game, but the honorable mentions to me are:-Planks of woods that make you go in ragdoll mode the second you barely touch them (taking away any control from you)-Falling through the floor multiple times-Going in ragdoll mode and never coming out of it-Spawning already dead-A ♥♥♥♥ING BOSS THAT REQUIRES YOU TO USE THE ""THROW YOUR HEAD"" MECHANIC WHICH IS JUST AWFUL BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO GODDAMN CROSSHAIR, EVEN THE DEVS MUST HAVE REALIZED HOW BAD IT IS SINCE YOU USE IT MAYBE 3 TIMES DURING THE WHOLE GAME.Anyway, I'm not saying all of this because I'm bad at the game, I literally finished it in 6 hours which is not that much, and I know there's people out there better than me that must have finished in even less. Too much of it is just bad, and the ending does not make up for any of it. which let me sayTHE ENDINGIts the biggest ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to the player's face. The last level is literally a circular path filled with blades, it's just ""jump and pray"". No skill is required, nothing you learned along the path is needed, its just ""I hope I don't get my legs chopped off this time"".And even so, it's not hard at all, it took me 3 tries to beat it, the bad guy just trips over and the game goes ""YOU DEFEATED HIM"", you get shot by a cannon in the ending zone, just to get greeted by the stupidest ending you could ever imagine.Ed finally goes up to the kid, hugs him and eats him. All painfully slowly and with sad music playing. Are you kidding me? I know its suppose to be a joke, but really, that's the ending you're going for?It was not funny, it just felt all like a huge waste of time.FINAL RATING: 4/10The beginning was great, and I was hoping that the game would have kept the flow during the entire course. It clearly didn't."

That being said there are a lot of bugs; Ed falling through the floor, body parts getting stuck in objects if you hit things hard enough, etc. The core gameplay could have been more developed, providing alternate routes to reach the end of the level if you lack required body parts because for many levels past the first few you really cannot complete the level if you are missing even one leg.The game could have really benefitted from more story or at least more information on the characters, all of them are undeveloped and your given bare minimum information on them.The ending was a nice twist though I did wish for more.All in all if you are looking for a challenging platform and don't mind a lack of story and less than stellar sound track then this game is for you! 6/10"

Only a perfect runthrough will work (or a bit of luck and bugabuse) in those cases, forcing you to try one part of a level for a hundred times while running through the rest at first try.

,Recommended,395200,24747752,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,vernanonix,"I can recommend this game, but not highly. For the price of $10, it's fine. It's an interesting concept for a platofrmer. That said, this game is difficult, and maybe not for the right reasons. A lot of times, while running a course, the game will throw something out of nowhere, sending you back to your last checkpoint. Later portions of the game are not a matter of being reactionary but instead are a practice of memorization. And even that isn't enough to get you through the levels. The physics in the game can make it a chore. Momentum on Ed carries weirdly which can make a lot of pinpoint platforming that's required to finish certain levels taxing. Due to this, the game has a sort of artificial difficulty. And heaven help you if you want to get all the collectables. A portion of them are hidden away in dark, out of the way areas that make them difficult to see and force you to give up your current run on that segment. And if you're going for perfect runs, certain levels will be an absolute pain. Slice and Fall was likely designed by a sadist and I only got through the last two segments perfect by sheer luck. Sometimes, this game teeters on the edge of being a troll game.With all that said, the game can have its entertainment. It's difficult so if that's what you want, go for it. It's a challenge and it's at least worth playing. Some parts of the game are legitimately fun, its faults aside."

You play Ben and Ed as Ed the zombie. Since you're already dead, loosing a limb or two, or even them all; from being cut by giant swords, isn't a problem. You can roll around with just your head if you like.Ben and Ed is a fun game to play, even getting squished, thrown 100 feet away or smashed by a giant hammer is funny.

It’s creative, unique, hilarious, challenging, and most of all, it’s hella fun.The plot would make for an amazing cartoon on Adult Swim. Basically, the world has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Ben, a young boy looking for happiness, befriends one of the neighborhood zombies, Ed. But it isn’t long until Hans, a big wig, millionaire and founder of the world’s hottest TV show, Rundead, kidnaps the duo. Ben is held captive, and if Ed wants to reunite with his friend and defeat Hans, he must defy death in the afterlife.Since Ben and Ed is a plat former, you can expect a serious amount of jumping, running, dodging, throwing, crawling, limping, bleeding, and decapitation. Since you play as a zombie, you can take quite a beating before kicking the bucket. Limbs will be lost, but not your spirit, and this provides players with an extremely entertaining gameplay mechanic. If your legs are snipped clean by an oversized scissor blade, there’s no need to panic! You can adapt by waddling about with your arms and hands. Same goes for the loss of any body part. Instant death is almost always common place in these sorts of games, but Ben and Ed throws in these comical and engaging methods of giving players a second chance. Crawling to the nearest checkpoint with nothing but your head and torso in contact is nerve-racking, to say the least.Not only that, but there’s a handful of boss fights to keep the action flowing. Speaking of action, it never relents. Each level is more daring and intense than the last, which is no small achievement. You will die… you will die many times, and many times more. But check points are placed at reasonable distances and I never felt cheated or at a disadvantage. Ben and Ed is not an easy game, but it is fair. When you ♥♥♥♥ up, YOU ♥♥♥♥ed up. There’s no one to blame but yourself for an embarrassing demise, and beating that level that had you pinned for over an hour… there’s no better feeling in the world. The motivation to save your best friend and defeat the bad guy in such a unique and original way enhances Ben and Ed’s overall entertainment value, and it really shines.But gameplay and premise aren’t the only things done right. Graphics are top notch. I felt like I was trapped in some murderous child’s play box. The décor is spine chilling and ripe with pleasantly evil things to admire. Add in an awesome soundtrack and some silky smooth animations, and you’ve got yourself a pretty damn good video game.This is the first positive review I’ve given on Steam without any negative comments involved. I tried to think of some criticism, I really did… but I can’t. Ben and Ed really is perfect in every sense of the word. With over 20 levels, bonus content, high scores and challenge stages, you really can’t go wrong with this title. It is plat forming done right. It is video games done right. End of story."

,Not Recommended,395200,22130570,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,MechMK1,"See below for tl;drSummaryBen and Ed is a platformer with a wide variety of stages. You play as Ed, a zombie, who wants to save his friend Ben. The game itself is split into stages, which you try to finish by getting to the exit. During the stages, various limbs may be torn from your body, which cause you to run with one leg, on your arms, or even just roll your head around.ProsIn general, the artstyle is consistent and with a neat morbid touch. Nothing feels out of place, yet there is a lot of variety.The levels are interesting and again with lots of variety. While they do keep the ""gameshow touch"", the devs managed to make each level feel unique and interesting.ConsThe lighting in this game is terrible. In each platformer, you should have the ability to see what's ahead of you and be able to react to it. However, in Ben and Ed, the stages are often so dark (with a spotlight on the character), you cannot judge what's ahead of you. So it might very well be that, out of nowhere, you get hit by a cannonball and have to start over.This fact sadly plays in with the notion that checkpoints in the game are very rare. You have to complete large portions without being able to ""save"", so you might be stuck at a certain point and just wait for your ragdoll to fall juuuuust right so it activates a checkpoint. I'm looking at you here, laser pit.Even more frustrating is the fact that its physics are a bit counter intuitive. Often hammers or similar barely grace you, yet send you flying across the stage. Other times you get knocked down from falling too hard and end up slowly sliding down a platform you should have had no problem landing on.These three things make Ben and Ed feel arbitrary in either win or failure. ""Winning"" a stage feels more like ""I finally glitched right"", especially in the later stages.Conclusion (aka. tl;dr)I wish steam reviews had a ""neutral"" option. I do recommend it if you can look past these screw ups, if you look for a challenge in a sense that you can do everything right and still fail. If you're easily frustrated, you might be better off with a different game."

The only thing is such limited content, only 23 levels, there's 2 levels that don't even take more than 4 minutes to beat each. The game is only starting at 10$ though so it's still worth it but that's the main problem is it leaves you wanting more, most people I've heard from seem to feel the same way they keep suggesting to the developers of the game on the steam forum to include/implement some sort of steam workshop or level editor so the community can make more maps/levels to keep playing, which would be cool. Also, the developers are on the forums frequently to address issues within the game to supply answers updates and patches so that's a good thing. This game is still new I don't know how much more the devs will add to it but the other day there was a patch since it's around Christmas time and the player now has a red winter hat on which is cool =}. Not a bad experience with this game, just 1 level really irritated me, Rafting Coaster where u are on a platform that moves throughout the level but it moves so slow it makes attempts to get to next checkpoint take well over 5 minutes each, took forever to beat that level. The rest are great though, my favorite levels are Moonshine Deadzone and Ed Fillet. Check those out on youtube they are fun in a challengingly hard kind of way."

The game is challenging and generally any mistakes you make are due to your own lack of precision. I made it through the whole game and had fun most of the time as I enjoyed the challenge.The only reason why I would not ever recommend this game, which is a VERY BIG flaw, is that the ragdolls are very badly designed. For a feature that is so core to the gameplay (especially on the last few levels), it amazes me how random it gets. People seem to blame the games physics in general, but everything else in the game seems to behave normal.When you, or any other object in the game, becomes a ragdoll, anything can happen. You can clip through traps meant to kill you, walls and platforms, or even get blasted outside of the map. Without the ragdoll mechanic the game would be amazing and fair, while still being very difficult. However you will often die, get stuck in a wall or fall off a platform for seemingly no reason and have to start the round all over again. This is most noticeable on one of the last few levels that is literally impossible to beat unless one of the ragdolled objects get stuck in the map, which seems like really lazy design for a game like this.TL:DR Not the challenging game it is supposed to be due to poor ragdoll physics."

,Not Recommended,395200,32230713,Posted: 6 June,all,I liek Potatoez,"It's a real shame that this game is total garbage, because I love platformers and was looking forward to this one's unique mechanic. Looking back, that mechanic isn't unique at all, but regardless, even though I got it in a humble bundle, it still felt like an enormous waste of time, money, and potential.First of all, there is no Steam controller support. It doesn't recognize the Steam controller as a 360 controller like NEARLY EVERY OTHER GAME WITH CONTROLLER SUPPORT, and for whatever reason, Big Picture also won't allow me to import configs, so I was stuck using a mouse and keyboard, which is a big ""no-no"" for platformers of any kind.Secondly, the design of this game is absolutely disgusting. They throw so many cool mechanics your way, like the ability to take off your head and throw it, or the ability to keep going after you hit an obstacle (I'll get to that in a bit,) but it never really makes any good use of any of these mechanics, and just sticks to the same 3 obstacles with different coats of paint throughout the game (at least, in the 3 chapters that I stomached before giving up completely.) The coolest part of this game is that your limbs can fall off and you can keep running. Your body has 11 individual sections which all can detach when damaged. However, 99% of the obstacles in this game are spinning blades which spin at chest, neck, or ankle height, so you rarely see your limbs flying off like you'd expect. Also, when you hit any obstacle (there are also swinging hammers and lasers,) you fall to the ground and, after a short time, press a button to get up. NOTE: one of the most frustrating parts of this game is that, unlike ANY OTHER GAME IN EXISTENCE WHERE YOU CAN FALL OVER, you can't press the jump button to get up. You have to use WASD. You can also take off your head and throw it, but I only ever had to do this in 1 level before I was ready to throw my keyboard across the room in frustration.As far as level design goes, this game falls flat again. Like I mentioned before, there are really only 3 main obstacles: spinning blades, swinging hammers, and swinging lasers. Many of the levels have a unique mechanic that separates them from the rest, such as balls rolling down a hill or faces that eject themselves from walls next to you, but these are either incredibly frustrating to avoid or frustratingly easy to avoid. This game has no middle ground. The swinging lasers, as well, swing randomly, and are placed randomly. One of the levels has a ""stay in the spotlight"" mechanic, but it's never really clear where the spotlight is going to go, and the darkness often hides obstacles that would've otherwise been avoided had I been actually able to SEE them, and the spotlight radius is so small that it almost feels like I keep getting cheated out of my gametime.I only fought one boss through the entire thing, which was a giant, robotic clown. Which sounds awesome and intimidating, until it starts laughing this annoying, squeaky giggle every two seconds. THen, it's just annoying, especially since that boss has a lot of BS mechanics, such as a platform you have to jump over that randomly switches directions often.Overall, I hate this game. Couldn't even complete it, don;t want to get invested in its unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't buy this game, even in a humble bundle."

Those screenshots got me really interested and I was excited to play the game myself when it dropped on Steam. I finally got the time and picked it up on sale for $7.99 and actually enjoyed the first couple of levels. Around the first Boss Level is when things turned sour. It became clear that the games controls were a bit too wonky for the platforming it expected. Also, the physics system is just unreliable. Sometimes I would find myself getting hit by a blade and simply falling down. Other times I would be hit and fly across the arena, meaning the whole dismemberment system wouldn't work. Being able to continue the level as a torso or reattach to my body was cool, but didn't matter if I was thrown across the level to a place where I was forced to restart.The camera can also be frustrating. There are pendulum style obstacles which pose little threat when presented swinging side-to-side. But When they swing front-to-back the pendulum can get behind you and completely obscure your view. Essentially making those moment of blindness a crapshoot. Will you make it? Or will some other trap come out and annihilate you while you can't see?This is a game I would have really loved to recommend. The premise is interesting and I really enjoyed the levels with pure platforming, rather than trap avoidance. But I just can't. I played for 80 minutes and probably only enjoyed myself for about 30 of those minutes. The only thing keeping me sane for the other 50 minutes was the game's surpsingly good soundtrack. Maybe another installment with more finely tuned controls and more dependable physics would have me recommending the game."

It's very polished visually, but the controls feel both sluggish and yet flighty. Momentum is a huge part of this game, and yet platforming needs to be done in places where the player doesn't have room to judge their own speed. The ragdoll physics are attrocious, on the first boss in particular. My first ten minutes were tolerable at best, but facing the clown for 20 minutes was unbearable. It's shockwave attack affects the player while in the air, sending him or her into endless cycles of floating in the air. It was unplayable at worst, extremely enraging at best. Respawn points are not safe as well, leading to cycles of respawning into attack and dying immediately.Turning is very difficult, coordinating the camera is extremely difficult, momentum is incorporated and yet not accounted for in level design, and the ragdoll physics is much too intense. I feel genuinely bad writing this review, as I only cleared five of the six first stages, but the game was too unplayable. I could not complete the first level.I do not recommend this game and am also asking for a refund."

Beyond the first few levels, the obstacles become too difficult due to either horrific camera angles, over exaggerated physics, or frankly impossible series of swinging arms, spinning sawblades, and platforms too small to successfully jump on.Beyond the difficulty and lack of realistic physics, the novelty of losing limbs is a worthless point. Many obstacles require you to have a full body to complete, so losing an arm or leg might as well kill you and restart you at a checkpoint anyway. Plus, reattaching to the body seems to be buggy anyway, and the torso usually just ragdolls as the head continues rolling.This game is well thought out and has an excellent concept, but for now, it really isn't fun and I don't believe its worth playing or purchasing without some major fixes."

But since this gmae is still going through updates, it MIGHT get better.Pros-*Pretty easy to understand for new players (Nice tutorial to show you the game)*Funny gameplay (In a way, for the wrong reasons.)*Plenty of challenges (varing on fairness)*Funny ""hero"" and villain (LOL the ending TOTALLY didn't see that coming)Cons-*BROKEN physics (Jump and press TAB slighty after to fly over obsictales. Back to those 2 Pallet coasters and the acid, I found myself being thrown in the air by jumping on the pallets while being only a torso, and this glitch happened a lot preventing me from getting past it, and to rub salt in an open wound, when this happened and I died in the acid I had to do it from the begining and it took a long time to get back to that point only to be given the finger in the form of a glitch!)*Tough to near impossible challenges (The lazers chasing you through the hall in Act 2 is an example. The lazers move faster then you and you can't out run it without using the rolling move, M1, and even then you can't make a SINGLE mistake in this part and once you're done with that one, you have to do it AGAIN with an even MORE brutal lazer run)*Boring 3rd act (After Boss 2) (The Pallet Coaster is so boring, this game is supposed to be action run and jump platformer, And the one with the two pallets in the acid is boring and BROKEN, I'll be on that later.*Repetative Soundtrack, one track throughout most levels (Through out the first few levels, with the exception of the first boss, I was listening to the same tune for all those levels. I muted the game and put on my own music instead)*Not worth the price (Steam Sale in place? Maybe it is worth it.)*Mechanics not working properly (The level with the singing hammers are supposed to break a wall of pallets at the end of one of the levels. Press the button and...*drum roll*...NOTHING! I couldn't pass the level without using the limp jump to make it to the goal. I had to use a GLITCH to get past a GLITCH.)All in all, it's like if Super Meat Boy went 3D, had a broken physics engine, none of the catchy music, was pretty boring at certain points, and had less content. Maybe they can tweek it and make it better but for the moment, not really. 4/10, Won't limp again."

It's not the gameplay mechanics that is the games biggest flaws. It's in the presentation. The music and level design.Jumping right in. The level design for me fell mostly flat. The levels are just so boring. Even when the game tries to mix the variety up it's still just as boring. ""Deadly lasers again!?"" The levels themselves look drab and uninspired. There are lots of collectibles in the form of stacks of cans through out all the levels to knock over or ""collect"".The music in the game is probably the most horrible aspect about the whole game. Each level consist of a generic techno/80's style synth song that seems like it's only 20 seconds long. When levels usually take around 15-30 minutes to complete depending on how good you are you will hear the same song over and over again. I usually turned the music off in a level after 2 or 3 minutes of hearing it.The game does offer a decent challenge if that's what you're after. There a lot of times where you have to be really precise with your platforming. You will die quite a lot. There are ""medals"" for making it from checkpoint to checkpoint with all your limbs intact. Which brings me to my next point.If you get an arm, leg, both arms, both legs, or even your head cut off you can still continue on. It does make the game even harder running on both arms just being an upper torso.All in all it feels like the game could have been more than what it is. The gameplay isn't the worst around, but a lot more care could have been put into the design of the levels I feel. It's a 4 out of 10 game at best. Definitely not a game for me."

The idea of the game is really good and I was sort of hyped but I must admit that it wasn't what I thought it would be (putting aside those lag spikes). Funniest part of the game's idea is losing limbs and still going forward until you can't progress anymore, but in the end most of the time when a trap cuts your limb you  either go hyper ragdoll mode and fly off the platform or just i.e spinning blade itself throws you off instead of cutting anything. Also, movement was kind of too sensitive especially mid-air (lag spikes honestly made it unplayable).It just got released so I hope they try to make movement  a bit smoother and perhaps make the blades actually cut something instead of being flat spinning hammer. It's quite cheap game so I sort of recommend at least trying it out. I believe they are going to do some tweaks to it. 6/10 in its current state perhaps 8/10 when they've fixed a thing or two."

Aside from that the player must run, jump, crawl, and even hop his way through each level just to come a little closer in resquing his friend each time. If you're into fun and casual gaming, this is a perfect game to buy. Everything is absolutely perfect about this game; From the price tag ($9.99) to the actual content of the game.ConclusionOverall, Ben and Ed is a comical yet challenging and simple game to pick up and play.

76561198039508387,Recommended,395200,34981879,Posted: 15 September,all,Ruc2012,The game would be brilliant if it picked up xb/ps contorllers with ease. However for some reasons even after so long this game won't adjust and still wants to rely strongly on keyboard. If anyone has a way around this do let me know. Until then it's a nice game with good dynamics. 6/10 of what I played
,Not Recommended,395200,35401748,Posted: 1 October,all,ohmsrulz,"This game's controls are horrible. Fun for a little while, but just gets frustrating as hell. I don't recommend this game at all unless you really, really like challenge and getting setup to fail.  I wish I would have paid 7/23 because that's as far as I got without becoming completely raged. Let me count the ways the controls suck:1) The jumping is weird. I can turn the guy in the air a little and have no idea where he's going to land. Sometimes he has momentum and sometimes he doesn't. When an object approaches, I can't tell when to jump to avoid making me sometimes too early or sometimes too late. Floaty I guess is the word.2) No crosshairs for aiming your head or the cannons. Have to just throw/shoot and hope for the best.3) It's hard to tell distances and stuff like that. I think this is just the result of being a 3-D platformer and not because of the devs.4) Inconsistent dying in level 6. When going through the bars, I have no idea what causes the guy to explode and what doesn't. I actually skipped an entire checkpoint by pure luck. wtf?!5) Bugs. I fell underneath the target platform when throwing my head and wasn’t able to do anything. wtf? I got stuck in planks on a few of the levels. wtf?? Sometimes this worked to my advantage... during the clown sequence it threw me right at the cannon and I seemingly flew right through the floor so I skipped having to walk/run there. wtf???6) Go ahead and find a perfect run-through on YouTube/Twitch where the player doesn’t die at least once. I did find some where they complete the levels, but they die doing it. That tells me that this game is more luck than skill.I'll continue to try to beat this game because I’m on a mission to try to beat all the games I own, but I won't be buying any more games that have Ben and Ed featured or are developed by this developer unless they fix the controls in their new games."
