I was a little worried, but my love of logic puzzles overcame that fear, and I bought it anyways.  I've been recording the game, and I've played one hour of this, (the rest of the time at the moment was me setting up the recording, and leaving it open while editing)  This game is a great logic puzzle game, as you recieve puzzles like seeing two doors: Either they are both correct or they are both incorrect; One says ""Both doors lead to death"" and the other says ""This door leads to bacon"".  Which door do you enter?  That one in particular was a VERY easy one.  They get pretty complex.  I've used up 10 notebook pages trying to solve these already.  Anyways, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to get confused. :P  Also, I want to aknowledge the people who say ""It's easy, just keep guessing until your right"".  To that I say, ""Really?""  What's the point of buying a puzzle game, if you DON'T LIKE PUZZLES?  Stop trashing the game when you don't even like the genre.  Saying ""Just walk in every door until you get it right"" COMPLETELY misses the point of the game.  The game is not supposed to entertain you for thirty seconds at a time, this game is something you sit at for long amounts of time, and actually use your brain.  You know, the thing that we all have but SOME OF US CHOOSE NOT TO USE..."

About halfway through (maybe about 20 minutes?) a plot element develops, which I found really interesting! But it is shortly abandoned for the same puzzles I solved earlier, and none of them really left me scratching my head. Not only that, but choosing an incorrect door has no real negative outcome. The fact that I can try over and over on the same puzzle, being helpfully loaded right back in front of it, leaves me with no motivation to truly solve it.The influence of The Stanley Parable is evident here, but it feels cheap. The office section of the game just screams it, but almost nothing is interactable, and the signs don't make any real sense to the ""narrative"" we find ourselves in. If it's satire, it's not working. I also would have liked to see more varied humor on the doors. The main joke with the bacon falls very flat. We get it, bacon is so great. It would have been a little funny if it was mentioned just once at the beginning and then you get it at the end. Instead the word is shoved down your throat so much that when the actual bacon does show up you don't want it at all."

(The tags lie.)The challenge in this game is to pass through 23 doors that lead to bacon - and to not pass through the approximately 100 doors that lead to death (which means retry, because there's autosave if you haven't turned it off). To help you with that, you need to determine which of the logic statements above the door is correct. (The statement on the floor is always correct.) It took me somewhat longer than an hour to do the first time. I've never seen a game like this, and I hope there'll be a sequel with more levels.The rules:In every puzzle is a door that leads to bacon. All other doors lead to death.On every door is a statement.

Heck no, it's essentially a book of ""The blue man lives in the green house, and the green man is next to the red man's house, so who lives in the purple house?"" style puzzles put into a game. Despite that, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. Doors' is a match made in heaven between Limbo's sharp visual splendor and The Stanley Parable's wit and charm. The gameplay is really well done, and it keeps introducing new concepts. Storywise, Doors falls a little flat. I won't spoil anything, but the ending could've been handled better, and it just felt lackluster.Doors is not a game for everyone. It's very short (we're talking 30 minutes to an hour) and is definitely more logical than Limbo or The Stanley Parable. Doors has little replayability due to the nature of its' design. There are a few easter eggs here and there, but Doors is ultimately a really great concept with great design, subverted by the lack of content. I recommend it, but only if there's a sale going on, or if you like logic games."

The puzzles made me engage my noodle; the first achievement I got made me laugh out loud; the description is honest about it being short.  I loved Portal and Portal 2, and enjoyed Antichamber, so I took a risk.  I'm glad I did.It's a little pricey for what amounts to a very brief book of logic puzzles, but it is attractive if not actually pretty, and has a bit of mystery to it.  If I have one complaint it's that we're supposed to buy that anyone could be expected to believe the game is anything but a simulation, when everything around them is that Limbo-esque, foggy black that Unity game designers use to look arty and so they don't have to design textures....That's for giving me that first achievement, Mr. Weibel.  You know the one I mean.I'm also not wild about the sound design -- the sudden bangs are a little incontinence-inducing.  But that is a fine nit to pick.If you like logic puzzles, and Doors is on sale, go on and pick it up.  I think $5 is a bit much to ask, but only because of its length."

But no sooner had I thought this than I was sucked back into the increasingly time-consuming simulated world of the riddle doors, which took the game through to its bizarrely nonsensical and rushed conclusion.It really feels as if two or three interesting game premises got into a head-on collision here, and lost their better aspects in the resulting mess. The final product is a game that goes nowhere, is bizarrely paced, and whose humor seems to consist of the concept of bacon, as though this were 2010 and we were all adolescents with ~lol so random~ senses of humor.

And by little I mean both minimalistic and short.The logic puzzles that make up the core of the game are based around deductive reasoning. They range from very easy (introductory) to somewhat frustrating difficulties, but they're never too difficult to get through. And if you get stuck on one there's always the trial and error options of walking through doors, losing and retrying until you find the right one.The underlying story is thin and not very well presented, but I think the lack of background is intended.Anyway, the game should be played for the logic puzzles, not if you want story."

After finishing The Witness, i was craving more.I had a look through some interesting games and i come across Doors. I figured it looks interesting enough to give it a go.The game is a glorified version of the Knights and Knaves logic puzzle. You are given a set of statements, some are true, some are false and you need to figure out what to do with that information. In concept, a good idea for a puzzle game, but i think the game could have presented the puzzles better.Each of the doors in the game were pritty much side by side and had no variations. The majority of the game consisted of a kinda empty scene in black and white. the modeling was very good, and i think a bit of colour and maybe a higher draw distance and the game would have been very beautiful, as well as that, when the game says it's short, it's really short. I was able to complete it within 50 minutes, and i was kinda disapointed it ended so soon, it felt like i was barely getting into the game when it ended.The puzzles themselves were a little too straightforward. If you didn't take notes then it would be easy to see how people would make mistakes but given the instructions it wasnt too hard (all besides the very last puzzle, which even though i was able to work out down to two of thirty doors, there was no way i could find to decisivly figure out which one was correct without guessing)TL:DRThis game is a lot like a cheap burger.Sure it's good but its not very filling, and also it's really bland and plain, it needs something to spice it up a little and i think it would be much better. 4/10"

A word of warning: If you're no good at even the simplest of ""riddles"", be fully prepared for this game to make you feel like the dumbest♥♥♥♥♥who ever walked the Earth.Essentially it's just a series of ""choose the correct door or die"" conundrums, in which you select the correct portal by way of a process of elimination...a process which I still managed to get wrong at least half of the time (so yes...dumb +♥♥♥♥♥= me)!  But it's a smidgen more than that...it also sets itself up as a bit of an atmospheric mind-♥♥♥♥, emulating not just a logic-based video game, but indeed a kind of corporate or governmental logic-testing simulator, complete with minor electronic ""glitches"" and so forth.  At first the slightly spooky landscapes you briefly traverse to get to the next puzzle seem like little more than an opportunity for some nice sound design and some snazzy screenshots, but as the game progresses, it does succeed in making you feel like you've just been a part of a short-but-sinister psychological experiment, the end result of which may very well be your own extermination (for the aforementioned crime of being such a chronic and incurable dumb-♥♥♥♥).  It's a minor touch, but a welcome one, just the same.Oh, and on the subject of ""shortness""...yeah, it's short, but don't let my brief playing time or all the boastful reviews fool you.  Sure, all bar one of the puzzles involves so few doors that you could just zip through them methodically 'til you find the right one, but anyone seeking to solve all the riddles fair-and-square is bound to take a little longer, unless they have an extraordinary natural talent for this kind of thinking.  Oh, and good ♥♥♥♥ing luck to anyone believing that they can solve the second-last puzzle in under two minutes without cheating (which I most assuredly did, by looking up a walkthrough...'cause in less than two minutes I knew it had me beat, plain-and-simple)!  There's also quite a few wacky little Achievements to pursue, for those so inclined, so earnest players could easily get more than a couple of hours out of this game if they don't give in to the ever-present and most assuredly evil allure of the walkthrough.If all this talk of logic and puzzles has done your head in already, you may want to skip this one.  For anyone else, the price being asked is more than fair for the product being offered, though the sitting-square-on-the-fence people might at least want to wait on a sale.  Recommended, but only heartily to those mental masochists out there who enjoy a good head-pummelling.  Me, I could probably go a few rounds of Killing Floor or Borderlands right now.  And I by-and-largely DETEST Killing Floor and Borderlands for being so ♥♥♥♥ing mindless.  But right now...a bit of mindlessness is sounding mighty ♥♥♥♥ing tempting...Verdict: 7.5/10."

But the first person aspect is limited to you walking over to the next puzzle each time. You walk through bland, uninspired, low resolution black and white landscapes (look at the screenshots). This adds nothing to the game. Halfway through the game, there is a bunker to 'explore' but except for getting some Steam Achievements done there, it's just a colored version of the walking simulator to get you to walk over to the next puzzle.The puzzles are... weird. They're not easy and they're not hard, but they require you to adapt to the word choice of the creator. An example. The phrase ""correct door"" doesn't mean the door that you need to walk through to solve the puzzle, but a door with a correct statement written on it. This will get you confused at almost every puzzle. Some people talk about it in the discussion forum but I think it's intended, because once you 'translate' the puzzles on paper and replace it with the real-life words (i.e.""door that leads to bacon""really means""the correct door"",""correct door""really means""door with a true statement written above it""and""incorrect door""means""door with a false statement written above it""), you'll solve every puzzle with ease. But what's the point of playing a computer game if the actual puzzling is done on a piece of paper, right? I know. So one struggles through it while trying to 'translate' in your head. But when you get to puzzles with, say, six doors and more, it gets hard. Not hard to solve, but hard to resist the urge to take a piece of paper and a biro, and immediately solve the puzzle as if it were a child's riddle.I see people praise this game because one person made it. Ok. But what does that tell others about the game? We need to judge the game for what it is and especially, if we would recommend the game to other people who have never played it. Well, I can only recommend against spending money and time on this game. The fact that one person made the game doesn't change that recommendation one bit.One last note about the Steam Achievements, especially for completionists. All achievements are easy to get except for one, which is unattainable. It's not bugged or anything. The person who made the game just thought it would be funny to make an achievement, describe it as ""unachievable"" (a reference to The Stanley Parable and one of its achievements) and actually make it unachievable. Really, there is no legitimate way to get this achievement. Read the discussions forum if you want confirmation."

,Recommended,395350,28739072,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,TheDContinuum,"Hmmm.... Tough one to pin down. I paid about a dollar for this when it was on sale, so I feel like I got my money's worth, but  here's the breakdown because I'm a little on the fence:Pros:+ Tough but doable logic puzzles, of the truth-table variety. Think of the typical ""one person always lies and the other tells the truth"" scenarios but with more people and more conditional statements. And the people are doors.Neutral:~ It tried to have a story, which made the game have a point, which was cool. Through the first few logic puzzles my thought was ""Why on earth did someone make a 3D video game out of a concept that could be a text game?"" but then the story kicked in and I was drawn in, waiting for more. But then there's no more story except for a few lines after the credits. I felt a little cheated.~ Bacon. Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but to put it in a game as your choices are ""bacon or death"" gets tired after a while and seems like pandering. ""Life or death"" is a much more fitting scenario, especially because the iota of story is circling around the idea that people are beginning to suspect that the simulation isn't real. Well, duh, because you're offering bacon or death. That's not what happens in real life.Cons:- This was a con for me, but others might not mind so much. As stated before, it was a 3D game despite the fact that all you're doing is reading messages on the ground or above doors and then stepping through. You frequently have to do a bit of walking before you reach the doors, so it's basically a walking simulator on top of a logic puzzle, though for no purpose. You can't go outside the path and, despite being a game where death is a constant threat, you can't actually fall off of any of the areas before/around the doors.- This relates to above, but you can't see the text on more than one door at a time, which meant walking back and forth between doors whenever you needed to reread or double check your conclusions. I was only playing for a total of 3 hours (including 80% of that time was me making notes on pencil and paper, or making elaborate flow charts or truth tables), but I got a little nauseated from the back and forth (not playing on VR, just normal computer.) This back and forth would have made the final puzzle with 30 doors nearly impossible had I not taken the initiative and WRITTEN DOWN ALL 30 CLUES ON PAPER SO I COULD LOOK AT THEM ALL AT ONCE WITHOUT WALKING. For a game that required me to use about 4 or 5 pieces of paper front and back for all my notes for various puzzles, it's not super well suited to a video game format, at least not without some built-in system so you can make your notes in the actual game.Overall: I'm right on the fence. 5/10. I got my dollar's worth from this game, but even at a regular price of $3.99, I wouldn't recommend buying at full price. But if you like logic puzzles, and it's on sale...it's probably worth it."

However, this one has a low price tag, so I decided to throw a few dollars at it.I enjoy the atmosphere of the game. It does remind me of Limbo. The settings for the game are very basic. Really should have a volume setting. The player moves at a slow enough pace to take everything in, but I'll elaborate a bit on the movement speed later.The puzzles are ""eh"". I have to wonder if I really suck at logic puzzles or did the developer intentionally use broken logic. Some of the puzzles don't seem to match what the statements are pointing at. Again, maybe I just suck.So, gameplay. You walk, read what's on the ground in front of the doors (or portals, which I guess is the Portal influence), read what's on top of the doors, and use your brain to pick the door that'll bring you a bit further in your journey. Choose wrong, and start at the beginning of the area. Oh, and remember what I said about the movement speed? Yeah, enjoy walking from the area spawn to the doors again. It starts to get old after failing 3 or 4 times. Should have just put a respawn in front of the doors. As some of the other negative reviews point out, you can just ""brute force"" the puzzles and eventually get the right door, but that's the nature of this type of puzzle game.Overall, I cannot recommend this game.

It runs smoothly and is pretty intuitive, so unless you want to zoom in (why can't I zoom in?) you're unlikely to experience any 'how does this work' type of frustration.The main draw is the combination of puzzles and absurd humor, which gives the game its flavor.

I understand that it is intriguing to put another layer of narrative on a rather mechanical core game, but it just really comes across as a mediocre rip-off. while the story bits here and there caught my interest, there really didn't seem to be any good reason to go for the whacky humour of stanley parable. the visuals and level design here were so close to the original, that i kept expecting some big fourth-wall-breaking revelation, that at the same time seemed totally unrealistic to connect with the elegant and rather straight-forward puzzle mechanics. well (spoiler? idk...) there is none and so this part leaves a sour taste in my mouth.last thing: cut out that bacon. really. ""is this memes?"" i mean seriously? yes, the internet loves bacon. haha, funny. i was wondering if you were going for the ""cake"" thing in portal - but portal made cake a ""meme"" and didn't use the next best funny little stupid internet thingy to center the narrative of an otherwise mindful game around.so that's my mixed bag. great puzzles and enviroments on the one hand. totally unnecessary stanley parable rip-off and immersion breaking bacon hype on the other. still recommend it in the end. i guess not everybody out there is a homourless vegetarian who is forced to go through the ""bacon is good"" door ;-)"

I suggest mixing up the texts, having a few presets for doors, I don't really know. Last puzzle was very intimidating but it ended up being the most fun of them all.TL;DRI highly reccomend playing but do it legit or it won't be fun. Can't wait to see where the creator will go."

For 5€ this is so basic. There is also no sensical progression of difficulty, as there are spikes in between the short amount of levels that are very complicated due to unclarity (luckily, only 3-4 are this way).All-together, I seriously doubt the amount of work that was actually required to design Doors, considering that there are tons of in-your-face invisible walls with no intelligent way to design anything different to hide them. The only level that is NOT in a seemingly virtual world is also super-rigid and the monitors that are included in them look like a box with an image straight out of photoshop.If there is anything I can applaud, is that there was (minimal) effort to implement some kind of 'story', and that for the first few minutes the bacon thingy is funny (although repetitive very soon).Not recommended until it goes on sale."

I personally enjoy mapping out every variable of a situation and coming to the one and only logical and optimal conclusion to a problem.Let me tell you, if you are walking through each door until you are finding the correct one, you are cheating yourself out of any potential enjoyment you could be getting out of this game and refusing the opportunity to improve yourself even a tiny bit.I have two complaints about the game though. The first one involves a level that breaks up the monotony of choosing doors by sending you to a completely different environment. At least two acheivements and much of the enjoyment of the game can be found in this new environment, but it is way too easy to accidentally leave this level and never have a chance to return. The only option left to the player is to finish the game and restart from the beginning until you reach that level again.My second complaint about the game involves the puzzles. Almost all of them follow an obvious pattern that looks like this:There are X correct doors.Assume a set of X doors are correct.You will either see that assumption leads to a conflict or that an additional door becomes true from that assumption.Exhaust all possible combination of doors being true until you find the one that does not lead to more or less doors than X being correct.What I appreciated about this game the most was the final puzzle. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but I thought the contrast between the second to last puzzle and the last puzzle to bring up an interesting question in the player's head, and I believe bringing this question to mind is artistic in the way that only video games can be.Overall, steam says it took me around 7 hours to complete. I think this must have involved a lot of idle time where I left the game unattended. However, if you are playing this game correctly, it should take you several hours to complete."

Doors has linear gameplay with no mechanics but to walk, look around, and choose. The concept for Doors is very similar to that of The Stanly Parable with making choices. The choices that you make limit you to getting only about two endings depending on if you picked wrong or not. #1. If you choose wrong you die. #2. If you choose right you get bacon.

I beat the game in only about 15 minutes with no reason given as to what I was doing and it was not memorable.

,Not Recommended,395350,22110311,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,BoxOfFaces,"What would be a simple and promising puzzle game tries too hard to make itself interesting outside of the puzzles that it weighs down the entire experience.I bought this game because it reminded me of a riddle I really enjoy, but was ultimately disappointed in the product. The puzzles themselves are not always bad, but the game as a whole is poorly constructed and feels like it tries too hard in too many areas that don't add anything to the experience people are here to enjoy - puzzle solving.The puzzles are simple. You're presented with a group of doors, each door has a sign above it with some text above it, and you have to use the text to figure out with door to go through. In addition, before each set of doors there is some text on the ground that gives further information you need to solve the puzzle (usually telling you how many of the doors are lying to you). This is a fine idea and can lead to some satisfying puzzles, but the way it's presented has some things to complain about.Firstly the wording. The door you want to go through is described as ""leading to bacon"" (a poor, meme-like attempt at humor I wish I could say only appears in this once) and the doors you don't want to go through ""lead to death"". The doors where the text above them is telling the truth is described as ""correct"" while the doors that lie to you are ""incorrect"". This wording is confusing, and they never explain exactly how all the wording works. They tell you bacon is good and death is bad, but they don't explain that correct and incorrect refers to the text above the door being true or false, rather than the correct or incorrect doors to walk through. Knowing exactly how this wording works is absolutely essential to solving almost every puzzle, which makes it the puzzles seem frustrating, unfair and somewhat random until you figure out their unintuitive wording scheme on your word. All to include a joke about bacon. Clearly the designers had their priorities straight on this one.This all could have been solved if they did away with the bacon/death thing and used correct and incorrect to indicate which door you wanted to go through, then true and false to describe which doors are lying to you. This makes sense, and probably doesn't even need explaining to most people. Just establish that to progress you go through the correct door, and the rest explains itself. If a blue door says ""The blue door is incorrect"" you know that's not the door you want to go through. But then if another door says ""The blue door is false"" you know the blue door is lying to you. And so the puzzles begin, with no need for explanations and minimal confusion. It would also help with the text on the ground before each set of doors. They might say something like ""One door leads to bacon, all other doors lead to death."" But with bacon being substituted for correct, it could simple read ""One door is correct."" There's no need to explain that the rest are incorrect because correct and incorrect are opposites, and people can intuitively figure out for themselves that ""all other doors are incorrect.""Now, with that simple poor use of words aside, the puzzles aren't bad. My only other gripe is that the game's idea of difficulty is the number of doors a puzzle uses, so as you go, the puzzles begin having more and more doors. This isn't entirely a bad thing, but there are two things about this I do't like.Firstly, since this game is played from a first person perspective, keeping track of what all the doors say means walking around constantly and looking at each one individually. This works just fine at first, but as the game progresses and the number of doors goes up, it's honestly more challenging just to keep track of everything than it is to actually solve the puzzle.Secondly, Some of the most interesting and thought provoking puzzles are the simplest ones with the fewest. They certainly seem easier, since you don't have to keep track of what 10-20 doors say at a time, but they're interesting and more rewarding. it would have been nice to see them break up the string of huge multi-door puzzles with a really interesting smaller puzzle every so often.(It is worth mentioning I didn't finish this game, so it's possible they actually do some of this later in the game. If they do, good on them, but I honestly doubt it.)Now, if that's all I had to complain about, I'd probably have enjoyed this game a bit more. But no. There's visuals and atmosphere to consider as well, and here's where this game really falls short.Most of the time, the game takes place in a black and white environment with a minimalist art style. These places actually look quite nice. It's atmospheric without being distracting, which is perfect for a puzzle game like this. It also helps the colored doors to stand out, which helps you find the next puzzle once you're teleported to the next area. Of course, this wouldn't even matter if they didn't make you walk so far after each puzzle for seemingly no reason, but whatever.However much I like this art style, it really clashes with other parts of the game, most notably the ""bacon"" gag. For a game that isn't above using a cheap meme of a joke in the core of the puzzle solving, the serious-toned and mysterious vibe the environments gives off seems like an odd choice to compliment that (and really, if one of the two has to go, it should definitely be the bacon).Worse than this is the portions of the game that attempt to... You know, I'm not even sure what the intent was. Was it trying to have a story? Make things more mysterious? Add to the atmosphere? Whatever they tried to do, it failed.There are parts of the game where weird trippy stuff happens for no discernible reason. My first encounter with this was when some random text appeared in the sky but disappeared before I could read it, and shortly after the whole screen ""glitched out"" as if I was inside a computer, and suddenly I'm walking down a long white hallway. Then I somehow end up in an office building? The hallways of the office building have no sense of direction and are littered with posters that try to be funny with little success. It feels like I'm playing The Stanley Parable, except there's no narrator and it's written by a Facebook account that does nothing but repost relatable jokes. Some of the posters are kind of amusing, but most of them just seem to think random equals funny. (HaPpY PlAtYpUs DaY!!! . . . No, one of the signs actually said. I wish I was making it up.) But even the jokes that stand up on their own (A.K.A. don't make you cringe) are not clever or witty, or even relevant. After wandering the hallway of bad jokes and unnecessary turns, I stumbled across a room with some sort of sci-fi test tube looking container. It was open, so I walked in. It closed, lowered me into darkness, and the I appeared at the next puzzle.Can... Can somebody explain to me what the point of any of that was? What does that add to the game? What does it add to the experience? Why is it in the game? It is really hard to resist the urge to use caps lock right now in order to better convey my sheer bewilderment and confusion at the inclusion of the sequences in the game. If the rest of what I talked about doesn't ruin the game for me, this absolutely does. It takes me right out of the experience and leaves me more confused and annoyed than at all interested in the game.In the end, this was a simple idea that tried too hard in too many unnecessary places and ruined what could be a fun puzzle experience. If you can get past this, you might have a good time, but I personally find it unenjoyable overall."

As it stands, I think that the world is an obstacle between the player and gratification, not something that positively contributes to the experience. The middle part in the office felt entirely unnecessary and out of place because it added nothing useful to the game.

The middle section hints at a story but it isn't ever developed.In the end, if 4 or 5 dollars for a half hour to an hour of decent entertainment sounds like a good deal to you, pick this up. You could certainly spend more on an hour. Otherwise give it a pass. Oddly enough, this is a puzzle game that probably isn't well suited for people who love puzzle games. There simply won't be enough to the game to keep a regular puzzle player busy for more than a few minutes."

WHO CARES?!!""... Actually I could even reproduce the whole *content* of the game inside this review: it's a sequence of logic-based puzzles that could as well be read. Also the puzzles aren't particularly fun.Other than that, the game is weird for the sake of weirdness."

And I enjoyed the background sounds. However, the game length is very short and the puzzles were fairly simple. Not even any headscratching puzzles. I reccomend this game to someone who just wants something different to play and some time to kill. But I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who's looking to plug in a lot of hours. And I especially wouldn't recommend this game to someone who is looking for a story rich game."

,Not Recommended,395350,21250798,"Posted: 16 February, 2016",all,Snappy,"Interesting idea, more fun when played with friends but very short with uninteresting meta story stuff.Towards the end a lot of time was spent walking between statements rather than solving the logic behind them. First person walking at a slow pace between doors makes sense for VR, but for regular play it just gets a bit tiring.There's also the unavoidable issue of ""brute forcing"" the gates since there are checkpoints at the start of each level. A bonus mode of randomised levels where you have to beat as many as possible in a row without failling would be a nice addition. Such a mode would change from a not recommended to a recommended!"

I took my time, double-checked my answers, went afk for at least an hour (with the game left running), and still ended up with less than two hours of played time.Might still be worth it for some fans of logic word puzzles -- but wait for a price drop."

This game was exactly what I was looking for--a logic puzzler that was a bit more interesting than pencil and paper.While it is clear (sometimes to an eye-rolling level) that the creator was trying very hard to capture the Stanley Parable/Portal humor style, they were not entirely successful. However, that's not why I bought the game.The logic puzzles were well-made. I didn't see any logical inconsistencies, and though I made mistakes, I always understood why a door was right in hindsight. The environments were interesting, and the puzzles grew more and more rewarding (you start celebrating when you figure one out on your first go). The final puzzle was my favorite.One word of advice: use diagrams if you have trouble with this stuff, especially as the doors start becoming more and more numerous."

,Not Recommended,395350,28261325,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,sherlockian6,"This was one of my most regrettable purchases on Steam. As is said throughout the reviews, it is meant to be made in the same vein as the Stanley Parable, though they do not achieve the same story development nor polish as many of these other games. There are numerous spelling errors through the game, and, for a game (seemingly) based purely on logic, there are logistical flaws that are simply inexcusable. On top of all of this, there are certain puzzles that it takes exceptionally long to reach, and once you fail (and you will fail) you have to make the entire trek once again. If you have the money to blow on a  game that'll make you think, but make you just as mad, then buy it on sale, otherwise...not a chance."

76561198042902955,Not Recommended,395350,34894623,Posted: 11 September,all,Poppin Dog,"First and foremost, this game does, to an extent, achieve the mysterious atmosphere of the type of puzzle game it seems to mimic. Also, there was some genuine satisfaction to be found in solving some of the puzzles in this game. There were also some moments where walking to the puzzles was mystifying and genuinely interesting, but I dont know if I can credit a game in which the walk to the puzzle is more visually stimulating and interesting than the puzzle itself.With that out of the way...Doors is the type of game that can only be enjoyed for perhaps a few hours. You can see that I have only put about an hour of time into this game myself. To be honest that was all the time I needed to run through this game. I didnt take my time, and could have slowed down to enjoy the scenery, but at some point I felt as though I had seen it all. There is not much substence in this game compared to ""similer"" games like Antichamber, The Stanley Parable, or Only If to a lesser extent. The game is quick to present itself as a sort of atmospheric puzzle game, but the puzzles stay relatively the same throughout; with little visual changes to stimulate the otherwise less-then-steller puzzles. The game could have used more drastic and visually appealing set peices if nothing else.I also could complain about the way a story was ""teased"" at one point, but to be quite honest I only played through this game once, and may not have any legitimate grounds to critique the hidden or symbolic imagery in the game. With that said I  have no desire to replay the game to gain more information, so on that note I can only say there was not enough ""meat to grab onto and enjoy.""Also, it should be said that this game has an affinity with the ""bacon meme"" (where as bacon is apparently the greatest thing in the universe). This is more of a nitpick, but the inclusion of achieving bacon as a goal seems childish, and overall takes me out of the fantasy of the game more than anything.I can only truely recommend this game to someone who desperately wants to feel anything similer to Portal, The Stanley Parable, or Antichamber, but this is unfortunately not even close to achieveing the same levels of complexity and atmosphere as the aforementioned games. I wish I could enjoy this game more, considering I absolutely adore the atmospheric puzzle / walking simulator games. I love the feeling you get when walking through a surreal environment solving puzzles. It can be a great escape into the world of senselessness, but unfortunately, Doors misses the mark."
