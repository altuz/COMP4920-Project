76561198011891156,Recommended,395420,18686267,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,Jargonaut,"I love old school turn based RPGs and have been playing this game for the last 4 days.I have played at least 60 games in this genre on steam.I am enjoying ""The Dwarf Run"" very much because it is not mindless hack-and-slash game.There is also a object-puzzle-solving element in the game.You can USE various objects in your inventory to interact with various othe objects in the environment to advance the story-line and open up new locations. Although the storyline is linear, there is a sense of accomplishment if you can finally advance it by figuring out the right interactions of object. Sometimes, I am stuck for hours, took a break, and when I come back a new idea pops up in my mind, and I can advance the story. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!There is also no mindless grinding in this game as there are no random encounters or random monsters. Because of this, every encounter is precious, and I would try to explore every corners of every map to make sure that I do not missed any hidden encounter. Resources are also limited and precious in this game. Ammunition is limited and you can obtain them from limited number of boulders (to make stones), animal bones (to make stone arrows) or insect stings (to make poison arrows), etc. Money is also very limited and you will have to decide what type of gears to buy with the limited amount of money. I really like the way this game control XP, ammunition and gears, as it make each acquisition to be meaningful and treasured.Although the game length is stated to be only 15 hours, I have played at least 36 hours on this game and love it. I am a completionist and am trying to get every single Steam Achievement in a single playthrough. That is why I go slow and cautiously explore everywhere to make sure that I do not miss a single achievement. So far I have all the achievment except the last one which is from finishing the game. The ending should be within the next 2 days, but I decide to take time and write this review instead, so that other people can enjoy this fun game.I would definitely recommend this game and it is worth the money spend."

At first, I was like Iceywind1980 and was about to give up on the game; it ttook me 30 minutes, or so, to get going and figure out how to play.  Also, the default difficulty setting is ""Difficult,"" but you can change it in game.  The fusion of point-and-click and rpg is really succesful.  Solving inventory puzzles, searching the enviroment, and talking to things is really just as essential to your progress as combat.  The writing is very good and never fails to entertain; party dialogue also frequently gives subtle clues as to how to progress.  The graphics and animations are good, for this type of game, and add to the enjoyment.  The game runs pretty smoothly and load times are minimal. The rpg mechanics are pretty sophsticated for a modestly priced game like this; for instance, your characters earn combat experience based on how much damage they did in the fight.  Also, turd zombies.  A very enjoyable game."

It combines elements from point-click adventure games/ and games like Grandia (where you hero has an option of running around, doing melee attacks, or a ranged attack. You have obsticles you have to overcome through discovery of items, as well as tough foes.In spirit it has a very old-school (probably through budget as well as choice) feel. There's no voice acting and the models/enviroment are low-poly, but done so in a somewhat artful way.Pros:+Quirky looking dialogue, story.+Low PC demand+Interesting gameplay+Challenging gameplayCons:+No grinding for easy playthrough (there seems to be no grind, the arrows/ammo you get you can only get 1 time, and there's no way of grinding you characters up).+Challenging easy mode, even the easy mode can seem impossible at times.

76561197989916429,Recommended,395420,18691062,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,DerWizard,"Amazing game. I was skeptical when I launched it for a first time, and the feeling I had was that it was going to be another easy to play low rating game for an hour or two. What surprised me most is that despite the fact that the game is cheap, has low poly, lack of voice dialogue (it would be strange to have that for such a price though), it still feels great and plays much better than many other AAA games of the same genre. In fact, it feels like a quest, a parody, a mix of modern RPG and old school dungeon crawling at times, which in my opinion, is very interesting way of making a computer game.What I really enjoyed in this game is the game mechanics - I am not saying it is something new, but you cannot just hack and slash entire game without some strategy. Every move, every battle, every level up of your hero requires you to think twice. What is interesting is that, unlike many similar RPG games, this game is challenging, if not impossible at times (especially for people who never played RPG games before) - in fact, you may end up reloading a game several times after every single battle (!) because of the one mistake you made either in battle or (the worst) if you developed your characters wrong (and trust me, for a first time you will do this). So if anyone want to avoid the mistakes before they are made - do not follow a typical RPG paradigm - your heroes will be useless if you focus just on what is best for their classes in other games - thus, if you think STR and con are great for fighter, INT is only issue mage needs to solve, and good ranger only needs to have high DEX - then you will need a new keyboard because you will kill it by hitting the same reload button 1000 times. Again, universality is key in this game - this will be clear once you enter the pits.Second thing I liked in game is the sense of humour. I thought I saw everything of the genre but this game made me laugh so many times, I am still trying to understand how weird the situation can end up from a usual (as it seemed) dungeon crawling attempt. Yes - you have to be prepared to read the story, listen to your companions, and pay attention to details in order to really enjoy the game.9.5 / 10"
,Recommended,395420,21322114,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,SpiteAndMalice,"I've just completed the game and overall I've had a pretty enjoyable experience.From reading other reviews you can probably tell that there's clearly a few imperfections in it and it a couple of ways it felt a little unfinished, but and this is a big but, I think that the positive by far outweigh the negative.The Downside- There's no voice acting, only written dialogue, but to be fair given the price of the game I'll actually take this, and no voice acting is actually better than bad voice acting- There's a couple of pathfinding bugs during battles (usually solved by moving the camera around or going in and out of inventory)- The arena battles go on and on and on (especially if you don't release that you can get through them quickly by not trying to complete the whole lot of them... it took my 18 rounds of a particular one, and I don't want to give spoilers but let’s just say that a bit clearer sign posting would have made that it didn't)The Upside- The balance in the game is beautifully done, I think set loot drops play a big part of this, but at no point did I feel that battles were too hard or becoming too easy. I think this really shouldn't be underestimated in a game, at no point was Dwarf Run coming grindy for me, and as a result it's one of the few rpgs that I've played through to the end.- The story is fun, again without giving spoilers, it's different, it'll have you scratching your head a couple of times, and it's in some ways pretty simple, but put simply its engaging, it leave you always wanting to see around the next corner I was a lot more curious about where everything was going than in some AAA titles where you have to defeat the 9 lords of blah blah before finding out that they were just minions of the 12 gods of yada yada.- The levelling system actually makes you stop and think, it does something really really well which upon reflection make you wonder why other games haven't been doing it. For instance, a spell will cost you 1 point to learn, it might still only cost you 1 point to get a second copy of it, but the third copy might then cost you 2 points, a forth copy might be 3 points. The result it that you can't just one trick pony your way through battles, you have to have to plan a bit and make yourself a strategy in order to succeed.-Those arena battles end up being strangely addictive.So the verdict is clearly a thumbs up from it, I hope that we get to see more games from the same developer, a sequel perhaps, that said I also hope that any sequel we do get doesn't move away from the formula that's been set up here in the first Dwarf Run. Even with a bigger budget I hope that any follow up games retain what Dwarf Run has at its core, and that's Charm."

I never write reviews, but I thought this game really deserved it. The humor was spot on, not too much but not too serious either. The puzzles weren't really out there like some other point-n-click games. Yeah the difficulty might have been a little too rough even on the leisure setting, and the arena had way too many fights that drew the action down, but with a little tweaking, it's a sure challenge for anybody who wants to test their mettle. This game is indeed a diamond in the rough. I enjoyed it from start to finish... Congratz for a game well done!"

Yes it is a linear game, but it is alot of fun. The first fight you get into, you'll probably get your butt handed back to you, so you look for another solution, Then once you figure out what you need to do before you get into that brawl, it becomes much more managable. The puzzles are pretty straight forward, they are common sense. It does take a little bit of an effort to understand the mechanics of the game, but once you do it is fun to play.You will spend the most of your time fighting, the turn-base system, is ok as well, you need to pay attention to the amount  of action points you have, ie...you have your Cleric cast bless on someone, then you cast regeneration in the same turn, but nothing happens and it is the next characters turn, you are like WTF happened, But the next time around when it is your Clerics turn again, the first thing he does is cast regeneration on the toon you had told him to do it on. So with that in mind, you need to plan ahead.They say it should take 15-20 hours to play, but maybe because I like to see what all my options are, it took me a little longer, or maybe if you know what to do, it might take the suggested time. All in all it was a good game to help me get through the weekend. And now that I know what needs to be done, I'll play it again."

The Dwarf Run is a linear, indie (1 man dev) RPG with inventory puzzles and lots of turn-based combat. Be warned that the default difficulty level is equivalent to hard mode of modern RPG games, luckily you can change this at any time if you find it too brutal.Pros:+ Challenging combat that forces you to really understand the combat mechanics. You can tell that a lot of thought went into some of the battle design and there is good variety. The last two chapters crank up the difficulty level to almost rage-inducing levels, making it much more satisfying to beat the game.+ A quirky story with a variety of scenarios and locations that goes a bit crazy near the end.+ Really captures that old-school RPG feel.+ Lots of convenient autosaves and an option to respec your characters at any time.+ There truly are no cutting edge bloomy graphics as stated in the description. However I did like the loading screen graphics and the stained glass windows in the temple area were pretty.+ Helpful, responsive dev.Cons:- Default camera angle was confusing to navigate. Luckily there is an option to switch to 3rd person WASD controls although you can't move backwards. Having the default camera as either top down isometric (like Divinity Original Sin) or 3rd person WASD (like Star Wars: KOTOR) would be much better because that is what gamers are most familiar with.- Dialogue was not created by a native English speaker and it shows. Could do with some refinement. There is no voice acting but this is probably way beyond the scope and budget of the game.- In battles, not having a clear hex grid layout makes it hard to see if a character is blocking another from moving.- A rare bug in battles meant that sometimes a character could not target an enemy for one round. Hopefully this will get fixed.- Most of the music was adequate but could have been stronger to add more atmosphere.- The extremely linear design combined with having a specific solution for each puzzle means you can get stuck (or die) a lot until you figure out the solution or check the walkthrough. Maybe an in-game hint system would be useful?Summary:The Dwarf Run is clearly a budget, indie RPG, slightly rough around the edges, but if you aren't put off by the presentation it is definitely worth checking out. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the 20 hours or so of gameplay I got from it. I look forward to the dev's next project.Final score 7.5/10"

A lot of trial and error got me through most of it and the game is generally built so that you can't advance unless you have everything you need.  I did have to look a walkthrough for a couple of things and didn't feel bad after I saw what you were supposed to do (WTF? moments).- Not much polish.  PS2 graphics, lack of sounds, no voice acting (that might be a plus considering the crummy VO in some games).- Combat fluctuates in interest and complexity.  Sometimes I had to give specific orders to win the day and other times I Just let the game auto run combat.- One part of the game involves prolonged combat that felt a bit like padding and was my least favorite part of the game.I enjoyed my 13 1/2 hours in the game.  Good for people who are a fan of D&D (the rough old school kind) and don't take it too seriously.  I played the game on casual because I just wanted to enjoy the exploration and adventure, not bang my head against the wall."

It plays like a point-and-click adventure game, solving puzzles with inventory items, with turn-based squad combat ala Wasteland 2 or X-Com.The story is decent, gear upgrades and loot are rare, which makes them more valuable, and some of the dialogue and cut scenes are quite funny, particularly one where your party meets a...er...I'm not going to spoil it.Nothing in this game is perfect, but it doesn't matter because it's fun.  That's what it comes down to.  This game is fun.  Pretty much the best endorsement I can give any game is that I finished it, and I finished this one.PROS:  You can respec whenever you want, so it's impossible to gimp your toons and have to restart.  The game autosaves constantly, so if you forget to quicksave before a tough fight, or you kill your whole party by making an obviously stupid choice, it won't matter.  Good dialogue between the characters.  Lots of variety in the game environments.CONS:  A couple of the fights later in the game are difficult, even on the normal setting.  I found them impossible on the default challenge mode.  Pathing in combat, once in a blue moon, is really messed up.  Once in a while, frame rate plummets after casting fire spells.  Very, very rarely the game locks up during combat and Task Manager is the only egress.  The lockups, for me, all happened during instances of messed up pathing.Summary:  A few nights worth of fun point-and-clicking and Dwarven squad combat.  Definitely worth the price tag and the time investment."

Combine that with having to conserve ammo and potions and you have some enjoyable dungeon crawling.- Surprisingly good itemization and character system.- Light puzzle elements. Nothing very complex but they provide a break between fights.- The story. It's bizarre and small in scope, there is no saving the world, just a group of adventurers searching for treasure.

Then read DerWizard's review because it pretty much covers most of what I was going to say.Yeah, the camera  is wiggy.  Yeah my 11+ dex ranger with 83% hit chance misses eight times in a row and does minimal damage per hit.  (*maybe the random number algorithm is borked. . . maybe)  And yeah, some of the spells are half useless because some enemies are immune to some of them and others simply don't work the way you might think the work.  Most of that can be dealt with by adjusting tactics or, in the event that you just can't buy a frigging hit, load and re-play the fight.It certainly is not perfect, but it's challenging and I have fun playing it.  As often as the random number generator kicks me in the teeth (83% chance missing 7 or 8 times in a row. . . I know.  I know.  It happens, but it's annoying) I also have had success in some encounters by changing tactics.  Many games reward the rinse/repeat and don't think about it tactical combat style.  This one, in some fights and encounters, does the opposite.  It seems to reward you for doing different things.  For example, I made one fight way, way easier by doing one simple thing.  I went from getting stomped into the mud on the first attempt to an easy, easy win on the second.  And this particular fight is known to be nasty.  The walkthrough actually informs you that it's hard, and suggests using consumeable items.  And no. I didn't cheat.  I also read the walkthrough for that section *after* I finished the battle.  Shame on you!  (just kidding)Anyway, I like that a different approach to some fights can make the fight harder or easier depending on what you choose to do.  It is not necessarily always required.  If you want you can keep hammering away using the same tactics and *eventually* the random numbers will come up in your favour.  Or you can change your tactics and make the fight a bit easier.  Usually.I'm having fun with it.  It was cheap.  I've paid more and gotten less out of a lot of other games.  It's challenging, but not always for the right reasons, however the dev (yeah, to the best of my knowledge it is one person) is tweaking game balance fairly frequently right now and added tips to the game reminding people that certain stats, like constitution, are essential to success later on.Perfect game?  Not even close.  Fun?  Usually.  Challenging and frustrating?  Both, sometimes.  Linear?  Yup.  Good story?  Up to you to decide, I think it's pretty basic but does the trick.  Good writing?  Not particularly for me, but I read a *LOT*.  The dialogue has made me laugh more than once.  Great graphics?  No... but they work.  You can tell what things are supposed to be.Recommended?  Yup, 'specially if you know what you're buying *and* get it on sale.  I'd argue it's worth the base price, however if you're not sure just wait for the next sale."

You have to make do with limited equipment and skill points, carefully building up your characters, conserving money and ammo while solving the tactical challenges and puzzles for experience and items. It has a straightforward story and some effective humour as well. Sadly the game falls flat in the third act by sticking you in an arena with endless combats and everything interesting about the game stripped out. The Arena sucks and it ruins the game IMO. Developer tried to fix it by adding a 'casual' arena mode with fewer fights, but it's still too many fights.

The game I'd consider it most similar to would be the Drakensang games, with some hints of Blackguards (it's of similar difficulty to Blackguards, if not more so). The graphics are ok, not it's strong point. Similar to games that perhaps came out in 2005. The music is excellent however, and the game does a good job of creating atmosphere. The writing is very good as well, with elements of humor throughout. The game is pretty linear, but that's not exactly bad.  The only fault I can find is the fights are perhaps a bit too difficult. Many fights might come down to who gets the last hit in. There are times you might think a fight is impossible, only to discover there is another room where you can fight 1-2 more batches of monsters, and they drop a weapon or level up one of your guys, and that tiny edge is what you needed to make it through the next fight. Some of the encounters take thought, and require a solution you would not normally think of, forcing you to figure out an unorthodox solution. All-in-all, I think this is a good game."

And the combat in this game is done fairly well, is balanced, and requires real tough decisions to be made. All of that is working quite well.However, I blame my disappointment on the scenario design, as about halfway through you're forced to fight a ton of battles within an arena. All manner of exploration is removed and it just starts to feel like a grind. The combat IS good, don't get me wrong, but not good enough to withstand this slog. Games like FFT can afford to do away with exploration because the character building and combat dynamics are so friggin' deep, but here after six or seven straight samey arena battles, the combat simply can't mange to stay fun. And all you have to look forward to in terms of power is a point or two into a skill you already have.After so many fights in a row, patterns start to emerge and it all sort of starts to feel samey. For example, my Wizard will start every fight casting Posses x2, then Fireball, then Itch, then use up the rest of his Spark spells. While there is a consideration of prioritizing enemies, other than that, you generally employ the same strategy in most every fight, and I think the Arena reveals this flaw.Had these fights been more broken up and spread out over several areas replete with exploration and people to talk to and things to find, I might not have minded so much. I think 10 or 20 real big fights would have taken me right to the end, and I would have been happy. This Arena thing just isn't working for me. I feel as trapped as my characters.So I can't really give a positive review because the Arena takes up such a huge part of the game, or at least feels like it, because it's so underwhelming compared to the sections that came before."

I sincerely hope the team makes another similiar game which I would buy at release with no hesitation!"

The puzzles are fun and not too hard, rewarding when you work them out and the overall gameplay is great if you like a party rpg where you are constantly trying to get better loot.The fighting system is simple but good.  A few more skills and abilities may have been nice but most the fights are very interesting.  There are a lot of boss fights many of which you really need to change tactics to beat, some may keep you scratching your head for a while.I didn't like the default camera setting wasn't to my taste as it kept panning out and round but once I changed it I had no problems (there are 3 to chose from).All in all a very good game, amazing for the price.  10/10"

You have four fixed adventurers to steer one each of a fighter, cleric, ranger and wizard. There is no character generation but you gain experience points with which you can increase attributes, skills and talents. It is a rather limited system but very rewarding and its best part. The other part I like is the constant problem solving by finding, using and mixing items to solve different obstacles. That gives this game a nice touch.There are a lot of fixed combats in this game and at chapter 4 on default ""Challenging"" difficulty I had a very tough time and had to decrease it to casual gamestyle. The game is still hard at that level but suits fine so far at chapter 5. The game is quite humourous which is not a part I am very fond of. The story is nothing special and there are a lot of small sidequests.Overall, well worth it at sale and easy to throw away 10 or more hours into but only if you are totally out of RPGs would I recommend to buy it for its ordinary price.It reminds me of the game Underworld Gold even though they have little in common except being party based indie RPGs. But I would say Underworld is better and more advanced but this game is easier to get into."

Like perfect if you have played 80s and 90s rpg games and enjoyed those.   Younger audiences may have a hard time figuring out some of the puzzles if they have little experience with classic rpgs.  This is a great game for turn based fanatics."

It has the right pace, the right mix of exploration, combat, adventure and whacky dialogue. More dialogue and interaction would be appreciated.Character development is well done.And putting it nicely, I really hope the dev learned a lot concerning game design, since the 2nd part of the game, the arena, is awful. Not only too many fights, it also needs some adventure, dialogue or plot between the fights.Graphics are indie, but since this is an oldschool game I really dont understand all the dislikes. It is almost like people cannot read, because it is advertised that this game has NO cutting edge bloomy grahics. Besides there are screenshots. Why complain when you get EXACTLY what was proposed?Despite the arena, this game gets a solid recommend, because I like oldschool whacky dialogue more than that pseudo-realism of Witcher and Elder Scrolls or boring characters like in Mass Effect."

,Not Recommended,395420,28573978,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,jenn_geoffroy,"Good-ish two-thirds of a game. Then you hit a brick wall of grindiness. After the third try at a fight that married the most boring elements of an arena fight to the worst aspects of an escort quest, and realizing I would have to fight the same fight again TWO MORE TIMES at least in order to get all tiers, I asked myself: Am I having fun? No. No, I am not. So I stopped.The first two-thirds of the game were fun enough; a few one-liners made me smile, a section when you get to the temple of doom or whatever it's called was inventive and fun, and the elf's face perpetually stuck in an expression that screams ""AIIII! A BALROG!"" is, I suspect (hope) some kind of inside joke. If you can get this game on sale that would justify a dozen hours of decent gameplay and you like turn-based fantasy dungeon crawls, go for it.Edit: After dropping the review (I'd played the game a month or more ago and was just catching up on rating some stuff) I noticed a note by the dev saying they set up a casual mode for the arena that cuts down the fights by 2/3. Indubitably a good thing, though I can't say I have any enthusiasm for continuing even under those conditions. Still, extra incentive to buy for anyone who might feel like it."

,Not Recommended,395420,26483895,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,LegendaryGeek1,"Well I put in near 3 hours on stream during my indie game night. First I'd like to give some positives... Graphics are not bad, also story is interesting and is not without humor. The progression is achieved through obtaining the tools needed to progress to the next area which requires some thought.My Neutral thoughts on this is based on preference. the camera angles are obscure and the game is turn based which is something I simply don't prefer.The negatives, Well... yes there are a few. Progression is slow, very slow. the point allocation system tends to leave the party barely hanging on.  And without spoiling things.... there are areas where the enemy simply overwhelms you and since you can't retreat, you simply die. I'd recommend dumping everything into Dexterity and Constitution.  The hit to miss ratio is seriously near 50/50 at the beginning.  and the characters start out with like 15 hp which goes quick!Since this game was made by a single person it is pretty impressive.... but I simply can't recommend this. 5/10 at best."

76561198010429902,Not Recommended,395420,18942796,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,ancientelder,"Pros: Very stable for an indie game.Cons: Dull humour and dialog, broken game play mechanics, and a difficulty curve that puts it out of the range of causal gamers. To be specific, the combat is difficult, the point and click puzzles are simplistic at best.Do you enjoy really hard tactical combat? This game is recommended for you.Update: Upon getting further in to the game I'm rewarded with endless arena combat. Ok, so level design is hard and it's great if you can make one level and then reuse it for 50% of the game, but ... ENDLESS! You've now earned your thumbs down."

My archer guy with bow and arrows on person seems to just wanna run up to the enemy and use his fists to fight, instead of his weapon! Mine as well forget about the weapons, bc they are useless here!  Glad i'm only $3 out of what I paid for it. Use it to better the game please."
