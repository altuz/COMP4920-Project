,Recommended,395500,24410201,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,AccidentlyOnPurpose,"6.2/10 - 1920’s Mafia Pixel Platformer with Elements of NoirI had fun with this game, but I got it for free prior to the finalization of the game I assume since the release now says July 16. I received the game from an unknown friend*, they made a point to say they weren’t affiliated with the  developer but I have my suspicions, especially since I played it over a month ago... Regardless, it was fun!The game is a pretty simple Pixel/Platformer shooter. You must traverse 7 stages using only a few guns of choice; certain guns are more effective against different enemies so don’t get too attached to a single weapon. You will be taking down the mafia in this short but sweet game; it took me about 35 minutes to complete it. So at $2, be aware of the game’s length, but if you like platformers I think you’ll dig this.Overall, It’s good. $2 would be the very most I would possibly pay, I’m being generous though since 10% supposedly is donated to charity… I haven’t seen any updates on that though. Without the Charity donation I would value it at $1 or so and if they don’t follow through with this promise I will change my answer for sure.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

76561198100783978,Not Recommended,395500,24311012,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,MegaGunPuncher,"Rot Gut was an impulse buy for me. ""A black-and-white 1920s film noir action platformer?! Sign me the hell up!"" Is what I thought as I impulsively purchased the game on a whim. Turns out that was a mistake. Even with its crazy low $2 asking price, this is not a game you should be paying for. Contrary to what people may believe, a game being short does not necessarily detract from its value in isolation. Many of the greatest old-school platformers could be beaten within an hour-and-a-half if you're a decent gamer, but that’s not the problem. This game represents everything that is misguided about the indie ""retro platformer"" scene that is glutting Steam right now.The game seemed promising up until I realized it was made in Flixel, one of the laziest Pixel art design tools known to man. If you like using Flixel, more power to you, but there are scant few Flixel games I'd actually pay for, given that it's mainly a tool used for simple♥♥♥♥♥newgrounds flash games... and Canabalt. Look, Flixel aside, this game is appallingly underdeveloped, as if the developers decided to give birth two months early. The controls are snappy and responsive, but   there are no rebindable keys and there's no controller support. On top of that the game control has no character. Dicky McGumshoe here has all the weight and momentum as a helium balloon, and so the platforming is woefully basic and flat.""But it’s a shooter! So maybe the shooting is good?"" Not at all. Enemies do two things, walk back and forth, and shoot at you, with the only variable being the weapons they carry and the damage they take. You can see the devs were trying to go for a rock-paper-scissors sort of thing where you use your pistol, shotgun, or Tommy gun as the situation demands-shotguns for the smaller guys and dogs and the Tommy gun for the shotgun-toting big dudes- but the enemies are so static and the levels so flat that it becomes redundant by the second level! Not to mention that the unlimited-ammo pistol works just fine with proper jumping, so the other weapons become even more redundant. To top it off, the (two!) bosses are pathetically easy, and the aesthetic, while under-represented in platformers, is utterly squandered on repetitive and simplistic background design.This game has a hard time stacking up with free Newgrounds flash games I've played from 10 years ago, let alone modern indie games. the fact that it can be beaten in 30 minutes, if not faster, only sours the deal. But the length is not the issue. The game's design is the issue. Indie Retro Platformers are, discounting a few exceptions, a damn crutch. Dev tools like Flixel allow countless indie devs to fall back on pixel art as way to reduce time and money spent on a game's art design and player feedback rather than as a way to convey crisp visuals and fluidity and immediacy in gameplay. Which is why you'll notice that a lot of indie ""retro"" platformers don't attempt to imitate the graphical limitations or even the general look of any specific retro system, nor do they attempt to use pixel art to its greatest effect and use it to create levels and worlds with rich graphical detail. Most of it is blocky, Atari-esque pixel artwork with small sprites and simple designs.And this lazy approach to design tends to carry over to the gameplay, as many games have the trappings of retro gameplay, but none of the nuance and clever design that make those older games classics. Rot Gut is no exception. In fact, it exemplifies all of the problems that I feel a lot of indie retro platformers tend to have, especially when you consider the fact that at a baseline level, the game's not horrible. It functions and can be a bit fun for a while, but that only makes its shortcoming more apparent.In short, don't buy this game, if not more on principal than anything else. But if you would like to see an undistilled example of the misguided design choices that plague indie platformers, this is a fascinating summary, if nothing else."

The theme is black-and-white/grayscale with red highlights. You play as Unnamed Agent Man in the Prohibition Era of the US. Agent Man sees the murder of a man and follows, finding the body to be disposed of into an incinerator. From here the game is played as a 2D-Platformer with 2 guns available at the start. There are nice little details in this game, like how early on you receive a chest placed pretty clearly to teach you how to better use your Double Jump. Also notable is the cigar in mister Agent's mouth. It glows red and smoke comes up from it. Even if it's a small touch like that, a well-put detail is very much appreciated. There are 3 weapons in total, one of which being unlocked after one of the two(yes, two) boss battles. Enemy variety is pretty small, at about 6 enemy-types seen by the end of the game. The more interesting one includes the dog, which adds a small twitch reaction to the game whenever you think the way is clear. The music is very much of the 20's, being made up of jazzy chiptune pieces meant for looping, and is one of the strongsuits ofRot Gut. I think my favorite song is the theme for the first level,Down at the Docks.Overall, while the enemy variety is lacking as well as the game being incredibly short,Rot Gutwas incredibly fun with catchy music and nice little details like the cigar and the transitions between levels. However, if 25 minutes doesn't sound like a good amount of time to spend with the game, then I wouldn't recommend buying it, as I'm honestly one of the worst Platformer gamers out there and I still finished this game in the stated timeframe. However, the personality and music themselves and some vision of this becoming a speedran game(Hint, hint) win me over and I hope the same will be said for others."

,Not Recommended,395500,24403757,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,trentonvitro,"I can't really recommend this game at all. Everything about it, from its brevity to the lack of controller support to the pointless (so to speak) mouse cursor on screen during gameplay [you can, of course, move the cursor to the corner of the screen to hide it, but WHY IS IT THERE ANYWAY?], screams ""attempt to cash in on what was once a free Flash game"". There's no enemy AI to speak of: you shoot a guy, jump to dodge his bullets as he turns and shoots you, then he immediately forgets about you and begins to walk away. Repeat until he's a puddle of red pixels. Why can your character, a hardboiled noir badass, do a double jump? There's nothing gritty about that. There are six short levels, and the pause menu allows you to skip every single one of them, as I discovered when I got bored around Act IV. Oh, and you still get the level completion achievements for the levels you skip. I can't tell if there's a story; you just murder everyone and everything you encounter. Vending machines are scattered throughout the levels, because why not. You push up (or W) to spend some of the coins that flow like gibs when blasting barrels and boxes (and the occasional miniboss). The only problem with this is that because of how the keys are bound, jumping also activates the vending machine. In other words, you can't jump in front of a vending machine. You can only spend. It took me probably 70 misspent in-game dollars to finally learn my lesson. In Rot Gut's defense, the gameplay mechanics, while basic, are pretty solid, although my appreciation of this was dampened by having to use the keyboard rather than a gamepad for the controls. The pixel graphics are... better than some pixel graphics, anyway. In the brief time I spent playing this, I encountered only one notable glitch, when a (normally non-jumping) enemy jumped off a ledge and sort of hovered in the air above me for a while before I put him out of his misery. My favorite part of this game, by far, is its cover image on the store page. And of course, it's relatively cheap. All the same, I have a case of the buyer's remorse. If you want a good Noir platformer, try Gunpoint. In fact, I might just re-play that right now. Damn, that was a good game. In conclusion: I think I spent more time writing this review than I did playing Rot Gut, and I definitely had more fun writing this review than I did playing Rot Gut."

It's insultingly brief and unbelievably easy. Usually, I won't bother with writing a review for a game unless I've put a significant amount of time into it (100 or more hours) or have unlocked every achievement, which normally requires a great deal of time and effort. However,it took me 20 minutes to completely beat this game and earn every achievement. Twenty minutes. That's it!The gameplay is generic as it comes. You can jump, double jump, shoot, and switch weapons from a pistol to a shotgun, and a submachine gun earned halfway through the game (10 minutes in). The control is very fluent, although I could find no way to rebind keys, as the game lacks even a basic options menu. Enemies are witless and easy to kill, and health is never a concern. The two bosses the game gives you are pathetic and not challenging in the least. I never even saw the game over screen throughout my entire playthrough. It all just feels unfinished - while the graphics and sound are okay at best, the fact remains that there is no meat whatsoever in this game, nothing to bring you back for another round.I've picked up games at or below this price point that have given me ten times the value that Rot Gut has, and I honestly don't feel it's worth it. I wouldn't even charge money for a game this sparsely featured - at its sub-half-hour length, it should be a free demo. But it's a ripoff. I spent more time writing this review than I did playing the game.

Like, I don't want to disparage the creative effort of several  dudes who have put out infinitely more games than I have and it's not like the game isn't arguably a more satisfying experience than what you can buy in a vending machine for the exact same price. It's just a perfectly fine game that doesn't really motivate you to do anything besides keep walking left and buying shotgun shells.There's no point in fighting the enemies (all of which take three times longer to kill than they should), there's no point in exploring the levels, and zero point in using any weapon besides the shotgun. You can collect points, but once you top up on health kits and shells, there's (shockingly) no point in doing that either. Just run to the left for twenty-five minutes and periodically blast your shotgun at the giants that refill all your health. Eventually, you'll reach the last boss, who eventually explodes in an infinite shower of dumb useless coins like some sort of metaphor for your dumb useless life until you walk into the final Exit door, no better or worse for wear as a human being. Then you find out there isn't actually an exit button and you have to force close the executible, and that's how you end up writing a review as meandering and pointless as this game.All that being said, it's a perfectly fine first effort. Better than any of the (zero) games I've actually made! The team very clearly loved what they were doing, as seen in the caring way chunks of viscera bounce along the ground after you commit murder.

I'm pretty sure it's either about a private eye vigilante or some harboiled dirty cop out for revenge, but the game never realy makes it clear what you're doing or why you're doing it. That's perfectly okay with me, though. I checked out this game because of it's cool pixel noire art style and general lack of color, making it feel like some old action thriller. Or a linear, 2D version of Mafia.Pros:-Cool art style-Good, jazzy soundtrack-Tight controls-Decent challenge-Good use of sparing colors-Simple mechanics and level design-Easy to completeCons:-Very, very short (which might be a problem for some)-Only tells you how to switch weapons after level 2-Unclear story-A bit lacking in enemy varietyOverall, Rot Gut is a simple, straight forward action platformer that I (and probably you) could beat and complete in less than half an hour.
