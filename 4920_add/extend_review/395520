76561197988012862,Recommended,395520,18215575,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,mendel,"Good free puzzle game.On the face, Missing Translation is a collection of three puzzle games with 25 levels each, and some overworld that connects them thrown in. The puzzles typically have several possible solutions, so while thy do require some logical thinking, they're not too hard. However, there's some non-obvious stuff to figure: it turns out that you can talk using a grid that you can make lines on, and there are some bits of an in-game language you can learn, with 3 people and a computer to talk to. Also, 3 achievements are in code. And what are those vertical windmills for? Lots of secrets (the two locked classrooms contain puzzles that aren't done yet).The game even runs ok on my old XP box, though the store page doesn't say so. It's free, it's small (under 80 MB installed): if you like puzzles, give it a go!The only drawback is that it's short. If you want more of those kinds of puzzles, check outUniumorOccam's quilt; if you want to crack more codes, tryPlease, Don't Touch Anything."

Actually, the only language in the game is apparently the language of a race from an alien world, so no problem. From the Store Page, ""REPEAT, NO TEXT. Everyone can enjoy it regardless of the language they speak :D"", and ""No tutorials, hints or even text to be found here. This wasn't made to increase difficulty but to let the player do everything on his own, ""Missing Translation"" isn't a hard game, but we don't like hand-holding."" BUT, achievements are included, and ARE in English (as suitable.)13 awards are listed for ""Missing Translation"", and I expect there will be more. It is a truly endearing game. The game's protagonist, player choice of gender, is abducted by (space) aliens (So there, Mr. Trump!) S/he is taken to a world inhabited by cats and peculiar looking aliens, and must solve countless (though mostly pretty simple) puzzles. What's most challenging about most of the puzzles (which seem to progress through 25 levels each) is the alien concept behind each group of 25 puzzles. What is to be done? Some are simple, some can be solved without knowing the goal...to a point. 25 levels seems a bit extreme, but that does allow for a thorough exploration of each concept. One of the best features of (possibly) all puzzles is the option to stop at any level, try another, and come back at the time of your choosing.The art is black & white pixel, and it's fully adequate. As is the pleasant music. Other reviews indicate fairly short game time, but for a free game, what's the harm? There's a Deluxe Edition available for $3.99US, but the game is complete without spending a cent. Basically, extras to support the DEVs, who ended up with a larger game than anticipated. EVen achievements are included in the FREE version.Hopefully, as I play I'll update this review.Thank you!"

,Recommended,395520,23285664,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"I'M SO INTO THIS GAME!Unable to sleep, your character (which you can choose to be either male or female) goes for a late night stroll to clear their head only to get pulled through a portal and into a strange world filled with odd beings, an abundance of cats, and lots and lots of puzzles. Solve all the puzzles to make your return home.For the most part, there are three main puzzle types, and three main chambers which house 25 of each type as they're displayed on a wall panel that fills the entire screen. The first type involves moving a block through a series of mazes so as to fill in all the empty spaces behind you as you move, but being careful not to trap yourself in the process. The second has you controlling the movement of multiple boxes simultaneously as they slide along tracks, with the goal being to manage the position of the boxes so they each rest within an outlined area. And in the final type you'll be presented with a board filled with crosses/plus signs, each of the four arms of every cross being either black or white, with the objective this time being to rotate the crosses so that all connecting points of every arm match colour.They all start off easy enough, introducing you to the most simplistic form of each puzzle to teach you how it works (showing rather than saying, since there isn't a single word of text in the game beyond its title), but they gradually raise the difficulty or complexity as things slowly ramp up throughout the course of each set of 25. It's tough to judge how difficult others will find it, as is always the case with puzzle games. Some may breeze through it, while others may hit roadblocks at points as they just can't see the solution, but all told, I imagine most will take about an hour to get through the main challenge. Though there is some additional content for those willing to dig into it.As well as the main story puzzles, there's a whole other larger puzzle hidden away in the form of the game's own language. This is a language based on symbols which you can draw to a handful of NPCs littered around the world. It's completely non-essential to the story puzzles and you can complete the game without ever even knowing it's there. But, still, even though I admit it's not really my thing and I had no bloody clue what was going on with it and quickly resorted to using a guide for the achievement related to it, I love the fact they went to the trouble of including it in the first place.Presentation wise, I adored the greyscale art - fairly pixel heavy in ""cutscenes"", really clear and detailed whilst actually playing - and the music never stopped putting a smile on my face the entire time, either. I'm still in awe of the fact such an incredible product was given to us for free, so much so, in fact, that as soon as I add some more Steam funds, I fully intend to buy the non-playable DLC as thanks and support to the devs and really hope others will, too.Part of me wishes there was more content, just because I had such a great time with it, but then again, maybe that's for the best, as, if it were made any longer, it could risk outstaying its welcome. I had a perfect little experience, and I'm happy with the memory and feeling that it left with me, so I really can't ask for anything more. It may only take you an hour to complete, but what an hour that will be."

,Recommended,395520,20422111,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Artibius,"PROS:+ nice soundtrack+ game presentation of objectives+ fun art-style+ freeCONS:- short game time- only 3 puzzles (+ the bouns one)- game presentation of controlsComment:A cool little puzzle game with a couple of flaws. The main being the limited content and thus also short game time. But it is a FREE game so it doesn't matter all that much. The art-style is fun and the no-text theme helps to translate into a good view on objectives through symbols. My problem is with the view of the controls, while the standard ones are okay, nowhere was it even hinted you could use a mouse. I know it sounds dumb but you need this in order to finish the bonus puzzle (and get 2 achievements). While nothing to cry about, it could have been hinted at least in some way. Overall a fun short puzzle game that is worth taking a look at and I recommend it!------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

,Recommended,395520,29842692,Posted: 11 February,all,Stealth,"Ever wanted to explore  a new language without any means of translating it directly? ""Missing Translations"" tries to give you exactly that. You're in a world filled with puzzles and cryptic (symbolic) language and have to find out what those symbols could mean.What appears to be the main part of this game at first, quickly becomes dull. The puzzles are very easy and just time consuming. The real challenge is to find out about that new language. What could those weird signs mean? How do people react, if I try to communicate with them?Sadly the language part in ""Missing Translation"" can almost entirely be ignored and you can still finish the game. However, if you actually want to look into it, you'll probably have some fun with it. Also, please let me know of other games that do this language-exploring-thingy better!"

76561198364117281,Recommended,395520,30077176,Posted: 21 February,all,Wolfthorn,"I was quite intrigued by this game, especially as it promised lots of puzzles.  There certainly are, although it's actually just 3 different puzzles, each with 25 levels so I'm not sure if that counts.  It did get a little monotonous going through them all unfortunately.  There's a separate fourth puzzle which I almost missed but that only unlocked an achievement so it seemed quite incidental.  It looks like the game isn't quite finished; there are two locked rooms which apparently aren't available yet.  It certainly has an air of not being complete.  I finished the game by accident, by going through one of the doors thinking I'd missed something only to find it that was the end!  I found the music rather loud and a little irritating after a while but there's no option to turn it down or off which is a shame.It's a short little game, something different and probably worth a try if you've got an hour or two to spare and like puzzles."
