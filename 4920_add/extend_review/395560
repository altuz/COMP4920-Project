The money spent in developing the game was too little or the staff was too tired. Graphics are just passable. Story is sufferable. and Bugs are plenty. Its is not as humorous as the first. Considering the price and the competition, or lack of, its OK."

I do like  the first lost horizon in many ways but this just isnt the same. some of the puzzles are SO ilogical that no wonder thay put in a walkthrough in - game ,for instance (not trying to add spoilers so I wont give out too much information) you are in the forest looking for a back entrance you KNOW you are in the right spot no doubt at all but NOTHING happens ZILCH no indication to point you in the right direction either . I only found out what to do by looking at the walkthrough there are too many instances like this that I just got annoyed with the game .some good graphics however commenting on the sounds now in ALL the scenes where theres water falling from the rocks above you dont hear ANY water!! not a trickle! like I said  good graphics but dont expect good puzzles because you will end up looking at the walkthrough some of the time. Good story some good voice acting too. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would say a 6 maybe 6 and a half.the pc system requirements say this needs at LEAST a 2 gb memory for the GRAPHICS CARD but I have a 1 gb graphics card a gtx 550 ti and I have no graphical problem at all. Im only playing this game for the story and the cool locations with mystic ruins etc NOT for anything else and certainly NOT for the stupid illogical puzzles. This game wasn't ready too be released when it did it needed more testers."

The story is good, the graphics are nice and the tasks are motivating. The locations are nice, varied and captivating. There are some glitches now and then with the animations, but they are not disturbing. I do not like the reaction-parts of the gameplay, fortunately there are not many in the first four chapters. I play the game with mouse only, just as classic adventure games are meant to be played and it works perfectly."

It was boring, the characterizations from the first were completely different, and the fun romantic history of the original was gone. The puzzles are often buggy or random, and even the built-in walkthrough is wrong at points. It was also quite short. Absolutely not recommended and very disappointed, as I thoroughly enjoy most adventure games. Save often - there is no autosave, and when a puzzle bugs out and you have to restart, you'll want those save games. Very disappointed."

The music was amazing and I wished Animation Artsand Deep Silver would have kept up with their good work in the past.Lost Horizon 2 may offer some nice sceneric locations from time to time and I was Glad to have Fenton and his Daughter with me. The Story started off nicely but soon I found the soundeffects and the cutscenes werent going anywhere near its predecessor. It rather went the opposite direction. Cutscenes are looking very bad and animations not smooth at all.The puzzles havent really improved but have become a bit more annoying to take controll of a wheel to steer or a swtich to move.The story kinda  gets lost during half of the gameplay and many questions are left unanswered. Also not much is mentioned what happened with Fenton and Kim after the first game ( I wont spoiler here either).I also hoped that gameplay somehow would have some improvments or some developement but not much new was added.An ingame walkthrough can guide you through every puzzle if you get stuck at some point which is a positive aspect but maybe the only one that I would say is an improvement at all.It was anyway hard to top the original Lost Horizon since it was a very beautiful and entertaining game but somehow the developers of LH 2 totally fell off a cliff.If you want a recommendation then I can suggest you Lost Horizon 1 if you havent bought it already!"

Characters, annoying* Puzzles are mundane, and have no connection to the storyline, whatsoeverThis game has the terminal illness  called 'generic puzzles'. Since it has no plot, it resorts to making everything difficult, to stall for time. Towards the end it gives up any pretense, and all the puzzles are just some generic **** you've seen anywhere* Some of the puzzles are *pure* guesswork. No logic to them. At one point you'd have togo through all the 5x5x4 options of a certain files cabinet to find the viking artefact.Why? No reason. Just stalling* Moreover, tons of useless items you never use* Finally, I couldn't finish it. Towards the end there's a bug in therune-puzzle, where the door sometimes doesn't open.Pros:* Decent voice acting?Do not buy this game, just stay with your memories from Lost Horizon I. This one is a complete waste of time, in any adventure-game wise prespective"

Exploring old houses is especially fun for me. I experienced no technical issues throughout gameplay. In the style of point and click adventures, there was a lot of thinking to be done in this game.Most of the puzzles were easy. I would say the one at the end with the Nordic Boat was particularly difficult. I really enjoyed that the characters travelled all over the world. Some of the landscapes were very beautiful. I really enjoyed the fact that autumn leaves fell throughout certain segments of the game. It reminded me of another of my most favourite games,Black Mirror III. The learning curve seemed to fall on easy for most of the game until you reached the final chapters. It then seemed to soar up to rather difficult in certain areas. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point and click adventures with a pseudo-historical narrative.  Since Germany isn't allowed to utilise the swastika in games they chose a different symbol. This didn't take away from the overall story regarding World War II. It helped you understand the severe terror these people went through especially in their hiding from the Nazi's. In a way it reminded me of when I visited Anne Frank's house in The Netherlands."

Poor graphics, very shallow and simple plot, stupid riddles, illogical solutions and many many bugs. Some of them even make it impossible to continue the game. Of course you can alwas load some save but only if you saved it at thr right moment.I didn't finish it, stuck with the stupid rotating pillars at the cave. No idea how they work and what should I do to make the third one move but I don't care anymore. Mainly because I can't try to solve this riddle again because a bug won't let me get to them anymore after I left the room and came back. And my last save was long ago and I don't have any more patience for this game to load it and try again. It's simply not worth the effort."
,Not Recommended,395560,28928376,Posted: 1 January,all,JJCobra,"Loved the first game.  The orriginal felt very cinematic, was well written, nice graphics, good dialogue, 60 NPCs....  This on the other hand... Well... It feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized port of a game that was built to put on the iphone.  But then again this is par for the course in any Animation Arts series.  For Example, Segrect Files: Tanguska was pure genius.  Then Secret Files 2 came out, it was alright, but clearly suffered from being a sequel.  Secret Files 3... Well lets just say that someone flung some poo at a fan here and signalled a death spiral for that series.  And don't even get me started on Sam Peters, but needless to say, travesty, and wanting ill will towards the developers would be putting things lightly.So actually, I guess that means that Animation Arts got better... at failure and killing a series faster?  Why waste killing a promising IP over 4 games, when only 2 will do.  Right?"

76561197970613265,Not Recommended,395560,31607880,Posted: 7 May,all,tsujigiri_nin,"I am not too picky when it comes to adventure games, willing to overlook convoluted solutions to mundane situations (exacerbated when the games have realistic-ish settings), non-existant character animations and the occasional writing fumble.  Deep Silver have generally been pretty good at those - solid, middle of the road games that scratch the itch I've nursed ever since the first Broken Sword.  Lost Horizon 1 was, for my money, the best of their bunch.  Some would argue the previous game they made, Secret Files 2, was better.  Of the Secret Files games, I preferred Secret Files 1 for its mystery but even I have to admit it was hilariously unpolished.  So when they put out a sequel with a really interesting 'start of the cold war' setting I was super excited.  I thought, if 1 was a total knock off of Indiana Jones, then 2 might be a moment to shine by being a better post WW2 Indy adventure than crystal skull was.  Sadly I was wrong.  This game feels badly unfinished - the character models are all off, the writing (never the Studio's strong suit) is sloppier than usual, there are a number of display errors, and an odd mix of Cartoony and realisitc art - a problem in the equally weak Secret Files 3.  It is tragic because some of the settings are stunning and the characters all have major potential - we have glimpses of what an older Fenton could have been like if written better, and his daughter Gwen is everything you would expect when the game lets her be.  The story is pretty workaday too, and again, there is just more potential there.  There are some really kitchy make work puzzles with lots of back tracking, and none of the quirky and irreverant puzzles in the first game.   Some of the puzzles are also let down by awkward camera angles. And that is a shame too because right at the end they introduce a left of field puzzle and art style that really comes alive, is more interesting than the 'distant past' mechanic at the end of the first game and has a really nice connection to the opening.   Though, I hasten to add that the somewhat out of nowhere kung fu showdown at the end of the first game is an addition which I do miss.In short by god I want to like this game but feel like I am simply not allowed to.    Some spark has gone out of the team making these games.  And that is a real shame."

Puzzles are logical and good, sometimes are time based puzzles anoying, you must repeat whole scenario again and again. The lenght of the game is acceptable, about 10 hours. Story is great, you playing with 3 difrent players, sometimes you must switch between two players for finish some task, and this is great implemented into the story. You visit many diffrent locations and they are very colorful. The story is presented with many great animations. I played the first Lost Horizon game and I like it and  I must say that the second one is better."

With the combination of a sluggish cursor and my poor reflex time, I can't complete it and move on to the next part of the game. There seems to be no way to skip it,so my game ends here. I buy point and click games because I'm not particularly fast, so adding something like this without an opt out means I've wasted my money."

I don't understand why people don't like this game. It is very pleasant, the graphics are perfectly acceptable and the puzzles are fair and well integrated into the story. As a conventional point&click adventure game, it does not break any moulds, but I don't see why it has to either. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but why can't people just enjoy some good old fashioned adventure game like they used to."
,Not Recommended,395560,27951531,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Dwight Knight,"I wanted to like this game, I really did.After having played the first one, I was really excited when I saw that this game was releasing.  The story of the first one left me feeling somewhat nostalgic for the Indiana Jones series and I was excited at the thought of reliving that.I was wrong.My biggest complaint with this was just how incredibly shallow the plot was.  I played it a bit when it first released and felt a bit 'meh' about the plot then, but I decided to soldier on and see if the game got any better.  It did not.  Certain story plots seem like they're going somewhere and then they just drop off and others are very, very telegraphed to anybody with the slightest bit of genre savviness.For instance the story of the game just kinda.... ends.  Nothing really wraps it up.  You just solve the last puzzle and then..... short unexplained and unvoiced cutscene and credits.If you can get this on a *really* good sale (like.... 90% off), don't own any Indiana Jones films and are looking to fill a couple hours of your time then it might be worth a buy.TL;DR This is the PC gaming equivalent of a what you'd get if the baby of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was dropped on its head repeatedly by a negligent nanny."

Exactly one scene really requires a fast computer, a scene that could easily have been deleted without any loss.Officially, there is no auto-save and if the game crashes, all progress since the last save is lost. If you are lucky, you can recover from the auto-save file which is created but not available for loading (at least I didn't find a button ""resume game"").I had several crashes during my 5-hour long playthrough, but attributing this to the game is not quite fair since I played using Crossover (I thought Unity could do Cross-Platform), which (beside the occational crash) works quite well with the graphics quality set to minimum. That said, I still consider the graphics quite good.The puzzles are not too hard. I had to cheat once since I was obviously unable to read. Someone with more experience than me will probably go straight through this game. (It took me about 5 hours in total, but I think something below four is possible.)I kind of liked the story, which has an interesting, but not quite realistic plot twist with a clever conclusion.I got the game for a reasonable price (3,74€), but I would not have bought it for the full price."
