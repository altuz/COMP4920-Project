That is, if you can make any sense of the broken english. The game is littered with gems such as ""Darkness - A way of getting rid of perishable body to feel lightness and timelessness"" and a frankly appalling number of typos (and this applies to everything. Menus, tooltips, dialogue, codex entries... if it's written, it's written badly). You can wrangle meaning out of most of it, but it just takes you right out of the setting, especially when it's coupled with the absolutely atrocious voice acting. It feels like two of the devs decided they could record every character, so there's a nice layer of terrible accents over the broken grammar.Marring the presentation even further is a large number of visual and sound glitches (objects making no sounds, cutscenes cutting out too fast or too slow) and you end up with a game that is constantly pulling you out of the experience with its clumsiness.The gameplay is actually good when it's not being brought down by baffling design decisions and poorly communicated mechanics. The game is quite challenging, which is good, but a lot of the challenge also comes from fighting with the controls and interface (with abilities not triggering properly, doing unexpected stuff, cover not concealing correctly, etc...). You're expected to die a lot, rinse and repeat, but a lot of your deaths feel like the game mechanics are screwing you over instead of a challenge to overcome.Still, when everything is in full swing, there is definitely an enjoyable experience there, and when you get all the synergies going it's very satisfying. Sadly, a lot of the time you'll just be dying and going ""wtf."" I enjoy stealth games, and don't mind replaying the same level over and over until I get it perfect, and yet this game just ended up a mostly frustrating experience.It feels like a lot like Commandos back in the day, except with none of the polish those games developed over the years.Bit of a shame really."

Being it solo or in a full group, this game difficulty sits on a razor's edge and will punish you a lot. Forcing you to reload to the last checkpoint.Still, once you get past the frustation and you learn the best path to get through a level, it's like something clicks inside your brain and you know what to do and then you'll challenge your self by trying to find the best possibile approach in order to save armor.Your see, your job is not just to maul down the enemies, but to get past them in the most efficient way possible, the game rewards good strategists with its armor system. The less hits you take, the more armor you can save, and the more armor the less damage you take and the higher the chances for you to success. This idea is also part of its upgrade system, which often forces you to take the optional, hardest part to beat of a level, in order to gain one of those gem stones necessary to upgrade your dwarves.Giving them a better chance in the future.The enemies are hard to deal with not only because they hit like a truck, but because each type has a different kind of beheviour and each enemy has probably a sub grup among them as well, swords, rifleman and so on. Oh, and they communicate with each other as well, so one wrong pull and the whole room is after you.The enviroments and it's traps, bushes, ledges and checkpoints play a huge role in the fights as well.Yea, it's hard. Very hard. But once you figure out the best path to take, the best position to hold and the best abilities to fire at the right time, all the frustation you accumulated so far turns into joy as the enemies lie down before you, and you took the minimal amount of damage possible.Overall, it's an enjoyable yet challenging game, your best tactic is to learn the levels, the enemy beheviour, your character skills and use enviroment at your advantage. Then try and die as many times as it takes.It's difficult but rewarding, and I personaly recommand it."

I bought it 8 months after release, with no recent huge patches, so I figured it looked good and should be well debugged.  Unfortunately, the controls are still extremely clunky, the gameplay is rough, and as such the playthrough requires often reloads.  I love these sorts of games and can usually deal with a less than optimal control setup, but after several hours fighting with this, I'm bored, frustrated, and am moving on.  I would suggest finding a different game; as beautiful as this looks, it's sadly disappointing."

I am in no way good at the game, but it clearly explains that cover most likely won't work if they get close to you, and low cover does nothing in most situations. Also the swamp is the very first thing explained to you: you drown in deep swamp. If you are sinking past the waste, you are in danger of drowning, it is an insta death.Also all the complaints about the bad english??? You can tell just by the videos on here that it wasn't made by native speakers, and 99% of the errors are meaningless, no impact on the story whatsoever. You guys are just complaining because you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who can't accept that not everyone has perfect english. They can hardly afford to fix the actual bugs, so why spend money on a good editor?I have also seen a lot of complaints about the tutorial levels being the most difficult, but I find that very hard to believe, as they had the least enemies and were the easiest to manage.It just seems that everyone who leaves a bad review is just lazy and never liked the game from the start.Definitely a good game, though, especially if on sale. It has a really nice concept, great story. Ineresting environments, enemies, and characters. Each character has a variety of abilities that are a lot of fun to use in each situation. Even with the minor bugs, it is a fun game to play scenarios over and over to get the most optimal situation where you hardly took any damage. I'd reccommend it at 8/10"
,Recommended,395570,21478342,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,dlyrium,"(I have two or so additional hours gameplay on a friend's account in addition to that shown here)Positives:- Really fun and challenging core gameplay. This is a difficult game. You will die. A lot. But the game is designed around that. Rather than huge, expansive levels, they're split up into sections, and each section presents it's own challenge.- Fantastic setting and world, including very pretty and unique environments.- Death is potentially around every corner (even in the tutorial) and it's a lot more strategy based than your average tactical combat game. Think of it more like a real-time X-Com than a traditional action RPG.- I love the way the environment plays a part in the tactics of the game. Not only the traditional 'exploding barrels' and 'cover' mechanics (though obviously they exist), but also natural hazards and other effects which really add to the overall atmosphere and challenge of the gameplay.- Each dwarf's 'class' has a different mechanic, some of which lead to unique effects and playstyles. For example, several of the marksman's abilities cause recoil, which leads to him being pushed backwards when he takes a shot. You have to be careful near cliff edges, as it's perfectly possible to recoil off the edge and die.- I also love the 'senses' mechanic. Enemies don't only detect you by seeing you. Some can 'feel' vibrations in the earth, and some can hear you, or smell you. As you'd expect, each enemy has different sensitivites of each sense (some can't see you, for instance, but hear better). Moving in short bursts causes less noise and movement, and you can wait for their awareness to die down before moving again. Once an enemy senses you, it'll come and investigate the area it heard/felt/smelled you (unless it can clearly see you, in which case it'll run over and attack immediately). This plays into the environment features too, as some flora and fauna will react to your presence by making noise/emitting a smell, which in turn will attract enemies. It's a fantastic system.- Also has good music, and great ambient sounds for the flora/fauna which make for a great atmosphere.Negatives:-  Very badly localised. Many, many typos and spelling errors. To be expected, I guess, from a self-published first game from eastern european indy developers, but even so...- The UI in general seems unpolished and a bit rough around the edges. No worse than most games from, say, Focus Interactive... but it definitely could use some tidying up.- The voice acting, while it is refreshing to hear some different accents from the usual American, British or American-Trying-To-Be-Russian/German/Italian/Spanish, is a little dull in terms of performance (aside from the first character you meet, who is pretty good). This is not helped by the script, of course, which is very hammy and suffers from not being written in the writer's native language (or, if it was, badly translated). It's not a huge problem, but it's worth mentioning.- The collectible items in the game are all rather small and can be extremely hard to see at times, and this isn't helped by the fact that you have to click on them specifically in order to pick them up (as opposed to just being able to walk through them and collect them). This makes some of the 'collect X resources before continuing' sections very frustrating as I just could NOT find the last damn resource, and it turned out it was in a really obvious place I'd walked past about 5 times, just didn't see it.- No rebindable keys! Really?! Come onnnnnn. In fairness, the game uses a MOBA style QWERT system, with movement controlled by the mouse. So it could be argued that it's not really necessary. I just hate using Alt, as it's really awkward to press if your fingers are resting on QWERT.- Inability to zoom the camera, while possibly a specific design decision, is a little annoying.- The movement controls feel a bit clunky. Sometimes your dwarf doesn't end up moving anywhere, or moves to the wrong place, or takes an expected route through dangerous terrain. It's not horrible by any means, but it could be improved.Overall though, the actual gameplay is excellent, and if you're the type of person who doesn't care too much about the writing and voice acting, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the game to you. Especially as the typos and grammar are very easy to fix, and doubtless will be in due time."

I have died so many times and always in the same place but I'm so stubborn that I won't admit defeat so I've just tried again and again until I succeed, but I can see that if you don't like that kind of thing this game would be really boring. The recent update has addressed the problem of fixed controlls and the difficulty so some of the older reveiws may not be as useful any more. I really love this game and fully recomend it to any one who likes extremely hard games in whis you will really need to think through fights instead of just charging straight into a bunch of enemies and expecting to come out the other side alive.

It provides you with enough level of challenges and balance maintains perfect till the very end (which is not common nowadays). Visuals are awesome and authentic.I saw complaints about inconveniences with controls. Yes, there are some, but controls are much better then in Dragon Age Inquisition. During dwarves I struggled with contrls first 3 or 4 levels and then got accustomed, but with DAI I was frustrated with poor camera and controls during the whole game. So, I believe people just have steep demands to this nice small indie project.My conclusion is: If you like tactical games such as Blackguards, XCOM, Banner Saga etc. - you deffinitely want to experience ""We are Dwarves"". It will not become ""game of the year"" for you, it can't compete with AAA titles but it WILL leave something warm and smouldering in your heart longing for future adventures of Dwarves."

Says it right there on the sign. Who would have thought...But seriously forks, I put a lot of play int this game. There were problems, yes. But the developers were kind enough to help me through my issues. So, let's get started shall we.The visual presentation starting out is stunning. Very well done backgrounds, interesting enemies, and a well done take on Dwarves. I really enjoyed the story and really enjoyed romping around this world they created.The voice acting...I keep hearing people complain about how it sounds cheap or thrown in or what have you. Mmm, I don't know, I really did enjoy it, especially Forcer's voice. Did a couple of the Devs just come in and be like ""We'll just do the voices ourselves instead of paying a ridiculous price for voice acting""? Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. But I liked it either way.The game play focuses on stealth more so then combat and if you have the shotgunner dwarf, you're main thing is going to be knocking dudes off a cliff. I think we need more stealth games to be honest. To me, iit has a vibe along the lines of Commando: Behind Enemy Lines. The fact that you can pit enemies against other types of enemies is pretty bleeding cool in my opinion.That said, I do think the upgrade tree could use a little work. It's too hard to get items and too hard to upgrade your dwarves. Also, your armor gets knocked off too fast. Maybe it's because I suck at the game but still, it's a thing.Anyway, I enjoyed the tactics part of it. You can't run and gun in this or you'll get killed which makes the dwarf SmashFist a little out of place but this game really has been fun so far. Good job guys. Keep it up.Thanks,Ol' Stompy"

The voice-acting is terrible, but in a charmingly terrible way, so I still like it.There are several key problems with this game. The first is that the controls are just awkward. Click-to-move is tedious, activating abilities is clumsy, swapping between Dwarves causes massive camera movements that are disorienting- it's just really hard to control. Dwarf movement is slow, which is fine- until you missed a piece of dwarven metal on the level, and have to decide if you want to go re-search the whole map again to find it, or just leave the level and get on with it. It's never good in a game when you're saying to yourself, ""Let's just get this over with.""But the fatal flaw is the camera. It's locked down. Angle is fixed. Zoom is fixed. Tilt is fixed. Offset is fixed. Is there a rock outcropping between the camera and your dwarf? Well, now you can't see anything, and too goddamn bad for you. Because of the angle, enemies that are to your north are easy to see, but enemies to your south- despite being the same distance away- are off camera, and impossible to target.All in all, I'm glad I have it a shot, but the controls and cameras make an otherwise promising game nearly unplayable."

Your intrepid band fights to survive after crash landing on a hostile alien world.  Initially separated as a result of the crash, each dwarf is played individually while you learn their abilities.  Ultimately, the group is reunited to face the local fauna as a team.The game ran smoothly.  I liked the graphics and some of the game's concepts, but I didn't enjoy playing this game.  The problem with We Are The Dwarves is it's not fun.  The controls are clunky and the dwarves are weak, both defensively and offensively - they can't dish it out, and they can't take it.  Effective use of the dwarves in combat requires a lot of pausing and micro-management of attacks, which is the antithesis of a ""real time strategy"" game.  Even with careful planning, the dwarves tend to lose battles easily.  Level completion brings temporary relief, but not satisfaction (""Ugh, I'm glad that level is finished.  What's next?

To clarify, the game does have some agency over characters but it is limited. The player chooses the path characters will follow and faces obstacles which they must overcome using triggered abilities which are specific to characters. This is how the game attempts to immerse the player. It also employs visuals to immerse the player in its world. Music is spartan, preferring sound effects and characterization instead. The characterization is not the typical Scottish dwarves, and can seem off at first 6.5/15DIFFICULTY: There are options for difficulty, and there is a rough description of what the difference is. The game tutorialises the interface and that doesn't add to the difficulty. When characters are restricted from doing an action they will say they can't. The interface is less intuitive about it's sneaking and explaining the feedback enemies provide. So there is something of a learning curve. 6.5/15LASTING APPEAL: Short. The game is decent for one or two levels here and there. Over extended playtime it may be difficult to retain interest. 5/15CONCLUSION: (SUBJECTIVE) We are the dwarves has potential, but it might have been better on iOS or another platform.

The voice acting is... recorded, at least.I appreciate its difficulty. It's certainly a tough game. Meant to be puzzle solved through, not brute forced.I freely admit I don't really know what to think about this game. For how much they want you to stealth, there sure aren't many indicators as to how you're supposed to. Enemy sight lines are long and not visit to the player. Enemies also detent by sound, but you don't really seem to have a sneak mode. Your ranged character might as well be melee, his firing range is so short."

It's hard to tell.4. It's very very hard.  I can't tell you how many times I died in the starting area.  Again, the game doesn't tell you how to be successful, so there's a lot of trial and error.  That wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for...5. The load times.  Don't get me wrong, they're not very very long.  Like, it's not NBA2k15, but considering how often you'll be dying, looking at the loading screens gets pretty infuriating.6. It's satisfying.  When you complete your goal you feel like a tactical badass, and that's because the game stacks its deck against you.7. The atmosphere of the game is really cool.  It makes you take an interest in the world, but not so much in the characters (probably because of the VA work.)I'm gonna keep playing, and I'll probably update this review as I get more time under my belt, but right I'd say go for it.  It isn't an expensive game, and it looks like some fun can be had here."

,Recommended,395570,21536868,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,8-Bit Zombie,"When WatD first released I offered up a fairly scathing review; two patches and a half dozen game hours later I am returning to offer my second opinion.First off I would like to say that I don't enjoy WatD whatsoever... Mind you this is not due to a fault of the game, though it does have it's share of faults which I will cover below, but rather due to my misconception of what I imagined the game to be based on early trailers. It is easy to look at the isometric view in combination with it's seamingly fast paced combat and character classes shown in the the trailer and immediately think of something along the lines of a Diablo-like with a pause feature that allows you to que up attacks and strategize; the truth is that WatD couldn't be further from a rogue-like dungeon crawler despite it's appearance and is actually an RTT (Real-Time-Tactics) with an active pause system that strongly resembles Dragon Age Inquisition's tactical view. This has lead me to greatly dislike WatD; not because I think the game is bad, but because I do not enjoy the genre.With that said, there is a lot of positive aspects to the game; it's lore, concept, and visual representations are all worthy of praise. The inverted universe that Whale Rock has created is truly an amazing concept, and how it links sci-fi and fantasy to offer an all new and unique setting/concept is really WatD's strong suit; this setting is complimented quite well by the stylistic, colorful, and beautifully rendered environments and some truly impressive lighting that brings it all to life.Where WatD loses me though is it's gameplay... Part of this is due to not liking the genre, but part of it is also due to frustrating difficulty spikes, issues with control resposiveness, player movement pathing, somewhat unblanced enemy AI and mechanics, and lackluster classes each on of which I would like to talk about in a little detail since I feel most of the reviews on here haven't actually talked about the game and resort to ""It's brutally hard, which makes it great!""First I want to talk about difficulty. Now, normally I like difficult games, in fact I am a glutton for punishment, but I am not fond of games that have inconsistent difficulty spikes; for example one part of a stage will seem like a reasonable challenge, while another part will immediately seem to be almost impossible; for example one room in a stage might be relatively simple and only require 1-3 retries while the next will have you reloading your save 20-30 times just to find a strategy that doesn't get you outright killed instantly. Moments like this feel like pulling teeth as you try and rack your mind for a solution that should work only to realize it will fail because you wrongly predicted how an enemy would react or a mechanic failed to work the way you expected and the margin for error is so low that the simplest of mistakes can mean death. These are the moments that have made me consider outright quitting on several occassions.Secondly there is the camera control, or lack of control since there is only an option to rotate around a fixed angle. I can't count how many times I wished I could freely pan the camera to get a better look at the mape and see where enemies/items are or tilt the camera down a bit to see what's directly in front of me. Beyond the lack of camera control it is also worth noting that there is no foreground transparency for environmental objects, this often means that you will find yourself with objects blocking your view from multiple angles and in some cases making it almost impossible to see what is around you at any time. Personally I would really like to see the camera moved away from RMB to rotate to something closer to XCOM's WASD to pan with Q/E to rotate, this would make controlling the camera and navigating the world outside of the active pause significantlty easier.As a sidenote to controls player movement pathing also needs some work, one of the things that is quickly apparent in WatD is that your movement is incredibly important; staying in cover, avoiding enemy paths, sneaking past environemtal traps, etc... all of these things are necessary for your survival which is what makes the clunky click to move system a little bit frustating. I've found many occasions where I will click a location and watch my Dwarf take the worst possible path to it, or worse instances where I am controlling multiple Dwarves and one takes the safe route while the other runs straight through a camp of enemies and into a trap (or two) before reaching their destination. It's annoying and often makes me wish I had a much more accurate control of my movements.Then there are the enemies, which often feel way too fast or at times down right omnicient... One of the first things you will notice when you start playing is that your dwarves are significantly slower than most of the game's enemies, so much so that some enemies are actually impossible to target with specific dwarves, and there is nothing more frustrating than lining up and planning an attack only to realize that when it occurs the enemy you targeted is now 5-10 feet away from where they were when you started the attack. The absolute worst part of WatD's enemies is how the AI is encoded to immediately know exactly where to search for the player once they have been alerted though, even if circumstances should have made the player impossible to track. You were in cover, on the other side of the map, using an ability that mutes your actions when you fired an arrow? Guess what, as soon as enemies find the body they will know exactly where you were, and if you've moved they will be able to immediately track you to your new location. What makes this worse is that you can't do anything at all while enemies are searching for you, including saving or upgrading your character at save points or leaving the level through it's exit, and enemy AI will aggressively track you until it finds you once you've alerted them; this is by far the one aspect of the game that feels brutally unfair.Mind you, dealing with difficult enemies in droves probably wouldn't be too hard if the dwarves themselves didn't appear to be the worst possible versions of fantasy video game tropes, you have: Forcer the ranger who's shotgun has a range roughly half that of all the games ranged enmies, Smashfist the tank/berserker who needs to be nearly dead to use his tank ability and pushes enemies away just as much as he draws them in, and Shadow the stealthy rogue who alerts just about every enemy on the map with each of his actions. Half of the abilites are either incredibly situational or require several upgrades to function with any efficiency while other abilities are pretty much useless, like Forcer's decoy which enemies seem to largely ignore or Smashfist's stone skin which is hardly ever available for activation since his ""fury"" meter rapidly drains all the time even when in battle. The result is that your dwarves often feel ill equipt for the situation they are in, and frankly pretty bad at each of their roles which can be a bit annoying...With everything said I will say that We are the Dwarves is not a bad game, in fact it is far from it, but at the same time it is not the game I wanted or expected it to be which frankly is my problem not the game's. If you are a fan of RTT games and are looking for one that will challenge you then chances are you will be quite happy with WatD, but if you were looking for anything other than that chances are it is not for you..."

It was new back then and I was very frusterated with the bugs in the game so I could not recomend it. It went through many changes and mechanic overhauls and for the better. I now recommend the game because most (not all) of the problems have been fixed. It is now stable and playable.I think the smartest thing they did was add a difficulty setting. Play it on easy to learn the controls and mechanics, play it on normal to play it through, play it on hard if your a masochistic nut case. This game has a very long learning curve and it takes a good chunk of time to get used to. I still find the controls themselves to be clunky and a bit unresponsive but it is a lot better than what it was in the early months. It feels like your dwarves are sometimes mired in mud (not in swamp) and it collides with the mechanics if you dont know what you are doing. This game is not for dumb people, this game is not for impatient people. This game requires thought, careful planning, adaptation, and a little luck. And that is why it's very fun. It stimulates your cerebrum when you complete a task or conquer a goal. The mechanic rehaul makes things a little more fair.There is an element of RPG in character building. The upgrades may not seem useful in the descriptions but they definatly are some time down the line. You should mostly choose your upgrades based on what mechanic you have the most trouble with. Tired of friendly fire? Upgrade Forcers friendly fire percent decresion. Want Smashfist to be harder to kill? Upgrade his stone form. It's a very enjoyable and clever way of designing.This game is worth the price especially on sale. If you want a good, time consuming challange and are a huge mark for dwarves like me then I recomend it. Be warned though; it is brutal and be prepared to save often and reload a lot."
