I don't regret my purchase, but I will generally support any rts game, that I think has potential, and this game does have that.Pros:1) A little bit of base building.2) A decent variety of units.3) Experienced based global abilities per game.4) Can pick your loadout( or what your able to build in game) out of/before game and save 3 different loadouts.5) Suprisingly for once, good scale.What it needs:1) Better environmental system of advantages and disadvantages. Height, cover, obstacles( firing lanes), and concealment.2) Repair system.3) Unit Vetrancy.4) More variety of same type of units. Both in the armory and what your able to build. You should be able to build a couple different kind tanks, with differnt versions of each kind.5) The armory needs at least 10x the selection for each unit. And it may need a point system in in of itself, to minimize exploitation, the cost of the unit in game might be enough to offset this, but I am not so sure.6) More structures and implacements.7) Bigger maps.8) A little bit more zoom out.Cons:1) No campaign. For this type of game, its not really a con for me, but I know for a lot of people it is a deal breaker.2) A lack of everything I stated it needs. :)Overall its playable in its current state, and while I recomend the game, I do so only to those that understand what an early access/alpha/beta means and the kind of support and patience that indie/one person developers need. I will edit later accordingly."

This game is in very early beta. It's potential is off the charts. It has many features that lend themselves to game changing strategy and tactics. For example if you take a neutral army controled area you might get a free tank that can change the momentum and initiative of the whole area.The developer Windforce is also very active in the games forums and is very willing to work with the community to make Armor Clash the perfect blend of the developer's and player's vision of an adictive and fun RTS. I know this to be true because I bought the game played once, lost. I went to look for a game guide or manual and could not find one. I posted my desire for a guide/manual in the forums and within 1 hour Windforce got back to me and said yes he would write one that night!I was, as you can imagine, stunned. And Windforce delivered. Ever since that the game has become one of my favorites. I do not have a lot of time to play games because I have a large family to take care of but when I do Armor Clash is always on the ""To Do"" list ;)"

So yes, there are many things to work on but overall this is an excellent game. It's a throwback to the Command and Conquer series, especially Red Alert and Generals. At the same time the impressive details and accuracy makes fans of military realism squeal.Armor Clash is a nice time killer that you may find yourself going back to from time to time. It's simplistic controls and dynamic combat make for some interesting times to be had."

You might want to think about getting this tittle, though.ProsReal life units, nicely done models.Old school RTS gameplay.Units gain veterancy.Neat animations. You can see your vehicles being built.""Neutral"" units, that you can attack for resources or let be.Infantry, that usaly becomes useless in tank based RTS, can be upgraded to call airstrikes.Day-night cycle.CONSNo online multiplayer. You have Local Network multiplayer, which means that both players need to have a copy of the game and be connected at the same network. (Or use hamachi or some cr4p like that).You noticed I said ""both players""? That's right,you can only play 1vs1.So, multiplayer doesn't sound too good, right?Well, there's no campaing.Singleplayer is just skirmish, in 10 maps.No factions, you make a ""deck"" with the units you want to use. So, even if all the vehicles are based on real life modern military, you can make ""decks"" mixing USA, GB, German, Russian or Chinese units. Which breaks realism imo.Same voices for all vehicles of a kind. An american tank will ""speak"" with the same accent and dialogs than a russian one. Voice acting is not terribly good but it works.Buildings are allways the same, since there are no factions.Infantry is allways the same, since there are no factions. Riflemans are equiped with M-16,  AT troops use something that looks like a Javeline.Lame UI.Not much info on the vehicles, other than names (could use some neat descriptiosn, like country of procedence, conflicts the unit have been used, and so on).No music.No Achivements or card drops. (No that I care too much about it).Why do I still recomend this title?Well, first, because I'm having fun playing it. It's a straight forward RTS, and it does play ""oldschool"".Secondly, the dev (one man team) has been updating the game, and adding content. So the game is getting improved. The dev already announced a sequel, so I wouldn't count on him upgrading this game much once he starts developing it.However,there are many RTS games in Steam that you can get for more or less the same price (or less in sales) that offer more content.I appreciate the support for Linux, my OS of choice."

This game is starting to gain ground and for me its already one of my favorites, the fact that it combines the most common and well known vehicles, and you may costumize your armory (the units you can use) its a great advantage. Really recommend this game and hope many people will support its got great potential."

Now, if you have an average pc like me, then think before you buy it. Thats not saying dont buy it but you have to be a hardcore RTS fan to buy it especially since this game screams optimization (Yes i know this is early access). But as soon as more than 20 units get on the map, my pc goes down to around 15 frames where near the start it was running much better.The AI. For the most part, its good, but the infantry AI sorely needs some retouches, as sometimes I'd find them running off in the distance or not attacking the target I pointed them towards.Combat looks great in the game, and it would be cool to see in the future how the customization thing turns out. Mixing and matching the different parts of vehicles would be amazing. Bigger maps would be appreciated as well as more zooming out. Great start, the potential for this game is OFF THE ♥♥♥♥ING CHARTS!"

The way in which you can customize your army is something I have not seen in an RTS. There are only two modes on this game: skirmish and LAN. I hope the devs add a online multiplayer mode.

You have a army builder with a ok amount of units that have diffrent traits. You have a level up ablty that gives you 1 of 3 choices. Base building is fairly simple and straight foward with resources gained from you supply building and capturing of points. Units gain veterancy that give them new items. Airstrikes seem to be called via infantry, with ablities (General Powers if you will) calling in more such as Su25s or B2s. Overall its rts at its simplest, yet fun.Only issue i saw was unit path finding, as they seem to get stuck, and could not get them out, though rare.Still, as a one man game, the developer has done very well. I expect to see more added to the game over time (This is my opnion, not a fact as far as im aware)"

Next to no options/orders for your troops is just one thing (option to fire a barrage fire is present in almost all games  since the dinosaurs). No option to turn your unit to face the enemy (not sure if it matters at all btw). Hardly any options to build your base. Framerate (despite the fact that graphics is far from beautiful) is low. No campaign, just sort fo instant battle with a few basic options. On my HDD it lasted for less than half an hour. Thanks to the steam god for refund :P"

I would need to be critical and fair on my accessment on this game. So here goes:It goes without saying that this is one of my few favorite Indie RTS game that featured modern units that do not have fancy gizmo or sci-fi nonsense. I also like how I can customized the units that i needed for combat. I can sent hordes of T-72s to overwhelem my opponent only to get Scud and get a brutal revenge by the oppoenent.=================================================================Graphics:While it is an Indie game, I generally find the graphic is lackluster. The game is graphically very poorly optimized, if you have more than 20 units in one combat, the GT 540M Nvdia graphics card would suffer severe lag and frame rate spike, while the GT 850 Nvida Graphic cards suffer minor frame rate drop and frame jump. I know that many company has seriously optimized their RTS engine to allow 100s of units in one scene with less frame rate issue. Thus this is defenitely something that the DEV need to look out for.The graphic option is really really sparse, you can only choose: (Low, Normal, High, Ultra) and screen resolution. i do hope the Dev can add more option if possible.=================================================================Sound:I have to be brutally honest, this is probably the worst part of this game. No music, no ambient sound and the voice of each units are generic. Yet it is probably the one thing I can fully understand from a ONE INDIE DEV! So yes this is something that I find it OK!=================================================================Gameplay:While the design is classic RTS style, Unity Engine is not the best engine for RTS. The unit pathfinding can sometimes fustrating, Unit spacing is kinda messy, also in combat, due to pathfinding or AI, unless I micromanage the units, they will go back and forth while not firing weapons. The AI opponent also got this problem as well.The UI is basic, you know what should be build and it display cleanly. It do not have aesthetic of many RTS, but it gets the job done.I like the Armory, as it showcase what sort of unit you can pick for your class. I suggest the Dev to provide the description for each individual units, such as history/description of the units to spice it up.=================================================================Overall: I do not recommanded if you want full-blown completed RTS, Recommanded if you are into indie RTSI know I being harsh in my words, but I gladly support your effort and playing for a while I do enjoy the game, it do not play nonsense and gets into combat action quicly. I hope the best of luck and hopefully optimized the game even further. AND I LOVE ARMORY, IT IS THE THING ALL RTS SHOULD HAVE! Hope to see more experience soon!"

The AI is good. The overall still good. I meant like the game dont push you further to play it, but that's something I like on it, because of the nostalgic feeling of playing an oldstyle RTS that really sells what it is. Its an old fashion RTS for enthusiasts. Not to the new public. Definitely not! Like, the game screams the ""I AM WHAT COMMAND AND CONQUER NEEDED TO BE!"" but meeeh.... not much, Its just an RTS, with the old (But good) basebuilding fashion.Now the technical blablabla:- The textures (I know that will sounds a bit rude, but no! Dont take me bad on it) Are kinda potato. Because I know, maybe the team is small, and its noticeable that the models arent clicking. They seems to be from different sources. (that isnt a problem, since the game is good) And you just thrown some kind of default texture material on it. It could be better.- Some sounds got missing during an ""cluster♥♥♥♥"" battle. And I know that is UNITY problem, that lacks sound management on free versions.- Lacks of online multiplayer. This game would be awesome in multiplayer.Well, as a final consideration, I'd recomment that game to guys like me, those who misses that hole the game industry didnt want to fill nowdays. The old fashion basebulding and complete management RTS. The core of the RTS from the 90's and 00's ."
