I belive that too many people come into this game expecting it to have the same off-the-walls wacky gameplay that Goat Simulator brought to the table and find themselves disapointed when the find out that there aren't any people to bowl over or explosions to create. Bear Simulator instead focuses on is creating a setting where there is a story to be told that the player has to discover by exploring as much as they can and finding food and clues as to what's going on. Everything is not as ordinary as it seems as the player progresses, and the fun is in slowly discovering new things, which admittedly is not for everyone.A notable discovery early on is the fact thatyou are not a full grown bear, but rather a cub.In one of the very first areas that you will explore there will be a sign stating that acuband notany full grown bearsreside in the area. If you stop to think about it some more you'll realize that all the other animals you encounter are rather large comparative to you. And this brings me to anoter common misconception about the game. Many people who have played this game find it unfathomable that you, as a bear, are not smart enough to eat certain foods or are getting killed by a fox. While a normal adult bear would have no trouble with these things, you are just a stupid and frail cub and will need to eat everything in sight to grown stronger and smarter.To end this I would just like to give a simple message to the developer of this game. Don't give up, man. A lot have people have found the actual method to enjoying your game. It's completely normal to make mistakes at the beginning which will net a lot of criticism on you. If you feel you need to take a break then go ahead, but please don't say you'll shelve your talent away forever. You've managed to achieve something here that plenty of other people can only dream about being able to do by getting your own game published and put up for sale on steam. I am one of those people. I don't know if you'll even get this message, but if you do, then whatever you decide to do in the end, then just make sure you're happy with your decision."

The charm wears off extremely fast due to poor gameplay mechanics that feel like they should be included. Basic things that feel like they should be included: A map, and some form of skill/stat chart. When certain things require for me to have X stat, it's frustrating having to look around to find things that make me smarter or stronger, uncertain of how many I need to eat.As for the map, this game feels so directionless, and I easily lose track of where I've been, because the general blandness of the map. I feel constantly lost, and end up going in circles, to occasionally rediscover a landmark or two. Maybe something of a radar, a bear-dar if you will, would help greatly. Just something that says ""Food is nearby"" or ""An item is nearby"".Two other gripes I have are the hitboxes, which feel nonexistant, especially when every creature is fast moving, except frogs. Having a massive bear claw swing, it feels like I should be doing something when I hit a location that isn't the center of being.My last major complaint is that I'm not sure what is poor level design, and what is 'secrets off the beating path'. I'll often be reminded of Skyrim and Fallout, jumping and holding W as I traverse a mountain, only to find a flat surface, with nothing on it. Yet, I still feel obligated to climb up these mountains, in the event there is something hidden, since there is no real other way to know otherwise. Also, on at least two occasions, I felt like I skipped part of the map, just by climbing on things until I was able to jump over whatever barrier was preventing me. Again, not sure if I was supposed to or not, becuase there is practically no explaniation of this is game design of exploiting Dev's errors.I want to end on a positive note, though. This game is still salvagable. A few features and fixes could make this game fun.  I think that part of what makes this fun is the Steam's stream ability, which allows me to privately have a group of friends watch, and experience the jokes and laugh along with the jokes that are scattered through the game. Honestly, its' the only way I can continue through it at it's current state.4/10, I am honestly sad that this game turned out the way it did."

And the ""story"" of the game is locked away in hidden temples that you have to find throughout some of the areas,  one of which you have to get passed an annoying mountain platforming section where if you make one mistake and fall you die and have to start from the cave every single time. Then there's the secret ""fun"" place where you have to go through an obstacle course that looks like it belongs in Roblox and is hard to do considering the fact that you can literally fall through the floor at any time. Hitboxes are terrible, you have to be inside the thing you want to kill and aim at a weird angle. The birds just fly straight up before you can even get next to them so your best bet is to just sprint up to them and aim up immediately. Chasing the bunnies around is annoying unless you can get them stuck on a piece of terrain where their AI can't tell that it is stuck and needs to turn around (thank god for this though, cause otherwise killing them would be even more of a ♥♥♥♥♥).

,Recommended,395850,33495822,Posted: 12 July,all,Tak Blue,"I'd like to start off with a simple statment of profound meaning for anyone who is curious why this game bombshelled: F*ck PewDiePie in his pretentious judgemental and cruel little nordic butt.That aside. Bear Sim is a wonderful game. The elements of exploration and the way the game is designed to keep you drawn in is fantastic. Very few games have ever capitivated me in the way that this game did. It has humor in place of horror or cheap jump scares. It gives a sense of purpose which is quickly and easily adopted without the need of an explanatory narrative. It is build to be friendly and still challenging. An absolute marvel of ingenuity on the dehalf of the developers.I played this game for a bit longer than I am proud to admit, but the thrill of it reminded me very much of playing ""Valley."" Where your experiences are rewarded with greater and greater game function. The game itself becomes the reward as you are able to move more fluidly, more quickly, and with a sense of purpose. The more you achieve small goals which surmount into the experience of, being beyond argument, the best d*amned bear that has ever been been. Yogi ain't got nothin' on you!My only complaint to this game is actually very ironic: The humans that made it, got stressed out and left a 95% complete game. They lost their inner-bear and gave up due to critisism and funding constraints.Honorable mention: This game provides a very clear and honest insight into the fact that humans are still hunting bears to extinction. Its not in-your-face with that fact, but does present it in such a subtle manner that it stays with you.My personal experience: I am an Iraq and Afghanistan combat veteran. I have severe PTSD and anxiety. I'm also a father of 2 cubs, and a mama bear who is not at all a gamer. I found this game to be extremely soothing. I would often return to it when feeling anxious or worried. It gave me a simple function to complete in a big world; which was calming. I also let my oldest child play under my supervision. It was a learning experience for her; She didn't want to hurt any other animals. I told her she didn't have to. After awhile she came to terms with her sense of pacifism and said ""Dad, I can't get any stronger just eating plants!"" This lead to her understanding the predator/prey notion of life. Subsecuently, she learned resilience. She learned that she had to keep trying to look for indications or options more than just looking for things in the wide open. The first time she found a hidden way into a new area she shouted ""Dad, I found it!""My spouse and second child however crushed every single objective together in the game in about 18 hours. Proving once and for all why my Wife hates gaming... its just too easy for her. My second child was equally as blunt and condescending about it.But I did not care, nor did my first child. Because we are bears and we have no time for such stupid things."

My partner Steve was sick with typhoid fever, and I was serving my shifts alone. I got a call in the morning that some campers (who were camping ILLEGALLY) had spotted a grizzly bear within 100 feet of their campground. As a devoted ranger, it was my RESPONSIBILITY to protect these people. When I responded to the call, I came upon a campground painted with the blood and guts of these park visitors. I almost VOMITED in pure disgust. Little did I know, the grizzly bear that had committed this atrocious act of violence was still lurking amidst the trees only meters away from where I stood. He must have smelled the peanut butter sandwich I held in my pants pocket. He charged at me, tackling me to the ground with a level of force unrivaled by any earthly creature. Luckily, I had a .44 in my ankle holster, which I used to shoot the bear in the neck, as he snacked on my delicious sandwich (later I learned this bear was allergic to peanut butter anyway). Did I flinch or hesitate to destroy this animal? No, because I had to do it to save my own skin. If I had a scud missile I would've used it. Maybe it was perverse of me to open this game, expecting to play this kind-of encounter out from the other side, but regardless, I didn't get to experience any scenario close to the TERROR of my own. Although later I learned that bear was a golden retriever. I lost my job that day, but I could've lost my life. Instead, all I got were childish memes, clearly picked from the mind of a CHILD, not seasoned by the horrors and sights of what MEN like myself have seen within national parks. You grass men seem to think creatures like these are JOKES. They aren't. A bear killed my brother in '92.The American Grizzly Bear is one of the most formidable animals in any given forest. Its power is unmatched. One strike from its muscular limbs could leave a man dead.If you're giving a game in which I step into the body of a BEAR, THEN I'D EXPECT TO FEEL STRONG. I'd EXPECT to overpower any fellow animal, much like that giant golden retriever overpowered me. Nature is NOT a joke. People lose their lives. It's not a little virtual playground for grassmen to make jokes about frogs. Liliputian homunculi.So next time you think about make a game with bears, please depict them with some goddamn accuracy. LIfe isn't a meme. Men lose their lives. Golden retrievers (unfortunately) get shot in the throat.I give this game a 7/10 (I have to admit the frogs were quite humorous).- Ranger Charles"

While there are a few bugs (mostly getting stuck in rocks and surroundings) and some features, such as fast-travel to get to the further areas would be nice, overall I have no problems with this game.I think if the Lets Players explored a bit more rather than just yelling all the time, they'd find it more fun.

Of course, it took its fair amount of patience, but I rarely lack in that field. That, AND, I'm a huge fan of exploration games, and that's mainly what this game is+adventure+some platforming, rather than a simulator.You explore to find out what the goal of the game is and its story. To find out why you're playing as a bear. To find out the indications of what you need to do. To find out why you lack stats to eat certain foods or do certain things, even if it doesn't really make sense. And, if you give the game the chance to, it's really made well enough that you get your answers if you bother going beyond what you're maybe usually use to go in video games. Bear Simulator DARES not take you by the hand and show you the way, and instead, pushes you to get out of your comfort zone.You're not given a map. So what? The game's environnement is designed well enough that you can make your own map in your head without getting confused. There's a whole bunch of beacons and landmarks everywhere, and nothing looks exactly the same. After playing about 10 hours, I knew my way around the entire game world pretty darn easily and if you can run it on high graphics, some of the environnements are pretty darn neat-looking, especially one region of the game, even WITH some low-res and stretched textures.The game has also a good share of surprises and things that are, depending on how easily you can be amused, pretty worth working hard to unlock, especially after grinding your stats and unlocking new abilities.Now, for the less positive. Yes, indeed, the game has its BIG share of bugs. Like, I got stuck in some parts of the environnement many MANY times and had to go back to the main menu to reload AND the hit detection is sometimes very ackward, even if you can get it working right after a while.Yes, the game is rather unfinished, but if you can get pass those two aspects, which I think are the two major ones, to me, really, this was pretty darn worth the money I spent on it, and I would love to see it get properly finished with ALL the other remaining mysteries still left unanswered after completing the last possible objective.So, overall. Yeah. It ain't a game for everybody to enjoy and you gotta like the gendra and be able to forgive silly things and some bugs here and there to be able to fully have fun playing it. And this, I got all that was needed to achieve."

I would like those of you who read this to keep that in mind. This is the only game that I have ever purchased where I have liked it at first, but then realized that it is a complete waste of time, energy, and my money. There is no direct goal to be heard of, no way of guiding the player on what the hell they're supposed to do besides gaining 20 intelligence to eat a ♥♥♥♥ing mushroom, which in order to do that you have to comb the area before for things to eat (which don't re-spawn so it makes it even more time consuming). This game had a lot of potential, but didn't execute it correctly. The color scheme and concept are amazing but everything else doesn't meet that and it's charm of exploring and eating things is removed when you have to scrutinize every detail from the area just so you can make any semblance of progress. I only have 4 hours because I thought it was going to go somewhere at a decent pace. The reason this game is bad isn't because it's inherently a bad game, It had a lot of good things going for it, but the poor execution completely killed this game that, otherwise, would have been very delightful and charming to play."

I personally enjoy them, and I think this game is one of a kind.I really like PewDiePie, but I think there was some kind of a misunderstanding. I don't think he managed to explore the whole map of this game. At first, exploring the forest might be troubling or considered somewhat boring because almost everything is hidden including other regions, but this game is deep. I could definately tell that they put a lot of effort to this game.I do have to say the bear's story advances slowly. So..At first, it might be hard to get this game, I guess. It has hidden messages if you play it through and explore different areas. Everything is meticulously planned and designed, even the right timing(or bear level) of when to find an area or a special souvenir, etc.It might be challenging to control your bear or survive or eat something or find something at first, but it's really fun to make the bear eat a lot of different things and discover new areas and make the bear super strong/intelligent. I really like how they made these different areas. If you explore around enough, you'll find a radioactive zone, beautiful beach and even a spooky area. You can also give your bear a fun makeover, which is enjoyable as well. They have a rastafarian hat, a nice cap, glasses, a moustache, and fun bear furs. I also like the casual humour they put in to this game, because fun remarks would pop up if your bear does something that a human wouldn't normally do. It made me laugh while I played. I think this game is appropriate for all age and gender. Everyone can enjoy this.But I do hope that the bear control would be easier and maybe have more options for choosing my own key for bear movements? cuz I prefer different keys for jumping or running.If you start upgrading your bear enough, I think you'd definitely find the true essence of this game and what the developer is trying to say. I mean, it even raises awareness on environmental issues! Like I said, this game is deep. It's definitely worth $15. Love this! Keep up the great work, and hope to see this game expand inside and outside."

I thought that I had found a game that would be a giant hit like Goat Simulator was when it came out. You know, something that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is mostly there for you to laugh at its absurdity. By looking at the website before this game came out, it seemed like this game was heading in a good direction. There were jokes everywhere; and they were actually pretty funny.So naturally, when the game came out, I bought it. I was ready to be a bear.....I quit after 1 hour.Why? Because there's nothing to do. In that one hour, I walked around a world that was more barren than anything I'd ever encountered in games like Fallout, which are SUPPOSED to be barren and devoid of life. I killed two rabbits, which I was only able to do because they got stuck on terrain, one duck, and then died to a fox. A fox....the natural enemy of the bear, obviously.The game mostly consists of this: Walk around and try to find something to eat. Oh, is that an apple on the ground? Eat it. Yay, some stats went up. Is that another apple? Eat it too. Yay, some stats went up. Is that a plant of some sort? Eat it too.You cannot eat this plant. You are too stupid.Yes, you can apparently be too dumb to eat things. Things that you REALLY NEED TO EAT so that a fox doesn't kick your♥♥♥♥♥in a fight.Now, you may be reading this and think ""Well gee, I dunno, thatsoundslike it might be kinda funny.Trust me, it's not. It's extremely tedious. You can walk around forever and not find anything to interact with. The highlight of my gameplay was finding a hat.PROS:You are a bear.You are smart enough to eat an apple without killing yourself.There is the occasional funny sign to find.I found a hat.CONS:World is so barren that it looks like the apocalypse just happened and they didn't take the bears with them.Graphics look like something I'd find on a PS2 game in the year 2004. A lot of things, such as hills, just look like extremely stretched textures.Hit registration is off. In combat, I died to a fox because my right paw REFUSED TO HIT ANYTHING, EVER!THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. - This is the biggest drawback to the game. There is literally nothing to do. If there were more animals to kill, more places and secrets to find, more funny things in the world itself, and you weren't so stupid that you risk killing yourself if you eat a mushroom, then the game has the POTENTIAL to be fun. As of right now, the game is a chore to play. I bought this with the intention to start make a YouTube series out of it, but there was so little actual content in the game, that it was just incredibly boring.Overall score: 2/10 - Would not bear again."

The only problem is it is basicly impossible to kill a Tan Rabbit. I hope the game developers fix that because if it runs by you you cant kill it. The only time I killed one was when it glitched into a corner.
,Recommended,395850,29383735,Posted: 20 January,all,King Gigabyte,I honestly like the game regardless of what some loser youtuber letsplayer said. I played through most of it and I thouroughly enjoy it. The humor is quite amusing to. I really wish it would have future updates though like promised on the kickstarter.I don't know if any are even planned any more but if so then that's awesome. If not then that's pretty lame but I'll get to the gist of the review.You're a bear obviously.The graphics are pretty decent. I'm able to run the graphics on high and they're very pretty. The bear fur is a little odd looking but not much of an issue. I love the soft ambience as well. The water looks pretty nice to and so does the animals and the wildlife. Those ducks tho...  I'd give the graphics an 8 out of 10The sound is decent. You have soft ambience for each area. Nothing annoying or any thing. The sound gets a 9 out of 10The story there isn't really much of a story going on. If there is i'm not really sure what it is but you get bits and pieces of it. I feel like it could be developed a lot further. Though hearing the story via documents and the scent system is rather fresh and unique. For that i'd give the story/plot a 7 out of 10.Overall I give the game a 7.5. It has room for improvement but overall I do enjoy this game quite a lot. Would I reccomend it ? Yeah I would.
,Recommended,395850,31512537,Posted: 2 May,all,GodOfBears,"This is the best game that I have ever laid my eyes on. I felt like I was looking through the eyes of an actual bear... to be honest when I first played this game I thought that I WAS the bear, it took me 6 months to finally snap back to reality because i started to notice things about me that were different for example i started making bear noises when interacting with my peers, started to have a addiction to honey and I would even sometimes occsasionally sleep in a cave.10/10Kojima 'Very good game'"

Sure it may have some flaws but honestly its really fun and really cute. I love the prospect of being able to play as a ♥♥♥♥ing bear. Keep making games man you have the potential to do really well. I know I don't have a whole lot of time on the game yet, but from what I've played, I honestly don't get the negativity. It's a really awesome game that I suggest to anyone who wants a fun little exploring game with a bunch of cute little niches such as catching/eating wildlife and evolving your bear skills haha!TL;DR This game has more content than No Man's Sky on Launch and its really cute in that you play as an adorable bear :)"

I thought you just had to find food to survive, i wasn't expecting it to have adventure, puzzles, quests and prizes. DJ Raven was hilarious, and the ancient cave is really vexxing, but fun.The only thing i can say is that this game would be SO MUCH BETTER if we had a map, and tutorial on how to use strength, upgrade our bed, etc. I know the game was just released today but, it is really aggrivating to try and remember how to navigate back to entrance zones for different areas. I had to make 3 bears before i finally resigned to staying in armani falls for about 4 hours. loved the anceitn ruins, very zelda-meets-kungfupanda, loving it.I also noticed that if you get stuck somewhere, twice i got stuck on logs, you have to exit, and it's a real pain if you haven't saved. An autosave function would be rad.love the mysterious humans with the fallout feel, great game, loving it so far."

There are bugs and secrets and stats and jumping puzzles and silly notes from animals just about everywhere. Getting started initially is a bit difficult because there's no map or minimap in any way so you have to more or less learn landmarks to find your way around.Don't go into this game expecting breath taking visuals and storyline. Do go into this game expecting tame and gentle ridiculous humor (like the fact that you're a bipedal bear collecting butterflies and reading messages from depressed ducks)."

You can explore a big world full of scary things like ducks and rabbits.4. You get to eat all kinds of stuff like other animals, plants, and pizza!5. Eating things makes you more powerful.6. Did I mention it's about bears?Cons:1. The game doesn't taste like honey.2. The game doesn't taste like fish.3. You can't actually eat the game at all, I tried.Stuff humans might care about:1. It's fun if you like exploration type games with occasional fighting.2. The game world seems fairly big.3. It's clever with silly jokes throughout the game.4. No controller support yet. Use something like Xpadder if you want to use a controller, which I think is better than keyboard and mouse.5. A lot of graphics pop-in.6. Make sure your build up your stats before wandering to new and tougher areas because every bear should work out (eat a lot) before hitting the streets.I give it 2 paws up. Would eat again.UPDATE: The developer has fixed some issues like graphics and the ability to invert mouse look. Now bears don't have to be smart to eat food too, which is good for bears not named Yogi."
