,Recommended,395860,22375186,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,Faudraline,"The dreamer can know no truth, not even about his dream, except by awaking out of it. - George SantayanaAt first glimpse, nothing seems to actually stand out with this game. In its essence,The Last Dreamis a fragmented object game - or a FRAG as called by the veterans of the hidden object genre. Pretty interface, expected gameplay, a selection of puzzles... But its beauty in execution and thematic nuances centering the notion of dream; and a hopeless pursuit of love, hiding a heartbreaking truth that separates itself from the rest of its genre formidably in means of display, makesThe Last Dreama memorable experience.As an interesting choice, we take the role of a male protagonist - which is quite uncommon in HOG genre to begin with. Ben has lost his dear wife, Elizabeth in a car accident some time ago. Since that dreadful day, he is getting haunted by the apparition of his wife in dreams. Elizabeth is calling for him, leading him to an obscure discovery through uncanny geography of their history. Desperate to reach his dear wife, to hold her hand once more, Ben takes on this strange journey, persistent to reach her with any means possible. A nameless, smiling cat accompanies him in this journey, leading him through bizarre environments and dangerous obstacles in each new dream. Can Ben reach his dear wife at the end?With these kind of games, we are accustomed to encountering digitally rendered art work and animations for characters. Here though, the dream world and the real world are sharply separated from each other in means of display. Enacted characters and their interactions are presented in FMV cinematics in the real world, while dreamlike environments and gameplay sequences are arranged into digital art works. This way, the story presents a medium for you to emphasize with the character, making all nuances a bit more touching. I personally think the acting is quite decent, yet voice acting isn't that marvelous or emotional at all. There is a certain stiffness and a lack of theatrical enthusiasm in voices that wrecks the emotional quality. Dream environments are most certainly beautiful and fittingly uncanny with sorrowful, elegant and symbolic displays of memory streams.For the gameplay, there is not much to talk about. You collect items, combine some, use them in the appropriate places and carry on with the story - with one difference of a dream companion. Selecting a cat as a dream travelling guide is a beautiful nuance borrowed from Egyptian mythology and well appropriate for the undertone of the whole story. You are given 10 FRAG scenes in which you'll eventually collect different items and 20 or so puzzles, which are not that hard to deal with anyhow. In 9 chapters - with each of them having a central theme with 3-4 places - you'll come to the end of your journey and the bonus adventure in 3 hours or so.I suggest considering this beauty on a sale. If you like the HOG genre, it's one of the better ones out there which doesn't come from big name developers.

It all was so confusing and unreal, until you reach the last chapter of the game, then all the puzzle pieces will fall together. For me, the last chapter was a redemption or I'd have rated this down and not recommend it to anyone.The bonus chapter was short, kind of strange if you think of it logically (But usually there is nothing logic about hidden objects game and the tools locations) It wasn't a bad addition to the main story. Also If you are after achievements, you'll have to clear the bonus chapter as well in order to achieve everything.What bugged me in this game that there is no map, no journal, you are on your own and have some specific tasks to do and finish somehow.Pros:+OK graphics.+OK story.+Good fragmented objects scenes. (There is no hidden objects scenes)+OK music.+Collectibles+Easy achievements.+Steam achievements.Cons:-No map.-No Journal.-No replay value.You wouldn't know when to use the helper who you have and this is a flaw in the game unless there was a logic behind it which I missed.I can't rate this down because it is not a horrible game, it is playable, and I actually enjoyed the last part but, I only recommend it to people who love fragmented objects scenes, love achievements and challenges, and doesn't mind live action cutscenes. Personally I think the voice acting was much better than the acting itself. But as I said, the ending of the game was really good."

It is more like an adventure game than a hog(the hog part is the fragmented object kind and not annoying at all)The FMV makes it interactive and it's engrossing.I have had to disable the high DPI and run it in compatibuilty mode for windows xp ...Edited; finished...LOVED the game.  Highly recommendedI also loved the music which was non intrusive and a little melancholy but VERY fitting for the story...

76561197993862065,Recommended,395860,31758337,Posted: 14 May,all,IceHippo,"Mix of hidden object, mini-games, and inventory puzzles gives about 6 hrs of enjoyment. It's worth getting but only on a good discount, YMMV.If you've played TRAUMA on Steam this is a similar game, but with a bit more too it. It's about a third each of hidden object, mini-games, and inventory puzzles. The atmosphere has a dream-like quality. The artwork is good, but not great. There's a bunch of live-actor video cutscenes, and I can't say the voice overs or music were exceptional. The minigames were ok, although the directions on a few (the ""i"" button) were not always clear and one had a bit of a buggy result (see below, puzzle related not software glitch). When you finish the game, there's an additional chapter in the extras section that is worth doing (especially if you want full achievements).Sometimes it's not clear where the hotspot locations are, and on a few of the puzzles I had to look up the solution because I overlooked an item or hotspot. I'd often leave the game open, and come back when I had an idea about a puzzle that stumpted me so my play time was closer to 6 hrs, and people who are good with hidden object games can probably finish in less time. I only played on the hardest mode with no hints, personally I would rather look at a walkthrough than deal with in-game hints (YMMV).[edited to make more clear] When you come across the safe puzzle, this might drive you crazy (this is not a solution spoiler, but rather what NOT to do if you think you have the combination figured out and don't know why the safe isn't opening):In each diagonal, the lower number is 3 times the value of its upper opposite diagonal (8 and 24, 13 and 39). The missing number is diagonally opposite 18, so the missing number should be 06, right? Well, it's not, but you're sort of on the right track.I had to peek at the walkthrough for the solution, there's no reason this alternate (wrong) solution about should have been in the game."

I liked the use of live actors although the lips don't move and was different to the other hidden object games as, you have dark moments and also have a cat companion who helps out and even in the bonus which is a good thing.  Puzzles can be easy to difficult depending on how good you are and the game will take a few hours to do and a nice game to pass the time and has puzzle solving which can make it enjoyable and buy this on special."

Here is why: (I will be reviewing this game one specific at a time.)Graphics: The game looks amazing for 2015. Everything in the enviornment is detailed and easy to recognize.Controls: The controls are very easy. You click on one of the arrows that appear to go in that direction, and the controls are very responsive during the puzzles, and while navigating the main menu.Gameplay: You click on something to investigate it, and solve puzzles through various means. Easy.Story: Your wife dies in a car accident, yet she keeps calling you. Your dream gives you a strange clue, and you realize it is your job to bring her back to you. I'm not going to spoil anything, let me just say that the ending is one of the most beauttiful endings I've ever seen in a game.Overall: Buy this game. If you've never played a point and click game before, this is a good place to start. Don't expect the puzzles to be easy, though."

76561198077378264,Recommended,395860,34118862,Posted: 8 August,all,Sorenn,"The Last Dream is a point and click game with FrOGs.  I had to look that one up - it means Fragmented Object Game.  You play as Ben, a young man whose wife Elizabeth has recently passed away.  Ben has started having dreams about Elizabeth as if she is trying to contact him from the other side.  The game consists of a series of stages that take you ever closer to Elizabeth.  Her ghost appears frequently to urge you onward to the next challenge.The game uses live motion video for the cut scenes.  I think this worked better than having mediocre CGI as most similar games do.  At first I found it a bit cheesy as they try to force the emotional connection to get you invested in the story.  They had me hooked with the cat - whom you must use to aid you on your quest. I guess if the love story doesn't work - add an animal.  The voice acting is much better than normal for this type of game.I think the locations were nicely drawn in a cartoonish style - I quite liked them.  The fragmented object puzzles were very well done - that was the best part for me. It is clear someone put a lot of effort into the FrOGs.  There are normal point and click style puzzle games too - these are also nicely executed. My compliments to the developers for a solid effort with strong attention to detail.This game has thriteen Steam achievements and takes about four to five hours to complete. I bought it on sale in the Steam Summer Sale - I think I got good value for my $3.  I recommend this game to fans of point and click / hidden object games.I give it 7 out of 10."
,Recommended,395860,33445697,Posted: 10 July,all,ElusiveOne,"The Last Dreamis a pleasingly relaxing blend of hidden object and point and click adventure that takes you on a simple journey through an increasingly surreal world.Despite huge gaps in realism, the game provides clear directions so players don't have to wrestle with fuzzy logic. There's a reasonably natural flow to everything, except in the few circumstances where you work towards solving a problem not yet exposed.As is generally the case with this genre, objects are scattered in the most ridiculous places. Reveal, collect, use, activate and merge items in the environment or through a manageable inventory. A simple click handles most actions, except in situations that require your inexplicably devoted cat companion for extra help. The actual presence of this cat makes no sense but adds variety.There is exactly one fragmented object scene per major area, with detailed parts to seek clearly visible at the bottom. Completed series turn into a usable object that activates another part of the scene until all has been found. These were very enjoyable and easily my favorite game segments.While full motion video may be a welcome addition to some, what is seen here is almost intrusively amateurish. Developers opted to film themselves as the two characters in grainy video, a notoriously bad decision since the early days of FMV. Dub actors provide serviceable audio.""Why is there always a gear missing?""There's eventually a palpable level of repetition with objects and surrounding actions, including lots of power tools, handles, ropes or chains, water, buckets and containers, passwords and more all appearing on multiple occasions.Mini games are mostly derivative versions of classics you've likely solved before, such as the 8 queen chess problem. Few of them were actually enjoyable, and certainly not memorable. Some even come with poor instructions and arbitrary undefined rules, causing unnecessary difficulty spikes in an otherwise fairly easy game.PositiveDetailed and pleasant backdropsGood location varietyExcellent fragmented object scenesAdjustable level of difficulty perfectly tuned for newcomers and veterans alikeFound notes explain the more difficult puzzle expectationsEpilogue with extra story and puzzles (hidden in extras menu, a nice addition but easy to miss)Generally decent audio (despite a few repetitive short loops)No list-based object searchesNo time limit or fail statesShort but decent lengthNegativeAwkward cat model and animationsCheesy and poor quality FMVEasily forgettable storyUninspired puzzle mini games"

Actually, it's a bit harder than other games in this genre (if you avoid using hints), but with some patience everything can be solved logically.There are few fragmented-object scenes, a variation on hidden-object that in my opinion is inferior. It's more challenging to find an object by its name without knowing its shape than to look for a known one in the scene. Still, those in this game are perfectly satisfying.You even have a cat assistant. Take my money already!Recommended for fans of casual point-and-clicks."
,Recommended,395860,30066364,Posted: 20 February,all,Mr Torgue High-Five Flexington,"Not your typical hidden object / point-and-click game.While the game is short, relative to other games in the same genre, The Last Dream makes up for it with the real-world video cutscenes. The story follows a man trying to reunite with his wife, and there is some decent confusion as to what is real and what is a dream that help pique a player's interest.Ultimately the gameplay is overly simple though. Hidden object scenes are few and far between, and are an odd mix of find-and-assemble, and find-where-to-use-it, all on the same screen. I admit to getting stuck in a few places as well, trying to figure out what to do next. Puzzles are an odd mix of easy and hard, making it difficult to pin down what age group the devs were targeting when making this.There is a good variety of scenes and some interesting barriers to overcome, even though I felt it could have benefited from more puzzles and gameplay.The inclusion of actual videos with real actors helps push this game into arecommendedfrom me, something other HO game developers can learn from."

,Recommended,395860,35179706,Posted: 24 September,all,Rainn,"I'm generally not a fan of hidden object games. The genre doesn't allow for a great deal of variety, and most of them usually play like the developer has made a Waldo puzzle more difficult for the sake of it. As such I would never willingly go out of my way to buy and play one. I'm still not sure how this game found its way into my library, but I'm glad it did.This game isn't as difficult as other Hidden Object games and has a far superior storyline to match it, which might just keep you going when you've been staring for 5 minutes and just can't find that last stamp part. Pretty visually impressive too, and the kind of addicting where you finish the game and realise you've spent hours beating the game in a single sitting.Highly recommended."

I played this game on the hardest setting (basically no hints or clues whatsoever) and the game set quite a good challenge. You'll need to think a little outside the box when combining items and the puzzles are quite testing at times which does make this game suitable for those wanting a challenge. Graphics are very nice, combining live actors in the story giving it a cinematic feel. The music was my highlight keeping the scenes engaging and not feeling too repetitive.

However, this quickly became natural, and a kind of interesting way to solve the stages between every level.The puzzles have good variety between difficulty, and I must admit after sitting hours with some of them, I just had to press skip... While others were truly fun to try to figure out. Love the fact that the hidden-object-modes are a bit out of the ordinary, where you have to find pieces of items and not just whole items, and then find somewhere to use them once the items are complete. I'm no huge fan of the story itself, and sometimes the background music was too short and the loops got annoying, but the gameplay itself makes up for it.All in all I found this game highly enjoyable, had hours of fun.Greatly appreciate the small things, such as the fact that this game is one of the few p'n'c games where you can actually BREAK STUFF instead of finding the darn key!"
