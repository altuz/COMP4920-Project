76561198065261299,Not Recommended,395900,19310920,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,Stoopy,"Not recommended since it just misses the mark in so many big ways.   Top 3 examples:1.  A backgammon game with onOfflinemode should at least offer challenging gameplay and decent AI.  This doesn't, even on Master mode it makes very elemental mistakes and bad decisions.  Never at any time did I even feel remotely threatened of losing a game using the most challenging settings.  Just go for the doubling cube right out of the gate since you are pretty much assured a win.2.  A backgammon game with onOnlinemode should at leastbe able to connect to a server...but this game only very occasionally is able to connect. most of the time it simply fails (as reported by many other reviewers).  All my other Steam multiplayer apps work just fine.3.  Lastly,anycomputer-based backgammon game should at least offer an ""Undo"" feature to allow for mistakes or unintended moves which can easily be made due to shortcomings and learning curves with the user interface. And the user interface in this game is far from intuitive, it's clunky really, and ends up taking away from a smooth gameplay experience... so the lack of an Undo button in this game becomes even more noticeable due to the heightened ablity to click on something incorrectly.  On the bright side, the authors may have figured it wouldn't matter much since you can make plenty of mistakes and still win due to the over-agressive and poor AI.And after finally trying ""Blitz mode"".... makes an arcade game out of backgammon with powerups and a Gameshow-themed announcer.   Won against AI using no powerups while it threw everything it had at me,  If you like slugfests with tons of pieces going on the bar I guess it's entertaining.Pros:  Gameboard graphics are very nice.  Two player local mode, human-vs-human would offer a good experience probably but at that point why not just get the real board out from the closet?If you are a new backgammon player and looking for something fairly easy to win and maybe different in an arcadeish way this could be something to try out, but you also may not end up learning much from the AI."

First, there is no means to undo a move.  There should be an option to allow you to ask your opponent's permission to undo a bad move and if your opponent is okay with it, then you can do it.  Also, trying to find someone online to play with is almost impossible unless you find a friend on Steam who plays and you make arrangements to play in advance.  That is probably the most disappointing part of this game and it almost caused me not to recommend the game.  However, with a little tweaking this could be a winner.  It needs an undo and it needs to make finding other players easier.  Also, when I finally did find someone to play with online, the servers were not that good.  I expect these issues to be resolved."
76561197993733711,Recommended,395900,19450078,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,WaspsinmyHair,"Without doubt the prettiest and best sounding implementation of backgammon you've ever seen. If you know how to play you will be playing in two button clicks, but if you're a newbie Backgammon Blitz's tutorial will get the job done very well.I'd especially like to point out that matches are amazingly customizable-I'd never even heard of the Raccoon rule or Jacoby rule, for example, but I know about them now! This game unfortunately does not appear to be particularly popular, since finding an online match seems to be a pain.There is room for improvement. The biggest problem is that the automatic bearing off of checkers is broken when there are enemy checkers in your home board: the computer will expose you to capture instead of the correct play of moving the checker to another point further down.  Also turning on automatic dice rolling removes your ability to use the doubling cube.I also like that the developers added in keyboard shortcuts, which are welcome for those of us who enjoy the opportunity to play quickly. It's too bad there isn't a similar way to move chekcers without using the mouse, which can be temperamental.One final suggestion: it would be a relief to have an option that greatly speeds up or entirely removes the dice rolling and checker movement animations. This would greatly speed up and enhance play!EDIT:I finally played a match online with my brother, and I have to say the clunky interface is especially painful in multiplayer. You will end up waiting what seems like a very long time for the other person even to cast dice. Sometimes a minute or longer will pass until you realize that actually he's been waiting for you to roll. Part of the problem is that the interface's display of the Roll Dice action is the only indication that it is your turn.The extremely finnicky checker selection and movement is even worse in multiplayer because of a slight delay after each checker movement, as if the game were waiting to confirm each movement with the server. Playing multiplayer convinces me that the controls are fundamentally flawed, and I think this game would do well to take cues from the open-source GNU Backgammon and implement a less frustrating way to move checkers. In GNU, clicking once on a checker will move it intelligently, and it also has an Undo feature which is lacking in Blitz.While we're comparing Blitz to GNU, it must also be said that the AI in Blitz is atrocious in every possible way. If you're not familiar with GNU Backgammon, it is meant for serious players and comes with a world-class AI. But Blitz doesn't play competently even on Master level, exposing checkers in its own home board and capturing the player's checkers with no rhyme or reason. On the other hand, a single screenshot will be enough to tell you that GNU does not hold a candle to Blitz's graphics or sound.It's a shame to say it, but at this point I'd say the only thing bringing me back to Blitz are the gorgeous graphics and sound and the ability to play over Steam with my noob brother. The program is really ideal for drawing in new players with its interactive tutorial mode and fantastic presentation. But after about an hour or so or play, you will realize that the AI just doesn't cut it and online multiplayer is nerve-wracking. Get it when it goes on sale again to satisfy your curiosity, but if you've been playing backgammon somewhere else and thinking about Blitz, you will not be satisfied with the package at the full price tag."

Gameplay seems ok, though I haven't seen much difference in the computer AI difficulty settings.  Maybe I just got lucky.There is single player and multiplayer.  I've only done single player so far.Choose from several different board graphics.  And you can choose music tracks (jazz, classical, etc).There are lots of settings for rules variations.  You can turn off that doubling cube thing (I never play with it).I have had some problems with the game freezing, but I'm pretty sure it's my computer's fault.  My graphics thingy got messed up by a windows update.

Backgammon Blitz let me try it out against an AI opponent and gave me the rules, which turned out to be pretty simple. Unlike the board game, Backgammon Blitz shows you what the possible moves are. Multiplayer matches are simple to set up and provide straightforward entertainment. Even in multiplayer, there is a nagging suspicion that dice rolls are not entirely random, but it's all good fun. The presentation is really slick and the jazzy soundtrack is very nice. I can say that this is a great game and reallychilled-outcompared to most others I play."

If you don't like Backgammon, you won't.At its heart, Backgammon is a board game about rolling dice and trying to get your pieces around the board while stomping on your opponent's pieces to send them back home. Now, in my opinion, it is just about the pinnacle of that style of game. It has strategy, action, and a lot of pressing your luck. If a board game with all of those things that's been loved for millennia sounds exciting, you'll probably really like this version of the game.The A.I. is good and the graphics are beautiful. I really want to try it on multiplayer, but I haven't had the chance yet. I didn't like the controls at first, but then realized that there were multiple ways to control everything, and I was happy with the controls  I eventually found.

It makes really fun to play with these beautifully designed boards! With the well-selected music it creates a very backgammon-like atmosphere. I'd really like to play it against online players - if there were some! Hope they'll show up after a while. The AI is unfortunately way to weak to be a pleasure to play against it.There are some minor design mistakes which do not conform to the standard Backgammon rules which will certainly annoy serious players. The doubling cube should, when used, reside on the player's side who accepted the double. Also, the checkers on most of the boards are  too small, especially on the leather board. They should nearly cover the base of the points - have a look at some high-quality boards to see the relations.I don't like the way how to move checkers. The game should support dragging the pieces and move them by a single click, e.g. like in gnubg. This is pretty standard in all modern Backgammon clients out there. Clicking twice for selecting the checker and pointing to the destination is too slow and not enjoyable.Concluding, I recommend the game for online playing. It really creates a nice atmosphere and is certainly the most beautiful computer Backgammon game. The weakest points are the AI and the small number of online players."

The jump in difficulty from ""beginner"" to ""intermediate"" is astounding.  It is nearly impossible to beat.  For any good computer Backgammon game there should be at least 5 difficulty settings.  The jump in difficulty between settings is insane.  I can win every game against ""beginner"" but I don't have a prayer against ""intermediate"".  They should have gradually increased the difficutly, I am very displeased with the extreme jump in difficulty.  Another thing is that there is no option to make it so that you cannot see your legal moves.  I like to calculate my own legal moves, but when the computer tells you your legal moves, it's basically playing half the game for you.  Another thing is that they should have allowed the option for manual dice rolls, just to make sure the computer isn't cheating.
