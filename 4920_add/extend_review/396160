So I think that constitutes false advertisement. It looks more like an 8-bit color pallete in-game.SIDE-BY-SIDE SCREENSHOT:http://imgur.com/YmSFA8GI want to try this game but I don't think the game is playable in this state. The framerate in this game is locked at what seems to be 10 FPS. It's hard to tolerate. I've never seen anything this bad. Maybe this game was made in Basic.Extremely difficult to control your character:There's a setting to toggle run/walk but that stopped working after about 5 minutes and no longer works so I'm stuck walking. Seriously. I reload an old game save and that one is stuck running.360 pad works, but only the analog stick, not the D-Pad. This is really dumb since movement is not analog.There is an option to 'hold down a button to run' (It's the shoulder button), but it should be the OPPOSITE! Hold the button to walk! And as mentioned, this might not work after a bit. The shoulder button is a bit too clumsy for this dextrous task as well. Very unfortunate.Test PC: i5-750, 760GTX, 8GB RAMGoing to let the developer keep my 49 cents. Controller updates would be greatly appreciated. Keep trying."

I know you want to read about something you love, something you like or just some AAA games, but in order to finish everything, we have to go together even through things like this.I feel like I've shattered Zonitron enough, that triple death was enough. I don't want to lower up quality here, but Lunatoid at least tried. I can see little bit of creativity over here, but it's all hidden between really big number of bugs, glitches and of course 25 minutes long content.They've been creative at least with visuals. Yes, it looks like every other indie game like that or every other album of so called artist named ""Future"" woah. But it really not breaking your eyes into peaces like Zatwor game. Combat system should not even be called system. It's just stack of things you can do and you can use and that's it boom.To sum it up - 30 minutes long game with like 5 quests, no bigger picture, handful of fights and that's it. But at least it doesn't hurt that much when you looking at that.Bonus Point: Mystic MountainsRating: 2/10"

Speaking of Jobs, the Job you pick only affects your HP, MP, and which shop weapons/armor you can use, no job specific skills or anything as far as I saw (I was a lv. 15 Ninja by the time I beat the game).  My biggest problem is the game doesn't even tell you what to do or where to go after the first 10 minutes, it's just wander around the world killing stuff, doing a few quests that have little story themselves, and the ""main story"" is go find 4 elements in dungeons and take em to a bird and then kill said bird after it attacks you, then it takes you back to the title screen, the end.  I kept seeing talk of other party members in the game but I never got a single one while I wandered around talking to everyone and doing every quest I saw.TLDR: Game isn't as good as trailer made it out to be, only get it if it's on sale and you want to waste time.  5/10  Was expecting a little bit more out of the game and at least some direction on what to do and where to go.  Won't be playing it again since other Jobs are practically pointless to play other than to make the game pointlessly hard."

76561198042646749,Not Recommended,396160,34067080,Posted: 6 August,all,kris.aalst,"Secret of Magiais an old-school RPG made with RPG Maker. Although it screams potential, this game is obviously unfinished and abandoned by its developer.Secret of Magia, an unfinished productI mean it when I saySecret of Magiashows a lot of potential. It seems like a greatbasisfor a solid old-school RPG, if only someone would have finished it…To clarify, some examples of unfinished aspects of this game:There's no story. At the start of the game, you get three lines of dialogue informing you that you need to get your hands on four 'elements'. When you do, you get a message reading 'Well done' and you're returned to the main menu. That's all the storySecret of Magiacontains, really.There's a magic system but the game only contains two magic spells. And although the enemies scale with your level, both magic spellsdon't scaleso they quickly become useless.You need to choose a class for your character but are offered no information whatsoever on the pros and cons of each class. I looked it up. Turns out your class determines how much HP versus MP you receive when leveling up. Makes sense, but like I said the magic system is as good as absent, making MP-focused classes a bad choice. The only other thing your class determines is which weapons you can use. Fair enough, but the best weapons in the game can be wielded by any class, so that kind of beats the purpose of the classes altogether then.NPCs refer to 'your party' and there are options in the game's menus that clearly hint to a party, but you never get a companion or a party. You'll play the whole game with one single character until the end.There are some shops in the starting town, where you can buy basic gear, but there are no more shops after that. So money becomes obsolete soon after the starting town.The game has a crafting system but it's clearly unfinished. You can craft some decent starting gear and that's it. You can also brew potions but it's much easier to buy them in the starting town and like I said, money is worthless anyway. Crafting gear or brewing potions makes you level up a skill connected to those activities, but there is no advantage to gaining levels in those skills. You don't get to make better equipment or anything, it's just an unfinished feature.In the beginning of the game, there's a tutorial teaching you about 'the lantern', but the lantern isn't used anymore after that point. They also teach you about a grappling hook to cross chasms and such, but it's almost never used again after that.In the game's menu, there are literally options that don't work as those options were never implemented, for example a 'pocket watch'.You come across several locations that were clearly supposed to be involved in a quest as you find elaborate instructions on how to use the equipment there, but there never is any use for them.On top of that, there are plenty of scripting bugs in the game, especially walls and such that aren't marked as 'impassable' so you can just walk through solid objects like that. In one case you enter an inn in one town and when you leave, you find yourself at the inn in another town!On Steam's extra featuresSecret of Magiahas 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.The 5 Steam Achievements seem to be thrown in for good measure (well, to get the label 'Steam Achievements', more likely). Example: the first 'quest' you get is to enter the town well. The first achievement is called 'Into the well' and has the following description: ""You found the well where you discover your powers"". But the achievement is granted only when you select 'No' when prompted 'Do you want to enter the well?'.The rest of the achievements consist of trivial 'tasks'. The two most laughable are 'sleep at an inn' and 'get healed at a church', especially because they don't work at the first inn and the first church you encounter. This makes you think the achievements are bugged and not bother with them anymore, unless you read a guide that tells you otherwise."

Soundtrack is pretty good, though even with all the volume sliders at 50% some noices are still really loude.  Gameplay is pretty simple, but that's not a bad thing.  I've also noticed that sometimes a monster (like the wasps and slimes) take up to twice as many hits as other monsters of the same type in the same map, causing my death a handful of times (I picked mage, by the way, so I probably have less HP).  I've also walked though a wall or two so far, so hopefully a patch or two will come out later to help fix these issues.  I do like it so far, but I probably wouldn't buy it if it was much more expencive.Added: Oh, and the shift+tab doesn't do anything."

What is the Secret of Magia?It's a lie. It's a farce. It's a buggy, broken, terribly developed, messy piece of junk that should not be on Steam. Yet somehow it is. And if just playing the game wasn't enough, digging into these Steam reviews is even more eye-opening than one would think.When the dev himself is complaining about the publisher messing up his game, screwing it up, and even trying to hide that IT is the publisher (Epic Quest Games), you know something is foul.But if finding all those solid negative reviews and reading them isn't enough, have some more with this one.Action RPG? Yes, but only barely. Inspired by great games? Possibly, but this is so barebones and by the book that it hardly echoes of any of them mentioned on the Store page. Huge world? Nonsense. It's small enough to be easily beaten in less than 3 hours, AND you even have the in-game maps found to prove it. Tyranny of an evil, supernatural dictator? More like an ambiguous bird being who wakes you up and threatens your life if you don't gather plot items (as seen in one of the screenshots).I mean honestly the entire ""About This Game"" bit can be properly summarized down to ""Secret of Magia is an action RPG. Your story begins in a town. As you venture out, you'll earn levels and find obvious dungeons that have broken weapons. You start weak, you'll get strong, and you will never need to go back to your starting village. Explore a tiny world, grind aimlessly on cheap monsters, and go beat up the final boss.""4 side-quests of a moderately ambiguous nature. A really tiny overworld. Practically no plot whatsoever beyond ""go find the four things"". Flatter, more two dimensional characters than paper. Enemies that level with you, a battle system that is easily broken, weapon crafting and item drops that serve no real solid purpose. And a final boss who upon defeat compliments you then kicks you back to the title screen. That same final boss is the one who kick starts the plot to begin with, and that's basically all the plot you get.Secret of Magia is ONLY worth the cards it drops, and even then how much can you make? This is better off lost and forgotten about, tossed into the proverbial rubbish as it is now. Do not repeat my mistake.Because honestly, even fifty cents worth of candy gives more enjoyment than Secret of Magia."

It obviously has a lot of ideas going into it, but none are brought to fruition and little of the game feels finished or satisfying as a result.  The game features weapon crafting, but the weapons you make are useless compared to what you can buy by the time you can craft them.  It features potion crafting which requires gathering items from defeated monsters.  However, defeating monsters means gaining levels and gaining levels is more of a drawback than a plus.  You rarely feel that your character is getting stronger since monsters level up with him and they get stronger faster.  The game has side quests, only five in total, and not all of them give rewards.  Money is too easy to come by, so you might as well spend it all on potions and armor to make the game more bearable.This is not the kind of game that you pay for and I'm sorry that I did, even though it was on a massive sale.  This is the kind of game that someone puts on the Internet for free so he can get feedback about what to do betterin his next project.  This is an amateur's first attempt at an action RPG and the creator must have a heck of a lot of audacity to think he can sell this.  Don't make the mistake that I did.  Don't buy it.

Both the delight and the engine are open for purchase on Steam. Reminiscent of the early Zelda and Last Dream titles, Riddle of Magia will take you on a hazardous top-down big business through grounds of changed region. By get-together stock and interesting limits, you will probably return 4 unprecedented articles to a noteworthy supervisor and procure 5 thousand Steam achievements. Unfortunately, as of this composed work, none of the achievements are truly popping... in a perfect world this will be settled soon.The primary demand of business when starting another preoccupation is to pick one of two characters: male or female. Disregarding the way that you have a spiffy mouse cursor alive and well of a sword, you can't use it here. With your jolt keys, coordinate a dull hover through the gateway by the character of choice (I picked male for this review). A little while later you will pick one of 6 character-classes (I picked Paladin) and get side voyages to supplement the major story line. As your experience continues with, you'll keep running over towns and distinctive spots noteworthy to your target of social affair the 4 remarkable things for the immense manager.We should talk towns. As indicated by RPG measures, these settlements contain three staples of adventuring: markers, structures and non-player characters (NPCs). Markers can be anything from a stone to garbage dumpster... basically, a stationary thing of interest. In Secret of Magia, an unmistakable town marker is the ""Extra Entertainment"" wellspring.Structures give an organization, whether it be weaponry, sustenance or essentially a place to rest. Lunatoid was adequately wise to join a specialist's office sort working, for smart patching in the wake of a dull day of getting yourself hurt.NPCs are the most intriguing of the town staples, as they offer bits of data to help you impel the story. As a less than dependable rule their help is quick; at various times cloud. Regardless, they're persistently charming to meet.The open world is colossal, and you'll as often as possible go over alarming areas. Say what you will, yet the commendable RPG ""cell"" has constantly been my most adored spot to experience anything; especially fight. Enemies are definitely not hard to spot in this redirection. They meander impulsively about... until they get inside a couple hex spaces of you. Do whatever it takes not to get vain, in any case. Rather than using a turn-based structure, Riddle of Magia offers consistent fight. Adversaries can unexpectedly shoot toward you, hit you for mischief and pull back to prosperity, all in a minute. I suspected that it was useful to take cover behind near to things and a short time later surge the baddies before they could get a ricochet on me... however, those were just sewer rats. Mindful foes are much harder! Despite a standard weapon, your character ought to in like manner juggle a shield, defensive layer and a substantial gathering of phenomenal embellishments and spells.This redirection puts RPG Maker through its paces, and it's up to the player to make everything work. The best direction I can give for the youngster is: ""Take as much time as essential!"" The entertainment sports get ready grounds and fight shams on which explorers can hone their capacities. Before long, I'd contribute equal the initial investment with vitality getting awesome with the swarm menus and sub-menus; trading things and weapons on demand: ESC/Enter/Space/Q/Move/X... like a comfort ninja (which is one of the classes you can pick, incidentally)!I found the menu structure exceptionally bewildering at to begin with, however with some practice I got the hang of it. Clearly we're not part particles here, but instead I'd considerately suggest that menus be fairly more regular.This passes on us to our last point: delight regard. Is Puzzle of Magia defended, in spite of all the inconvenience? The reaction for me is a stunning YES. As of this conveyance, the preoccupation is at a can anticipate $1.79 (US).

It's more of an action game.The pathing of monsters and their attacks are quite frustating to play against, some just dash to you in zigzag kinda patterns and are almost impossible to dodge. On the other hand, with anything but a dagger or a bow, you can sit next to monsters and kill them to your side. With a bow, you can just kill them from afar without them trying to kill you.It could have been a great game, but there are too many flaws. Mana regen is slow, leveling-up actually makes the monsters harder to kill overall. Classes are a little meaningless and have no really specific skills. There's also no abilities to unlock as you gain levels.There's no maps, so you have to keep the layout of the map in your head and the game is just pretty, bland... In the first 2 dungeons anyways, all you have to do is kill the unique monster inside the zone, get his key and then unlock the door that leads to the boss room, that's not very original!The music is not too bad, but I heard it wasn't composed for this game, so I won't praise it too much. The graphics are fair enough for RPGmaker, but they could be way better. There are some game breaking bugs (just pressing f12 for example, it crashes your game).

,Recommended,396160,32032771,Posted: 28 May,all,YPRPG,"Secret Of Magia is an action RPG with a hack and slash combat system and approximately 3 hours worth of gameplay.The world map contains a sequence of areas which lead away from your home town, with enemies becoming more difficult, the further you go. Levelling up is pointless as enemies level up with you, but the further flung enemies have fancier moves that make them more formidable. The map is open world, and you can easily retrace your steps.The main mission consists of capturing the souls of four different bosses, then defeating the final boss. To get to each of the bosses, you must enter a cave, then find and defeat a powerful enemy which holds a key to the door where the boss is found. Defeating that boss will reveal its soul.There are several areas and towns to explore, and a handful of quests to complete. There is enough content here that it's possible to make it through the first two hours, without ever realizing that you've overlooked the main mission.As for the main mission, it is not well explained at all, being only vaguely hinted at by some of the NPCs. The only way you'd know what to look for, is if you read up on the game beforehand, or stumble across the key by randomly killing the enemy that drops it.The story is virtually non-existent, as the side quests are given in the most blunt way possible, and the ending is equally lacking in fanfare.There is extensive customization of your character in terms of class, equipment, magic, and craftable items; however, this is largely wasted, because most of it is unnecessary to beat the game, and you can easily earn enough gold through combat to buy the strongest equipment in the shop, and more potions than you'll ever need.This game has a little bit of action and a little bit of adventure, but probably not enough of either one individually to satisfy its prospective fans. The hack and slash gameplay might prove too easy for its hardcare fans, while for adventure RPG enthusiasts, the story is somewhat lacking. There are five achievements, however, which are relatively easy to accomplish, if you prefer something more basic."

Are you looking for fun?Then look somewhere else.Concept & Story:Secret of Magia is standard Japanese Role-Playing-Game fare. There is nothing new brought to the table. Some may be fine with this approach, as was I. However, there is hardly any story at all. The game opens with a monstrous bird that threatens to kill you if you do not return with four crystals... at least it appears to threaten you. Significant grammatical errors are made immediately. While these can be sludged though and understood because of context, they persist throughout the game, sometimes making sentences nonsensical. This problem never alleviates. There are portions of text that lead completely off the screen, leaving the player to guess what was being said.After leaving the introduction, our hero is set on a set of sidequests. That's it: five sidequests that aren't really tied in any way to the plot. The plot, of course, does not exist. It is only revisited at the end of the game and very, very briefly at that. While it is typically considered in bad taste to spoil the ending of a game or film, I cannot do so, though I am sorely tempted to. You see, the ending... it doesn't exist. As the boss lays dying, you are returned to the title screen. No credits, no ""Thank you for playing"", not even ""Game Over""; there is absolutely nothing following this. This isn't just unexpected in story-based games, it's just downright rude.Concept & Story - 2/10Gameplay:This sort of title has many expected mechanics in gameplay style. It is clear what the developer was aiming for, it just misses the mark in each and every way. Full controller support is claimed, but this is false. Movement, with a control pad, is only permitted with the analog stick, not the directional pad. This sort of game would have played much better with the latter. Giving players the option of either or best would work for everyone. Instead, the developer chose otherwise. The buttons used for play are odd in placement and incredibly awkward throughout the game. It is not unusual for them to be nonresponsive. Sometimes, there is a significant delay between pressing buttons and having a chosen action take place. This is inexcusable.Navigating menus is slow, tedious, and excessive. Early in the game, the player is asked to equip items that aren't even present. They come into existence only when suggested by the interface. Other portions of inventory are completely unused, specifcally charms and accessories. It is as if something were planned and then completely forgotten. Evidently, the forgetfullness persisted through alpha and beta testing, if there was any at all.The game utilizes class systems, levels, and crafting. This would seem a good idea. Class choice makes little difference as they play nearly the same. When leveling, your character becomes stronger. Unfortunately, the enemies gain in strength, health, and resistances to your attacks... and very disproportionally so. In other words, ""leveling up"" not only does not help you, it is an extremely bad idea. Under no conditions should the player consider grinding for experience; they may find the game unfinishable. Crafting is introduced to upgrade weapons and to create potions. In fact, one entire town in the game is dedicated to the industry of alchemy and potions. This system is never flushed out and developed. It suggests itself to have great promise and then proceeds to be completely ignored. There is no reason to bother with crafting weapons of any sort.There are more concerns about things that would never be discussed if it were not for the fact that these normal mechanics are broken. Sleeping in village inns poses the slight risk of waking up in another town. It would appear that the screens that the interiors of the Inns are not reliably linked to the screens of the towns. As such, about one out of three nights spent will leave you across the world. When fighting certain enemies, the player can be stunned. This, in it of itself, is normally not an issue, but menu access is also locked. Any attempts to access the Game Menu or otherwise Pause are also ""stunned"". The entire game locks until the Effect wears off. There is no reason for this. Frequently, the player will become stunned even if not hit with a stunning attack. There is no way to predict when this will happen. Furthermore, progress through the four key dungeons is dependend on acquiring unique keys held be mini-bosses. Sometimes they drop them upon death... sometimes they don't. If not, pray you did not save, as the required Key is now and forever inaccessible. The only solution is to reset or load from a previous save file and try again.For what should be simple and casual play and control, The Secret of Magia fails even at this minimal task.Gameplay - 3/10Sound & Music:The sounds are fine and what would be expected for this sort of game. While voice-acting is a nice feature, it is not neccessary. Music is acceptable. It isn't awful, but it isn't memorable either. It is the sort of thing one would expect if a developer snatched up a few royalty-free music tracks and tossed in the ones that sounded best. Actually, this is exactly what developer, Lunatiod, did. The exact same music can be heard in other games as well. Even if they chose to use synthesised MIDI tracks that someone composed with this title in mind, it could have added more substance.Sound & Music - 5/10Graphics:JRPGs have a typical look to them and this title attempts to keep up with the look and style of these. It is light and whimsical, with a touch of cartoony adventure. This being said, it is expected that things are consistent. Windows appear out of the edges of the walls of a church. Players walk right over gates. The player can even walk into and through some walls. Frequently when moving, the player will appear to be using their ""Hookshot"" item, when no such device is in use. These realatively easy fixes persist.Most striking is the fact that the game does not appear as shown in the presented screenshots and advertisment video. It is extremely clear that the developer or publisher used photo and/or video editing software to make the game appear to have a very different asthetic than is actually present. In short,this is false advertising. This sort of practice is loathesome and completely disqualifies this aspect of the game.Graphics - 0/10Enjoyability and Replay Value:Secret of Magia showed a certain amount of promise. Each promise suggested was carelessly broken. Even if one sets their expectations low, this particular title fails to meet even that. This was an attempt to be a game without any intention to put in effort. It is hours of constant frustration dealing with glitches and broken game mechanics, a lack of story. and a complete absense of any fun. They entire game plays out as if ""fun"" is going to be right around the corner; it never comes.Since all characters are virtually the same, despite what their names suggest, there isn't a reason to try these variations out. There is not much in the way of secrets, so outside of a hidden dagger (with coordinates that mean nothing), there is nothing to go back for. It isn't even the sort of game that one can enjoy the story once more, because there is practically no story and what little is presented is certainly not enjoyable. It isn't fun or remotely interesting. It offers absolutely nothing.Enjoyability and Replay Value - 2/10Final Thoughts:It is obvious that the publisher and developer were interested in creating something that could be called a game, on paper. At 49 cents for this and three other titles, I feel ripped off. A waste of two hours. Avoid.Overall - 2/10"

As others have said, the enemies level up with you, which would have been fine if the shops did too, but once you have the basic equipment you run out of things to spend money on other than health potions, of which you will be using a lot because the armor is quickly outpaced by the damage of enemies. Your own damage does comparatively less as you level, and enemies take longer to kill the more you play, until it takes a minute to bring down a basic enemy by knocking them back into a wall to stun-lock them in place.The achievements are simple and easy to get, and the game elements like harvesting flowers as impromptu potion materials can be quite charming, but ultimately the game fell flat on the one thing most important to gaming.

,Recommended,396160,19860794,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,Toxxn,"Rather than writing a deep expansive review that will probably just bore you within the first paragraph, I thought I would change it up by just simply get down to the brass tacks.This game was made using the RPG Maker VX Ace Engine, therefore it presents the same problems that just about every other RPG Maker game presents. Sadly, these issues are just simply the mechanical limitations of RPG Maker, not developer errors, therefore I cannot fault the game on these issues.Putting the issues of RPG Maker aside, I really wanted to like this game, however it does have its problems. The first problem I had was a very noticable drop in FPS while in larger open areas. This FPS drop really slows down movement and becomes a quick nuisance. This issue is fixed when entering a building or cave, etc however presents itself again when re-entering the large area.Second problem I have are the controls. The controls are really bad in my opinion and have somewhat of a learning curve as you cannot change them. Granted you can remap controls using Xpadder or another re-mapping program if you have a controller, I feel I shouldnt have to use another program to get the controls you want.As I said previously, I am not going into a great amount of detail with this one. The two problems are my main issues, as of right now, therefore you want to know about other game issues or gameplay mechanics, check out some of the other reviews. They are chalk full of plenty of information.I gave this a prositive rating becuase I believe this game had potential and with some issues aside it really isn't all that bad for the price, especially if you pick it up in a bundle on sale."
76561198042494969,Not Recommended,396160,19246086,"Posted: 23 November, 2015",all,ChrisKamori,"This game feels like it's trying to do the Y Chronicals or Link to the Past thing, where combat takes place in real time, rather than in the typical random enounter way. The problem with this is that the RPG Maker engine wasn't meant for this type of combat. Developers, I congratulate you for making the game do it... but it's a shame you didn't do it well.I learned that this game uses a system where enemiew level up with the player. A novel concept, but it utterly fails in practice. Developers, I'm sorry. But you picked the wrong genre to include such a feature, because doing this punishes the player for grinding. When you have a game that rewards players for killing enemies with exp, money, and crafting items, chances are we're going to be encouraged to fight as many things as we can see. And the combat system you developed makes it really easy to kill a ton of things early on. But as you level up, enemies will start to take more and more hits to kill. And then you'll reach level 5 during the first notable quest, only to get gored by a bee on the way back.Killing 20 slimes doesn't turn the rest of them into liquid iron. Not in a logical world, anyways.Writing is extremely poor early on. Who am I? Why do I down a rat infested well to train? What ""training"" do I get done by beating up on an archery target with a knife? How did guy from the guild see me training on the cliff side? I never say any other spot in town where someone could get that kind of view. The moment I'm done with that training, he comes to me and says he'll give me a weapons license and a guild membership. Is it really that easy to join this guild? I wouldn't mind if the writing wasn't handled so clumsily. If you have a guild with criteria to join, it's typically best to have the player go to the guild, and be given some sort of minor adventuring quest to join it. Not saying you have to fit the generic mold; but either make joining the adventurers guild some sort of major feat for the character, or have them already in it. Otherwise, joining feels meaningless. Another protip would be to think of catchier names for towns and people. I know that seems like nitpicking. But it helps your world to make it memorable.And here's a protip for using the RPG VX ACE maker. I noticed this when I stepped on a patch of tall grass, and it looked like I was floating on top of it. If you go into your tilesets, where most tiles have like an X or O on it, there should be an option that looks like 2 wavy lines. I don't have it pulled up right now, so I can't give the actual name for it. But it'll make it to where characters get their lower half shaded when walking over a section. This creates the illusion that your character has the grass coming up to his waist. Just apply it to the tall grass sections and you're good.Overall, it's a game I fell if I do complete, it'll be by force. Sorry guys. This just wasn't your game."

Introduction was quick enough.  However, my interest wasn't piqued much.  A strange bird tells you to get all four elements or he'd reap your soul.  You get to choose your gender and class (assassin, archer or mage).  That's it.2. You wake up in a city and you're being told what to do next exactly.  The game pushes you in the direction you have to go.  Not much thought process involved at all.3. The combat system is Zelda-like; Secret of Magia is an action RPG where you press Z to swing your weapon, S to block with a shield, A to cast a spell.  Easy enough at first, but you can be one-shot by some enemies as melee rather easily if you don't act quickly enough.  The shield that I bought from the weaponmaker after receiving the license in town didn't seem to be working either (and I made sure to equip it, too).  And the monsters really do move too fast for you to avoid them sometimes.4. There are background bugs everywhere.  Cliffs and walls are passable when they shouldn't be, etc.5. No proofreading has been done for this game, apparently.  Dialogue is full of typos and misspellings - you'll be talking to plenty of 'Gaurds,' for example - and even with that fixed, it's not particularly memorable.  Many of the NPC's lines are nothing special.  ""I love my nice house!""  One guard said that they couldn't drink in the watchtower and giggled as he said it - which seemed weirdly out of place.6. Quests are discovered by talking to NPCs with an exclamation point or by examining books or so on - they seem to be straightforward but there was one quest that pointed out a location of a dagger while giving you coordinates.  I'm not sure how that would have been accomplished without an add-on telling you X and Y coordinates of the map you were on.  Granted, I didn't play long enough to try to figure it out.7. Did I mention you could be one-shot rather easily?  Now there aren't enough save points to really help you avoid a lot of experience and gold loss if that happens.  I decided not to risk entering the mines and try to find a save point because of it in the next town up.  This isn't really a criticism.  I like the challenge, but it can probably be discouraging to some.8. The Dash function is default (and essential in avoiding monsters); however the game's frame rate doesn't seem to be very smooth when you're dashing.  I've seen this done better in other RPGMaker games like Labyronia.  It's a bit distracting in this game.9. There are two different ways you can use items: through equipping them, and by using the Q-W quick item equipper.  I think the item equipper could have probably been removed to simplify up the UI a bit in that respect.10. There was a map inside the training hall in the first city that showed you the first few areas as if they were zoomed out.  I play RPGs to explore areas myself, so that map kind of took away most of the mystery of the first few areas for me.All in all, unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this game.EDIT: I bought it on sale ($1) and still feel ripped off - and now I find out from reading other reviews, if I had kept playing, I would have completed it in 2.5 to 3 hours anyway... I feel like there are a lot of better games for your money's worth.  Labyronia for one, which I mentioned."

A retro rpg had caught my eye and I was well convinced this was a good buy and I still don't regret playing it. I don't know if I was the only one, but only the first 1/4 of the game was actually scripted with quests and events. This was rather dissapointing, as I was expecting some really good developed plot to just slap me in the face. After obtaining the three elements, you get an attrocious sentence or two as your ending, and you are returned to the opening page. Just awful and depressing. Gameplay was simple and enjoyable but it looked like there was a lot of thought missing from the last half of the game that I was so upset with.

What it fails to do is execute these well and the game just turns into a giant mess. In Secret of Magia, you'll experience game breaking glitches, awful hitboxes, poor English, and a game that just isn't very long at all. The game has a grand total of five dungeons available, though only four of them are actually required to beat the game.One of the things in Secret of Magia that made absolutely no sense to me was why the enemies scaled with your level. I very quickly decided to not even bother with killing anything but what was required to even proceed. When it comes to the bosses, it doesn't even really matter if you're underleveled. All you have to do is stand to the side of where they can hit, and so long as they don't have some sort of area of effect skill they just can't hit you. One NPC remarked that you needed a shield to beat a particular boss. This boss was actually one of the only ones I couldn't abuse this hitbox effect on and I still never even used the shield (playing as a Paladin).Secret of Magia holds some good promises but completely fails to deliver on them. Many glitches are being left unchecked, such as being locked out of dungeons forcing you to restart the entire game and the Scythe just not being upgradeable. There are much better games in this style out there, so my suggested is to just play those instead and pass on Secret of Magia. Unless, of course, you don't mind smashing your head into awful English and poor hitboxes."

So now all the pros are covered, let's get to the cons.This is by far one of the worst 'games' I have ever played.To say this 'game' is bug ridden is an understatement.  Randomly walk thru walls?  Check.  Exits not linked properly?  Check.  Random graphic glitches?  Check.  Items that don't do what they say they are suppose to?  Check.  Typos all over?  Check.  Items that you can repeatably loot over and over?  Check.  Good luck getting the five laughable easy to get achievements.  It randomly can take dozens of tries to trigger it, despite doing the same thing literally every single time before.The 'game' itself is horribly linear with no story and no direction given.  You are punished for leveling up, as the foes grow in power much faster than you do from gaining levels.  Classes make little to no difference in play style or abilities.  Archers are even more punished by having a limit of 99 arrows.  It can take 10 to kill a single foe, forcing them to use the basic knife most of the time.  Gold flows so much so you can easily afford to get full stacks of every usable item in the 'game'.  Not that his helps much, as foes do so much damage by mid game that getting hit once or twice can kill you and getting stun locked happens too much.To top it all off, it's maybe only a few hours long.  This is not an early release game or alpha, yet it clearly plays as if it was.  For 2.99 you can do much better.  Even free, in this current state of release, don't bother."

Defeat around 4 or 5 bosses and unlock the gates to the final boss. There is dialogue in this game but it might as well have none since 90% is non-informational and irrelevant to the plot. Wait--there is no plot--nevermind. There were some cool aspects to this game, but it needed more people working on it or something.Also, there are bugs. But for around $1.00, who cares? Nothing too bad.Lastly, I beat the game (thinking I was only in the beginning) and the final boss says ""So you did it..."" or something to that effect. Then I was put to the title screen. I believe anyone could design a game better for $1.00, but I didn't feel I wasted my money.

Even with the fact this game was 25 cents.  The loss of time I could have been playing other games makes it not worth it.1. Leveling doesn't matter. - All creatures level with you, be it the starting rats, or bosses.  They give more xp and more gold every time you level and go to a new screen.  This removes the element of leveling altogether really and frankly I don't understand why you level in this game, other than the fact the maker knows leveling is important some how.2. Story line might exist? - The story line is so lackluster that you could argue there isn't one.  I would argue there isn't one.  This is the best I could come up with for storyline ""I wake/call on your soul to kill the 4 elemental gods and bring them to me""  That is it, there are 5 quests otherwise that sort of vaguely lead you towards your goal and only the frostfire dagger quest is interesting in my opinion.3. Combat is terrible - There are multiple classes and I chose the paladin since I thought it would be neat to block.  There is no block animation and I saw no reason to do it ever.  The cooldown on enemy attacks is so low that the time it takes to block, recover your ""stamina"" to swing makes it so that NO monster makes it viable.  By the end of the game I was killing every creature the exact same as I started with. stand slightly to the left of it and use a weapon with a wider arc then just ahead of me.  This killed everything in the game by just spamming attack.In all honesty I think this was someones first attempt at making a game and for a groundwork attempt its not terrible, however, this should not have been released for public use.  It just lacks everything in every category.  You can see where the ideas got laid down and the creator has potential if they can flesh out the game and do their own thing.However this game is SO bad, NO ONE has written a guide. No one thought the game had enough depth or importance to write how to beat it.  That is how bad it is.  Even if you get this game for free, even if you receive it accidently as part of a pack.Do Not Waste Your Time.Spend your free time doing anything else like watch paint dry.

Unfortunately they were held back by the limits of RPG Maker, which made the game worse than it should have been. An original battle system, but extremely easy to abuse. And while the game wasn’t designed for story purposes, I can’t forget about how uninteresting the characters were, how clichéd the story was and how extremely disappointing the ending was.
