It feels far to abstract and pulp sci-fi for my liking. The terms he uses, the world building he has done... it just dosnt work for me. I loved the hero rise series 'a lot', but this new project by Zach is just... well its disappointing.Story wise its no inspiring at all, and the romance's are simply handed to you, you dont earn them. Far to many muti page narrative dumps, with few choices in between. The whole thing feels padded... with little progress being made. It dosnt feel like anything special happens because my character is one thing or another... at least nothing substantial.The mechanics for this project are more complex then hero rise, but I don't feel thats a good thing in this case. The stats are presented more as a puzzle for achievement's then as a representation of character development.The fact this project was designed specificity to run in series has greatly detracted from the quality as it doesn't feel like a complete story has been told... just the beginning. There is no clear beginning, middle, or end... just a beginning, middle, and to be continued. There was no clean or clear cut achievement the main character accomplished to make a conclusion to this first 'chapter'. It just seemed like ""Well that seem a good place to stop, time to work one book two."".Maybe I'm judging this project to harshly based on Zach's past work, but this one has left me disappointed and uninspired. In fact I ended up only lightly skimming and speeding through the final chapter since I had lost so much interest in the choices I was presented. It just didn't feel satisfying.Take my opinion with a gain of salt though... this story just wasn't my 'thing'. That doesn't mean it won't be yours. Give it a shot if it appeals."

,Not Recommended,396230,17675135,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,Azradun,"Absolutely the weakest interactive novel from this studio that I've played.It is more focused on gender issues than plot, and it shows. The Mysterious Alien Being is shown as transgender for no reason at all, with all the pronouns (Hir, Ze etc.) when NOTHING indicates its gender or lack thereof (based off a single short encounter)! We get to know that the main protagonist had ""freedom to experience their sexuality without restricting gender roles"", that's very profound I think, but boring to mention. I'm to play a game, not entertain in gender studies, thank you. The number of remarks about gender is staggering and off-putting. That's too heavy handed.Plot... revolves around biggest cliches in SciFi ever. Defend your world from aliens, ok. Standard, but sensible. Go to a planet that holds a mysterious mortal combat tournament between Good and Evil where contestants are from all the galaxy. Now, this is cliche, contrived and childish. There was an old He-Man episode with a similar plot, and it was done better. This is the laziest SF cliche of them all, that allows you to show many alien species and interactions between them without all that pesky world building. Including a map of the planet Versus at one point was a mistake, since the locations made me cringe - single castle, single forest, single range of mountains, single love lake in a shape of a heart... I've read Polish communist children books with better maps than that when I was 8. Either make a good map or no map at all.We have flashbacks within flashbacks, game mechanics many times rammed in our face, and later, a wonderful option of buying a cheating DLC, forced on us during the actual game in a dialog. Hint: things like that ruin the immersion a bit. Had I wanted to by the DLC I would, now please gently let me play the game I've already bought.I've enjoyed Choice of the Deathless, Hero of Kendrickstone, Choice of Robots and other games from the same studio.  They had good plot or interesting scenery or great character development and often all of those. This one has gender studies instead, and a silly map suited for a children fairy tale, not a SciFi story. And I enjoy GOOD children fairy tales, mind you, but don't you think profound mentions of ""sexual experiences not restricted by gender roles"" doesn't fit that? Must I tell the author such basics of storytelling, keeping a consistent tone?Tl;dr; Weak and uninspired, avoid. There are much better games from this studio."

As others have pointed out, the worldbuilding seemed hamfisted and awkward, the delivery of the made-up words like ""blerg"" and ""furking"" was anything but seamless (sadly, this problem never improved) and there were tons and tons of exposition drops about stuff that, to be quite frank, I simply didn't care about.With those complaints being noted, however, I did find myself enjoying this a lot more during the second half.  The characters began to grow on me, the writer doing a pretty good job fleshing them out in the end, and I actually enjoyed the political intrigue (despite the narrative hammering in exactly what sort of effects your decisions will have).  The writing also seemed to improve as the story went on, though I may have just gotten used to it.  I only wish the worldbuilding could have been more interesting; to improve as the characters did over time -- though, there were some cool aspects of it that caught my interest near the end.  I'm hopeful the writer will follow up on those and build upon them in future installments.Overall, I did enjoy myself with this, but take my ""recommendation"" with a grain of salt.  This certainly isn't without problems, and if you don't think you have the patience to get through the subpar first half, then I'd say this isn't really worth your time."

,Not Recommended,396230,17667183,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,Faustitas,"There's alot about this game I didn't like. The game's premise included stealing powers and invading thoughts, but in practice that felt lackluster. There were very few powers to absorb and they didn't feel like I'd gained anything when I did it. In fact it led to 'memorywalking' which led me on a story within a story, rather than the one I bought. A story within a story I had a hard time caring for because it was told as a dream rather than your action. In a dream I wasn't a person crafting or even participating in a story. I felt like someone viewing someone else's story. In fact even the story outside of the dream felt that way, being tugged along by other characters. Your character didn't feel like he gained anything from his power to absorb, he starts with the power to shoot lazers of all things. He is an alien, and that made it harder for me to like him, especially when him and everyone else because his writing involved so many new words and lingo and ideals that I didn't really connect with. The choices in the game didn't feel like they mattered; even my characters body and gender and even my name felt ignored. I believe my character was called Princy more often than the name I gave him and by my characters in game pet as that. The pet is something I didn't get to choose anything about, and in the middle of the game i was prompted to pay a dollar for DLC so it could give me hints. The game ends what feels abruptly, in the middle of its story, and with a premise similar to the 2nd book in the author's other trilogy, which I feel a hard time being interested in, especially if there are several months of waiting between playing each book and whatever book comes after."
,Recommended,396230,17672456,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,Noobster,"Honestly, this game was confusing at first but I enjoyed it as story progresses.The game has interesting premise and original world setting. Although most of the time the words does not make any sense, the writing has been interesting enough to keep hooked. The game mechanic is complex at first but can be get used to with the help of Rosae and occasional peek at the stats. The political aspects of the game is very intriguing and exciting. Kind of disappointed the game is just the beginning of series as the game is hard to be grasped on at first and as we getting used to it, the game ends. It has long hours of gameplay so very worth of the price.I would like to suggest adding character potraits either fan made or by the author as most of the time the character description is hard to imagine how they look.Although most choose-your-own-adventurers need to tend to their own imagination,  I still cannot imagine how disgusting Empress of Blots looks maybe too much description of the characters is a turn down. Either that or my imagination is not good enough.So this is the best Choice of Games release till date beating Heroes Rise Trilogy Choice of Robots,Slammed and many more.

The first hour or so is spent on nothing but throwing made up names at you and very abstract poorly explained sci-fi things. The story can't move forward because they constantly try and fail to explain things like some kind of a Communist society where everyone is forced to think and feel the same  and everything being made of mirrors as a metaphor...because. It doesn't explain what species the main character is supposed to be, what kind of a planet they are on or anything of that sorts.It's simply weird and not very coherent. Almost as if this all was randomly generated.They use made up pronouns like ''ze'' and it comes off incredibly forced. As if they have some sort of a mandatory tumblr propaganda quota to fulfill. Weird pronouns - check. All soldiers are female - check. Men are medics - check. Socialist themes - check. It's another one of these."

76561198001600751,Recommended,396230,17700938,"Posted: 24 August, 2015",all,serban1703 (Vash),"Tl;dr Great story, characters, setting and theme. 9/10 (The 10 was taken by Choice of Robots)I like the story, the characters and the setting. I found the story to be engaging with the world explained well when the story deemed it necessary. Some of the complaints I have seen mentioned the lack of explanations but I will say that none of the information is actually lacking but provided over the course of the story and in amounts that add to the story and not needlessly side-track you with overinformation. Long story short, the story approaches a lot of topics, one of the biggest being self-understanding and reflection (at least in my perspective) and while I don't want to touch on the others because spoilers, I want to say that it does so in a very open but not obtrusive manner. Some consider it a bit too pushy on certain topics but, again, I think it makes sense within both the story itself as well as the day and age we live in.As for the ""made up"" words, I found them to actually add to the story. The vast majority made sense and most of them added to the descriptions of their various owners. Also, they are almost all names and some being adjectives. They were worked very well into the story and descriptions and I never found myself confused by any of it. My one objection to the wording are the blergs. They're meant to susbstitute the words we'd normally use to describe frustration or anger (think damn or the more colorful companion). I found them way overused and at times distracting, especially since they didn't flow very well into my own reading process.The choices seemed much more significant than in the author's previous titles (namely Heroes Rise: The Prodigy). They have the feeling of importance and impact and each one give off a sense of uniquenss. The story seems to be much more affected by these choices and some of the choices I found to be quite hard to make.The romances seem much better integrated and seem to flow very well from character to character. There have been complaints that they seemed to be handed down but I disagree. Think of it this way. You meet someone of the gender (or whatever) you're interested in who happens to be good looking. You might think that you might want something more than just a friend and might ask that person out. Conversely you could not. That's how I feel the interest works in a sense. Either you're interested in more than just knowing the person (when you meet that person) or you're not and you could be friendly, indifferent or outright hostile. I think it works well within a more carnal, lusty type of deal, at least at the beginning. There are a couple of points that I found forced, but I'd rather not go into those for the sake of spoilers. At the same time they made sense to me due to the circumstances and natures of the characters (or at least to-that-point know nature of the characters)The last thing some complaints have touched on was the seeming needless gender fluidity. While I find the pronouns for the gender-neutral...gender?...a bit distracting, they're the same as the ones seen in Heroes Rise and again they actually make sense, if they are a bit hard to get adjusted to at first. Some compliants have suggested that the entire issue is over-long and forced but I think in a story that is quite vocal toward self-understanding and reflection, the way this is presented might make one ponder their own beliefs about such things. There is a lot of pondering that could result from this story, especially as it touches on many great topics (in my opinion of course).Overall, it's a great interactive novel that I would very readily recommend. Great story, great characters and a very good setting as well as very interesting topics and execution."
,Not Recommended,396230,24367206,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,karlnp,"This is one of the most ineptly written things I have ever read. The author's other works are highly rated, so I assume it's more due to inexperience with the genre than anything else, but the fake swear words are annoying, the names of planets and people are thoughtless, crudely generated (example: ""Blarfngard"", robots come from ""Binaria""), and almost literally unbelievable. It reads like a farce or unintentional parody of Choice of Games' titles, and I was very surprised to find out that it wasn't something more akin to ""The Naked Gun"" than Mass Effect. The ""political maneuvering"" has more in common with Mad Libs than anything else, given how you're literally presented with a checklist of how to proceed if you want to support one side or another.Not only that, it reads like an outline that was only fleshed out until the author got bored with the whole endeavour. Not only *that* but it ends on a cliffhanger. I have more objections but my opinion is clear and I want to stop wasting my time with anything related to this game."

It starts with a cold opening filled with nonsense terms and jargon, then proceeds into a flashback having told you nothing about the story, world or characters.The game is littered with invented words and terminology that are closer to a child’s attempts to pronounce words they misheard, than they are to phrases a living culture would develop. Cluttered with pseudo-English as if changing a vowel would adequately express how alien and new these things and concepts are meant to be. This problem is then exacerbated by the authors insistence on using the relatively unknown gender neutral pronouns Ze / Hir, incorrectly I might add seeing as their used in reference to a characters physical sex as well their completely unknown (as in our characters merely assume this) gender.It then proceeds to brush off the magnitude of an alien landscape with our characters (who early on express their desire to see the world beyond their narrow horizons, having never before travelled the stars) strolling into alien buildings, habitats and situations as if they were down at the market buying vegetables. Should we not be amazed at this, and there by proxy, we the reader/player feel some sense of imaginative thrill?But the crowning achievement on this monolith of unpleasantness is the unfolding character interactions. For you see, I had the Gall, the Nerve to try to play as a morally honest character who was also rebellious! The scandal, every time I picked an option that was deemed ""honest"" (by the author flagging that as the ""honest"" choice) I was immediately informed by the game that I was doing it wrong. For you see I the player am a mere spectator, how dare I try to impose my narrative on the writers scenario.The reason for this was that as a morally honest character, I was opposed to the blatantly evil feudal lords set up as the early adversary. I selected a character goal of disbanding this corrupt organisation, picturing my character as a being who held all lives as equal and worthy. But this goal (the game later informed me) required me to support certain characters, and believe in subterfuge and dishonesty.Which was why my character was chastised by the game (not a character, a meta-narrative construct) for daring to challenge another character who was attempting to trick someone who trusted them, into dying for them. A character literally described as a God, was trying to trick their loyal subjects into fighting a pointless battle they couldn't win, by lying to them. What was a morally upstanding character like mine to do?To then rub salt in the wound, as the game continued to tell me how I was playing it wrong (Hah!), all my characters subsequent dialogue with those involved in my goal of bringing down the ridiculously villainous bad-guys, was phrased with my undying obeisance as I decried my foolishness for deciding that I wished to be a Morally upstanding ""Rebel""."

The stats are very in-depth, the relationship mechanics are very complex, and it even has images embedded into the game, something which I believe very few other CoG games have.Unfortunately, VERSUS' plot and characters is where it all goes to hell. I can understand that some or even many people would delight at the concept - Individuals taken from a gamut of different worlds around the galaxy to fight in some kind of strange, mysterious tournament. For me, however, the whole thing feels like it was written by an amateur high school ""author"" who thinks that combining twelve different genres into one is super cool. The problem with this game, then, is an issue of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Combining two or even three genres at once is viable for some creators, even if it is an exceedingly difficult task to do properly. Combining as many genres together as VERSUS does, though, just results in a chaotic mix where the game really doesn't seem to have any idea what it wants to be at any given moment. Sci-fi? Fantasy? Mystery? Action? Cyberpunk? Steampunk?

I have read and purchased many of Choice of Games interactive novels, the most recent being the Heroes Rise Trilogy.  Heroes Rise immersed me into a wonderful story line full of twists, turns, and an entire rollercoaster of possibilities.VERSUS brings forth a sense of customization, while keeping the reader immersed in the world.  Giving you choice of name, gender (or lack their of), and sexual/romantic preference, this interactive novel truly gives the reader a further connection to the story: it allows the reader to place their personal identity into their hero.This interactive novel also gives the reader philisophical choices paired with their personal agendas.  Was your hero raised under strict religion and views, but feels that fate has destined them to explore beyond their community limitations?  Or is your hero a hot-headed renegade, prepared to take on the world despite their homeworld's strict raisings?  Is your hero one that finds themselves suddenly captivated by an alien goddess?  Or does the idea of knowledge overpower the idea of possbile romance?I hadn't a clue where VERSUS would take me, but I found myself torn between two opposing teams with equal rhyme and reason, debating my views on secular purpose, and coming to terms with what was morally right, given extreme circumstances.If you have a few hours to spare, immerse yourself in the world of VERSUS.

But the author created 3 games to complete the ""Heroes Rise"" series so can probably be relied upon to complete this saga as well, if we keep buying it, as IMO it deserves.

Which is awesome!-I originally thought the premise was a bit simple, but during the course of the game the plot evolves and turns out to be incredibly involved and expansive, offering many different ways to build your own motivations.-Speaking of that, there are a large number of axis to build your characters up on for a huge amount of replayability.-You get a map, this is minor but I love when I'm offered a map. It helps me immerse myself.-The stats page gives you the choice to access it again at any time along with all information you may need if you leave the game for a while before coming back.Cons:-People who have played the HR series may find one or two interactions a bit too familiar. Minor spoiler example:Oli looking into your head and being able to choose that you're thinking a little saucy reminds me a lot of one of the earliest Black Magic interactions.Still loved it though, but just a warning.-Sometimes I look at options and I can't figure out which one is supposed to apply to what skill. I see 3 options that all seem aggressive but I'm not playing an aggressive character so I felt kinda screwed. (Though it said I gained the highest score I could have at the end so it wasn't a huge impact)."

Stuff like that should either be included, not included or left upto the mod community, not a £1 add-on for a £2 game.Other than that I really enjoyed the game/story. Your character is fairly 'customizeable' (sexuality, gender, name, I think skin colour too) which includes variable genders. I ran with the normal man that loves women, but spoiler alert; my character didn't care when his love interest was 'intersex' which I loved.My only other titbit was that there was no clear indication this game was part of a new series. I've played 'Choice of Robots' and 'Choice of the Deathless' before and neither were part of a series so I didn't expect this one to be."

It has to be one of the best adventure novel pieces I have ever picked. The story draws you in, giving you a look into a totally new and original galaxy with interesting beings and politics. The characters are well thought out and widely different, it is hard to choose who your favorite is and why. Similarly, such things can be said for the romances, which I found myself conflicted upon picking between any one character. Every choice has a consequence and it is very easy, yet also challenging, to paint yourself as any singular sort of being. Are you a manipulative and evil jerk bent on achieving his own desires? Are your decisions based on love, or a singular political focus? I won't divulge anything about the story itself, spoilers would be heart breaking when considering such a interesting piece of work. The only reason I hesitate on giving it a full ten stars is simply due to my desire to see the romances flushed out just a little more. But, hey, that is my own pickiness showing, I due tend to favor handsome characters and sweet words. Try it out, you will probably like it.~"

Everything tends to have an ""exotic"" name that's just one letter removed from a common adjective or object name it is like.  It's the sort of thing where you meet a rabbit-like alien creature, and it turns out it's called a ""Vunny Vabbit"", or something.  The abomination that dominates as a villain's name is ""Bominate"", for example.There are far more decisions here than most games, but they tend to be in two categories: Action decisions and ""what you think"" decisions.Action decisions are fairly cut-and-dry, and are based around your stats, both relying upon and empowering stats.  You have ""forceful"" versus ""cunning"" (preference for direct versus indirect confrontation), ""weapons"" versus ""abilities"" (technology versus superpowers), and different absorption energy levels, but which one you pick doesn't seem to mater so much as whether you pick themconsistentnly.  Whether you take weapons or abilities, technical skill absorption or agility absorption, you're going to be flying, it's just a matter of whether the text says it's with a jetpack or a flight superpower.  It's like being drowned in multiple layers of the standard good/evil karma meter: You just pick one and keep picking it's options until the end of the game, taking away from the impact of choices by making them all equally viable, just for different playthrough paths.The ""what you think"" decisions are much more nebulous, and seem to do little but push up a ""growth"" meter of unexplained purpose.  The game asks you constantly for what you think about some concept or person or what you want to set as a goal, but then someone busts in, teleports you out, or throws some other deus ex machina at you before these choices can impact anything.  The system seems to be there to punish ""inconsistent"" answers, but at the same time, encourage ""growth in your viewpoint"" as the game reveals more information to you.The plot is one of those somewhat annoying types of mysteries where all the mysteries would largely be solved if you just asked the right questions, but the prompts never let you, and all your conversations are 3 minutes long before shoving you into some new, arbitrary crisis half-cocked, asking you to just make a blind assumption, and hoping you're right.This is exacerbated by the fact that there are multiple concurrent plots in this game that have little to no overlap - that elite courte intrigue that's part of the game's main selling points has only the most tenuous connections with the blot plotline the game starts with, or the android-human war you launch into after that.  The plots have totally different actors, backstories, and even planets the characters come from, and you can't ask characters from one plot for help understanding the other plots.To a degree, this seems to be a result of how the game handles the vast interation of possible choice combinations - they keep the plot from branching into geometric plotlines by just putting the results of your choices in one plot on hold while you get shoved into the next, unrelated plot.  I can understand the reasoning, but I can't help but see it as a weakness of the whole scripted dialogue branching choices genre, as it weakens the story as a whole.Essentially, instead of having one long plot, you have three short plots, where the only actual divergence in the relatively linear story comes at the very end when plots all finally crash together... right before a ""To Be Continued."" Yeah, there's a yet-unreleased sequel, and nothing but the achievements being layed out chronologically hints that you're about to run out of game.This hurts the replayability, as well: You have some choices to make that are flavorful and welcome, but then the only real way to play differently (or get the other achievements) is to purposefully make the characters you romanced last time hate you this time. Achievement-hunting basically counteracts the value of playing to express yourself, because you are required to befriend everyone, romance everyone you can, and make everyone hate you, while also going against your previous choices for weapons versus abilities. It's just busywork for cheevos, and that's probably why so few people get them, in spite of it being rather quick and easy to get them. Contrast this with Choice of Robots, which offers completely different vignettes for different character romances, and wholly different chapters for different specializations.Also to be noted is this game's ludicrous level of customizable sexuality. You can play as a transgendered or intersex character who is attracted to male, female, or androgenous characters, and have an androgenous lover, or an android one.  Of course, you still get the option to just say you're a straight man or woman and the game respects that, too."

I say it's ambitious because the ending will show you how large this game could become. Without spoiling anything I'll simply say that the way the game is going there seems to be the potential to go into about 20ish episodes easily. It took me about 7 hours to get through this one so all together, that is a LOT of game potential.However if the game doesn't get enough support then I don't think this will have a satisfying end, so that could be a major downer for some.If you haven't played the other choice of game stories, I recommend the choice of robots the most.

One suggestion I would like to make is that some of the choices you make don't seem to affect the writing as much as it should. Sometimes it seems like the story is responding to something other than the choice you chose. With that being said, the amount of adaptability is still really good, but can be polished a bit more."

It's full of detail and mystery and its great fun to go along with the flow of the story and influnece the events in usual multiple choice gameplay.The story in this series does somewhat pleasantly remind me of Flash Gordon and some of the older pulp sci-fi stories I used to watch/read. It's certainly different from what you usually get, but that's what makes it so great.As far as multiple choice adventures go, I'd say this is one of the better ones and while its only the first part of a longer series, it's quite entertaining and promises even more fascinating reveals in the future installments."

This is the second 'Choice of' games I've played, the other being Choice of Robots, and I must say this holds up the same high standard. I enjoyed the world, or rather, worlds, that the writer created and I believe many other sci-fi and fantasy fiction fans would too. The characters, abilities and decisions are numerous and fun, and I definitely cannot wait for the second installment if and when it becomes available. However, there is one complain I must state. There are certain points in the game where you're given the option of a decision, and the game literally tells you ""Option A WILL lead you to path A, option B to B etc"". Now, this might not be a big deal for some. You might know the direction you want to take, and want to know which is the optimum path for it, however I felt like the game was coddling us, holding our hands. I believe you should have to use your imagination and foresight to think ""Well, if I act like this, the events should end up like this..."" and try to figure it out for yourself. Sure, some explanations of how the stats and politics work can be good, however I believe that the writer went  a little too far with their help, as it did lower the level of enjoyment for me.Still, the game was very enjoyable overall, and I will definitely perform more runthroughs and keep up with the series."

Because of the the nature of the plot there is an unfortunate tendency for info dumps.2. The author clearly has strong political opinions and these have heavily influenced their work, while this is not necessarily a bad thing anyone who isn't a SJW/able to enjoy fiction from a different political perspective may not enjoy this story for that reason.Now for the good;1. The writing is solid.2. The characters feel well fleshed out and diverse.3.

The story seems to be setting up to be rather long and complex which means it could be years before we actually get to the end.  Your character comes from a culturally isolated world and one of the most important things it tracks, though it has little impact in this game, is Growth; your ability to understand and adapt to new cultures.  Lots of deep issues teased her such as the nature of divinity and what it means to be sapient.  Some of the naming conventions are a bit weird though I imagine that this was largely done to show just how different some species and cultures are from each other.This game's biggest flaw is that it teases so many things but doesn't really have the time to get into one thing in any real depth.  It lacks a traditional climax which, once the series is complete, may not matter  but can have you feeling a little hollow as a stand-alone game.  As a setup chapter though it is top notch and I can't wait to see where the story and existential distinctions go."

Without the use of such language, I do believe the story would falter in its enjoyability. It immediately feels alien, unknown, which presents the reader with a myriad of emotions; the most potent of which being a sense of impending adventure. I enjoyed the story quite a lot, and the characters were beyond intriguing. I'm looking forward to all future installments of the series.There are a few minor grammatical errors throughout, but if you look beyond these and into your own imagination, you'll find this story rather unputdownable.There's room for improvement, that's for certain, but it is definitely one of these most enticing stories to have been released by CoG, and certainly boasts of an interesting cast of characters.All-in-all, I give it an 8.5/10."

,Recommended,396230,19833437,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Cos-moS,"I want to make it clear first: yes, Steam shows I havn't played this game for long. It is because I played this on my tablet. I only bought the game on Steam because I was shocked that the game is receiving this many of bad votes, and I'd like to give my evaluation. Of course, everyone has their rights to dislike a game, I am just here to say that, in my opinion, this is a great choose-your-own-adventure game.===========================TL;DR version:If you want to grab a quick read for your toilet & public transport time, no this one is not for you, because the plot and the writing don't allow a semi-attentive reader to fully apprehend and appreciate this novel. But if you are tired of all the shallow bull-sh*t Choice of Games sometimes pull out, and want to enjoy a REAL novel. This one definitively is worth considering!And BTW, the ingame ""optinal payment content"" is not necessary at all. Basically it gives you some reminder like ""Previously, you have chosen the Strategy A, so now, if you want to be coherent, you should consider the choice that stay in the same line.""============================================================First thing first. Some people giving negative review were complaining about the confusing plot or/and the universe created by the author. It is an ""understandable"" opinion, IF you just want a quick short-novel to read while in the toilets. Because this novel is NOT a ""toilet read"". It tries to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ create a Sci-Fi universe!!! And of course, all novels like this (ranging from Tolkien's to Asimov's novels) take chapters and chapters to establish themselves. The author of Versus tries to condense all the necessary informations & background in an efficient way, and for me, he succeeded. You just need to set yourself confortable and enjoy the read slow and nice. Because yes, as the informations are very dense, if you try to read this as a transport pass-time, it will be hard to grasp all the subtleties.As for the plot, it is one of the best plot I've ever seen in all my readings with Choice Of Games' interactive novels. I honestly dislike the previous trilogy of the same author (Hero Rise etc...), but I hugely appreciate this one: the choices I make truly give my the feeling of shaping the destiny of my character. And contrary to a lot of similar interactive novels which often tend to have really shallow plots, this one actually succeeded to build up the intrigue. This novel had me several times to stop and think ""waite a minuit, does this mean that XXX is trying to... But what if...."" whereas for most interactive novels, you just see the actions & motives of each character cristal clear. For me, this makes the novel a huge enjoyment. For some... I guess this may be qualified as ""hard to follow"" if they don't pay attention to details...For me, it is best COYA novel Choice of Games had published so far. Before this, I'd rate Choice of Robots at top, but this novel just has so much more depth and perspectives. I am marveled by the universe built by the author. It is interesting and inspring like the TRUE Sci-Fi novels where you can glimpse thoughts about sociology, ethics and belief in every imaginary alien society that the author creates. The only regret I have is that, at several occasions, I'd like to have more choices: the given choices didn't correspond too well to what I'd like to behave. But I guess it's impossible for an interactive novel to cover and foresee all the options..."

Expect space unicorns (there are no space unicorns).- Unlike the Heroes Rise series, this is more episodic (Indeed the devs point this out at the end of the game). By this it is meant that it is like an episode of a TV series, thus incomplete.- A lot of new lingo to understand. It's fed to you with narrative dumps, so be careful when going in. Also some xirhir going on, take that as you will.- The story will jump around a lot (one minute you are in Camelot and the other you are chasing the Holy Grail, next you are Robin Hood).- Like the Heroes series you are very much nudged in the direction of becoming a specific archetype, thus there is perhaps less roleplaying and more ""what choice is x or y archetype"".- Plenty of romance options, you can bang guys, gals, goddesses, chicks with♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(hearts, huge hearts). At the same time if you want to. Not robots though, but you can romance one.- Full character customization as usual (except last name). It does not have a major impact (since the story tailors characters to you), but it's there.My personal opinion:Let me start by saying I think this is a good title, and I did want more after I finished it. I personally don't mind the episodic feel to it, but once you finish it then it is certainly evident. It does not close up the plot as neatly as the Heroes Rise series did, but it is not meant to. Personally I am fine with that, I'm a sucker for episodic content, but you should probably keep in mind if you are as well, or at least know what you are getting into here.The writing is generally good and while the author does use a lot of new terms and smashes you with them, then it does serve to paint their world as fundamentally other. It's not Earth, it's a universe of humanoids. Generally these terms makes sense by themselves and with the context that they are used. For me it's not too difficult to understand, though some might object.I am not hugely experienced with ""Choice of"" games, but I have binged a lot on them this Christmas (I think I've emptied Steam of them by now), but I am uncertain as to how much choice you really have in this game. Perhaps the best way to explain the choice you do have in this game is to say the devil is in the details. By that I mean that you will not stop this train no matter what you do, but you may have conversations with people on this train, choose how to conduct yourself and indeed who to save from its impending doom. So huge choices? No. Small choices? Plenty. And if you like details then almost no choice is meaningless.As mentioned above the author does push you towards archetypes, which you might be familiar with from the Heroes Rise series. It really does streamline your choices, responses and so on. I'm uncertain whether I think this is good or bad. In the grand scheme of things it really does limit your choices, but on the other hand it does make for replaybility as the game is focused around these four archetypes. Your game as an honest status quo guy will unfold differently than one as a manipulative rebel. Ultimately I think these archetypes are necessary to give a good narrative as the game will know how to respond to you based on them, which is good I think.The romances... they're alright, but I'll be honest... There is too little talk going on between all of them to really be considered romances (I think anyhoo). They're more like a date and a hookup. I hope we'll see them grow though. I do like that, apparently, you are able to pursue several romances at the same time. What can I say, my completionist nature makes me greedy.Also you cannot romance Prodigal, Chicken. That's the one true black mark on this game."

So what do you do?Whatever the hell you want.With this game you feel every choice, every pull, every push, all as if they were the beats of your own heart. This game allows you to control your method of fighting, of political interaction, of social interaction, of romantic intent, of anything and everything. You are the player, the player is you. A unique twist to this one is that, instead of giving you clear, consise choices, it lets you do whatever you want. The kicker is the subtle rewards of doing something. If you are rather ruthless, the game rewards more ruthlessness. If you use your abilities a lot, you may find yourself rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a weapon. If you act like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ you probably will be rewarded for other actions that are similarly cuntlike. I don't know, I'm not a♥♥♥♥♥♥ But you might be.And it's OK.So c'mon people, lets keep signal boosting these games. Especially this one.I want to give it good to Breeze in the sequel."

So many different factions, planets, races, concepts and more all thrust upon the player at the same time, making it all a bit difficult to digest at your pace, so to speak.
