,Recommended,396260,21852929,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,H3X,"This is a fast arcade like game, similar to Zombies Ate my Neighbors.Pros:Lots of levels with randomized goal areas for pizza dropsMany unique upgradesVariety of unique enemiesVery rewarding for good movement (Faster pizza delivery gives more money)Cons:I played for about half an hour with my arrows keys and my fingers are exhausted. When you get superspeed it becomes even more intense. You really should play this with a controller or joystickThere's a boss that isn't really explained how to beat and you just run around confused as to how you kill him. You'll easily make it back to him thoughMy main gripe is the kamikaze enemies that do massive damage. They might kill even if you have the 420 health upgrade but I'm not sure, they're just not very fun.EDIT: I'd really like a pause button and to be able to run the game in windowed mode but there are no options to do so"

I'm the kind of guy that likes to plod through games killing everything and exploring every pixel. With World's Fastest Pizza I take a deep breath and plunge in to total mayhem. Get in, get out and stop stuffing around.The game markets itself on being proudly Aussie... well, just like in Oz, everything you encounter in the game is pretty much going to either bite you or sting you and it ALWAYS hurts. Then, unexpectedly, you can get an easy,short break. Did I say short? Who am I kidding? Let your guard down and something will crawl up your trouser leg before you can count the correct change.I have no doubt this will be the kind of game I will come back to time and time again. Brilliant."

Soundtrack is terrible, breaking glass broke my ears, massive lag problems when something is hitting your character. Game wants you to grind money in 3 missions at a time and thats annoying as hell."

I still remember the first time I had to run screaming for my car under a hurricane of gunfire.--SERIOUSLYTHO--World's Fastest Pizza could be alternately titled World's Fastest Game. A gameplay session is a stitched-together series of exercises in progressive superpowered madness: you deliver pizza, you deliver pizza while moving at the speed of sound, you deliver pizza at the speed of sound while setting everything on fire, etc.The only downside is that it seemed much too small, and short. After merely an hour, I felt as if I had seen every power-up and level type, and the music was starting to get just a bit repetitive.The thing was, I didn't really care. I was busy laughing my head off as I drilled a mole burrow through a hapless homeowner's windows and furniture because I'M GONNA DELIVER YOUR PIZZA DAMMITAmusing to pick up, play, and put down. For anything more, I might hesitate, but for only three dollars, consider adding it to your library."

Everything about it has that australian humour like the Police now targeting signs and the Koala powerup, I have no idea what it does but I had a good laugh with that.Pros:Cheap priceGreat gameAussie made (Perth! :D)Very addicting""here's your pizza""""burn the witch!""Cons:I got stuck outside the map on the very first levelAudio levels could be brought down a little on some things"

Some people will see similarities in game play like Hotline Miami or the Original GTA mainly because of the top down view but instead of having to kill anyone or etc, It's simply get out of the car, find the delivery point, drop it off and get out. Provides many lols, Its worth a whirl, I liked it.Made a short instagram video for it -->https://www.instagram.com/p/BDDUD4kNj2o/?taken-by=championgamersnatchSo yeah, good work lads. :)"
,Recommended,396260,33631798,Posted: 18 July,all,Clone,"The Hotline Miami of pizza delivery. Kind of a one trick pony. I would not pay more than $2 for it, but it is a fun and ridiculous arcade experience. Mix bullethell and Crazy Taxi with the terror that is the Australian Suburbs and you get World's Fastest Pizza. Race around random neighborhoods during ""happy hour"" dodging gunfire and explosions, being chased by a rabid dog, to deliver the hottest pies in town, then sneak into a dungeon and follow the blood trails to deliver a last-meal to those being held there - leave them to enjoy their pizzas and get out, then drop off your last meatlovers to a peaceful, sober man in the quitest neighborhood Sydney. A truly absurd game."

I think what I'm trying to say is this game is great but you may end up crashing your car."
