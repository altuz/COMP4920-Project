Have at it.LocoSoccer is a hilariously low-quality physics game. The enjoyment of it is in its simplicity and the stupidity that happens on most plays. For a buck, you can't go wrong but if you're really careful with your money and feel a dollar isn't worth the risk, look up the browser-based game Soccer Physics and give that a go as it's a much shorter version of the same concept. Where that is a 1-minute game, LocoSoccer ups the ante with a full on 5 minutes of gameplay per match with a team of 5.Contrary to some of the other reviews, you can switch players if you happen to read the controls (which are really like 4 buttons. I literally play this one handed)."

I think that if it came out 20 years ago it would be an arcadey cult classic, but in this stage of video game development it's not there at all.If you want to buy a derpy game for your child to play while you go do something, or if you want a funny game to show your friends, go for it. But it's not worth any more than its price tag."

The store page didn't look like much, But the reviews mostly pointed to a hilarious experience so I take a chance and buy this game..Upon getting past the settings interface doubtingly setting the graphics to 'fantastic' in a tongue-in-cheek sort of manner I play my first round.. Couldn't figure out how to move my guys and noticed the AI bots cheat on easy (Using SHIFT to spin around). Finally learn to move ONE set of guys, Lost 7-0.Second match, Managed to figure out how to switch to my other team of guys using the number keys.. Figure out how to use SHIFT correctly, Win 9-4.Third round after buying some novelty stuff with my pitiful winnings, Found out I can get all four of my guys AND the goaler to shove the entire opposing team, AND their ball down the field. After a furious struggle of tug-of-war we pushed everyone AND the ball in the goal and won 8-3.Prognosis: Best one dollar I ever spent.My only complaints are the backround sound loops badly (Needs to be cut seamless) and has random disjointed voices of people talking. Likely recorded, And the lack of some method of making your own parts shirts or heads, And no online multiplayer. Despite the few flaws though and an 'unpolished' feel that some more serious gamers might avoid this is hilarious fun, Especially if you take the time to set up keyboard/joypad or joypad/joypad local play.9/10. Looking forward to the PS4 mega HD director's cut limited edition preorder collectible metal tin-and-biscuit remake."

It's more of a joke than an actual game.Normally I'd say that if they fix the glitches the game would be a lot better but I just dont think theres a foundation here for a great game.

I mean this game doesnt really tell you all the controlls... I kinda wouldn't kinda do I kinda like this game but on the other side Not really.. For people who like very stressful games.. I MEAN SERIOUSLY I JUST GOT THIS AND I CANT EVEN CHANGE TO MY GOALIE NOR MY OTHER PLAYERS I MEAN REALLY DID U ADD THOSE IN FOR MORE STRESS BECUASE THE NPC'S CAN USE THE GOALIE THATS BULL******EDIT** Just fix that and tell us how to switch to our goalie and our other teammates because i swearits Stressful.***EDIT*** So im here again I read the disc bellow and it said how to change the group and its numpad (Why Numpad? i never use it). The NPC's are very fishy like they are cheating they seem to always want the ball out of bounds when its on their side the Controlls are okay, The gameplay is not very good but its a start I bought this game when it came out so its pretty buggy the NPC's or even me the Ball gets stuck in between our feet like we are a robot rolling around as a wheel for a soccer ball which is silly but you need to fix it and more people will like this game (P.S. This game is like the Impossible game to win)****EDIT**** I am getting better and better and the spinning mechanic helps me. This is a short edit because i haven't found much more glitches.*****EDIT***** Okay this is not like a impossible to win game when you get the hang of it. When you do good you get more effectiveness the more you lose the less effective this game is a great time waster to do when your bored! I will highly suggest this game now! He finally updated it and we get to see trading cards. Any stuff like that anybody who see this review, you know I love this game now!******EDIT****** I love the Customization in this game its silly it brings out such memes Like Spoderman and Bobo Punk. He added Bobo Punk 2 now and I love it. Still You should really get this.Play it for a while get used to it. It'll be fun I betcha. If your reading this all, Appreciate it if you do, You will understand what I like and love about this game and I might make more edits throughout. I'm the longest comment and I just love this game. So peace out until the next edit guys!"

Boy was I wrong.While it has the Soccer Physics feel and hilarity, it sets itself away from SP by enabling the player to control 5 players on one team. Once I learned how to play and started the campaign, I was laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off. Totally worth it.Though the Tutorial was a bit tough, but, since there's no game mechanics, the game itself would be very hard. This whole game is just luck, but god damn, is it fun!10/10 would make a video about it."
