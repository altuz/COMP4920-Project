76561197972230444,Recommended,396480,22262160,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Traeba,"There are many who have compared this game to FTL. As a very passional FTL veteran (well over 1000 hours played), I would agree with this relationship - it's clear that elements of this game are inspired by FTL: the sector-hopping map, asteroid & nebula sectors, friendly & enemy battlestations (at least in the advanced edition of FTL), scrap as a commodity - and most importantly, the overall story arc of attempting to save a galaxy by ""making-it"" to the end of a series of maps and defeating a final enemy (although here, with less of a predictable cast of characters).However, the perspective is certainly different. While in FTL, I commanded a single ship through various comical hurdles, becoming quite attached to my mighty mantis raiders and my lone zoltan who never got to leave the engine room. they leveled up, my ship gained dynamically altering augmentations, and I was responsible for everything from the timing of my glaive beam shot to ordering my stoic rockman to get out of a room that had been vented to open space.Here, I am no longer a captain - I am the admiral of a triumvirate of starfaring vessels, built up painstakingly from skirmishes and pitched battles. I can't control individual crew members, because my responsibility is so much greater - I command squadrons of fighters, damn it, and the lives of tens of thousands of human crew surge forth and fall back on my word. FTL was the voyage of the USS Enterprise across regions of brave unknown; in Battlestation, I am the Grand Admiral Thrawn, falling like the fist of an angry god upon an enemy battlestation who dares to encroach upon the domain of Man. When my Capital Ship Armada fires the first salvo of death rays (yes, a Master of Orion inspired element) , and twin Esquishal-class heavy assault carriers burst through the firery cataclysm that remains of the first enemy vessel to rain waves of elite bombers and laser cannon drones upon the enemy starbase, I contain the awesome power of a fully operational starfleet!So... in short. I like to think of FTL and BS:H as, in a way, sister games. Each complements the other in ways that they can't fulfill alone. Buy it today!"

It very much shows it's mobile game roots in it's lack of depth, emphasis on grinding and short-form gameplay. While the game seemed to be, on the surface at least, a game with much in common with FTL, they're really not all that alike.Battlestation Harbinger mainly falls short in it's lack of depth in ship customization and upgrades. Unlike FTL, wherein your ship can start as a poorly armed, fragile transport and then by the end of a run be a battlecruiser that makes even the bravest captain in the best-armed dreadnaught shake in his boots, Harbinger's ships really only upgrade in the firepower department. There is an emphasis on building up your fleet to bigger and tougher ships over time, but high-end ships are vastly expensive and as such upgrades come in single huge leaps, rather than gradually. This leaves you at the mercy of a bad encounter bringing a fleet of middling ships to a swift end, with just a few dozen scrap needed for your next big upgrade.This would be mitigated if you could start with a single high-end ship, but unfortunately the starting ships are locked behind a grindy and honestly pointless leveling system. There's a series of other small, nagging issues, from being forced to buy ships blind mid-run with no way to preview their equipment node layouts before purchase, to game balance being all over the place, starting off reasonable but very quickly ramping up to insanely difficult craft far faster than your upgrades can keep pace with.All in all, the game's sole saving grace is it's price point. Good for a few hours of entertainment, but far from the soul-sucking obsession other rogue-lites can be. If you've yet to play FTL, or even it's mods(Captain's Edition mod may as well be official for how good it is), get that instead. If you've played several hundred hours of FTL and want something similar, maybe give this a go, but don't expect the same kind of compelling experience."

Having put a few hours into the game I do not think those comparisons are warranted. Unless I am missing something there is nothing that keeps you from simply retreating and returning to any conflict as many times as you like so it is not really all that rougelike and the most strategic decision I make in most battles is how to maximize my starting distance from the enemies. It is not a braindrain and the need to precisely target enemies is just not there, So not like FTL, but I still really like it.Most games I feel like I can get into the developer's heads and figure out what I am supposed to do, but this game is not one of them. I do not understand the ship progression at all. I feel like the number 11-13 ships are way better than the number 21 ship for example. When you jump to a new sector you cannot neccessarily see if anyone else is jumping into it and this can result in massive ambushes that you have to run away from, so there are plenty of situations that I assume are just unwinnable. Also the experience system is not balanced in terms of time invested and the whole thing is very grindy and slow to start. These are minor complaints though because I really love the core of the game.I particularly like the end-game. Once you get your three ships and you have filled all the slots you can upgrade some guns, but if you lose the ship you lose those upgrade points which are much scarcer than the regular currency. Instead I have been buying the super advanced weapons at the top of the purchable weapon list that are just brutal. I expect there could be some expansions in the future that would allow some custumization as well. I would recommend this game, but understand that its nowhere near as full and intricate as FTL. It is a 3 ship fleet simulator with some RNG elements and very little customization or variation between the ships."
,Not Recommended,396480,21470468,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,subsphinx,"This game is best described as a mashup of Gratuitous Space Battles and FTL. The graphics and sounds are not as good as GSB, and the rogue-like, perfectly balanced micromanaging of FTL is not present. However, it has elements of both of those games, combining two enjoyable things into one, though not being as highly proficient at either. This is not a knock on the game, it's just where it lands on the spectrum.I like how the game handles the tactical combat interface. Your ships act how you want them to act. They go where you tell them and attack in the desired order. The only problem is that there is almost no depth to combat. Yeah, you can change where your ships land in the sector, or position them in a minorly superior way, but it does not make much difference. It operates such that you optimize your ships while traversing a map (FTL), but then order them around precisely in real time battles (like GSB). The game consists of 4 procedurally generated sectors (FTL), though each particular sector is wide open for combat (like GSB).The game becomes far too grindy at times due to poor pacing. There are major spikes and valleys in the opponents difficulty even in neighboring sectors. One second you are destroying face, and the next you are scurrying back to your battlestation to repair. This would be fine, but it is often expensive to upgrade or purchase additional firepower. This sends you grinding around safe parts of the map when you should be getting rewarded for exploring more. This problem worsens as you go on.The deeper you get into the game, the more boring it gets. I often have my fleet at maximum capabilities in the first map. What this means is that I have no way of improving my ships, and if the enemies keep getting strong, there is no possibility of victory. The game needs tweaks. It's not horrible as it is, but it could be a lot more. This feels more like an early release, at least from a PC standpoint. It is obvious that the game is a port from a mobile platform, that's its ideal niche."

The startup on this game is somewhat grindy and tedious since it’s not otherwise very engaging beyond its core. Absolutely not for you if you don’t like watching your ship explode a lot.Value For MoneyAt a 10 euro price tag this game delivers approximately 25ish hours’ worth of game-time if you enjoy the mechanic, want to unlock all the ships that are available and want to scrape out a decent number of achievements. If the unlocking of ships is not enough of a fix for you to keep playing you’re definitely going to not make it to that mark.MacroIt’s tempting to compareBattlevoid: Harbingerto the hundreds of roguelikes already out there but what the half-way good ones always seem to have in common is a slightly different mechanic that gives it a nice little thing to play with.Battlevoid: Harbinger gives you a starting ship, an obscure mission that for some reason you are in charge of because reasons and send you on your merry way to save the galaxy or in true roguelike fashion basically steer you into the nearest fatal accident in space.You jump across nodes in a turn based fashion, do a lot of real-time (pause-able) space combat and once you’re done scraping by for a bit you can hopefully but a nice piece of gear for your ship or a ways past that up to two new friends that you control and otherwise fly in formation.The addition of the up to two allies flying with you is a nifty addition that allows you to play a little bit with a fleet style according to your needs.For the most part you will however just get vaporized if you’re not careful and since you need levels to unlock better starting ships and recruit-able fleet ships which comes in very slowly in the beginning. The XP rewards at the end of a run also could’ve used some tweaking as it seems awfully slow levelling up in the beginning and stimulates you just killing yourself over and over for the quick xp.This wouldn’t be so bad but you’ll run out of equipment to try out on your newly unlocked ships long before you manage to unlock all the ships only to notice that they aren’t all that different from each other either.The fact that there literally was no story beyond a one page blurb and some off comments after the last mission didn’t bother me so much but it was worth mentioning.The problem with this game is therefore a modest amount of content and a lot of polish. It’s not so much that I wouldn’t recommend it but I’d recommend a lot of other roguelikes before this one would even pop into my head.6.5/10 Needed more RNG. Didn’t think I’d ever say that"

Easily get submerged in the involving battles, until a mischosen jump ends your game, well, not entirely. Each game you gain exp and will get more choices of your starter ship or ships(3 at most in a fleet) with higher lvls, and also depending on how much you had in last game, sets your starting credits and upgrade points.The mix of type of ship and typical and random choices for placement of defensive and offensive equiptment is a venture hopefully well done..  even where on a ship you place it, because distance is very important,such as when you are trying to manouver a short range shot on a moving object.Meteor fields, shield and armor killing environments, or emp clouds, will have to be moved through, or fought in.  The random mix of events will have your imagination and choices kindled, as well as your nerves racked. I actually circled in a cloudy nebula trying to close in on an equally weakend enemy, hoping another emp pulse would not happen before I could jump out.Great game, very easy to pick up, may seem casual, but its not easy and its entirely addictive."

The basic mechanics are really lovely and there's a lot of really good things going on in it.However...The basic balance of the game is really really off. I really enjoyed the basic mechanics of the game enough that I wanted to write a positive review, but after playing through many times, beating it on easy and normal, and getting to about level 16 I just can't endorse this game as it stands. There's just too much wrong in the basic math of the game.Most of the tech simply doesn't work the way it seems like it should. About half the guns in the game are either worthless or unplayable. The don't create any significantly different tactical situations when used by the opponent or give  the player new choices in how to play the game, they just have slightly different animation and math, but essentially are the same. For instance, the Ion cannon disables enemy engines. In theory, this should... do something. But it doesn't. Sure, the enemy stops moving but... who cares? If they were gonna run they still can, and you don't do significantly more damage than they do unless you were already way more powerful than them anyways. Another example: Shields are as far as I can tell close to useless. Most of the dangerous enemies in the game simply ignore shields or blow through them so fast that you can't tell you had them in the first place. Unfortunately the only way to actually improve your defense is to buy... shields... So what ends up actually being true is that the only way to protect yourself is to spam the board with projectiles and fighter squads to block incoming fire. This leads to a remarkably similar run through every time I played.Perhaps I missed something, but as far as I could tell there was no significant strategic reason to ever choose short range weapons. Sure, some of them are very strong... but you are *always* in danger at short range because all the long range weapons don't lose any effectiveness at short range and point defense weapons stack up when facing six enemy ships.Last but not least, the... plot... is extremely shoddy. You get a snippet at the beginning about the race and situation your in... and that's it. From there on out the game ceases to resemble a storied universe and becomes a pure game that doesn't feel like a universe at all. Also, the Schillae race is a absurdly sexist concept.All in all, I feel like this game is a blueprint for a *really* good game... but ulitmately it just seems very much like it's one guy in a basement or an amatuer group who made a passable game and didn't put in the effort to actually flesh it out and make it truly good."

As you kill and progress in each map you'll find new weapons that may or may not be stronger than what you already have.Eventually you'll ""win"" the map by killing a specific target.The game gets pretty boring after your first few hours.  Once you survive 1-2 maps you'll likely have all the gear and most of the upgrades you'll ever get.

One that has two (or more) sides that are in a state of war. With factories on both sides, and the ability for AI and players to build new factories.

The port to Steam seems to have sucked nearly all of the enjoyment from the game.1)  Selecting a target in the mobile version is  a single click.  Here it takes two clicks.  A LftClick on the firing ship then a RtClick on the target.  If the player can indeed click on the target.  Click targeting is touchy to say the least.  Which brings us to:2)  RtClick command is overloaded.  Not only does RtClick  tell a ship where to shoot it RtClick also tells the ship where to move.  So a missed click can send that ship precisely where you don't want it to go.  Coupling that with a somewhat small click target  ships frequently are headed to the wrong place.3)  Controls are scattered about the edges of the screen resulting in a lot of wasted & unnecessary pointer movement.   There are many good reasons to cluster game controls. There most obvious being that it allows the player to keep his focus on the action. There are few good reasons to spread them across the entire real estate of the screen.   Perhaps none.4)  Ship speeds are a bit slow on a mobile.  On a 27"" monitor they are excruciatingly slow.5)  Game balance is poor; even worse than the mobile version where game balance is precarious to say the least.  The worst balance issue is the ship speed.  All enemy ships are faster than all player ships.  All of them. This is especially annoying with regard to Carriers.  Historically naval carriers have been, and are, amond the fastest ships in the fleet.  The earliest carriers were in fact converted fast cruisers.  The job of the carrier is to get there""the fastest with the mostest""6)  Formation following doesn't work well but then it doesn't work well on the mobile version either.The devs have a new project that is taking most , if not all, of their attention.  They said that they have no interest in putting more work into BH.  That's too bad because the best advertisment for a game is a history of prior successes.

No fuel restrictions, free repairs at stations (which also defend you when enemies are in the sector), and LOTS of ships to choose from.The only thing I'd say bogs this game's experience down is that it takes too much gameplay to unlock ships. You get experience when you end a game (so, when you die, since finishing a mission takes you to a new one), but it's never more than like one level.I'd say $10 is a bit of a high price for this game, but that depends on how badly you want a space game with lots of (fairly repetitive and grindy) gameplay.

Although at the time of this writing the Carrier ships are far better than the starships that cannot hold fighter planes and/or drones.Loads of replayability as each and every time you play, the map is much different than the last.  Believe me when I say this is a good thing because you will be ending up dying horribly more often than not.Position matters!!  Where you jump into the sector and how you have your formation could mean the difference between a bad or a good battle.Huge variety of weapons.  This actually plays an important part of your strategy since some turrets shoot farther than others.   You could even place shorter range burst fire guns on your ship to destroy your opponents as you warp in right on top of them to gain the advantage!There is only one bad thing that I can note:Once in a while, there are times where you will die no matter what you do.  Example:  I got caught in an EMP storm right before the tough boss battle and I could not move and had to wait 4 times straight in the same sector  before being overwhelmed by enemy ship battles.Here is my gameplay video:https://youtu.be/aFKv7mQmPdQOver 20 hours played as of this writing and I still haven't beaten the ""easy"" mode difficulty.

In essence is a rogue space RTS based game, (Turn based per map space you move to), this gives you some breather room so you dont get completely slammed. Compared to its mobile variant, their are some SERIOUS improvements. Personally, i like the addition of extra ships and modules.Also hacking the game, is proving a challenge to cheat the system, i like that. Making it hard for those script kitties to cheat the game (i just ran CE and hacked away at it till i got what i wanted), but the whole point is, its pretty robust, and hard to beat. Even on easy it offers a reasonable challenge. A few bugs here and their which are obvious (compared to the mobile variant) which these bugs are resolved, but otherwise, non the less a amazing game.Really your running through 1-3 stages, in normal mode you face off against randomized maps with different factions, different enemies, and difficulties may vary based on level setting (easy, normal, hard), each variety only seems to change the enemy spawning times, scrap gain, and initial starting as well as how hard the game is overall.All in all, i give this game a 5/5 if you dont have the mobile edition, get it. This is identical to it in every way, except rebuilt for the pc platform.

The game is slower even in the real time battles giving you time to make a more strategic choice of placement rather than twitch ability.  There is a decent variety of turrets for ships, all of which can be upgraded in a variety of stats throughout the game, including some support-only turrets.  You gain experience throughout the game, whether you win or lose the scenario, which in turn potentially unlocks new starting ships.  There are three main difficulties, but I have yet to actually beat easy, though I have seen the final sector.  It is roguelike in the sense that if your ship is destroyed the game ends regardless of how much of your fleet remains.  Really nice for essentially being an upgraded port of a mobile game.Also, you get carriers.  I love having a carrier with drones.UPDATE: I've played enough to beat normal a couple of times and even finished hard once.  I have unlocked all but four ships.

It has levels system which unlocks new ships to fly, but you get such small amounts of experience that you will need tenths of hours to unlock them and i can't see why you would play this game for so long. Both times i had some meaningful progress i got screwed by rng, when you warp into the next sector your warp is on cooldown and while you can control where you land - you can't account in the late warps of the enemy ships so both times 4 ships just suddenly warped on top of mine and there's literally nothing you can do but to pray that you will kill them before they kill you, a couple of times i got lucky, but those 2 times i wasn't.It's worth a couple of hours of playtime with a heavy discount, otherwise avoid this game."

Your end score will just be penalized a bit for how many turns you spend out there, but nothing major. The game doesn't try to push you to the exit.- Thus, this is kind of a space fighting game. It's where the most work went and probably most of what you will do as it's the most interesting aspect and the one which pays off best- The goal aspect/win conditions aspect is more varied in this game, where different games will give you a differend end goal- The crew management is absent in this game, which hurts its depth of play quite unfortunately- The customization aspect is somewhat superior in this game as you can run a squadron of ships, equipping and upgrading each, piloting each individually RTS style- The hardcore aspect manifests slightly differently in this, where one small wrong choice can lead to a disastrous outcome whereas FTL is mostly just ""very hard"". This leads to a more dramatic experience in Battlevoid than in FTL in my opinion- This one allows you to restart the game exactly where you left it, so there's a bit more of that laid back ""let's explore"" componentThe game would be really good with a bit more depth to its world and mechanics and the inclusion of crew management and more frequent dilemmas. Void of that, after the discovery phase and a handful of sessions of play, it's still a sweet time-eater into which you can throw 10 to 30 minutes here and there and not feel bored or madly frustrated.

I got it in a sale which makes it ever better for the price but when you think about the game, it is very simple. However there are some really big flaws in the game. So I'll go over them.Firstly, there is a somewhat negative aspect of leveling. Usually I enjoy leveling and unlocking new ships or weapons or whatever but this really only unlocks new ships. Bigger ships. . .usually slower. Which makes them more and more boring in the end. You can't upgrade your ships basic stats which means what you see is what you get. Hull can't be upgraded, you can install new shields which is something that just needs to be done. Even once you have a fully kitted fleet out capital ships, you can still get jumped by a fleet that just enters and shoots you in the back and you will end up losing one of your capital ships. Nothing you can do about it. Even on the easiest settings. For example you can trigger a missile trap and get hit for 800 shield damage and 500 physical damage. As you can imagine, that is a lot since that is your full shields removed and even the strongest ships get taken down by 25% with that. It scales too, so if you are a higher level and go in with a big ship and then purchase smaller escort ships, you could lose one just by opening a trap. Also when you enter battle, you tend to 95% of the time, get placed in the worst possible place. For example all the enemy ships are in the middle and you port in the middle, you will be placed with all their ships behind you, so they get free shots at your weakest points basically and can even knock out your engines. I have had times I teleport in and instantly lose a capital ship from a concetrated hit. Thats even before my ships weapons are up from the down time from flying in. So the ship leveling system is pretty lame. As for the ship types, carriers are pretty fun but as the game progresses, they are virtually useless. In my oppinion they are not balanced well. If you get surrounded by a group of fighters, your capital ships can take some pretty nasty damage but their range means that you can pretty much laugh them off. They have a range of 200 and hit points are pretty low (for the lowest) compared to 600 range with still pretty low hit points (for the highest) Then you need to upgrade their numbers (which is super costly). They are only really good to defend your own ships from missiles but once you have 1-2 ships, missiles rarely reach, let a full fleet of 3.Now for the actual weapons, most of them are pretty trashy. You can't upgrade them to your hearts desire. You have a resource that allows you to upgrade but it is . . .well, I wouldn't say rare, but compared to the price of an upgrade, they are♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will usually get 1-2 per battle so you need to do the missions to get them (you can luickily cycle through them till you get one with high amounts but still. . .) However you really come down to a a few weapon times, the energy weapons, kinetic, laser, missile and what I like to call the doomsday weapons. Energy weapons are good against shields so each ship should have at least one however in classic stupidity, they have less range than your hull kinetic weapons. So you end up using a barrage of high hull damage shots that do virtually nothing to shields before you even get in range to shoot their shields. So now you have the kinetic on a slower recharge and then the energy that are relatively fast but range and ship speed are annoying. Laser weapons are my personal favourites but they have such low range and such long recharge time that they are fairly bad weapons. Then you have missiles which unless you really load up on them, are pretty bad cause they will all be shot down. Doomsday weapons on the other hand are really nice but since they cost the same as a ship, they are a bit over the top. However they can deliver huge damage over huge range. Once you have them, you almost have won the game. Start fights at range and just move in slowely and you got an easy win.Now other than the AI, the scaling battles, the badly balanced weapons and movement speeds/game speeds, there are other issues, the randomness and the badly outlayed quests and background information. . .I wish they had spent the time on this game to bring in voice actors and full out events/unique missions and everything as this game could have been the best game all year if it was polished up with some TLC. As it is now, it leaves much to be desired but it also is still a great deal of fun.The thing I really enjoy about this game is creating a couple of powerful ships and going at it and seeing how far I get. Loads of fun. Getting past the starting area and breaking through the first galaxy is pretty easy, then each subsequent galaxy is that much harder."

It is a good game for leaving and picking up later at another time, yet it has enough depth to it from being brainlessly boring.The game is perhaps most similar to FTL but without a hunger clock and more focused on a squad of ships, one serving as your flagship. You enter a level with several sectors and a goal - usually defeating some end boss. Their are aliens but you don't seem to have any joining your squad of ships (you can use their weaponry though).The game can be a bit of a random draw at times; while at other times you can grind your way to victory if you so choose. There are things like little side quests and mercenaries to hire but they are mostly just distractions.I would probably best recommend this game for your phone if you are choosing for a specific platform, then for a computer."

The most ""tactical"" thing I ever did in fights was turn the side of my ships that had defense weapons (as opposed to the side of the ship that I filled with extra shield generators) towards the enemy. Watching the fight to see if your ships will DPS the enemies to death isn't very fun.As lame as the gameplay is, the interface is just TERRIBLE:- The range of your weapons is not shown in combat, making positioning needlessly difficult.- The game LOVES to show you ridiculous stat bars for weapons and ships, but you need to check the wiki for crucial basic info like how many weapon slots a ship has, or how fast a weapon's projectiles move.- Speaking of ship stats, once you rank up to level 2, you unlock a new starting ship that doesn't have a fighter bay like the default, but is MUCH tougher. And the best way to rank up quickly is to play on hard mode, even though you'll die for sure... did I mention how newbie-friendly this game is? /s- The galaxy map is a MESS that ""forgets"" where your friendly bases are (or were, if they got blown up) once you're more than a couple jumps away.- The ships all look very similar, to the point where I had to scroll ships off the screen to see if they showed up as enemy or friendly radar blips."

It's different in it's own good ways, but those are two completely different games.B:H has more of a heavy emphasis of configuring your fleets and sending them off to go do battle, similar in that regard to I guess Gratuitous Space Battles. You DO control your ships, but the ships all move so slowly, they CRAWL, that you're honestly not doing much in the way of micromanaging at all. A well timed teleport will help spread the damage, jumping out at the right time will help you barely survive, but other than that it's mostly a hands-off affair.And that's not a bad thing.But aside from that there isn't much going on here. There are some weapons that are hands-down better than others, and even the devs have mentioned that if you're not maxing out your fighters then you're asking to lose, because they're completely superior to capital ship weapons. Once you figure out what works and what doesn't, things fall into place very easily and you just plow through the opposition, even on the hardest difficulty settings. In fact, I couldn't actually tell what the difference between Easy - Medium - Hard actually was, other than simply starting with fewer resources to build out your ships.The capital ships themselves have very little difference in terms of stats that aren't health/shields ... it becomes apparent that the best strategy is always Go Big or Go Home, and there will be absolutely no point in investing in smaller ships that have only one weapon slot. They don't move faster or have any benefit that warrants buying them over a behemoth ship that has all the same weapons x4.The last achievements I have to unlock are 'complete 50 escort missions', though these come around maybe once or twice per playthrough that I can't even be bothered."

However, this game has some serious flaws that make it infuriating.   Once you get to the third map you start running into some pretty ridiculous weapons that can pretty much 2 shot any ship.  If you get unlucky and they have multiple of this weapon or multiple ships with this weapon you can lose your whole fleet without having a chance to do anything.  Second part of this gripe:  Since it is an energy weapon the only way to prevent it hitting your ships is to utilize fighters (since you basically have no real mobility in the game).  But the AI and manual control on the fighters is absolutely abysmal.  You cannot get them to fly on demand.  Half the time if you try manual control they just fly in little circles and never go anywhere.  Since your ships don't drop their loot any death is a major set back.  Potentially multiple hours.  If the energy weapon targets your main ship you loose and get to start over.Now onto the next major game breaking flaw.  You can find a factory and just farm.  For hours and hours.  Eventually for some unknown reason gear starts coming out beter and better and better.  Eventually you have such over powered gear that has 2500ish range that you can land anywhere on a map and just alpha kill anything.

You start off with a single ship (starting ships can get better as you level up), fight some battles, earn some scrap and upgrade points, buy new ships, make a fleet, and conquer the galaxy. Or atleast you get as far as you can with the ships you have available to you.One of the largest flaws with the game is that the ships you can buy while in a mission are limited by your level. So how far you can progress in the game is really determined by what level you are. Even if you can afford a super awesome destroyer, you'll be stuck with little 2 gun ships for quite a while. I understand limiting the starting ship by your level, but limiting the ships you can buy if you survive long enough to earn the scrap? That isn't a great decision.None the less this game is very fun (and inexpensive), and I would definitely recommend giving it a whirl."

Though the game has a variety of guns... that's really all it has. Also, some guns, such as rocket cannons, are far more versatile and powerful than others. There are no other tactical advantages to utilize. All ships move the speed of refrigerated gravy, and there is no way to increase said speed, or bolster the starting hulls to create true assault ships or fast flanking craft. Your fleet is also limited to three ships, the other two of which are drawn from a limited list of support vessels. People keep saying this game is hard, but after you unlock the destroyer, learn the guns and thier functions, and realize that carriers are OP with their bombers and fighter craft, an experienced tactical mind will win this game in about their fifth or sixth playthrough.Reccomended for a quick Rougelike space shooter if you don't have a lot of time to kill, but don't expect Sins of a Solar Empire, or Battlefleet Gothic, level of combat."

,Recommended,396480,22771215,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,PH,"This is a cautious recommend.The game has an incredible grind. You unlock new ships one by one as you gain experience. Experience is gained solely through playing the game, win or lose. The most efficient way to gain experience is by just grinding out hard mode, which makes the earlier levels utterly brutal.Once you get to around level 17? Around when you unlock the BSE Harbinger and the Valiant, the game opens up and becomes more fun.There's not a whole lot of gameplay depth, especially at the tactical level. There's a decent amount of ship loadout planning, and most of the decisions you make in-game are between combat encounters, where you choose how to allocate the game's two main resources: scrap for buying new weapons or ships, and skill points for upgrading your weapons.The combat itself is the weakest part of the game. it has a very, very mobile feel. You only have control of the movement of your ships, but positioning barely matters. The main issue is the combat maps are small, and the ships' turning and movement speeds are very low compared to the way damage output and weapon range is balanced. If you are poorly positioned, you're going to suffer and repositioning rarely matters or is practical. Your ships aren't responsive enough for changes in positioning to do anything for you.At the strategic level, you're shown what systems you can warp to next and what ships lie in wait there. Each system/combat map is divided into a 3x3 grid, and you can choose where you want to warp in based on that. This is crucial so you don't end up warping in on top of a space station or something. You're also shown whether enemy ships will be moving to another station during the next turn. You can either move to a new system, or wait at your current one to see how enemy ships move.There's a very basic quest system mostly made up of ""go here"", ""kill that"", and ""bring this item here"" tasks.My biggest complaint aside from the initial grind is inconsistent difficulty spiking. This is a symptom of a lot of rogue-likes, but it's still frustrating. Playthroughs can be as short as fifteen minutes if you die early, or as long as three hours if you make it to the last starmap. Losing late in the game to some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you can't react to is infuriating.That's really about it. It's a fun game that doesn't require a lot of thought, and is definitely worth it for the cost...if you can last through the initial grind (took me about nine hours spread out over a year or so)."

For starting upgrades focus on # of fighters and/or # of projectiles (burst)... though the Laser Cannon is an all-round excellent weapon.- Picking up items is done in Engineering: Drag from Space to Cargo.- Upgrade points (green) should be used to spec your ships for specific roles.- Fill your ship's equipment hardpoints and then save up for the next ship... but make sure to have spare change for some equipment on that ship as well."

Details below.I like space a lot, and what Ineedis a worry-free casual singleplayer game with persistent progress andsomechallenge. A simple rogue-like/lite should fit the bill.Battlestation: Harbinger promises to be just that, and it has been okay so far. I tried Endless Sky and Destination Sol first (both free, check 'em out), but in those you are the pilot, not a captain/commander, so they get more involved. I prefer to command, unless we're talking Elite/Freelancer.What this game offersVery basic graphics (""pixel graphics"" is a valid art style, butcheck out the competition; it can be difficult to tell what you and the enemy ships have mounted).Simple shipbuilding with hardpoints (weapons and shields (and tp) ONLY) and different ship frames.Basic tactical combat (range, vectors, damage types, fleet composition, targeting, pausing, etc.).Barebones questing and looting, ""vending machine"" type.A pleasantly loose feel; you can micro but you don't have to, losses are regrettable but not a tragedy.Rogue-lite levels of challenge. Death is not the end, but it is frequent and unpredictable.What the game lacksWriting.What little there is does not count as plot or dialogue (see FTL for reference).Punch.Bland BGM loop, somehwat unsatisfying GFX (capital ship explosions are pretty sweet, the rest is forgettable).Exploration.Even randomised grinders benefit from player-world interaction and random encounters beyond pure combat and trading.Speed options faster than ""Lazy"" and ""Leisurely"".Engine, Sensor and Cloak options for hardpoints. The first especially feels like a big problem.If you have ¤10 and want a serious game like this, I would try FTL first.

You get 1000 points automatically just for choosing hard mode. Once you get Carriers will lots of weapon mounts, the game becomes a lot easier.---Great little 2D space action game for fans of S.P.A.Z. or Gratuitous Space Battles. The combat is simple but has some depth, and the ship customization is deeper than you'd expect. Each ship has a unique combination of firepower, speed, and toughness that makes the choice a bit meaningful.There are a few enemy types to encounter and nothing is more satisfying that watching a barrage of your own guns wallop an enemy fleet; battles usually last less than a minute but are kind of thrilling while they do. I wish you could name your ships! Or even design your own ships.The graphics and sound design serve decently, it is a $10 game after all. That said, fairly addictive and a great way to burn a weekend."

But using caution and repairing at space stations you can eventually become a steam-roller of galactic doom, slicing through enemy fleets.  Playing around with the various weapons is enjoying, and once you can equip death rays and giant plasma cannons you can destroy capital ships in seconds.You're going to occasionally lose ship in battle, but the game is forgiving enough that you can always build up to purchase a replacement and equip it effectively.The game loads quickly, is rock solid stable, easy to control, flexible in configuration, and shows nothing of it's mobile roots.All said and done, the only downside I can legitimately claim is that it ends right when you've got an amazing fleet you really have grown fond of.

The downside is that you have to level up which takes time but it still allows for you to have a sense of acomplishment. Once you get to be a high enough level wherein you get carriers the game gets pretty easy because bolter ships are OP at protecting you against any kind of hit minus lazers. Its a pretty good game with basic balanceing (with excpetion to the 1 race that seems to be OP as hell) and you can adapt your prefered playstyle pretty easily depending on the ships you want to have with you.My only 3 complaints.-My first complaint is that even when transitioning to systems and you choose where you pop out can vary widely. More often then not I find that I spawn right on top of or in VERY close proximity to everything around the center of the map. The reason it sucks is becasue once you hit stage 4 the 2-4 starbases with 1-4 ships quickly melt your fleet like there is no tomorow.-My second complaint is that you can only have 3 ships with you at a time. I understand why when it comes to balancing but It was also a pretty big let down especially since you tend to stack scrap and it quickly becomes nothing but bonus points used to help level you up.-My third complaint is that the ships dont stick to the formation you set them at when you move them. It would be nice to have them stick to the formation and maybe be able to choose what direction they hault motion at. When you change maps your first ship will be stationed in the center of the circle and will nudge any other ship out of position. Your ship also tends to place itself on the outskirts when moving them as a group which will make it vulnerable and in later levels easily end your game. Though you could always micro manage them which can be very annoying though nessasary at times.If you like roguelike space travel with sort of RPG elementsv and the ability to customize your ships loadouts its a pretty easy buy especially if you can get it on sale. I look forward to future updates where they add some features to the formation aspect, more ship, increased fleet size, more weapons (its pretty limited atm) and something that you can use your scrap for in the late game (kinda useless once youve unlocked all the ships) because managing to get 200k scrap banked away for points is annoying to say the least."

It's great for a plane/train ride and i enjoy watching ships that outnumber me being destroyed piecemeal with a little prior planning. But don't forget the mouse as this game can be more difficult with just a touchpad.And there is a pause button, if that's something you're worried about.This game requires careful planning but still retains a fast pace as most battles are over in 30 seconds. Strategic use of distress signals (a wonderful touch to the game) can finally make an area possible to conquer or end in your defeat as nine capital ships turn in your direction.You have the ability to run from battles once your jumpdrive recharges and some levels have solar storms and asteroids that can cripple your shields/ship or your ability to run from battles. However, these can be known ahead of time.Another great feature that this game does right is you can tell straight out if your rounds are going to connect with the enemy ships. This allows you to change your strategy more fluidly but don't expect it to save you as your ships move like snails.My biggest compliment for this game is the ability to see what number of capital ships and fighters inhabit a sector before you jump there as well as where they're located. This is compounded with the ability to choose from nine different areas you can jump to so you can heavily strategize and rearrange your weapons and fleet before you jump.My complaints for the game are:> Really just two. I wish there was a pansy difficulty that permits save scumming so the loss of a ship (or fleet) after several hours isnt a 'game over.' Sometimes it's fun to just keep destroying, even if it means you arent rewarded. However, this is EASILY overlooked as the game permits leveling which unlocks (occasionally) better ships. Meaning you are rewarded for your efforts even when you lose.> It still crashes to desktop far too often whenever you pause it for a few minutes or more. It saves your progress but for a game out of beta it shouldnt be doing this.A number of additional ship options, as well as a few changes to the core gameplay, would be great:> Get rid of the ""captial"" ship. Losing your command ship leading to a game over is an arbitrary crutch that serves no purpose. This is not helped by wasting a weapon section to have an escape pod.> A way to gain a little intel on enemy fleets within a sector, possibly by buying such information from a mercenary or starport.> Show the shield and hull strength of individual fighters.> Way to counter/initiate your own pulses so you can disable fleets from running or prevent your drive from going down.> A WAY TO INTERCEPT ASTEROIDS WITH YOUR WEAPONS! This one just seems like an oversight as you're forced to sit and be pummeled (same with a black hole) for no other reason than ♥♥♥♥ you.> The fleet designer needs to be tweaked as the boxes will jump around if you come too close to one and will even mess themselves up for no reason. It makes setting up encounters needlessly more challenging and causes me to lose 10,000 point ships because the setup reset after I told it to layer the ships.> Better control of fighter/bomber escorts (in fleet selection mode) so we can use them as a shield for the opening salvo or to lag behind the motherships so they can counter from behind a wall of titanium rather then be fodder.> An additional note would be the pointlessness of the story itself. I don't read it as I don't care. This game isnt deep enough to really benefit from a story as I'm really just pointed in a direction, given a little slap on the bum and expected to carry out wholesale slaughter because some little text blurb told me to do so. Which is good enough for me but make it so I can just turn off the story mode altogether so I don't have to keep hitting ""skip"" several times to kill something.I also have a question for the devs, why are several of the ships unavailable for purchase after you unlock them? You can only start the game with them but can't purchase them to make the fleet ""unstoppable"""
