,Recommended,396560,33363495,Posted: 7 July,all,@Dicky Spanish,"Early review update when got more time.A lot of people have been writing this game off on Reddit and other places, suprisingly it's not as bad as some make out. It's arcadey and the Germans attack in waves and others shoot from doorways, high areas etc pretty much like a frontal attack. So it is called Front Defense and that's what it does and it's a lot of fun at doing that.The graphics aren't to bad and better than 70% of other Vive games, runs fine on my 6600K, 1080 GTX with 16gb ram, SS on 2.2. If you like John Wick Chronicles then you will like this game, even the other WW2 game The last sniper its a better version of that game.Pros:It's FunNon stop actionYou're shooting human targets not Zombies, orcs or blobs of lightThey just don't rush you, they attack from different angles, sides, heights etc.It's not a story, it's just action when you feel like blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things.Get's a decent sweat up to test that DASyou can have 2x2 or 3x3 size play space option at start.Cons:The red target dot is unneededThe kill amount highlight above the kills unneededPress and hold Trigger to hold front of weapons there are much better ways for thisThe extra ammo belt slightly at wrong place and can get confusing when crawling on floor. Also the grenades raise to head to remove pin kept hitting my HMD with my controllers.Highlights:Hearing a ping noise and realising it sounded different from other gunfire and finding my helmet had been shot off and I had to put it back on.Getting bayonetted by a large Nazi, he scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me when I was hiding behind the sand bags.Hearing the Nazi's yell what sounds like the start to the Red Hot Chili Peppers - Suck My Kiss songIf this was released with the Vive then it would of been what a lot at the time were looking for, now with so much choice it's probably only for those who like Arcade shooters and to let off a little steam. Go for those high scores and diving around your playspace frantically.If you pick up for $10 or under it's a must buy, should be around the $14.95 mark but I'm not put out paying $20, have bought a lot worse for  more for the Vive so far.6 Adolf nuts out of a one nut Scrotum."
,Recommended,396560,33376742,Posted: 8 July,all,Kiesta07,"First of all, this is an arcade shooter for the vive. It is not a gritty, realistic shooter, and it is most certainly not a story based shooter.Pros: 1.simple gameplay loop makes it easy to pick up and play for vr shooter beginners and veterans alike2.intense, gets you panicking as nazis rush in from all sides3.weapons are satisfying yet intuitive, you dont need to♥♥♥♥♥♥them, making for a more fluid experience4.immersion and sense of presence is definetly very good, things like your helmet being visible to the heat effectsfrom your machine gun make for good immersion.5.running on a GTX 1070 MSI and am getting very good performance/graphical fidelity ratio.Cons: 1.Price: the game is definetly expensive for a ""wave"" shooter, but it has similar content to space pirate trainer,another good arcade shooter for the vive. (I reccomend getting it on sale, but I think a price drop is in order)2.Slight animation glitches, but functionally the game does its job very well. The current issues could be ironed outvery easily, but none of them impact gameplay.A good buy on a sale, does everything it said it would, it's an arcade shooter. Nothing exceptional, but good graphics and good gameplay. Overall, I would reccomend this game to people who enjoy Space Pirate Trainer or the SuperHot VR endless mode."

Graphics is very nice, gameplay smooth. Played only first map, and it's challenging, which is good. Totaly love the helmet! There should be a possibility to turn off the health bars and scores, as they are bit disturbing. Seems there are only 3 maps, let's hope there will be more added later for the price. But lot of fun, keeper for me. One of the very few WWII games. Thanks!"

76561198115534343,Recommended,396560,33419308,Posted: 9 July,all,clownfish33,Awesome arcade game!  It is very challenging.  But I am glad you get to advance to next stage based on accumulated points rather than skill. Graphics is excellent.    It's quite hectic and makes me sweat.  Consider people paid to play this in arcade in Asia.  It is a bargain to have this at home.
76561198386712898,Recommended,396560,33482323,Posted: 12 July,all,Vorax,"Very immersive, frantic and intense - It's a wave shooter but uses the mechanic in a way that makes sense. You are hunkered down and trying to survive. I highly recommend for anyone that likes immersion and frantic gameplay. Bonus points for WW2 environment and graphics."
76561197990442199,Recommended,396560,33414765,Posted: 9 July,all,slamei89,"Good graphics, feels like an older Call Of Duty wave shooter. Unnecessarily long grind in between unlocking next level. Gameplay overall is fun and engaging, just becomes repetivie. Hopefully for updates."

76561198014651745,Recommended,396560,33422534,Posted: 9 July,all,Killzone,"This game isnt bad but its definitely difficult. I was unable to get past the first level and does need some bug fixes when it comes to reloading your weapon. The graphics are great and shooting the guns seem amazing and realistic. Right now not sure if its worth $20 though. Im sorry i ended up getting a refund because i did enjoy the game. i guess i was waiting for bug fixes but to be honest, i still want to play it. I think the difficulty was just to hard. its like you can keep up with the enemy and bam you are completely overwhelmed. I still recommend the game."
76561198247562068,Recommended,396560,33354591,Posted: 7 July,all,RVMX_4,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS:The game is fun and I can run it on low graphic settings without a problem with a GTX970 and i5 4460. It also helps to work out while trying not to die taking cover. You accumulate score by killing to unlock the other levels which is challenging to survive for long. I dont know if it each level can be beaten and there seems to be 3 levels only. Fast action, some minor bugs. SO FAR I LIKE IT! Yes.. its a wave shooter but I love WWII era and this feels really good especially at aiming. Its acurate especially if u use sight. If you are a fan of COD and BF, BUY THIS!SUGGESTIONS:Put some FIRST AID KIT to heal you, making you feel like you inject urself morphine or a gauze in an arm. That would be cool!Make a new FREE Locomotion game like Onward and arizona sunshine in this environment, where you can pick up guns, hide in certain spots, etc.. THat would be awesome!Option to enable or disable RED DOT.PROSFeels like the good old COD WWII gamesDifferent weaponsCan choose 2x2m area instead of 3x3mEasy to play.Good performanceChallengingNice environment, you do feel ur in war.Having to grab your helmet from floor is cool.CONSNo Story.Wish there was more environment destructionNeeds more bloodA sword or knife to defend when enemy is near youSeems impossible to beat.No multiplayerRifle ammo Ends quick... wish it lasted a little longerCould become repetitive to stay in one place just killing but its fun. Would be nice to teleport or move to other locations of the environment after surviving some waves... suck as elvens assasin"
,Recommended,396560,35055661,Posted: 18 September,all,Trugreenguy,"This is the most fun, incredibly realistic arcade style game ever!   It puts you in the battle!   If you play this game, and talk crap on it, your a complete moron.   No game has ever given me: rug burn, sore muscles, sore joints, and straight up heart pounding, out of breath experience as Front Defense.   What a great example of what VR can really become!   This is the game that really makes the beginning of VR become evident of what a venture into what virtual reality can really do.  Right now today, this has got to be the best VR experience in a game I have ever seen!   Difficult, yes!   Thats what war is, life or death!   Wave shooter?  Yes, but not like the others,   This is BAD♥♥♥♥♥"
76561198012915042,Recommended,396560,33525400,Posted: 13 July,all,erlingheusm1,"Great immersion. I was hitting the ground felling bullets hit. It felt real versus other wave shooters because it felt authentic. Authentic by if you were in WWII you would be holding off all sorts of waves at one point like that. Ducking, helmet flying off having to put it back on, deal with multiple real attackers on foot, motorvehicles and tanks. The point system is extremly high thou to get to tghe next level. Graphics are very good. Also, you will build up a sweat and leg muscles playing this well."

76561198051501408,Recommended,396560,34622783,Posted: 30 August,all,Salami.,"This game may not seem as ""the VR experience"" they're looking for, but it's sure as hell mine. The only thing i would recommend for this is more missions, heck, if you can, add steam workshop and see what the community can cook up for missions. I don't know how in the world they could make that happen, but if you had the workshop for this game, i think this could easily be my favorite VR game."

76561198073557424,Not Recommended,396560,34407090,Posted: 21 August,all,HeartDigger,"This is not worth the money currently, i would say 10 dollars would be worth it, this is a rip off, a better one at that, of the last sniper VR. This game has bad gun gameplay, its boring and plain, like theres a red dot and it takes half a mag to kill the enemy if you even hit them every time, also theres only 3 guns which wouldnt be to bad if this wasnt a game where you sit in some sandbags shooting germans for 4 hours just to get to the next mission. the grind element is terrible please remove it devs, or atleast reduce it. what would be cool and in my opinion make this like a 40 dllar game is multiplayer, mabye where you and a few other guys have to take a villiage and kill the germans or have to jumpout of airplaneson D-Day or charge normandy on D-Day or even wit AI. but at the moment its a meh wave defence. the only thing it has behind it is it looks good and its ww2. devs please try to take some notes from us all. but really i think there should be a option for 1 shotish kills and no laser."

,Not Recommended,396560,33360492,Posted: 7 July,all,infam0us1999,VERY buggy. Half the time when you throw away a magazine you cant pick up a new one. even when the lazer is dead on a target your shot can miss. The Banzai charge by the germans is overpowered. Shouldnt kill you... you should have a knife or something on you.Pro's -The Refund Button workedCon's-Everything else. overall boring. just sit and pull a trigger with no objective whatsoever.

76561198019046685,Not Recommended,396560,34259688,Posted: 15 August,all,Hooded Crow,The visual quality and sound design are nice but the gameplay is very boring.  Using the available weapons feels like holding prototype versions of the light gun for duck hunt and does not immerse you in the experience at all.  For $20 you don’t get much either.  There is a total of 3 beatable missions with you standing in one place the whole time fending off waves of enemies.  This would be a good title for an arcade but pass this one up if you're looking for something to occupy time at home.  Maybe if it got a gameplay overhaul and the guns actually feel like guns but for now this is just bad design in my opinion.
