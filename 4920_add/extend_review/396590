When your ship blows up, you can get back to base and start another one, but this process takes like 3-5 seconds. This being said, as those giant space rocks float at you, you are biting your nails and smacking your keyboard screaming, ""HURRY UP DAMN YOU,""Con:Co-op and local co-op only (i can understand its not easy to do, and i am not a game dev so i don't know the depth of difficulty that this creates)This is a con for me, but you can only go forward. This being said you have to turn your ship around to go after what you were planning on grabbing. This doesn't break the game for me, and this is more of a pet peive than anythings else, but it is something i will get over and turn into a ""skill"" rather then an annoyance.Not a con, but Newtonian Physics.Shooting into one asteroid, and your ship flys back into another. BOOM!If i could add one thing, with the resources you are getting, why not use that to add minor station upgrades onto it to increase the survivability, so like a small rail cannon that fires once every 6-10 seconds at 1 asteroid flying at it.Over all worth the cost, if you have friends locally this game would be amazing with them as well."

Co-op lures people in who think this has network support.The idea of the game is good but you should really add options to customize the controls. At the current state I would expect something like this on newgrounds for free, but not on steam for 4 euro.BTW: The controller support might be true, but it is not very satisfying if you use a non x-box controller. The analog stick and the directional pad are inverted and as so rendered useless.This game is kinda fun, but also kinda not finished."

Given that this is a game where you shoot a lot of asteroids, that becomes annoying very soon.Developer is aware of the problem and it was about two months since he requested additional information on PC specifics and never was seen since then."

Music is great and the gameplay is challenging and fun. It really shines when you want some classic ""couch"" competition with some friends.Full disclosure: I know the dev and have played it at events during various stages of development. It always had a crowd at public showcases because it's a great local co-op game. Check it out!"

It's simple enough to play for 15 minutes at a time, but it's addicting enough that you could easily lose track of an hour.Here's a quick overview:Music - Great! Sets the tone pretty well, not repetitive and annoying.Controls - Solid, smooth; I prefer the controller myself but the keyboard felt natural as well.GamePlay - It's addictingly simple; Fly around, blast asteroids and protect your hub. Watch out for enemies on the minimap!Graphics - There's not much to them, but they're consistent and aesthetically pleasing.I would highly recommend this title."
,Recommended,396590,18507849,"Posted: 16 October, 2015",all,madcapable,Awesome local multiplayer game. I know the developer personally and have witnessed him creating this game over the past 6 months. It's amazing to see how it's evolved and how much fun it is to try to survive the mayhem of asteroids with your friends. The game definitely envokes that 'one more round' feeling and burst out loud laughing moments.I just played a game with a friend and he got frozen while sniperoids were locking onto him. Panic ensued. Awesome.
,Recommended,396590,18637835,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,SonicxFiftyForty(Rin),"Played only 10 minutes, two matches, and I have to say, I love it!Puts  newer twist on the classic Asteroids game. I do think that there should be different game modes, however. Such as facing waves of asteroids, rather than endless ones comiong at you all the time. In between waves, you can purchase upgrades for the portal so it has a better chance of survival.I also wish for an online Multiplayer one day. Playing solo is a bit rough, and two people touvhing my keyboard is not okay.But overall, this game is great~!!"
76561198255337478,Recommended,396590,18720110,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,tayo_potato,"CMYW is way too addicting. Totally worth the $!PROS:-Quick playing and easy to understand-The leaderboard is a great motivator-The physics behind all the movements is impressive. The more ores you pick up, the slower your ship propels until it's emptied at the portal. The more powerful the gun, the stronger the kickback (so be careful...you're not invincible!). It took a while to get used to the ship's motion, kind of like flying drunk, but once you get used to it it's awesome! The game features all balance each other nicely :)-It's fun to figure out the different weapons classes and how they best work (e.g. the mines have a longer radius of investication than the turrets so they are best placed inside the portal for max protection)-GREAT MUSIC!-The difficulty doesn't ramp up too quickly so you have time to adjust. That being said, I still struggle to survive longer than 5 minutes....-$4.50 gives you hours of entertainment!CONS (or dirty, dirty tricks):-When droids follow your astronaut into the portal when you're trying to regenerate, you're dead (unless you have some auto-defense weapons to save you). Such an anti-climatic way to die!-WTF is up with the nukes? I hear the alarm system and instantly panic-If you get hit by a sniper,  your astronaut get blasted so far off the screen that flying back to the portal with your limited oxygen supply is nearly impossible in the one-player mode. You almost need a buddy to help you out in that situation, especialy because the snipers can track/predict your flight path.-Sketchy ""houdini"" asteroids at the last level. Woah...Overall, awesome game!"

After rereading the other reviews, I think my negative reaction was due to the fact that I was just not that good at the game.So, I hid my review and sporatically played over the course of the next week.Now I have to say that I was wrong.  As play progresses, your get better upgrades for your ship and base making the game more enjoyable.Unfortunately, I still haven't had a chance to play multiplayer.  I did hook it up to my Steam Link and it looks great on my 55"" LED.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My Original review:These reviews must be written by the developer and his friends.  I found the game boring.  They claim it was inspired by asteroids.  Actually, they took asteroids and made it so you can only shoot one bullet at a time.  The controls seem very sluggish.I played 5 games and I am not sure if I will ever play it again.I will say that I have not played multiplayer yet.  I will try it out on my Steam Link.  If it turns out that it is more fun then I will come back and update this review."
,Recommended,396590,18593233,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,rodweis,"CMYW is an enjoyable re-imagining of asteroids.  The control mechanism is a little different from the original asteroids, in that ship rotation retains momentum, making it challenging to both fly and shoot where you are trying to aim.  The action starts off slowly, but quickly builds and the player must balance the risk of leaving their base and the reward of more points / kills.  An ideal game for a short gaming session.Rating:RGB / CMYW"
,Not Recommended,396590,24052793,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Jammin Hyaku,"The competitive mode was interesting, the cooperative mode lacked in content and meaning in my opinion. Very little content overall, two modes and thats all. Worst part is, is that is lagged on a relatively powerful laptop. With such simplistic graphics it really should be able to hold a much better framerate than it did."

,Recommended,396590,18683505,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,VinylBlaster,"As a big fan of Atari's Asteroids I can say this game is a nice fresh look to the idea.  I like the idea of playing local multiplayer with friends.  That being said I wish the controls were a little tighter, the over rotation is really frustrating, especially because the game gets hard enough on its own fairly quick.  I had originally started playing with my Xbox controller, but after a bit I had to switch to my keyboard, as it felt tighter than the controller.  Maybe this will be remedied in the future.  As for 4 player fun though you cant beat the price."

Perfectly suited to multiplayer, and the developer keeps adding little bits and pieces that make it even more fun.  Definitely recommend it."

,Recommended,396590,18524891,"Posted: 17 October, 2015",all,Waalflower,"If only we can have more Atari-like games on Steam!Pros:-Objective: Its the classic Atari game Asteroids, now with enemies to keep you on your toes and resource collection to further increase your high score.-Graphics: Kick @$$ Especially when the nukes go off or you lose your portal.-Music and Sound Effects: Feels like this is a game from back in the day.-Controls: Fluid. Much simpler when compared to original Asteroids.-Co-op: New major feature added to the original concept.Cons:-Co-op: Feature is local only.TL;DR:This game is Asteroids with added features to make the game more enjoyable. I can easily see this being a fun little party game you play with your buds when you want a change of pace from Mario Party. The price tag is an excellent deal considering how much money you would have to dump to enjoy the origianl Asteroids at an arcade. Give this gem a whirl; you won't regret it."

,Not Recommended,396590,19258837,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,Element,"This games pretty basic and gets boring extremely quickly. The concept is to stop asteroids from hitting the portal and it's extremely easy as well. It's good looking though because of it's cool, unique art style.Like I said, it's a game that gets boring quickly but with more support, I believe the developers can do a lot more with the game and maybe even make some cooler ones. I have to give it a thumbs down because of it's lack of  content but I support it as well as the developers."
