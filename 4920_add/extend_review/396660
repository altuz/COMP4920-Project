76561198018474677,Recommended,396660,25437516,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,ekidhardt,"Tahira was a fun, but brief, adventure that in the end, felt like the first hour of a really good movie.It ended when the character and story development was JUST starting to get rolling, JUST starting to hook you in--and then abruptly, it's over---clearly paving the way to a sequel or two.Which, incidentally I'll be buying--because Tahira seems to have nailed a lot of the fundamental aspects of gaming, correctly.Most of your time, and I mean 90%, will be fighting. And the fights are large-scale, multi-staged, arenas which make for some pretty triumphant moments if you use the battle mechanics correctly to your advantage.The battles are fairly long, with scripted events, and virtually every battle is a fight against overwhelming odds, which at first glance look impossible--but it's pretty gratifying to 'hulk smash' their superior forces.I've been a strategy and turn/based strategy fan since the term came into existence, and in Tahira, was content with the level of balance and difficulty that I ran into. What it lacked in dyanmics in terms of NPC skills, it made up for largely in the size and range of options of the battle fields. Essentially, while there weren't a lot of individual skills, there was a lot you could do with what little you had--so in the end, it was still fun and challenging.The graphics/animation are hand-crafted and look wonderful, similarly, the sound effects and music quality are well chosen.My largest gripe with the game is that it ended too soon--I don't want a half-scoop of ice cream! :)In terms of improvement, I think the characters could be better developed, and more dialogue could have been added to the game to make it seem longer. Dialogue between characters did not include descriptive elements (only direct, spoken lines), which I think is a missed opportunity for immersion into a well crafted, mystical environment. Humans relate to emotions--and if players can become privy to the internal dialogues and states of protagonist characters, they can relate to--and connect with them better; this is the difference between a comic-book and a novel. And as Tahira is a story driven game, it would be greatly improved by adding narrative and descriptive elements to add to it's already solid combat systems.Overall, I'd give it an 8/10, for 3 guys, it's quite a job well done. I hope they use this game as a template to launch future games with expanded character abilities, subtantially more dialogue and descriptive elements, as well as special attention to individual character (personality) development.I had fun! looking forward to the next one!"

Great tactical battles, compelling story, intelligent dialog, nice art, and a UI that doesn't get in the way. I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn based tactics.If you know Banner Saga's combat system, you'll be right at home. This is a good thing, very good even - it's an excellent system which deserves to be reinterpreted and iterated upon. There are interesting differences, but most importantly the battles you have to fight are open-ended, large scale, and challenging.The is no strategical layer to speak of. I prefer that to Banner Saga's trainwreck of one, to be honest.There are very few choices and branches in the story, which would have been welcome, but it's not a terrible omission either. The setting for the story is original, believable and interesting; the characters, while not developed that much, are likable. The story line itself is enjoyable and engaging.I typically don't place too much value on dialog, but I've been positively surprised here. It's interesting and smartly written, while staying short enough to not get in the way of the story or the gameplay.The art is also quite similar in style to Banner Saga's, and that's also a very good thing. Clearly the budget there is not quite the same, but that other game (being one of the most strikingly beautiful games in recent memory) is not a fair comparison. The first impression might be a bit less than overwhelming, but it grew on me quite well.The UI is maybe the thing I have the least good things to say about, although it's not really bad in any obvious ways. It looks a bit meh, and sometimes demands a few more awkward clicks than seems necessary, but nothing major.On the whole, the largest negative I found about this game is how short it is, as it left me wanting for more. Hardly much of a negative though, is it ?"

,Not Recommended,396660,25314965,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,darksol92,"Seemingly full of promise... In reality full of repetitive boredom. EVERY battle feels identical, most of your units are generic and randomly seem to carry on to the next battle or completely disappear, every battle begins with a massive enemy army facing your tiny but powerful army and quickly turns into a chaotic melee where your hero units (except the main character) are completely overpowered but never seem to get stronger, in the end it just feels like ""how many ways can you defeat the same monotonous massive army"" even the characters are rather lackluster, the main character's horse feels like the most developed character. *shocked whinny*. I thought this game seemed neat at the beginning but by battle 4 was horribly bored. Continuing onward just rewards me with more identical battles, more generic units, and more beating the same generic enemy with a stick, 50 times a battle. Frankly this game could have been salvageable with some actual battle rewards, there currently seems to be no reward for keeping any of your units alive except to avoid the game over screen, and your level-ups on the generic units aren't really very helpful, an extra 2 guard, 1 attack, and 2 HP does nothing when the enemies swarm like ants.Overall I thought it seemed cool at the start but it quickly became a boring slog with unfortunately equally boring characters.The ending also leaves a LOT to be desired, it looks set up for a sequel but I can honestly say after playing this one I won't be buying it."
76561197969417125,Recommended,396660,28319223,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,G00N3R,"Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire is a tactics RPG, with a turn based combat system. The kingdom of Avestan is being invaded by the evil Astral Empire, and Princess Tahira is attempting to lead the surviving civilians to safety, with the aid of a small group of soldiers.When this game popped up in my Steam discovery queue, my immediate thought was that it reminded me of the Banner Saga series. Obviously its not exactly the same, there are a few differences in the gameplay mechanics, but its a pretty good comparison to give you an idea of what to expect. If you enjoyed the Banner Saga, you should enjoy Tahira.The majority of the 12 hour campaign is spent in combat. In most battles the player will have around 10-15 units, going up against 25-30 enemies. With so many units on the battlefield, which is laid out as a square grid, positioning is quite important. Some maps have narrow chokepoints which you can take advantage of to reduce the number of enemies that can actually hit you on each turn, but you also have to be careful not to block off your own units.Positioning also affects damage per hit. If a unit is standing next to an ally, they get a defence bonus. However, if a unit is surrounded by multiple enemies, they take more damage. A couple of maps have ledges that you can knock enemies off for an instant kill. Each unit has a value for health and armour. Health is only damaged when armour has been reduced to 0. Armour can be restored by using willpower, or a supply cache, but health can't be restored during a battle. If any of the player's main heroes die in combat, the result is an instant mission fail, but you are allowed to lose normal soldiers.The player has access to three different types of units, each of which has their own special moves, which also cost willpower. Knights can simultaneously attack the two squares in front of them. Amazon style women can use a shockwave attack that damages the four squares on each side of them. Samurai style mercenaries get an extra attack for that turn each time they make a kill, which allows you to continue chaining kills for as long as there are enemies in movement range.The one obvious omission is that the player doesn't get any archers. Princess Tahira can use a magical staff to do ranged AoE damage, but its limited by willpower, and I kept running out. The enemy does get archers, but they're extremely weak, doing very little damage. This lack of ranged combat is the main weakness in the combat mechanics, and must be addressed if the developers release a sequel.The story is entertaining, but there's no voice acting at all, and the player doesn't get any significant dialogue options or moral choices. Again, if these points could be improved in a sequel, it would turn a good game into a great game. The only bug I noticed was related to keybindings. You can change them, but they seemed to reset to default every time I closed and reloaded the game. However, I mostly controlled everything with the mouse anyway, so its not the end of the world.Tahira is a fun game, and I definitely recommend checking it out, especially if you like tactical combat. There's enough content to justify a full price purchase."

Unusually, the game is heavily imbued with a Middle Eastern flavour. So refreshing on both counts.The story works perfectly with the haunting musical score as well as with the gorgeous artwork and beautiful animations.  The overall effect is one of simplicity and richness simultaneously.The combat (4 difficulty levels, excellent tutorials) ramps up to become deeply complex and tactical.  Lovers of turn based tactics games will be in their element.  But the devs are to be commended on their inclusive approach as people who prefer less combat or who focus mostly on story are able to turn the combat off.There are obvious but not overtly stated parallels with current political events and the game does not shy away from the dark and the anguished but there are enjoyably light hearted moments, particularly involving The Claw and The Hammer.  And just for the record, I love the horse!As with all games, influences from various sources can be seen but Tahira is very much its own game.  I am hoping for a sequel."
,Recommended,396660,29875029,Posted: 12 February,all,r47926,"Tahira is an indie turn-based RPG with large battles, very enjoyable combat mechanics and an entertaining story.Even at the full price (of only 15 Euro) there's really no reason not to play this (unless you absolutely hate turn based games).Highly recommended! :)CombatThe battles in Tahira are a lot larger than in most turn-based RPGs (e.g. in some battles you control 20 units) and there are usually some side quests and varying victory conditions.There are some fun and interesting features like ambush, were you can hide some of your units, which makes them invisible and removes them from the usual turn order. Those hidden units can be revealed any time during the battle, even during the enemies turn, to use the element of surprise and attack with additional bonuses.Just like in Banner Saga, you won't have many mage units and your units have 2 defensive stats (HP and guard). Unlike Banner Saga, you don't get to choose which stat you want to attack and a lowered HP does not decrease your damage output. Instead, a unit without guard points can get hit critically more easily.Guard can be restored, but HP cannot be healed. Also, battles are divided into several smaller ones and your stats are not restored after everyone - You need to plan ahead.Unit classesAt the current battle, my army consists of knights, heavy mercenaries (think barbarians), light mercenaries (ninja-like) and Tahira herself (mage). Also, a hero joins for every class in your army, which is basically a stronger version of its class.So far, the only one with ranged attacks is Tahira, so a lot of the tactics in this game comes from positioning and combining the special attacks of the different characters.Story and GraphicsIt's not your usual high fantasy setting or story. The story is well written and mainly presented within dialog boxes. I didn't like the art very much when I looked at some screenshots before I bought it, but now I have to say it fits the game quite well. Especially the combat maps look great!"

76561197999231643,Recommended,396660,34462873,Posted: 24 August,all,The Professional,"Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire is a good, little game. While I enjoyed it, I've seen some reviews here absolutely gushing with praise and I can't quite understand them. It's a good game. Is it incredible? No, not really. The story is good though nothing particularly amazing and it desperately needs a sequel to tie up some loose ends and to resolve the cliffhanger ending.Most of the reviews compare Tahira to The Banner Saga and for good reason, since the combat is nearly identical with only a handful of small differences. Graphically, it is almost disintguishable from the Banner Saga during combat and if you told me they were part of the same series, just covering different locations or something along those lines I'd believe you. Where the Banner Saga let you choose between targeting the opponent's health or guard, Tahira forces you to work through the guard stat before you can whittle down the health and dispatch the enemy. You only have three different classes to work with (four if you count Tahira, herself, being unique to the other characters you use) with a serious lack of ranged options. In terms of story and choices, Tahira comes up a bit short. There are only a couple of choices you can make (as of the writing of this review I can only clearly remember one though I'm 95% certain that there was another one) and they don't really make any difference. Where the Banner Saga prompted you with choices that had real ramifications for the story and the combat, Tahira is more like reading a novella with combat segments after each chapter.While this may all sound a bit negative, Tahira really is a good, enjoyable game. However, I would only suggest that you temper your expectations a bit. It is rather short and the ending comes up rather abruptly with a fairly large cliffhanger. The combat is good though nothing groundbreaking and some of the later battles can get a bit dull as Tahira's response to up the difficulty is to just throw more and more enemies at you as oppose to having different objectives to accomplish. The music and artwork are both very good and the Middle Eastern inspired setting is a fun and refreshing viewpoint that we don't see in enough games and could certainly do with some more of.If you enjoyed the Banner Saga, you'll enjoy Tahira. They are, like I said, shockingly similar. It is not, however, perfect and it's similarity to the Banner Saga works against it. I feel bad constantly lining the two games up and pointing out this or that but they really are that similar. However, in the end, I have to give Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire the thumbs up.  Pick it up, especially if it's on sale, you'll probably enjoy it."

It is somewhat short, yet the atmosphere of the game is excellent and while very similar to TBS in visual style, it is still pleasing and fresh to look at.The combat can be very hard on higher difficulties (played through one second hardest myself) but is very rewarding as a result of this. A somewhat confusing save system  had me replaying quite a hard mission at one point but I actually didn't mind because I enjoyed the combat a lot. There isn't a huge amount of unit variety but I personally didn't mind this too much either because of the generally epic feel of the fights.Worth the price in my opinion and I would gladly purchase a sequel :)"

The scattered humour provides a welcome diversion to the often dark atmosphere.I’m looking forward to moving to the next level of difficulty, and exploring some of the alternative incarnations of the characters; so far I’ve chosen options that show Tahira as statesmanlike and compassionate, so it will be interesting to see how a more ruthless aspect is developed !"

All works perfectly and, even on the moderate dificulty (""Voyarer"" as it's called) it poses a great deal of threat. It's easy to lose all your troopes on a single mistake; plan your moves carefully.The story itself is very compeling, with the ""kingdom under siege"" (no pun intended) fell and constant persue of your foes. It's not a standard game, and as i said, it follows the idea of ""Banner Saga"", so your caracters (the ""Heroes"") will heve their stories and intereactions that are unique; you can't let then die in any circustance, and you won't want to.The story is told by texts only, as in ""Banner Saga"", but all scene are show, not only a caravan; it could have audio on the speaches, which would make even more compeling, but it doesn't affect the game interest in any way.I beleave that will be another game following - since the ending (no spoilers or anything) leaves a lot of questions open and a ""cliff hanger"" ... i hope sincerly they release a follow up soon, so i can play it too.Great job for the studio that made (and quoting steam and ""Kritigal"" analysis) ""rehumanizes the tactics genre"" since you'll care for the characters, the objective, the journey and every detail of the story. This is great for Tactical games (or EVERY GAME for that mater) where usualy is just a series of base building battles one after the other; ""Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire"" is not like that, it's a series of events, stories and conflicts that shape the world and the characters as it goes.Really, really a great job indeed..."

I couldn't get past the fact that you have to use the keyboard to move around a 2D map, and that's after a tediously long conversation with a horse. Spiderweb games do a better job of scratching this retro itch."

While still holding on to its dark humor.I've only scratched the surface, and as such I will need more time in game before I write a proper review.The last two hours alone was nevertheless worth the price. The review will stay postive as such, but I'll let the potential buyer know what they can expect."
,Not Recommended,396660,35455967,Posted: 3 October,all,Aliy,Nothing wrong with the game BUT the ending. It's a cliffhanger. If it was any other kind of ending i would have gladly given a recommendation. The ending ruined my experience.
