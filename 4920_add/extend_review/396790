Making puzzles feel fresh is difficult in this genre so bravo, developers.The hidden object puzzles are relatively sparse and therefore easy, but the game isn't exactly overflowing with them so it breaks the game up nicely.I had absolutely no interest in the storyline whatsoever until the ending scene, which was a shame as it was a really intruiging ending!The character models gave me a bit of a chuckle with their wandering eyes, but I thought they looked good. The game looks quite nice as well, no complaints about the graphics.An effort was made with the voice acting, I've heard better and I've heard worse but it's nice when the effort has been put in to at least include voice acting.Not so fun bitsThe UI in this game had me so salty, because if you click too close to the bottom of the screen on your inventory, it'll take you back a scene. I don't know why this annoys me so much in HOGs but it just felt like a simple oversight.I found most of the plot and game progression to be almost nonsensical - I'd be staring at the screen trying to use items and the one that made the least sense is the one I'd need. This made the game feel a bit comedic? I don't know if it was intentional.My big bug bear with this game was the poor English. I have no problem with translated games that are made in another language, I'm just glad to get to play another hidden object game, but some of the phrasing in the text and tooltips either makes no sense or has been translated badly. I doubt this will bother most people but I just think that attention to small detail like that makes a big difference.TL:DR - it's an alright HOG. I prefer the Frankenstein game from Jetdog as it feels like a fully fledged HOG, but this feels like a tablet port at times. Again, the price is fair for the game time (which is quite short unless you get stuck on one of the harder puzzles). It has achievements but they didn't pop up for me until I exited the game, so don't panic if you don't see them straight away! If you have a bit of money in your Steam wallet and want a relaxed game to play for a couple hours, this is the one.Thanks for reading!"

But Dracula's Legacy fair a bit better than Sinister City in gameplay wise.Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're okay. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Easy and Advanced.There are sixteen different achievements to be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements that needs to be completed before they can be obtained. The achievements are rewarded after exiting the game.The inventory panel doesn't have an option to have it lock in place. But it does slides up and down.All of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists. Some of them do require little or no interaction.Most of the puzzles in the game are rather simple and easy to solve without much difficulty for some.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, there's a bit of plot holes in the storyline, which breeds a bit of confusion in the player's mind. As it was mentioned before Dracula's Legacy fair a bit better than Sinister City in gameplay wise. But there isn't much of replayability nor its' story rememberable. I would recommend this game but not at full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/396790"

The puzzles didn't come with instructions so sometimes it could be tricky to figure out what they wanted you to do. They also had some dialog continuity issues. (e.g. you call Matt your boyfriend, the ghost calls him your fiance, lol). Some of the hidden objects would be called something that wasn't actually right so it could take you a second to figure out what they wanted (e.g. a saucepan when it was a teapot) and the ending was kinda like... well it just ends. LOL. But honestly for so cheap, it was a fun little game to pass the time."

Like why would I need a watering can to put gas in the tank? Because I didn't, I needed to make a funnel. Or I was looking for a comb as instructed, when the actual object in the scene was a hairbrush. The hidden object scenes ended up being like ""click everything, it has to be one of these."" The puzzles weren't much better. If I had to describe them with one word, it would be ""tedious."" And there was way too much running back and forth searching for items I remembered seeing before, but couldn't pick up then, because ""of course you can't pick up the shotgun now, you haven't found any shells yet.""Usually I try not to skip stuff, but in this one I ended up skipping quite a few puzzles, because I just wanted the game to end. Could have skipped the ending as well, because it explained nothing. I'm all for stories were everything it not spelled out for you, but this game really had no ending, it just stopped. If I have to find something positive, it could be that I got the achievement for Expert mode, although I'm quite certain I selected Casual when I started the game.I can't really recommend this, except if you get it really cheap and are willing to go through an inordinate amount of the typical game mechanics silliness present in this type of games.

The hidden object scenes are rather boring and the adventure elements too often boils down to 'find the key, get one item, use that item, repeat', but the presentation is decent and the story is quite interesting.For 14 cent you can't go wrong and even for the regular price of 3 bucks it's an enjoyable way to spend around two hours."
,Not Recommended,396790,23138369,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,adam1224,"Hard to pick yes or now, I'll go with the not recommended option, because of the questionable quality of the game.The game is unusually cheap, only 3€, less than half of the usual Hidden Object Games ( ~8€) - this can be a strong point if you want to get it - around 1€ it's an okay purchase if you know what are you buying into.The game was obviously made for machines with touchscreens  - there is no accuracy to speak about, sometimes clicking on the middle of the screen brings up an action that's linked ot the very right side of the screen.  Active zones are light up if pointed at, effectively showing how huge the clickable area is - while this is not a real negative, it takes away the precision from the game, resulting in much less actions / screen, and puzzles are also affected: instead of a hold and turn rotating puzzle, you need to click on the parts, because that's easier to do with touchscreen.There are several problems with the game's english - having typos (they / there, can or can't) to the point of it was calling a half plastic glass a watering can (wasn't even used for that purpose, it was a funnel), a tool handle was called a broomstick, achievements asking for completing a game on expert while in the game the harder difficulty is called advanced mode.While these doesn't affect the game, it reflects some of the care,attention  and (maybe the lack of?) money the game got.Speaking about money: I'm pretty sure they had budget problems during the creation of the game. The full cinematic parts are done relatively well. Not outstanding, but pretty nice for HOGs.  But at the same time, the quality of ingame animation hit rockbottom after a point. At the start of the game you crack a wall with a pickaxe - the pickaxe is swinging, like you're moving it above your shoulder. Pretty nice.  Later on fumigation of bees is the fumigator floating up to the beenest, and not even a single puff. They just disappear. Using a diving mask to go underwater?  Mask floating to the water, then it's accessible in a way that you can just move underwater. Birds flying like in the infamous Birdemic movie. Items not even being rotated when used - keys floating to locks while pointing to the other direction, and things like this.So in short:- The usual vampire story, nothing of interest- Supereasy interaction, which results in oversimplification- Really nice stills (environment, characters) and cutscenes, but terrible item-interaction animations- Questionable english at many pointsIf you want a good hidden object game to get into the genre, avoid this game. If you want this anyways, get it on a sale."

However the graphics are older and a bit piexleated for wide screens. The story is decent enough but the achievements are buggy. All of my achievements popped up after exiting the game and none during the game. So that is a bit disappointing because as you play the game you don't know what you've achieved along the way.

76561198042646749,Not Recommended,396790,34460551,Posted: 24 August,all,kris.aalst,"GameplayDracula's Legacyis a Hidden Object Game (HOG). So there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.I've played a few HOGs and when it comes to HOPs,Dracula's Legacygets the worst score yet in my book, for three reasons:You're only shown a list of four objects at a time. When you find one of these objects, it's replaced with another object to look for. Nothing happens if you click on an object that's not on the list yet but will appear on it later on.Every object in the HOPs is huge so searching isn't really necessary, justglancingis enough to see what you're looking for. I'm not saying the objects should be so minute that the HOPs become a matter of pixel hunting, not at all, but good HOGs have shown there's a golden mean.There are hardly anyextraitems added to the HOPs. Almost all of the items you see are objects that will need to be crossed off the list while solving the HOP.Together, this means the HOPs are ridiculously easy. You look at the very short list, pick one item from the list, look up a bit and immediately spot the item, click on it and repeat. There's no challenge whatsoever.The same goes for the other puzzles inDracula's Legacy, actually: they are way too easy and offer no challenge whatsoever, with the exception of two puzzles. Those two puzzles use rotating discs as their puzzle mechanism, where rotating one piece of the puzzle into place means you move another part of the puzzle, too, so completing the puzzle relies mostly on trial and error instead of thinking it through. The other puzzles are so easy they mostly boil down to 'just drag these items to the position they clearly belong in'.As in most HOGs, interactable objects light up. InDracula's Legacy, objects keep lighting up as interactable even when you're finished with them. This gets annoying after a while. Playing the game on Expert Mode may fix this in the sense that interactable objects may not light up at all, but I don't know for sure.Speaking of annoying, on several occasions I tried an action that didn't work, only to find out later that it is in fact the action required to advance. It seems you can only perform certain actions when the game is ready for it, meaning after you've performed a different but completely unrelated action somewhere else.One last thing that influences gameplay in a bad way is that the game's English is rather bad. Sometimes you're not sure what the game wants you to look for because it's described inaccurately. Or you encounter strange things like an item that's labeled 'pike' but gets labeled 'spear' when placed into your inventory. Or what to think about mistakes that clearly point to lazy writing, for example:""The flashlight batteries are have no charge''. Lastly, the bad English sometimes results in laughable statements like""It's not worth bothering him""when you click on a monster that's looking for you and would rip off your head if it spots you, so they clearly meant to say something like ""I shouldn't attract its attention"".StoryYou play a young woman who's accompanied by her fiancé when they encounter a monster. In the chase that follows, you fall down a hole into an underground dungeon. So you'll need to find your way out, find out what happened to your fiancé and try not to run into the monster again, if at all possible.As the title reveals,Dracula's Legacy's has to do with vampires, which you'll encounter about half a minute into the game. So you'll need to kill some vampires and get your fiancé out of their clutches. And that's all the story there is toDracula's Legacy.Mind you, the game hints to a lot more going on with the main character (even more than she herself seems to realize), but it never goes deeper into that. There are several encounters that create interesting questions, but the story never comes back to any of those questions it created. At the very end of the game, they introduce an event that seems to finally be the point when some of the earlier questions may get an answer, but the game just ends. So the story is incohesive and clearly unfinished, sometimes throwing new elements at you but never once running with any of those elements to actually tell the story behind it. It's a bit sad and it ultimately leads to a completely unsatisfying experience.Graphics and soundDracula's Legacy's static graphics look beautiful but overall they're too colourful. With less saturation the graphics would have looked a lot more realistic and would have fitted the dark theme of the game much better.The characters don't look very impressive, reminiscent of how characters looked in late 1990s to early 2000s games. Character animations are mostly just plain bad.The music is atmospheric. The sound effects are sharp. So the audio is of very good quality… except for the voices. The voice acting is mediocre and the voices are way too quiet. You can adjust the volume for the music and for the sound effects, but not for the voices.On Steam's extra featuresDracula's Legacyhas 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.Of the 16 Steam Achievements, 10 are story-related and unmissable. The remaining 6 achievements are awarded for various optional tasks like completing the game on Expert Mode, not skipping puzzles, and so on.Achievements are bugged but not in the sense that they don't work:Achievements only pop when you exit the game. So you don't get the usual immediate feedback that lets you know you got it right. After you exit the game the achievements you triggered during the play session pop up in rapid succession and only then are they shown on your achievements page.Achievements are awarded even though they shouldn't be: I skipped a puzzle and played the game on Casual Mode, so that should have cost me two achievements, but after finishing the game I still received all the achievements."

Being contacted by a spirit, you're going to find the story behind the town you're visiting and about vampires.I admit that I was expecting at one moment in the plot to see the protagonist being revealed as the daughter of some powerful creature but unfortunately for me, the developers kept some secrets, hoping for a sequel. Yet, the main plot is solid. The game is called Dracula's Legacy anyway, that's probably why I thought that I will know who the heroin was really.If you're used to these developers, you'll remember Frankenstein: Master of Death, Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends or Sinister City in the same genre. So you're used to their style. But weirdly enough, this game has another style in game. I found it more cartoonish, save for the cutscenes. Also, I found easier to navigate in the scenes as when you're done with a chapter, the places you just explored are locked.However, the gameplay is the standard one: hidden objects, puzzles.... and slowness. I found the game very very slow: for your inventory to show, the cursor.... And there is a bug that made exit a lot the game until I looked into the walkthrough to be quick. Indeed, in a puzzle, I had to place shapes to cover and apparently, it doesn't support a lot of clicks, as I couldn't click anything after apart moving the mouse.The HO scenes are always beginning with three hidden items and one that can be found easily. Given the fact that some must be solved by a puzzle, it's not easy to finish it under 30 sec for an achievement.I'm quite mixed about this game but I'm still giving it a thumb up as I've enjoyed it, perhaps not quite like I wanted."

The graphics were good (although for me, the cutscenes were slightly blurry) and the girl was fairly hot as protagonists in these types of games go (so, it's got that goin' for it). Played without issue on Linux Mint 18.1 (Wine/PlayOnLinux).Besides that, some gameplay issues for me were:The hidden object puzzles are better described as, 'object puzzles'.Devs: Can you identify the frog in this picture?Me: You mean the frog right there in plain sight that you've made no attempt to hide? ...uhm, yes. Yes I can.Devs: Well what about if in the next puzzle we put it on the left side of the screen instead of the right?Me: Is this a trick? The frog is obviously right there with very little else even around it.Devs: Okay, we'll admit, you're good. But what about if in the very next puzzle, we tilt the frog so that it is at a slight angle? Muhaha...Me: Come on, guys. Seriously?The active areas are HUGE.If you're ever in doubt of where to click while playing this game, just close your eyes and randomly move your cursor to anywhere on the screen and click once. You're bound to hit something.The mini game directions were often extremely ambiguous.On a couple of them, even after solving the game I wasn't able to completely relate the directions to the solution. However, for most of the games, the object is apparent when you see the game. So this isn't a very material issue.All that being said, I'm still going to give this a mild recommend for those that think they might enjoy an extremely casual point & click mystery game with 'in-plain-sight' object puzzles rather than hidden ones. I got it for $0.50 and have no regrets.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.1 hrs although I've played at least 4 hrs and have completed the game."

It is bug free, but there are numerous translation errors, and the UI fights you the whole way. For example, if you use the wrong item, you get no feedback from the game. It behaves exactly as if your click didn't register, and sometimes it really doesn't register, leaving you bewildered. The ending is strange, nothing resolved, but not a proper cliffhanger either. It does seem to be angling for a sequel, anyway.As always, play Artifex stuff instead. This is really only recommended if you have run out of good HOGs."

You either miss them or click them while trying to click something else.c) already solved areas still sparkle, even though you can't do anything anymore.Aside from that, I recommend it.

It's a very clichéd (to the point of being idiotic) story with flat characters and atrocious dialog. It's kinda funny to hear the voice actors, who are good, struggle to breathe some life into it. Well, funny but sad.Otherwise, the puzzles are easy to the point of being trivial. The point-and-click adventuring is a piece of cake: you are practically told what to do when you click on something. There are only a few hidden-object scenes, and they are ridiculously easy.There are some very talented people involved in the making of this! Unfortunately they and we are all let down by the writer.Note that this game has Steam achievements, but they are only applied when you exit the game, not when you actually achieve them.The ""cliffhanger"" ending suggests that there will be a sequel. Let's hope that this ain't true."

I wouldn't drink it, even if I'm thirsty.""). It's a mixed bag all told, but even then I'd almost recommend it if not for the bugs. OH GOOD GRAVY, THE BUGS! Roughly 2 hours of my counted playing time was actually spent trying to solve a puzzle that, it turns out, is hopelessly bugged. For some players, such as my self, the game is ultimately unplayable and unbeatable after a certain point because of such bugs. And there are MANY of them. It's even acknowledged in the official forums, and the general response from the playerbase has been ""Yeah, it sucks. Oh well. You get what you pay for..."" The publishers? They're silent on the matter -- but  they can't respond fast enough when forum-users try to talk about a walkthrough (THAT little discussion needs to be silenced, apparently!). I'm told the game is unfortunately short, but I wouldn't know -- the bugs bar the way.EDIT: After reinstalling a few times, I finally got past (most) of the bugs. The game IS absurdly short; the puzzles are generally terrible, largely unrelated to what's going on in the game; if Dracula has anything to do with it, it's not something that is ever mentioned in the game itself -- they seem to have just assumed ""Dracula"" is the same as ""vampire""; and good gravy will you get sick of hearing that things are locked and require keys. After this, I feel like I could help summon Gozer the Gozerian because I am the KEYMASTER. Oh, and the bad translations only get worse as the game wends towards its fizzle of a conclusion. Definitely not recommended -- get their fairy tale games instead. They're richer, prettier, with better puzzles and better puzzle integration, as well as better writing, language localization, and better acting."

I'm far from disappointed, I'm in fact very happy with such amazing (although short) game.Vivian and her boyfriend search for clues about her past and the meanings of her recurring dreams. They end up in a mysterious town filled with dark secrets. Matt disappears and the player's journey to rescue him leads to an amazing adventure.The story is simple but well articulated, most actions make sense when gathering objects, and sometimes the results will surprise you!I really enjoyed the cutscenes, the graphics are OK, nothing extreme, but the developers put some effort into it, and for me is good enough! The locations are beautiful, I just wish they were native 1080p. The design is extremely well done, I felt emerged in each scene, and never in the same place twice.The HO scenes are really good and interactive, which makes it even better. They are far from confusing, and avoid giving the player a dosage of frustration.The puzzles are the ones I felt more difficult in. Some are extremely challenging, but all skippable if needed.I wish there was a sequel somewhere becauseDracula's Legacyreally does need one. Maybe the end is exactly what the creators intended, but I cannot stop feeling there was so much more into this story.Could this game have been longer? Maybe, HO's games usually don't take much longer than 5-10 hours (depending on your skills). The advanced mode always gives a reason to go back a second time, if not for the cool scenarios!A fun game for HO's fans and everyone else who can't resist a good adventure.7/10"

Yay. I did not pick up an item in one scene and as I finished the other thing I was suppsoed to do in that scene, this area locked off and was unavalible when I tried to read a guide and find out wtf I was missing.

Protip to avoid this bug:pick up the log by the fireplace before you put out the fireThe game also has a strange soundtrack, which normally does not bother me, but did in this game. Some of the sounds were just off and annoying. I also don't know which time period this was supposed to be from, tbut the music was all over the place.It also has some annoying solutions, for example; you find acar keyand try to use it on thecar, but it doesn't work because  you're supposed to use it on thetrunkfirst which probably would have been fine, hadn't the act of trying to get it to work on thecartold you that you needcar keyto get it to work, which is exactly what you're doing wtfgamewhatdoyouwantfromme.It also has some odd situations in which you complete a task of some kind, and you get ""you gained -item-"" without any expalination of how completing this particular task would lead to you gaining this item.It also has a lot of unnecessary cutscenes, which is fun for the 'skip no dialogue or cutscenes' achievement /sThe game also has one of the most 'to be continue'd endings I've encountered in these games, so the story feelds pretty ruind by that. I guess they fixed it so people can't guess the ending by having no ending at all. Yay.It does have something going for it, I suppose; it's pretty cheap compared to other games in the genre.

Many of the point and click puzzles suffered from ""no not the sword to cut the fish, find and use the fish knife to cut the fish"" arbitrariness.  There weren't many HO scenes and they aren't very difficult.  Objects in the HO scenes tended to be large, but there are some new mechanics that I hadn't seen except in Frankenstein: Master of Death, by the same developer/publisher.The major problem I had was picking up the wrong item from inventory.  It was awfully easy to grab the wrong item and you can't right click to drop, or left click outside the zoomed in area to drop either - standard UI behavior in other HO games I've played, so that always tripped me up.The story wasn't too bad.

Judging from walk through's on YouTube, I'm almost at the end of the game, but frankly, it's just not good enough to play it through again and finish it, and it's not just because of the glitch.What Hidden Object Games lack in tense game play they should make up for in plot and appealing settings to explore. The plot just wasn't there in this game. Voice acting was poor, and the combination of 3D graphics (which had all the fidelity of a PS1 cut scene) and hand-drawn elements just did not mesh together well. The game was not enjoyable to look at, nor was there really any reason to care about the story and its characters.The game play itself was fairly par for this type of game, including the annoying habit of the character throwing away items between screens for no discernible reason (Why would you ever get rid of a crowbar? They can be used for so many things) and needing items when you know any normal person would complete the task with their hands. That may be part of the charm in these kind of games for many, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a detriment, but certainly nothing new is brought to the table.Simply put, there are plenty of better Hidden Object Games out there."

The plot was B-movie at best, and I actually found Sinister City more enjoyable than this - at least I got some laughs out of that one!  The ending of Dracula's Legacy makes very little sense to me, but then much of the game was illogical anyway in my opinion.I didn't experience any real bugs although there were times when an area would continue sparkling after I was done with it, making me think I had to go back and do something else there.  There is no journal or notebook, as you might find in some other games, to remind you what your objectives are.  However, the game does move you on to new areas once you pass a certain point and doesn't allow you to go back, so at least you're not wandering aimlessly around every previous scene looking for items.I got it very cheap in the Hallowe'en sale, but I still don't recommend it.  It was not the cheesy fun I expected, but more slap-your-forehead illogical and frustrating.

Long story short; you spend just as much time confused, but you spend it staring blankly at the three screens you've clicked on every pixel of, instead of ten screens worth of stuff you've half-examined.* They went with a ""sleek"" interface that keeps trying to minimize while I'm trying to use it.  The mouse controls are also painfully floaty and imprecise -- it's as if the hitboxes for small items are the size of a full quarter of the screen, but are placed so imprecisely that clicking directly on the thing you can see won't do it.  Symptoms of a bad mobile port maybe?* The puzzles are more linear :  IE, at any given point, only one or possibly two puzzles are available for you to do, and you must do them to unlock the next set of one to two puzzles.  In other games, there were four or five areas full of puzzles available at any given time, and completing any one of them would add another one to the list.  The more linear design makes it easy to get stuck in this game, and in at least one place, the hint system is wrong about what to do next.  It thinks I have an item I can't get yet, and won't give me hints on getting that item (I need a valve to put fuel into a gas can : it keeps telling me to put fuel into the car).* Similarly, most screens / things to click on have exactly one item of use.  When you click on it, the item goes to your inventory and the screen closes and you can't open it again.  It's a little jarring, and reminds me that I am trying to accomplish a linear, pre-set series of events, rather than exploring an actual location or story with any degree of freedom.* Puzzles are less...creative, or make less sense, than previous installments.  In the first townlike area, there are no less than six things that require funny-shaped keys. Surely some of these could have been replaced with something less blatantly ""collect item to continue""...?* The story is about the same quality as previous installments, so I'm a little interested, but the writing is improving -- which is taking it out of that uncanny valley where everything is campy and hilarious, where Sinister City firmly dwells.  The end reunites protagonist and love interest, but answers nothing about her history.  Pretty clearly setting up a sequel.* Plague Mysteries had a beautiful map interface, where it would list every room you had access to, //every interactable screen in that room//, //whether you've seen each one or not//, and //whether there was anything to do there//.  All games of this genre should have that, and I think I need to update my review of that game with more praises.  Sinister City had a basic map, for travel around the town.  In this game, maps are entirely absent.  Although : When you don't need to return to a group of rooms, it will lock them off completely so you have fewer options to blindly search through.  That keeps gameplay more focused."

No problems or glitches. Like all HO games, there's a lot of backtracking.The puzzles were challenging most of the time.But... to be honest, the HO game didn't have many Hidden Object Search games in it. Honestly you'd look for a key, look for the hidden object then go to a bag of fountain and just click, click, and click. That's the reason why I don't see it as one of the best HO games made since there's barely any hidden obkects to find. It's mostly a point and click on an object and drag it here to open this door and click here again to do soemthing else.*shrug*That may just be me. I don't know, maybe I've been playing too many Artifex Mundi HO games.But other than that, the story is great and captivating.

The puzzes are too simple, almost all the time you know what to do next or what object you need, and even on advanced mode there are almost unlimited amount of hints. It took me only 3,4 hours to finish it. I do not recomend this game."

,Recommended,396790,32931143,Posted: 28 June,all,Hansaplatz,"If you are looking for a serious and well written game, this isn't for you. The writing is pretty cheesy and doesn't entirely make sense, but personally I enjoyed that because I wasn't expecting better after seeing the intro and it was amusing in its own way.Sometimes the logic of the puzzles is nothing like real world logic, but this is far from the only hidden object/point and click to suffer from that. Overall I liked the mix of puzzles they had, some were trickier than others, it didn't get repetitive from what I remember.I bought this when it was on sale at £0.33 and I was fairly happy with it for that. If it'd been more, like full price, I definitely wouldn't have been so happy. As it was, I got about 3 hours from it, completing all achievements in that time too, so at 11p/hour for somelight hearted fun that seems a good deal."

76561198197762062,Recommended,396790,32585970,Posted: 20 June,all,barbayat,"I mainly got this game, because vampire themed games are kind of my thing and it is by no means a bad game. However, it is aneasy game, there is no challenge to it and the story is pretty weak and has no satisfying conclusion to it.You basically click yourself through the usual locations, like broken down ruins, abandoned villages  and mansions in an Eastern Europe styled countryside. There isvoice actingand I have no complains about it.What little there is of the story is told in some of the many cut scenes, which is a nice change compared to other games that haven't much more story either but stuff it into notes you have to read yourself. However most cut scenes are just seconds shorts transitions or showing you more detail on your action.The hidden object scenes are structured by giving you alimited number of itemsto look for showing more once you found an item. Some require you tointeract with another object to combineit with the item you can then pick up.Theriddles are very easy, they require almost no thought and at most the effort of clicking a lot.If you are fond of vampire games (like me) and have two hours to kill, I would go for it."

The puzzles were either stupidly easy or extremely unintuitive as to what you were supposed to do. Hated this game and really consider it to be the sh*ttiest one I've ever wasted money on.

The story wasn't really entertaining at all and it was drawn out and tedious. If you are into visual novels this might be for you. If you enjoy a more fast paced game, steer clear. I wouldn't have purchased this but it came in a bundle so I gave it a try."

,Recommended,396790,29842286,Posted: 11 February,all,WidescreenRules,"I've played a lot of HO games, and this one is definitely not without its flaws, but overall (especially for the price) this one actually isn't awful.Pros:- Very easy puzzles with little attempt to hide objects- Inexpensive (as I type this, it's 83% off for $.50)- Standard HO fare- Voice acting is actually pretty good, which is surprising- The story isn't particularly good, but it does make you want to know moreNeutral:- Not translated well for the US (possibly UK) market- No resolution about the lead character to force a sequel- Achievements don't pop until you exit the gameCon- Some of the sound effects were completely out of place. Howling in a kitchen?- Some of the music absolutely did not belong, sounding more like it should have been in a sci-fi game- A few puzzles were bizarre- Some of the solutions were idiotic- Hints often point you to an area even if you don't have the items that you need for that area yetTo expand on a few of those, these are without a doubt some of the easiest HO puzzles ever. In fact, ""hidden"" is used very loosely. The items are almost all right there in front of you in plain sight. Drawing is standardHO fare (hand-drawn backgrounds) with some DirectX rendering of characters added, which was interesting.Amazingly, the voice acting was ... not bad at all. The lead actress actress actually sounds like she has real experience and none of the characters sounded (too much) like they were reading their lines in pure boredom. We're still not talking professional quality by a long shot; but I never felt the need to cring during dialog. That's probably the first for an HO game.The story isn't fantastic, but I was curious to see how things worked out. Unfortunately, they left the ending wide open for a sequel which is mildly annoying.Whoever did the translation into English needs more experience because some of the translations are ... not good, at least for the US market. For example, what they call a saucepan  we call a ""gravy boat"", not a stove-top pan to melt/heat liquids; their ""comb"" is unquestionably a brush; ""watering can"" is actually a funnel, not a way to water plants; ""casket"" is actually a jewelry box, not something to bury a body; ""clock"" is actually a watch (and don't get pedantic by telling me that a watch is a small clock either!); and so forth.The sound effects were often horrible with respect to placement. Howls, groans, wind, etc. were placed in areas where none of that would be appropriate; and this happened all over the game.The music was 50/50. Some areas had appropriately moody piano or orchestral music. Others had idiotic synthesis music that completely belonged in sci-fi, not in a ""historical"" HO game. If you play through the game, you'll know exactly what kind of music I'm referring to.Some of the solutions were absolutely idiotic. For example, the game deals with vampires, and one of the ways to kill vampires is with a wooden spike. Since when do you create a pointed, wooden spike by using a stone grinding wheel?! And what is with HO developers needing some way to move cobwebs? Just push them away with your hand!If this game had the same cost of other HO games, it would absolutely get a ""not recommended"". But for the price, especially if you manage to get it on sale, it's actually not all that bad. The surprisingly acceptable voice acting, the decent story, and the easy puzzles make it a good way to kill a few hours for not a lot of money. Just get ready to deal with a few moronic solutions, some completely misplaces sound effects, horribly-placed sci-fi music, and no achievement pop-ups until you exit."

,Recommended,396790,34269754,Posted: 15 August,all,Mintea,"I was very surprised at how much I had enjoyed this game. I play a lot of Hidden Adventure games as a wind down from the day, and this has to be one of the ones I would consider replaying just for fun. For something quick and entertaining, this is a good one to consider for its price.Pros:Surprisingly good Character models and voice acting. Keep in mind, most HOGs have either 'flat' portrait characters that never or rarely move, and the few I've played that have 3D models are all too stiff or robotic and that took away from the vibe of the game. Voices weren't ear wrenching to listen to, which is a plus.Puzzles weren't too difficult with two exceptions. Solutions weren't too outrageous either. I didn't need to do the tutorial in the beginning, everything was straightforward enough.Very pretty! The artwork was super pretty to explore and none of the important items you collected felt out of place, you had to really look.Cinematic scenes weren't too out of place when they played, although were unexpected at times, and kept to the art style of the game.Cons:Story was severely lacking. For me, it jumped right into the main menu screen and after a short cinematic I got to getting out of the first area. Never knew my PC was going by the name ""Isabella"" until I came to write this review. Never cared enough for the guy, Matt I think his name was? And I had far more questions than answers by the end of it all. From other story-driven HOGs I've played in the past, Dracula's Legacy played more like a Bonus Prologue chapter than a stand alone story.Game could have done with a map of some sort and a better way of 'locking' the toolbar below. Most of my back tracking was due to me going for an item and accidentally going backwards instead.Some of the areas you looked in/interacted with were blended in too well with the scenery. If it wasn't for the tab for 'highlighting' paths and areas, I would've never gotten through the game.The exception for the two puzzles were both of the picture slides. Not so much as the puzzle itself being difficult, but the developers chose to make the images you put together chipped/worn down and that made it very difficult to even guess what it was you were making.For me at least, it seemed random on when/where a click would register on an item/area you needed. I could be clicking the same thing 5-6 times, move to a small corner of the item, then have it picked up.Bonus perk of the game: In other HOGs, when the MC gets a gun or weapon of sorts it is to be used to knock stuff down, bust open a lock, or scare something away. While the latter does get used, I was unprepared for HOW that scare tactic was used and on whom. Found myself laughing really hard as that played out."
