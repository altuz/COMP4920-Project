Instead we must recultivate the land, grow more trees, and unleash the power of...fire hydrants?!  Yes, fire hydrants.  Who knew they had hydrants back in ancient Greece?Mostly everything is the same as the other installments of this series.  The worker guys run around gathering food, wood, and gold.  They clear the pathways.  Herc hefts the huge boulders, and Megara causes plants to grow.For those new to the series, this game does a much better job of explaining things.  There are pop up instructions of what to do.  Basically it is time management and resource management.  Each level has certain tasks to perform in order to complete the level.  If you do it fast enough you get achivements.There are 3 difficulty levels.  Untimed, easy timed, and hard timed.  (those are NOT what they are called, but that's what they are in essense.)I'll write more later as I complete the game.  I just wanted to get this up there since some yahoos decided to make negative reviews."

,Recommended,396800,21226064,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,talgaby,"Short version: 85%The fourth 12 Labours of Hercules game is undeniably made for those who are familiar with the series, but they will find probably the best combination of level design and gameplay mechanics so far.Long version:While I was playing though Mother Nature, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was made only for the long-time players of the 12 Labours of Hercules games, so this review is written for these people as well. If you are a newcomer, I advise to start the series from the beginning.For the returning audience, they’ll find probably the best game in the series, combining the level variety/design of Cretan Bull and the expanded gameplay mechanics of Girl Power. The bulk of the work is still done by servants, but by assigning a much more prominent, active role for both Megara and Hercules, there was enough change in the gameplay balance to make it feel fresh and challenging again.Speaking of balance, a lot of small things were tweaked: for example thieves (and a new enemy, anti-Hercules) are less annoying or farms are more manageable. These seem insignificant on their own, but added up they make the game a lot more fun.As a final bonus, there is now even some semblance of a story: Megara and Hercules start on a journey to regrow the Hellenic forests before they go on a well-earned vacation, struggling against the meddling gods all the time. It’s a bit silly sometimes, but it shows that the developers really cared."

Previous installment: 12 Labours of Hercules, Cretan Bull, Girl Power.NotesThere is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable. The gamplay formula is pretty much the same as its' predecessors.Unlike its' predecessors. This is the first game from the series to have a platinum edition.GameplayThis is a time management game, where careful planning is required, limited amount of resources that are available throughout the game; hence the word management.This game has the total of five episodes with eleven levels each; totaling out fifty-five levels altogether. The five bonus levels can be unlocked when the jigsaw puzzle is completed. The fifth episode is a bonus episode.There are three modes, relaxed; casual and expert, the difference between them is the timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode, no timer and no scoring. In casual mode, the timer drain a slowly and the scoring is moderately low. In expert mode, the timer drain much quicker and the scoring is much higher.The stars that are earned from completing the level depends upon on how much time is left on the timer. This only applies to the causal and expert modesThree Gold star is when the time has not gone pass the arrow. Two Silver star is when the time has gone pass the arrow. One Bronze star is when the timer is empty.Replaying any of the levels will improve the game score and the amount star.The Palace is build after each levels that has been completed in gold record time.There are few special bonuses: Freeze Time, Worker Movement/Work Speed, Additional Worker and Increases Resources. All of these special bonuses has a certain time limit but they can be used again once the bar fills-up. These special bonuses are very useful when the game is being played on expert mode.There are twenty-two different achievements to earned from playing the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements in order to unlock them.MiscellaneousThere are nine different wallpapers. They can be accessed through the game's main menu screen.There are seven different trading cards to collect. Only three cards are dropped from the game. The remaining cards:  Purchase from the Steam Market; Steam Booster Pack Creator and or Drop; Trade with friends. The cards are then used to craft the game's badge and upgrade it.I don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent.http://store.steampowered.com/app/396800Reviews for the games in this series:12 Labours of Hercules12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull12 Labours of Hercules III: Girl Power12 Labours of Hercules IV: Mother Nature"

Because of this it can get stale and boring, but it offers the same solid experience as the previous games, with some things added in to the mix so things are not as dull. This game genre is better picked up at a cheap price as they have little replay value and are easily reptitive. Giving Hercules and Meg a more active and meaningful role was good, and the addition of a small story is a little bonus too."

Episode one still has the best mechanics, you get stuff while being idle there, later you always have to click for income.Game lacks a speed system, but is more fun for perfectionists and much more strategic with external tools running it on a lower speed.Negative rating is deserved through the latest patch, the game now forces a connection to an online server spamming the menu with an ad for some other game - some ""free"" pay to win sheet.Thumbs down to the devs for this behaviour, I don't pay for a game to watch you fukn ads."

Slightly diversified (with new game play features, bonuses and surprises) to make each game a bit different, while keeping enough in common with the previouse one(s), which shortens waste of time and nerve on mastering the next game, that's valuable. Repetative, yet it feels all right here, can't remember myself being driven into bore even once. I beat all four games 100% on expert difficulty and still wouldn't mind to see the fifth. Taken into account the fact that games like these are not my idea of fun (or they weren't at least))) - what better recommendation could i give to a game. If you are looking for a highly involving and entertaining, not all that hard yet challenging enough game - check this one. Probably you will be pleased even beyond your expectations.---------------Серия из четырех одинаково отличных и очень качественно(во всех отношениях) сделанных игр- тайм менеджеров. Слегка отличающихся друг от друга (по набору игровых аспектов, бонусов и сюрпризов), ровно настолько чтобы не быть совсем однообразными, и при этом не вынуждать учиться играть заново, что несколько сокращает затраты времени и нервов на освоение каждой следующей игры, что порадовало. В принципе они достаточно однообразны, но здесь это не кажется недостатком, не помню ни разу чтобы это как то обломало интерес к игре.  Полностью прошел все четыре на экспертной сложности и не отказался бы от пятой. С учетом того, что сами игры далеко не из списка моих предпочтений (по крайней мере не были))), вряд ли я придумаю способ высказаться об игре в еще более позитивном духе.В общем, если вы подыскиваете что-нибудь достаточно увлекательно-развлекательное, при этом не слишком сложное, но тем не менее бросающее определенный вызов вашим способностям в пределах разумных затрат времени и сил - то это как раз то что надо. Вполне возможно порадует даже сверх ожиданий."

76561198112866114,Recommended,396800,22645935,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,kyzka,"The fourth time management game in the long run series produced byhttp://jetdogs.com/I must admit coming into this game I wasn't really expecting much as the previous 3 are pretty much the same thing. However this is by FAR is the best champagne corker and need of a toast that the developers can come up with new ideas if i have ever seen one. In fact if they finish the series off on this one I would understand as it would be difficult for them to top as they have really set the bar high for themselves now.The biggest difference to me is that your time management actions and mangament of resources actually changes the backgrounds of each level as you create rivers and forests and beautify the surroundings. On the downside this doesn't last long as you will have to do it again each time you replay the level. Like in Hercules 3 though you do get to decorate a palace which stays that way for good.There are many new characters, obtscales and decors that have not been in any of the previous versions. Some which at first created a 'what the hell' moment as I scratched my head how to defeat this new enemy. Also worthy to mention is that the level layout itself seems to be improved and some of them made me stop and think what i actually needed to do to get over there. I also like how they have changed the expert level so that it represents one big star and boy are they challenging. No longer is it about just the quickest way through the level but also what else can i click on in the level to raise my score up. Try and beat the developers record on 1.1 and you will soon see what i mean.The fact that Hercules eventually travels to an alien God Like land and traverses the portals and landscape to subdue his enemy was also well done. The story seemed some what more interesting than previous versions and was slightly disappointed that we did not get to see more of him and 'yoshi' eating megara's fruit afterwards.I would be seriously surprised if Jetdog trumps this version any more without ruining it, but just in case they are up for the challenge here are a couple of things that i would like to see them maybe implement...1) More unusual achievements for us to try and get than the old ones you constantly rehash.2) Instead of a palace which gets better and better, how about a garden like the 'hanging gardens of babylon'.3) While your 12 desktops are welcoming thought they could have been better placed as an unlockable reward for those who go the extra mile to unlock all the achievements.4) It would be nice if there was a super reward for those who are truly daring to beat the developers records on all the levels.5) Maybe some other unlockable cards, music, facts or even a developers photo gallery at the end.In final i guess this made the biggest impact on me only because i played the previous three and they didn't reach further than a mediocre experience. This one really showed that Jetdogs has the ability to think both out of the square, puch the boundaries and deliver. Thankyou."

,Recommended,396800,21727441,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Velvet Lerange,"This is the fourth installment of the ""12 Labours of Hercules"" series.  As someone who's played the previous three, I would say this is the strongest, as it incorporates all the elements from previous games, while adding some new mechanics. Here, Hercules and Megara have more of a role than in previous games, although the servants do most of the work (of course). What's interesting is how they've added other features , such as a ""Midas Exchange"", where you can exchange supplies or food for gold. There are new tracks to the original soundtrack as well. The gameplay is like the previous games, so if you haven't played them, I wouldn't recommend to start off with this one. Great for casual play to sneak in the day for a few minutes."

For one year, he was bedridden, sick, his wife Megara at his bedside. That's what happens you♥♥♥♥♥♥some (not so) powerful gods off. In the meantime, for some reason, his land became barren and desert. So now he has to restore it, bring the animals and water back, while fighting a wicked version of himself summoned by the same (not so) powerful gods.This fourth 12 Labours of Hercules brings every previous good ideas and mechanisms back ; still the same kind of game but with new stuff this time, unlike the previous opus. You'll discover some interesting things like a new portal system, hidden objects, more complex levels. There are even some new musics, including one very entertaining reminding me of Django (Tarantino).In my opinion, this is the best game of the series. But if you have never played it, I suggest to start with the first game anyway. If you're looking for another kind of games, casual, relaxing yet entertaining, or if you liked the 12 Labours of Hercules' games so far, I will greatly recommend you to give it a try."
,Recommended,396800,20702258,"Posted: 23 January, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"After rescuing Megara, after fighting the Cretan Bull and after Megara herself rescuing her husband, what will happen now in Hercules's world? Well, Nature seems to die around, Hercules is sick but recovers quickly before being confronted to his evil twin and after bashing Zeus, Hades and Hera (who were his previous opponents in the previous games), he has to rebuild a resort.And why does Mother Nature do? Well..., during the five episodes, if you save the nature, you'll uncover some new paths... Well, your servants are still doing the gathering of food (whether from a farm or from bushes or from cheese on the map), gold (whether from mining or the gold on the map) and wood (whether from the trees or from the workshop or from the wood on the map). You still have to repair bridges, holes in the ground, cover lava or acid pit, remove (golden) teeth or horns, etc... You can still upgrade your workshops, farms and mines to have a better recolt, you can still build obelisks to the glory of Demeter, Hermes, Hephaïstos or Apollo for permanent bonus, Megara is still used for growing bushes or pearls and Hercules for removing boulders, Cerberus for scaring ghosts, Pegasus for removing rocks, Medusa to scare Minotaurs, Cyclops to take sheeps, Charon to take floating ressources against gold... And you still have bonus that can be used for a limited time (stopping the timer, going faster, working faster, more ressources, one more temporary servant), during the levels. You still have thiefs, though they're not as common as before.So what really changed? Well, now, Megara can relive dead trees or washes away oil spills. Hercules can open fire hydrants. And these actions in some levels can unlock blocked paths (because of fire, because of water, etc..). That's the major change in the game. Also, now, the evil twin can block the servants's path and only Hercules can give him a shot in the posterior. Two new characters appear also as merchants: Midas can give gold against wood or food while Epaius or something like that can exchange wood for food for example. And only Megara can negociate with them.Otherwise, it's still the same way to tell the story, the same graphics, the same music, the same puzzles to unlock bonus levels and the same achievements as before. And for the extras, as it's a special edition, it's only a guide and wallpapers.So, yeah, I wasn't really expecting a new way of playing. The new additions are nice though. It's changing a little the repetitive stuff (send servants to collect, etc..). Also, where you had a special final level at the end of each world, here, there is none.So, the price is correct for the game. Those who liked the previous games will enjoy this one too. Those expecting more actions or twists will be disappointed. I've enjoyed this fourth game. And I do think that it's still worthy to be recommended even if there is no big surprise."

The game Cursor is slower then your current Mouse cursor.

His workers (or shall i say Slaves), has to do everything. They have to collect wood, food and gold Resources. They also have to Build or upgrade buildings and clear obstacles. If Hercules has to do something, like moving a boulder, he is going to show off with his muscle in a way like ""Oh look how good i am"".The game is bascially the same (each level) in terms of gameplay. There is time on each level. The faster you complete it the better the score and you are able to get a Gold medal. There is a Buff bar at the left. Each level has a Buff bar and once it has met the requirement. You could active one for temporary use. Each level has their own buff and you can't decide which one you want to take with you.The game is very relaxing and calm, You can sort of play in your own pace but also not really.The game is very simple and easy to understand.Music is okay.

Not only that, it's the same exact thing you had to do in the last three games.  So, that's like 200 levels of the exact same thing.  It's all so easy with absolutely zero challenge, but for me, this is my last game of the series and when I'm done, I'll be done.  Good riddance.4/10Only recommended if you like easy 100%s."

To be honest, I just enjoyed the one Wild West-themed tune on a few of the levels.Other than that, it's the same gameplay as the rest of the series, with the same mechanics, same music, etc. No wonder they can come out with a new game every few months; they're almost carbon copies.Oh yeah, the writing/plot is still hilariously rubbish with no hint of actual mythology apart from a few references. At least there is none of the 'trying to rhyme' now so it's just garbage prose and can be written off as such.5/10, got my 50 cents worth but that's about all."

76561197991465987,Recommended,396800,21637100,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,gbors,"The creators of the 12 Labours of Hercules series are releasing the games faster than I can complete them :) Less than 1 year passed since the first game, and now I'm trying to finish the 4th and the 5th is already in sight. This rapid pace makes you suspicious that we have a ""more of the same"" situation here - and yes, while there are slight changes between the episodes, we basically have four near-identical games with almost 200 levels altogether. More of the same is not a sin, of course - if the quality remains stable and the pricing is right, it can be quite attractive. Fortunately, this is the case with 12LoH.At this point, the game shouldn't need much introduction - if you're unfamiliar with the series, start with the first one, there's a demo and everyting. As a short summary, it's a time management game with appealing audiovisuals, good level design and a decent challenge on the hardest difficulty.Compared to the first game, there are a few new elements, the most notable being Megara (Hercules' wife) playing an active part (starting from ep3, actually) - since she doesn't introduce strategic variety (ie. you're always best off doing all her tasks early), I don't find much value here. Thieves were also new in ep2 or ep3 (you can guess what they do), and in ep4, sometimes an evil version of Herules appears to scare your servants. Managing thieves does add an additional dimension to the gameplay, while evil H is just an annoyance.The level design quality remains more or less constant. On most levels you need to make sure you balance your resources well, but there are some levels where you can find different solutions - these tend to be the more enjoyable.Difficulty is an interesting question. I do feel that the games get easier as the series progresses, but it's quite possible that I'm so used to the gameplay that I automatically make better choices than in the first game. To counter this a bit, there's a developer record for each level beyond the gold time, but to be honest, I can't believe it's really what it's called - many times, I do better than that on the first try. So in the next installment, some extra difficulty would be nice.All in all, it's easy to recommend the 12 Labours of Hercules series - buy one, play it through, if not bored yet, buy next, repeat. If bored, stop for a couple of months, and try again. When I think of the term ""quality casual game"", 12LoH is definitely one of the first game that springs to mind."

,Not Recommended,396800,30243964,Posted: 28 February,all,oerbyy,"Oh no, no, this is not how it works. The Hercules 1 was a good game, but this one I would NOT recommend and this is why:1) It's too simple. Although I set a medium difficulty, it's still weird I was getting gold medals only.2) What's worse, the game is loosing any sense starting from chapter 3 as you don't need to plan your path anymore. All you need to do is just click, click, click .... click and click as f***king rapid as you can on all farms you have in order to send your minions to grab resources. Just make 500 stupid clicks ... profit!Don't waste your time on this game, take the 1st part, not this one ;)"

It's incredibly charming, with cute graphics and fun little cutscenes.Honestly, for £1.99 you can't go wrong. I usually get around 6-10 hours of playtime out of these games, and this one came in at about 9 hours. Thats good value imo."

76561198158769859,Recommended,396800,29167498,Posted: 10 January,all,Gnobsk,"12 Labours of Hercules IV: Mother Natureis the fourth instalment in the12 Labours of Herculesseries. As I have already reviewed the earlier games and explained the core mechanics and changes in those reviews, I will skip those here save the summary that this game, like its predecessors, is a time management game where Megara, Hercules and their workers have to clear lanes, collect resources and construct buildings in order to progress through the levels.This game changes very little compared to12 Labours of Hercules III: Girl Power. The number of total levels is increased from 45 to 56, including the (super) secret levels. Some new music has been added and the story features a plot by the antagonists of the last three instalments.The biggest change may very well be the guide button in the lower left corner of each level, where you can find the optimal way to complete the goals and find the puzzle pieces. Some levels also have items that you can click for extra points; the locations of these can also be found in the guide. Needless to say, the guide is optional.I have always had my misgivings regarding the story and music in these games, but they do try to bring something new to the table this instalment. And I like the changes made, also with regards to the story and music. Therefore, another recommendation from me."
