,Recommended,396860,18078526,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,jfietkau,"When you'retraveling through a war zone on foot during a storm, you tend to not be very picky when an opportunity to find shelter presents itself. This is how one wounded former soldier, having abandoned his comrades during one of North America's many formative wars in the early 1800s, winds up in a shed together with a young Native American girl waiting out the storm. The shared experience is sure to tear down some of the cultural barriers between them, but will others be too sturdy to be toppled just like that?Over The Hills And Far Awayis a short kinetic novel (a visual novel without choice-based story branches), developed and self-published on Steam byWarGirl Gamesin collaboration withCollateral Damage StudiosandSeycara Music and Arts. It uses western-influenced visuals as opposed to the more common anime style, and tells its story in about three hours.The VN is built on the Ren'Py engine and has full SteamPlay support on Windows, Mac and Linux, which is something that I personally greatly appreciate. You can save and load at any time (somewhat curiously, the developer chose to provideno less than 250 save slots). It runs in fullscreen or windowed mode, and while it does not quite achieve full 1080p graphics, it runs at a very comfortable widescreen resolution slightly above 720p. The characters are not voiced, and at the time of this review, the VN is only available in English.The visual style, while having some anime influences, is pretty unique and distinct from most other VNs on Steam. It makesexpert use of color and lightingto set the tone, the backgrounds are as pretty as they are detailed and always fun to look at. The character sprites and CGs tend to be consistent between one another, and the characters have strong visual designs. While the coloring and most of the drawing technique is impeccable, I have to nitpick about the faces. The artist is good enough at drawing faces for it not to be too jarring, but they often end up looking kind of wooden or distorted and not really fitting the rest of the body. In one instance this actually made me laugh when a character was clearly supposed to be looking angry, but ended up looking more like he was struggling with constipation. That is the one unfortunate weak spot in the otherwise delightful painterly artwork.Since I don't have the knowledge to assess whether the soundtrack has any particular relevance to the time period of the story, I can only say that it seemed well-produced and always fit the mood. It's one of those immersive soundtracks that you tend not to notice anymore after a while, which can be a good thing, even though it makes it hard to identify any stand-out tracks (besides the vocal track during the credits that I enjoyed very much). That said, I really have to highlight the sound effect engineering in this VN, which feels like it has a unique little bit of audio for almost everything that happens. It's clear that a lot of attention to detail went into the sound design, and the result is impressive. In this particular regard it may actually the best VN I've read so far. The only sound problem that I noticed is that the background music does not loop very well and you frequently hear it fade out before starting over from the beginning. This is a common problem that always challenges my immersion unnecessarily and I wish more developers would take it into account. That said, if this is the worst audio problem that I can find, then that says more about what they did right than what they did wrong.I always perk up a little when I see someone announcing a VN with an interesting original setting, and in this regardOver The Hills And Far Awaycertainly brings something valuable to the table. I don't know all that much about American history, so a lot of the context of the war and the motivations of the various factions were undoubtedly lost on me, but it's worth noting that I never felt like I was being admonished for that. The story carries all the context that it needs to function, and I would imagine that many aspects of this story would transfer with little issue to many other wars in human history, so this title is not only for the history buffs to appreciate. If you are hoping to learn more about Shawnee culture from this VN, you are likely to be disappointed, as what little information it gives about them stays on a very superficial level. This is not an educational story (in the scholarly sense) like, for example,Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna)tries to be.As original as the setting is, the rest of the broader plot framework unfortunately cannot keep pace. The tragic story of thebattle-hardened warriormeeting theinnocent little girlis a safe genre staple, which regrettably also makes it feel a little stale. You know there will be a time period of the two warming up to each other, you know there will be lots of moments of joy, and you know it's going to tug at your heartstrings a bit. That's all just fine, and taken by itself every one of those moments works well, but you tend to see the heartstring-tugging coming from a mile away if you've read a few stories of this kind before, so depending on your own degree of genre-savvy cynicism, there's a tangible risk that this story might leave you feeling like you just went through the motions again.All that is not to say that the writing isn't good, it's merely not particularly innovative. I'm under the impression thatOver The Hills And Far Awayis the first ""big"" serious project of its writer, and sticking closely to a proven story archetype was probably not a bad idea at all. The writing shows very few rookie mistakes (some misplaced humour, some overreliance on clichés) in an otherwise rock-solid and immersive experience, and I have high hopes for the raw talent of the writer, who I'm sure will spread his creative elbows out a little more for his next work.I've often said that a great execution can do a lot to make up for some things that the framework may be lacking, and this is definitely true forOver The Hills And Far Away. I've already talked about the attention to detail in the sound design, but the same excellence extends to almost all other detail areas of the VN. When the protagonists are walking through a forest, you can see the thicketdraw leafy shadowson the character sprites that lightly sway in the wind, the animated fog effects are a joy to look at, and the occassional sprite animation when a character falls down or climbs a tree just gives the whole thing an aura of authenticity that you only get when the developers pay ample attention to the little things.Over The Hills And Far Awayis practically polished to a mirror sheen.Even if it breaks less new literary ground than the setting made me hope initially, I have no qualms givingOver The Hills And Far Awaya positive recommendation. There's almost nothing to it that needs criticism, and at the end of the day it is an enjoyable story with a very competent presentation. For people who dislike anime-style art, this is an obvious recommendation. Everyone else will have to weigh it against other VNs that they have not read yet and ask themselves whether the setting and the attention to detail are strong enough selling points."
76561198134509614,Recommended,396860,20632065,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,lil aeryn,"Tensions brewing since the Napoleonic War resulted in the War of 1812 between the United States and the British Empire, alongside 10,000 Native Indians. Over the Hills and Far Away, a debut kinetic visual novel by War girl Games focuses on the aftermath of a battle when the British Empire suffered a major defeat and Procter abandoned his army. Our protagonist, William Aubrey survived the battle and has ran to an abandoned farmhouse where he meets a young Shawnee girl called Mai hiding from the storm.Themes  and CharactersThe characters are well defined in the short time we spend with them. We get a real sense of their personalities, motives and backgrounds. The story has some light touches  thanks to the character of young Mai, a counterpart to the world weary and cynical Aubrey. Mai, despite being a smart cookie and resilient, in her childish actions delivers some sweet, funny moments. She remains upbeat throughout the story which rubs off on Aubrey. He may try to convince himself of his selfish intentions  but I see Mai as Aubrey's first trajectory for the redemption he seeks.Home and Identity are two strong themes running through this story. Aubrey feels like an alien in a fractured country and is looking for his own place to belong and call home. Their methodologies may vary but both he and Jackson are both looking for independence, home and freedom. Mai, on the other hand has a strong sense of home and belonging from her religious beliefs and community.Music and ArtworkThere is a lovely use of orchestral music by Seycara Music and Arts . It is not intrusive and matches the ambience for each moment. A particular standout piece I noticed is the field scene. The final song at the credits, After All, have some lovely vocals by Sagispon. The artwork doesn't have the usual anime aesthetics instead opting for a soft, muted pastel look. It makes good use of tones, light and attention to detail.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601111381ConclusionThe game is short running at around the three hour mark but is within the normal steam price range. Despite the shortness I feel that it was the correct length and successfully managed to get a sense of the characters and the story. History would tell you a different story about how about how most Native Indians were treated but if Disney can do it with Tiana in Disney's Princess  and the Frog why can't War Girl Games? They both want to give us some heart warming entertainment. so we should let it go...I highly recommend this as Over the Hills and Far Away, like The 39 Steps, will appeal to a wider audience as well.This is due to the lack of anime tropes, aesthetics, atypical story and unusual setting which may have some extra appeal for history enthusiasts."

Do feel for 13$ it is a bit on the short side of a story no real character development. For a VN if your looking for  choices there is none it's a linear story but at the end I had mix feelings. It's a type of title would want to give a in between. I enjoy the music and writing I just don't feel there was enough of it. Would reccomend it to anyone if on a sale.Since I wrote this review they did change the price of the game to $8.99 so would definatly reccomend to anyone who likes VN

Perhaps there wasn't enough time to become engrossed with the characters, which are written mostly well, but I felt I could have been more attached to the main duo. The plot with the villain is a little predictable, but still intense, and the overall narrative and message is a cruel (but brilliant) one. The music and art style is charming and both compliment each other perfectly.Generally though, a nice and touching little visual novel."

It's a story about a soldier who choose to live instead of dying on the battlefield, and a child who got sold into slavery and who dreams of coming back home to her village.This is one of my favourite stories, and I'm actually a bit sad that I bought it during a -75% sale because it feels like I paid too little for something great. Everything about it is absolutely wonderful, the way the game is written, the lovely watercolour style and the characters."
,Recommended,396860,32188446,Posted: 4 June,all,✔kupis1408,"What I like about this game is the developer tend to stay away from cliche setting we often see in any other visual novels; highschool teens drama, instead it happens during the War of 1812 (a conflict between United States & British Empire), where the story focus on a British deserter & a young Indian girl.While the story may be slow & lack of engaging dialogue for some players, the interaction between a rude & harsh soldier and a young but cunning Indian girl is well portrayed by how awkward but entertaining it can be. CG artworks are beautiful, but since the game is short, not so many places can be covered, which I find it disappointing. Among them, there is a villain character from different faction, which is well-portrayed based on his malice & grudge, enough to make me feel like punching him in the face.For a short kinetic novel like this, I suggest you to buy this during sale.Also, be prepared for whats coming, for you may not like where the story is leading."

It's a heartfelt slice of American historical fiction, and shows the cruelty of war for all involved, but particularly for Native Americans.Pros:- Great writing- Use of Shawnee language, culture, and folklore- Emotionally charged ending- Decent artwork- A fair amount of humorCons:- Too short (3 hours)I definitely recommend it. It teaches the reader a little about the Shawnee people and elicits a sad realization of just how cruel white men were to Native Americans in those times."

Although there is no voice acting, only graphics, sound effects and music, and you have to read the story yourself, I felt extremely hooked to this game. The atmosphere totally grabbed me all through the story. This game is a piece of art and you won't forget Mai, the little injun girl, easily, once you completed the story.

Hopefully we will see more of these from this developer.I see many reviewers saying this is set during the American War for Independence - that's not correct.  The story is set during the War of 1812, sometimes called the Second War of Independence.  Aubrey says ""this is the 1800s"" as part of his dialog.  Also, he refers to Chief Tecumseh being killed.

I searched about it and it's actually a lot more important than people think it is and it's worth reading about.- The artwork is fantastic. Filled with personality, the details are delicate but rough in the right places and very pleasing to the eyes.- Since it's a kinetic novel, you can sit back and watch it like a movie with subtitles.- Story wise, it isn't the most original out there but it's bittersweet and I almost cried. The prose is great.- The music is also beautiful. I wouldn't mind having the OST. It's orchestra, no synths, which it may not be historically accurate? But it fits.- The devs also did their research, I absolutely loved how Mai spoke her language, you rarely see Native Americans represented in media and I'm happy to see so much effort in building Mai.Cons- Some people may not like that's it a kinetic novel.- Some may find it too short.- Some people may hate the tragic theme, especially since it's kind of easy to assume that it will happen."

This is a sort of Visual Novel after all ( it doesn't even have choices!).What this game (or rather ""experience"") does offer is a nice story that will distract from whatever thoughts or worries you may be preoccupied with in the present, and transport you to another world, in the backdrop of the War of 1812. This is a unique story. It's not a cinema, block-buster-esque storyline complete with explosions and giant robot testicles ( must have watched Transformers to appreciate this stupid joke).It's more akin to a ""slice of life"" genre, which focuses on the more of the mundane and trivial aspects of life. Of course, the setting is uniquein itself, but the compelling aspect of the game is what I like to call the "" intimacy of small moments"".Do you sometimes recall small, stupid memories of your ""girlfriend"" in middle school, that lame dance your sophomore year, that cute girl at the fair you had your first kiss with, and never saw again. Do you remember these moments at the most random times, maybe during your dead-end, god-awful job, and have to try to not to cry? Yeah, this game's kinda like that.The beauty in those small, hidden stories that take place in the backgdrop of much larger events, that should overshadow that story. But in the end, there is still something very poignant about the small moments of joy and happiness that we are able to create in a world that sometimes feel too big as to being empty,I won't give any spoilers, but if you want a simple game with gorgeous art, charming characters, enchanting music, and a premise that will make you wonder just exactly how many stories of lovers and friends, how many adventures and journies, how many small moments that really shouldn't matter but will make you cry like a baby - this game will not just tell you, but it will show you just how many of these transient moments happened in the war of 1812.P.S. I know the girl is young, but... you know... like...,in the old days they didn't really think it was weird.... :) In fact, they encouraged it! Yeah! That's right!

It'd be nice if it had more depth concerning her language and culture.The main character though is frankly annoying to play as. Racist, self pitying and all around terrible. It was hard just go get through certain parts of it.The game presents a few other characters but they're not worth mentioning really as they aren't presented in a way that really encourages the viewer to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them. Maybe if Aubrey actually told Mai about himself like he wanted to...Good music, dialogue and art though. Nothing particularly amazing however and there's only a few actual fully illustrated scenes, the majority of the game just a portrait of Mai making cute facial expressions.Personally, as someone who absolutely has no knowledge of the War of 1812, and someone who doesn't care about American history, I feel as though a lot of this was lost on me besides Aubrey whining about how war is hell.The worst part of it all, is it's really damn short with no branching paths or proper interaction."

It's more of a visual novel, to be quite frank: it's literally only clicking to read the next written sentence. There is no other interaction between the player and the game whatsoever.

The art illustrates the scene we're reading about, or the characters' expressions and actions, in a very simple way.

So, if you never saw games of this type - that should warn you. Now, the anime part of the game was very pleasant for me, because I'm not a fan of those sometimes absolutely mad and hilarious scenes, that you see even in the most serious and dark Japanese anime creations - no, this one was far more European, with more detail to the character drawing and realism in storytelling. So, that's a definite plus for me, especially since the game touches a European historical theme of American Independence and British Imperialism, clashing together. Although, this is just a setting - don't expect to actually see any battles or historical events unfolding, or some kind of political context. On the contrary, the game shows us a story of two people, caught in the middle of conflict, and it focuses on their respective lives and interactions. The game has a rather nice soundtrack, well-written dialogues (I would compare the spirit of the story to something like ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"") and nice atmosphere. On the other hand, it is quite short. I felt that there are some missed opportunities here, which I will list in the negative section, but in overall, the game is absolutely worth the money, by all means. My recommendation.+ Good story+ Good soundtrack+ Excellent artwork+ Excellent narration+ Atmosphere of a well-written book+ A good balance between Japanese and European styles+ A rather close-to-history look into relations between the natives and Europeans- Characters aren't as complex, as they could have been.- Not enough artwork, too many similar scenes - even for such a short game.- A rather short game, especially since there is no gameplay - it should be a little longer.- Absence of voice acting seems like a rather lost opportunity; I would really enjoy hearing the characters live."

That said, I simply can't recommend this game. I don't mind it being short, and I could even forgive the lack of any kind of choice to be made by the player, but the visual aspect of it was incredibly underwhelming and the writing too simplistic.The visuals of the game consist of a handful (probably less than ten altogether) background images that accompany the text, with characters superimposed on them when the story calls for it - there isn't much more to it than what you can see in the preview.Seeing all that, I hoped the writing would be this game's strongest point, but it's just not very well done. Aside from the aforementioned lack of choice - you literally go through the whole game without being to influence it - the characters are incredibly simplistic, and while there is an attempt to give them some kind of depth through their backstories, they just never come across as plausible human beings. They seem to exist only to serve the story, which also can't really decide what it wants to be: it starts out as a variation on the old 'war is hell' theme, and at the very last minute turns into a morality tale about religion and racism. I might be more receptive towards it if the writer had at least known how to write Mei's character, but it's hard to get emotionally involved with the game when the main two characters' dialogue is just so unrealistic: a 11-year girl for whom English is supposedly a second language fluently and eloquently talks to a supposedly  ruthless, adult English soldier who acts like a 15-year-old.This is a cute short experience of a game if you don't think too much about it, and if you get it on sale, it's not too expensive either. However, don't expect it this 'visual novel' to go into any kind of depths; it's probably best suited for a younger audience."

It was an enjoyable read and followed a setting that I find intriguing, that being the War of 1812.Since Reviews should have some Pros and Cons, I guess I can provide that:Pros:-Nice Character designs and Backgrounds-Good character writing (But can come off as kind of generic for some of them)-Interesting story (Better if you aren't like me who thinks too much about it and winds up unsurprised at the end)-Music isn't annoying and blends in with the story-Unique Setting. Not many games are set during the War of 1812. Although it has been glossed over in most nation’s histories (UK and US, minus the Star Spangled Banner and MAYBE the White House Burning.) It has become important for Canadians and their national Identity. (Half con, an idea not brought out in the game but would have been unrelated to the story) For that, I give it props.Cons:-Short. Lasted me around three hours, and a lot of that was because I kept the game running from time to time while I was away. Probably shorter if you're a fast reader.-No replayablitiy since it's a linear game with no branching paths. I would only replay it if I wanted to re-read the story, but I highly doubt I will.-Sometimes the Grammar is a little off and can cause you to sit there being like ""What the ♥♥♥♥ do they mean?"" or something. (Bad for Grammar Nazis probably)*MINOR SPOILERS BELOW*Historical Nitpicks *MINOR SPOILERS* (I have some Knowledge of War of 1812 History and found some small unimportant issues, but it’s fun to nitpick them anyway) *MINOR SPOILERS*:-US Rank insignia displayed improperly. A Captain in the US Army is represented with One Epaulette (The fringy things on the shoulder) on the Right Arm, not Two on both. Both shoulders indicate Staff Officers from Major to Colonel.-Aubrey’s Uniform is a little weird. For a man in the Enlisted ranks to have BOOTS of all things is strange, he’s probably have shoes and spats on instead. I don’t think his uniform matches with the Regiment he served in, but I always get a little lost with those details.-General Proctor does suck.- Where is his Captain’s Hat? Americans love their massive Officer hats. Also, I dislike the lack of Shako representation.I hope this works out and helps you decide on whether to get it or not."

I am not through with it as of the time of this writing and will probably not update my review, but I can tell that I am close to the end. This is a good story, decent writing, some humour, some heartbreak, really puts you in the moment of what is happening to the characters. Can't speak of the ending yet as again, I am not there, but the majority of the game has been good. While there is little interactivity, they really do add things to the story visually and audiotorilly (not sure what the right word is here) that enhance the experience more than if you were reading it out of a book. Character portraits, moving character portraits, maps, sounds of random stuff like hiccuping or door creaking, shaking the camera when someone falls or snatches something out of someones hand, shadows from the sun shining through the trees, little flames shooting up from a fire, etc. Some of the art is absolutely beautiful and some seems a little less well done, but none of it is bad imo. It just seems rather inconsistent in quality but this does not detract from the novel much. The real draw here is the setting. I don't think I've ever seen a setting in a video game about this time period (war of 1812) that was story based. Just a very unique visual novel and if you can get it for around 5 bucks it is totally worth it. $9 seems a tad expensive for around 3-4 hours of content but the story is quite good so who knows maybe you will value it more.EDIT: Sooo I wasn't going to update this at all but the ending really blew me away. It was brilliantly done. Saying anything more than that is borderline spoilers but IMO the ending sequence, art, and ending song on the credits are really beautiful. Really made me think philisophically (sp?) about things, much more than a game normally would.

The precise timeframe is not long after the Battle of the Thames, the battle that destroyed the British army in the western territories and secured the American hold on the original West of the country, laying the foundations for the full Westward expansion of the American people after the way.  It will be of interest to those who like history but don't know much about the history of the Old Northwest.

This one was different, as I read from other review, as it required only the left click of your mouse button. Hence, it caught my interest.*Soundtrack*. As I opened this story, I enjoyed the soundtrack immediately (and in fact bought the DLC). It brought me memories from Guild Wars I, a game I used to play a while ago. It gave life, taste and fragrance to what my eyes would muse on, and animate the artwork in front of me. There were no voices, but I could almost hear their tone shifting as the dialogue followed thanks to the flow of the melody. I could tell it was being repeated only but rarely on different scenarios, but not in the very same one. Hence, all the melodies were well reiused.*Artwork*. You won me on the concept art for the girl. Her eyes, her clothes, her quiet personality and the expressions were unique to her like I've never seen before in any story. Trully, she is a one of a kind to this story and to all I've seen in anime over the past years. I wasn't that enchanted by the protagonist himself, but his story made him more interesting. I trully loved the artwork of the house with the rain outside. And in fact, they were really well executed to tell the story. Rich, vivid, it's the kind of art that gives you a starting point and with enough imagination you can write a movie out of it.*Story*. Although the VN is left click only without options, the story splits nicely in about I think 3 different dimensions. There is a change of pace between slice of life, past, dream, etc that makes it dynamic enough to avoid boredoom. I wish there was more lore, however, past the end. All those menus and buttoms could have had just an artwork of a diary with logs, telling the story from different lens as you progressed in the story. It wouldn't demand much of sound, artwork, etc. just write up. I think that was the only point of improvement I would suggest to the devs. *e.g. he wanders quite a lot given the nature of the plot, we could have had those buttons being enabled with things he found along the way. Could be, again, just described in written form.Also, the burning question, will be there a follow-up? Even text-only? I would gladly buy the book.p.s.: I almost jumped out of my chair late night with the ""War Girls"" banner popping up and a ""HA!!!!!!!"" coming out of nowhere.

,Not Recommended,396860,33456662,Posted: 11 July,all,CraftySprite,"To be honest, I'm surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this but full disclaimer, I did not play the whole game. I made it 30 minutes in and I just can't handle the slow, plodding dialogue, constant punctuation errors, and weird innaccuracies/inconsistencies. I kept waiting for gameplay to start, but there isn't gameplay, it's just a true visual novel --which I could be totally ok with if not for the issues I mentioned above."

There's good things in this game, but I'm not very happy that I've played it.Positives: The soundtrack is good ambient music, the credits vocal song and CG artwork are great, the conclusion was very emotional and touching. Including native American language deserves some credit,Negatives: Having grown up reading Bernard Cornwall's Sharpe novels, and naturally associating the song 'Over the Hills and Far Away' with young British Tommys far from home, I was very disappointed that the protagonist has spent much of his life on the American frontier, losing the potential story of a stranger in a strange land. The story up to the conclusion wasn't the most original and left me emotionally cold, though I suppose the finale would've been spoilt if it hadn't got me a little. Without choices, or the advantages of movies, kinetic novels probably need to present threats and problems big and fast, and  the first 90% of this story didn't do that. Maybe the story from the vulnerable Mai's perspective would've grabbed me more."

76561197970887820,Recommended,396860,22261886,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Mandrake42,"A short visual novel set in America during the war of 1812, a part of history I had not really been aware of until I played this. I knew about the Napoleonic wars in Europe at the time, but hadn't realised England was also fighting a war in America at the same time.Just to be clear this is a visual novel the the strict sense of the term, there is no interaction and there is just one path through the tale. That said it is well written and as mentioned above takes place in a part of history I wasn't even aware of, which is a plus. The direction of the plot is a little predictable and the game is quite short, but I enjoyed my time with it. The music and sound effects really at to the atmosphere and the writing is reasonably solid. It's worth checking out, especially when it's on sale.Pros-Interesting nook of historyGood musicCons-ShortLinear"

I bought it on sale and I kept waiting for what I thought was the introduction to be over. That introduction never ends. That's all you get. You can't walk through the battlefield, you can't even press a button to struggle over the sacred blanket. You can only press a button to advance the dialogue.For this review, let me start with the cons, because Over The Hills And Far Away was a little bit of a surprise for me:ConsIt is not a game - there are no choices, no movement, no challenges. This webpage offers more interactivity.Single button input - you will be pressing one button for the entire ""game""SHORT story with minor character development and repeated graphicsProsLovely art and charming story - nice to look at and okay to readSave at nearly any moment - easy to leave off and then pick up and start againMusic was decentI finished it in about 2 and a half hours. I won't be refunding it, because I did enjoy it. I really hope this will not be a trend for Steam offerings. Try the demo first, if it still seems intriguing at least try to buy it on sale. If this is really your cup of tea, just go read a book."

,Recommended,396860,22274715,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,yungcherrypops,"An interesting, albeit quite short (for a fast reader like myself) visual novel.Interesting setting, well-defined characters, lush artwork, and a strong soundtrack carry the narrative, but I thought that the main narrative was a bit cliched. Overall, I enjoyed it, because I love colonial America and feel that it's a highly underused setting. I do, however, think that it could've been longer (as you can see by my play time, I didn't manage to rack up the hours other reviewers have), and more well-developed thematically (Mai's monologue at the end especially hinted at some interesting themes that could've been expanded). I also would've liked a bit more background about the characters to make the final confrontation a bit more satisfying. Alternate endings or routes likewise would've rounded out the experience.Overall, it's one of the more enjoyable visual novels on Steam, and if you can catch it on sale (I wouldn't pay full price for something of this length), it's a good way to spend an afternoon.7.5/10Pros-Strong, endearing, believably drawn protagonists-Rich artwork-Good soundtrack-Interesting settingCons-Too short-Somewhat cliche plotline-Lack of alternate routes or endings (not necessarily a problem, but I feel as if it would've been a nice way to add length by fleshing out the characters/setting and making the finale a bit more emotionally involving)"

Art isn't always 100% perfect, but that's pretty common in visual novels, so it doesn't detract too much from the overall experience.The narrative is a classic ""grizzled protagonist regains humanity"" story, but using the War of 1812 as a background makes it unique enough.Heartwarming, emotional, oftentimes relaxing."

Truely, its not as good as I thought it would be, but I will not say it was a waste. I've read the novel twice now and its worth the money. Its orginal, its got twists, and it gets your atteintion.  I give it a 7/10 for three things that stood out to me: Good artwork, good pacing of story, and... well creativty for a story based time peroid thats not talked much about here in the States."

Particularly for the young ones brought up to believe that might is right by the elders who should know better, This little ditty may be what some people need to remind them that human suffering is not just a number to be rattled off on the evening news.The characters are likeable, and I found myself instantly attached to them.If you have some spare cash and time, I highly recommend trying this visual novel out."

Though I found the storyline to be a bit cliched (pretty much was able to predict the ending,) it was interesting watching friendship between an unlikely pair blossom.  I wish that the dream had been explained more in depth and in relation, but maybe that's something the player has to find out. Ultimately, I think that the game explores the idea of redemption, renewal, and racial stereotypes. If you choose to play, it'll be up to you to make the decision!"
