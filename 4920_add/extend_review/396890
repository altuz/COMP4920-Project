,Recommended,396890,20136203,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Mitchelson,"So first things first you will need 64bit Java to run this game well and without crashes.Gridworld is a very interesting simulator of evolution. When I first began playing I knew little about the controls for changing terrain or food and was more or less at the mercy of natural selection with what came of my world.My First 3 HoursFor the first hour of eager scrutiny of my first world I saw nothing but failures of creatures. Organisms that could reproduce but lacked a mouth. Creatures that emitted poison but lacked the ability to survive contact with that poison. Animals that could eat but not move, etc, etc. Most of them died off quite rapidly. I saw the slightest glimmer of hope when I noticed a creature moving, eating, and reproducing but when it would reproduce, the parent would die and the offspring without much energy to begin with, would die very soon after if not directly next to some food. By and large these creatures all seemed doomed and world would become a lifeless hulk of uneaten food.I walked away from the computer and left my game on. watched a television show, came back and saw not much had changed. Having left the TV on I left the room again to turn it off, sat down at my computer and stared at the screen.That's when I noticed a small group of creatures moving and eating food in the top right of the world.I immediately zoomed in to see these organisms:1. Moving2. Eating3. Reproducing4. Conserving enough energy to reproduce while keeping the parent alive.I WAS ECSTATIC. I sat back and watch these creatures, which I have dubbed 'Monchers', take over my world in no time. They spread like wildfire in a world abundant with food and devoid of competition. Now I see my little Monchers evolving with generation after generation, creating better, different, and sometimes flat out worse versions of themselves. Even as I type this the Monchers of my world are much more efficient than the first colony in that top right corner.With food more scarce and competition increasing between the Moncher species I noticed Monchers with poison emitters to kill of competition, ones with more speed to collect food faster, and ones with less fancy ""Neurons"" as the game calls them, which are basically body parts or overall traits of your creature. With less traits though the monchers use less energy, allowing them to survive longer without a meal and pass on the genetic code.With organisms that don't die within minutes, neurons actually become interesting features of your little animals. You wonder where evolution will take them next and what might succeed or fail. What species will die out or dominate.In ConclusionThis game is an evolutionary petri dish of interesting results. Although actual interaction with the player is limited, it's more like a simulation than a game. An aquarium or jar of sea monkeys. But this is so much more than a jar of sea monkeys. It's like having a small world of your own. Species to watch and track. You'll see generations live and die. Creatures rise and fall. If you have the imagination to enjoy these small beings, and don't mind a back seat view of evolution, this is a very interesting game to leave up and watch from time to time.You will not enjoy this game if you don't like the idea of:VERY simple pixel graphics.At times hours of gameplay without change.Having to make your own stories and use your own imagination for maximum enjoyment. Often times the most world altering moments can happen quickly and without much fanfair. To someone without their mind enveloped in the game world this would appear quite anticlimactic.This game requires a lot of patience and creativity.If any of these reasons don't sound appealing to you I would recommend you NOT buy the game. Otherwise I would highly recommend it."

They are currently mixing and fighting for resources.I wonder if one species will become dominant or will they all co-exist.How will you play God? :D"
,Recommended,396890,19984175,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Bradenm1,"Edit: Before I get into this review I would like to point out what the game does. It plots AIs if you would like to call them that learn completely from scratch in this game to survive in what has been given to them, some don't even know how to move, or what food does or even what the lava does... You could say they learn from trail and error untill they are very smart. It does not follow any guidelines like AIs from CS:GO or any other games, because theses make their own guidelines or rules, which makes them unquie and this whole ""game"" unquie.If you do not understand what neural networks are or even care about subjects related to Artificial Intelligence and or don't have much interest in that stuff don't bother with this Evolution Simulator even though all of them are like this, if you are still interested either way read below.This is all obviously my opinion and how I feel about this game at current state.Read if you wanted to buyIf you like knowing you have essentially a miniverse running on your computer and having the AI or Neurons roaming around and knowing you can control their lives and watch as they survive inside this Simulator and seeing them evolve then you got yourserlf a Steam ""game"" you should buy. The control is limited though but offers more features then other evolution simulators I have played. The miniverse is also limited to a piece of flat land.If you don't like waiting for them to evolve this cannot be changed you cannot edit the speed of a process like to go faster so don't buy it if you are not patient or want to spend hours and hours or even days on end running this game to see something happen. Unless you got some quantum computer, the faster the computer the faster it will be. Limited to the render settings. The creatures learns everything from scratch so it takes time to understand what that lava does or what food does, etc.concerns-Menus are laggy when using the mouse and clicking on things...-Needs Java 64-bit to run without crashing and to even start the game.-Quite a lot of stuff happens on-screen and I don't undstand nearly all of it, I did see the developer was going to push out a guide which would be nice to see happen.Things I would like maybe-I would like to see generations so I can view the history of my creatures and spawn them, possibly.-Custom world sizes-Creatures structure, I do not understand what is the sensors or the mouth, etc. Is it meant to be like this?-I would like to zoom out more then the default.-More options in the options menu, fullscreen, etc.-The scrollers that edit the vaules get stuck all the time and are kinda a pain to use, I would like to input my own custom numbers.I have not looked a lot of things in-game because I simply do not understand what it does. I edit as I go.Though their are a few free simulators like this out there this is one of the first ones I have seen on Steam and actaully under development and what not.On the other hand I like where the developer is going with this, I feel this is more learning towards a early acess game. I will add more to this as I play the game."

I've always been fascinated by both evolution simulations and neural network simulations, so ""Gridworld"" was a must-have for me. Still, there are a few issues which I find highly annoying and hope that will be improved in updates in future. I've given the project as a whole a ""thumbs up"", though, because I strongly hope things will be improved... Some of the points:1) Give us more details! Maybe I have been blind and am just missing the obvious, but watching blinking colours is MUCH more fun, if you have a clue what its meaning is! Okay, most often it just differntiates differnt ""creatures"" or ""neurons"", but it would be good to have that verified... Even more important: There HAS to be some manual explaining what the various neurons ""do"" in the world, or it is just boring to see them evolve.2) I know that a simulation is not about ""looking nice"", but the UI in Gridworld is ""lacking"" at least. I think one can live with the very primitive optics, but what is unacceptable is the lack of ""responsiveness"" of certain elements. First, I thought it is simply the ""workload"" making it slow, but when you stop the simulation, the UI becomes fully un-responsive! That is horrible beyond measure...3) In a ""simulation game"", where observing is more or less all you do, the program has to offer as many ""observing"" features as possible. I'm missing a punch! I can ""export"" facts, but where can i see them plottet as graphs? I would like to do record ""time-lapses"" of my creatures evolvement to play as a simple ""movie"". I would like to have a ""Analysis-Screen"" for the neurons when I have a creature under the ""microsocope"", i.e. see how it's neural network ""looks"" and ""behaves""....4) Autosave simulation. I've run a 14hrs simulation and it just ""disappeared"". (Gridwork stopped working and vanished at one point.) Have at least a ""timed"" auto-save to be able to recover!5) Randomness: The whole simulation is based on random evolution. I think it would be mandatory to provided the means to ""recreate"" the same random-numbers, i.e. the seed for the random generator should be an accessible option. Thus you can ""rerun"" a simulation to the identical effect and check what a ""modification"" of some sort would do.6) Optics: Not the most important, but it would be very, very nice if the ""genes"" and ""networks"" could be turned into some ""creature-shape"" to be visually inspected. Only in the microscope (to have short rendering times.)"

So far they have split up into two subspecies, one higher developed than the other, while it seems that neither has an edge on the other. Both seem to travel in packs, members are rather short-lived. But efficiency in food finding is good enough to keep em going.Game doesn't have the best graphics, but it's fun to look at anyway.It's like having seemonkeys.One thing that would be improvable is to be able to deactivate creature spawn when left clicking.Pretty annoying to spawn 4 new species when I want to select one of mine.All in all 10/10 would disprove Christianity with a 4 Mb game again."

The first stages of competition have appeared!20 minutes later, the red poison creatures killed themselves and now the creatures are evolving to be super fast (and poison free).I accidentally caused near extinction 30 hours later by making the neural energy cost really high for a moment, then just keeping it raised slightly, and now the creatures are slowing down to save energy (40 jets instead of a high of 45 jets). Creature count is way, way down and they still haven't done any more new interesting things.Left it on for 2 days while I was away, came back, they were EXTINCT. Also, the game updated, causing old saves to no longer work. I started over.Creature 242 minutes after starting, viable life appeared (yay for random gen.) and they are currently randomly rotating to find food.23 hours later, they are finding food again.At 43 hours, they had developed into viruses, inserting their dna into every other creature they touched. To keep things  interesting, I surrounded them with a ring of lava. They suicide into the lava quite often.The update that forced me to restart really sped up creature replication, they are only 48 hours old and are already at generation 46400.They are still running into lava, at generation 115,000, 163 hours after starting the simulation (596 hours if this were running at 30 FPS, according to the game).166 hours in, they now avoid lava!209 hours in:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614764502also, here are some stats (140,000 generation):http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614767184Generation 200,000! This game's natural selection seems to trend toward the most basic of creatures, as it has been 342 hours and my creatures consist of pretty much just jets, mouths, neurons, dna and eyes. Even my attempt to force stingers hasn't led to their development.Game updated, highest generation was at 246,000. Nothing special happened.Creature 3Testing to see what the game will decide is best adapted to a basic lava map.Even faster this time, in only 10 hours the creatures are moving toward food. They still run into lava, however.My computer started getting too hot, this review is suspended indefinitely"

Those that eat food and survive can pass their genes on, and that simple rule allows intelligent behavior to appear as a result.10/10 if you want to see neural nets and a version of the genetic algorithm at work. Seems silly but these same things are used for all sorts of modern problems, from this game to facial recognition and image classification.If you want to see little evolving AI pixel creatures eat green pixels in a simulation and slowly start to exhibit more intelligent behavior, buy it. If you are interested in machine intelligence, check it out. But it's a simulation, much less a game."

76561198056046398,Recommended,396890,23260000,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,[FD] Thomas,"i was looking for super cheap games, and for one dollar, i gave this a shot. Here is what i got out of it.(NOTE: This is NOT a game however, so much as a simulation.)Overview: GridWorld more or less introduces a concept of order coming from chaos. It starts by creating random bits of AI with random atributes. It has a custom grid that sections off these AI, and generates a field of food, with some basic enviromental conditions.Gameplay:  While this is more of an educational simulation with the express purpose of demonstrating how evolution from chaos works on a micro scale, there are afew key events to look for.*The Kickoff-The goal is to find an AI with atributes that can sustain itself and can have offspring (an organism that can eat, move, and reproduce). This is where most people get irritated because they dont understand how RNG works, and assume the game is broken. But in actuality it can take afew hours for the big ""kick off"" to happen. But once it does, the organism will spread like wildfire, consume the food on the map, and then reach a population equalibrium.*Observation of mutation and AI-From here on out, the dominant AI will have a random chance of mutation with each reproductive cycle. The mutation  will either hurt or help the mutated AI. If it hurts, then the AI dies quickly. But if it helps, the mutated AI will slowly take over the pre-existing non mutated ones because of its better surviability. (my first time around, it was actually canibalism, go figure.)Additionally, the AI has the ability to ""learn"" and can develop some interesting behavioral patterns, in a similar fashon to physical mutation. As an example, it may learn to avoid the lava boundary.My opinion:In my opinion, this is a well made simulation. It perfectly demonstrates order from randomness, and how evolution is a thing. I think the most irritating thing is the GUI, and id like a better explaination of all the functions, the different physical attributes, along with the AI copy function. Some things id like to see are achievements, as this is a gaming platform, i think some game type things are in order. I think the developer is working as hard as they can on improving these aspects, so i can forgive the games minor flaws. As for the negative reviews ive seen and complaints about how the game ""doesnt work"", RNG sometimes isnt in your favor, but thats not the games issue thats just how math works. Anyways, its an all around decent educational simulation, and its kinda an envigorating feeling to have your own little AI world. I would recomend it to anyone with an interest in computer AI, biology, or if you have 99 cents. Thanks for reading!"

They spend their lives rushing from food source to food source, spitting out a baby every once in a while.  As an experiment, I drop a few meteors here and there, decimating the food supply and the number of creatures.  I leave it running while I go run errands.Day 2, evening:I return to a horror show.  Many of the grazers have died, as they can't find food fast enough before they starve.  The surviors are the the 650th generation, and have split into two major subspecies.  One is the descendant of the original grazing SANIC species, having lost much of its speed in order to conserve energy.  The other subspecies is their closely related cousin, who gained the ability to steal energy, and alternate between eating food nodes... and their kin.  They seem to have no ability or desire to diffrentiate between relatives and the grazing species, and devour both with glee.  I've watched several times where instances would consume their children immediately after birth, or children assaulting and eating their parents after birth.

It switched to a particular indiviudal, happily making his way along the west edge of the world, travelling along the border and reaping massive food gains from the realitively untouched area of the map.And then I watched his brethren barrel in from the east, collide with the until recently fortunate friend, poision him, and then push his body into the awaiting embrace of a lava oblivion."

I kept getting creatures that had features such as, cantm ove but can reproduce, creatures that cant eat but can move, ect ect.This went on for about 2 hours and then a small colorful creature started multiplying rapidly. these creatures ended up spreading EXTREMELY fast and dominated my world within minuits.

You can influence the simulation with MANY different factors, or save creatures from their inevitable death. This is a simulation about evolution. In the simpliest simulation, you have a world of food surrounded by lava. Randomly generated creatures will begin to spawn. Creatures that are 100% random. You will quickly learn that the chance for a species that can sustain itself is extremely low. It can take hours before you find a creature that starts reproducing. It may seem awful that all you find are creatures that only know how to spin in place or don't even have a mouth to eat. When you do find it, it feels awesome. AND THE BEST PART: It is totally random. You may find your typical creature who just runs, eats, and reproduces, but you can also find cool creatures. In one simulation, I decided to put a big lake in the middle to see if it could change anything. Suprisingly, a creature which I call the ""Shore dweller"" arose. It lay dormant on the shore, conserving energy, until it reproduced another along the shore. There was just a pack of them wading beside the lake, living for an extremely long time. Recently, I started a game. Many creatures were spawning that were able to move and eat, but when it reproduced, it created imperfect, lifeless creatures which would die. Then the ""Rollers"" came along. A species that produced, yet seemed to also product those same imperfect babies. So how did they reproduce? Appearently, these acted as eggs. Something unique about these rollers is that they would roll things in a circle around their body if they touched something. They would roll the eggs, feeding them, and they would then ""hatch,"" being like all the others. Seeing these cool things like this make you feel good. Sadly, this creature relied on a huge amount of food and didn't like turning. I made a river that split this world in half, so they only had 2 real ways to go (Unless they had abilities to cross the river, which though they made some progress, not enough.) They went into my lava border and their species was wiped out, along with all food in the area. If you decide to play this game, there is a pretty good chance you will have a unique creature to rule your simulation. Or 2, if you try and segregate areas to attempt to get multiple creatures.ALSO, you should totally check out Rickashay's steam guide on the Boom Bust Cycle. It shows you another awesome example of a creature and they tell you about a cool cycle to fluctuate creature size."

Apart from setting initial parameters (world type, mutation frequency, etc.), it's mostly about letting your little petri dish world sit and develop. Checking in on it periodically is fun, as you can definitely see progress after several hours, but don't expect a whole lot of detailed interaction. The interface and details do take a little while to get used to, but it's cool to be able to look at fairly detailed information about each organism. I only wish the creator had put in more options to track ""species"" rather than just individuals.If you like watching little worlds and systems develop on their own, this is the game for you (just don't go in expecting, as another user said, a world as detailed as Rick and Morty's battery).

,Recommended,396890,20507563,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,Aze,"Gridworld is an exceptionally intriguing concept held back by a poor UI and insufficient explanations of mechanics..Gameplay:Gridworld isn’t really a game, and is better described as a simulator.  Thus, the gameplay consists mostly of messing with world settings and waiting to see how this will affect the creatures that have evolved in it.  That being said, the game does present a fairly large number of ways to interact; almost anything is possible, ranging from changing food distribution to creating flowing rivers of lava.User Interface:The UI is, quite frankly, horrible.  In a game where the only fun thing to do is change settings, doing so is painfully difficult.  Menus are unclear, and the entire UI is unintuitive.  Furthermore, the cursor runs as slowly as the game; even on solid computers it will drop to around 10fps, making menu navigation even more frustration.  If the UI were completely revamped, this game may become far more playable.Gridworld has serious potential to be a fascinating simulator, but I would suggest thinking very carefully before buying the game.  If you're willing to navigate a confusing UI and don't mind being confused, then Gridworld is worth the hurdles it presents."

Featuring actual neural network based brains. (Sort of.)An artificial life, natural selection simulation. One of the few truly easy to use, easy (with some time) to comprehend, sims of its kind. Complex enough for real neural nets to exist and self-replicate (though there is not, to my knowledge, any deep or reinforcement learning happening here - just pure natural selection,) and for interesting behaviors to evolve over time.Definitely not a game so much as a simulation though, and the user interface is a bit opaque, so expect a learning curve. Fortunately, the simulation handles most of the work for you, so you can simply let it run and observe until you're ready to make changes yourself and experiment.Map editing tools allow creation of specific experimental designs intended to test how the simulation's natural selection process ""responds"" to specific challenges, and tweaking things like the energy consumption required for certain neurons to exist, the level of friction or damage in certain terrains, etc. allow for even more control.Full reviewIntroductiomI had been on something of a deep reinforcement learning kick when I stumbled upon this sim, and while it does not (that I can tell) feature any true ""learning,"" it may be the finest, easiest to use natural selection AI simulator I've found so far.I am by no means an intellectual - I have little education, and am a complete layperson when it comes to artificial intelligence. But here is a program complicated enough for more intelligent people to run full experimental studies with - assuming proper experimental design of course - yet simple enough for a dolt like myself to use, tweak, and observe effectively enough to still learn something. It truly is endlessly fascinating.Complexity from simplicity - emergent behaviorThe premise couldn't be simpler. A grid - size of your choice - which continually populates with food (the green squares,) and random creatures. Its border is (at least by default) surrounded by deadly lava. Each creature consists of a membrane (a colored square,) and neurons (inputs for sensing the environment, a middle layer, and outputs for affecting the world and the creature's actions within it: grabbing, turning, feeding, moving, signaling, etc.)DNA, which mutates randomly, determines the neural network and the properties of the neurons. (E.g. what the neurons do is already established on a neuron by neuron basis beforehand, but the DNA tells each neuron what its specific threshold for signaling is, where in the network they are positioned, which neurons exist or get deleted each generation, etc. etc.)Each membrane can hold a configuration of input, middle, and output neurons (a neural network) at a maximum of 9x9x9.  So these are extremely rudimentary creatures, indeed.However, the random generation of these creatures' neural configurations, combined with genetic mutation and drift over  successive generations, means that natural selection over time takes place, and those creatures more specialized to find food, reproduce quickly, and avoid death, naturally tend to dominate.Given enough time complex and interesting behaviors naturally emerge.Epochs and equilibrium: Natural selection does not always result in linear, exponential advancementOne of the most intriguing things to observe in Gridworld, is how ""eras"" or ""epochs"" of specific traits seem to naturally emerge.For example: early in the simulation, there tends to be a life explosion. This is quickly counterbalanced by food scarcity. Those creatures which survive the ensuing starvation then pass their genes on to subsequent generations.Another example may come when creatures evolve to be more rapid, more efficient food seekers. A particular mutation - such as the ability to turn toward food for instance - may allow a creature with those specific traits to rapidly outproduce others, leading to their competitors' extinction and their own domination of the world. However, this too can be self-limiting, as eventually they can become so good at finding food, they begin to starve. Or, in the pursuit of food, they grow so fast that the speed with which they dive into the deadly lava at the world's border may outstrip the pace at which they can reproduce. In either case, and in others, they may eventually die out, or get out-evolved by another, more conservative species.For this reason, faster/better/more neural activity is not always the recipe for success. A simpler creature with a better balance between food seeking, energy efficiency, and reproductive rate - perhaps with a random tendency to change direction more often, lessening the likelihood that they will run straight into the lava - may be more successful than bigger brained competitors.All of this means the game goes through phases of rapid evolution and dominance by a single creature type, followed by some sort of impact on the world by said creature's ubiquity and behavior, until such time as a new equilibrium can be reached... either by the creature itself evolving to adapt, or a new creature outperforming it. This cyclical process of ""epochs"" is truly random, emergent, and unpredictable. Which makes it extremely compelling/entertaining to observe!Speaking of the lava...One of the most interesting and popular behaviors evolved by some, is the ability to detect and avoid lava. This is held up by many as an example of successful evolution, and many have expressed frustration and dismay at the rarity of this trait.It's important to remember however, that we are not talking about true intelligence or learning, here. We are simply dealing with rudimentary natural selection. In practice what this means, is that an advanced ability such as the detection of danger and the capacity to steer away from it, is not necessarily always the greatest sign of fitness to survive in Gridworld. Simpler organisms that reproduce faster may overtake these more advanced creatures, by sheer numerical superiority and food consumption. Which of the two then survives that mass starvation will depend not on who is better equipped to avoid lava, but on who is best able to find food and reproduce.This introduces an intrinsic and common limiting factor in Gridworld that some find disappointing. But make no mistake... it's entirely possible, however rare, for the perfect combination of food seeking, turning, danger avoidance, speed, and reproductivity to evolve. When and if that happens, you'll see very fast, very ""smart"" (not literally) agents avoiding danger and popping out babies like there's no tomorrow, while also not inducing a mass extinction because of their energy efficiency which requires less food.Natural selection is not the same as learning,and as such, species can go ""backwards,"" or reach evolutionary dead ends. Especially if you start changing the environment. Creatures well adapted to the previous status quo may die out, unable to cope with the changes, prompting newer adaptations to usurp their position in the food chain.PROSTrue neural approximations of brainsNatural selection driven emergent behavior & adaptationCan be run passively, taking an extremely hands-off approachFascinating to observeEasy for anyone to understand with some time and effortCreature capturing, importing, & exporting between different experimental gridsUser editing of world grids, energy cost, types of neurons that can be generated, amount & rate of mutation, & much more.CONSVery RAM intensive at high creature and neuron counts.Somewhat difficult to understand user interface.No reinforcement learning.If you find sea monkeys or ants boring, you probably won't like this more than that.ConclusionVery accessible, powerful sim, demonstrating true natural selection."
