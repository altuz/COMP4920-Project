The game itself is fun but recent changes to the game have been almost entirely negative and the developers refuse to acknowledge it as of this review.The constructed mode is fun and skill intensive but unless you want to pay more money it takes forever to build a collection solely through dailies and constructed wins. I find this unacceptable for a game that isn't free, when it's competitors are, and has a terrible draft mode.The draft mode, called pandora, was much anticipated and about 2 months late. It's launch ended up being one of the bigger dissapointments I've witnessed in gaming. The actual drafting will be familiar to anyone who's played digital CCG's before but in the middle of games you randomly draw ""pandora shards"" which wildly swing the game often leading to players who were very far ahead due to clever play now being at parity or even behind because of a single shard. The only people I've seen praise this system are praising it as a very casual format which is counter to how Faeria is presented (a potential e-sport). What makes it worse is each time the devs come out and talk about it it comes out as condescending and blaming the player base for over emphasizing the impact of the pandora shards."

76561198015014834,Recommended,397060,24444681,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Grammar Communist,"Ok i've spend more than 40hours on this, i guess i have to write a review now..Keep in mind that the game is still in early access.First: The price.Since it seems to be the first concern about the review...Right now, the game cost 8€, but it will be free on its release. So unless you want to play during early access (with its amount of bug and unbalanced gameplay), it's just your typical free to play game with a grinding/store system. You know, basically just like every other cards game. So let's compare thoses two systems with the most popular card game, Hearthstone:Grinding is faster than Hearthstone. The idea is exactly the same, aka earning gold by winning or doing daily quest, and buying booster for 100 gold each. You can also craft cards using raw materials you get from unused cards you want to get rid of. The difference stand by the numbers: in Faeria, you earn 10 gold per win, while in Hearthstone it's 10 gold per 3 wins. Quest also give more gold (60-80 in faeria, for 40-60 in Hearthstone). You also win a booster each time you level up.Crafting is also a lot cheaper in Faeria, since you need 400 raw material to craft a Legendary card (the rarest ones), while you need 1600 in Hearthstone for the same result.If you don't want to lose time on farming, you can also buy boosters, just like in any other cards game. The difference here is you can buy all the collection for 50€, while it's usually 50€ for a large pack of booster (like in hearthstone, for exemple). So for the same price, you are certain to have every cards you need, instead of trying your luck with boosters and not even opening the whole collection in the end.So i don't get why people complain over the price. This is certainly the cheapest or the fastest to complete card game right now.Second: The gameplay.This game reminds me of Pox Nora, another cards/tactical game that was quite popuplar back then. So you need to take the control of the map by literally building it, in order to defend your mana pool, defend your god or get near the opponent's one. This makes the game having two sides: is my deck strong enough to catch up with my opponent's one, and how am i going to take control of the map building lands?Cards use some of the mechanics we see in all TCG, like haste, taunt, doing X when it comes in play, etc... but also have clever powers on lands you build, and introducing mechanics i wasn't used to, like doing damage to the player while fighting his creatures, wich i find very interesting since it open a whole new level of thought over the triade Control/Aggro/Combo we see in every god damn cards games.Right now, i have to say the game is not well balanced, even if it's not awful. Even though i have all the cards, i cannot make every deck i want, because some colors or combination of colors are just way stronger and faster than others. But they are trying to balance it and in the end, it could lead to a very large variety of possibilities.Did i mention how not random this game is compare to Hearthstone? Right now in Hearthstone, 50% of cards have random effects. This is so pleasant to get rid of that randomness.Third: The communauty.This game has a very large group of players, so you won't be bothered while looking for someone to play against. This game is quite new however, so netdecking is awful. Since meta is not 100% stable, you don't see a lot of variety when you play ranked matches. On the other hand, unranked match show some very different idea, and i love to chill playing my fun decks on unranked, while i play ranked with the serious stuff.Fourth: The visual.Yeah it's beautiful and original art design. But i really don't cary about visual.Finally, i just have to say that this game feels like the best Trading Cards Game online right now. Of course, IRL nothing can beat the God of TCG, aka Magic the Gathering (even if it's also the most expensive one), but online this one seems to take the first place. To bad it wasn't designed by Blizzard, so it won't get as popular."

If you face the same opponents you can adapt really quickly to their playstyle in terms of how you take control of the board with your elements, which is amazing... kinda like chess. If you like hearthstone but are kinda put off by the random rng elements just crushing you sometimes out of nowhere then I'd say knowledge of the game will be more prudent in this game than hearthstone. Also faeria's soundtrack and art is just super zen and relaxing :P I am glad I checked it out even when I was sceptical, as I am chained to Hearthstone dailies and was let down by Duelyst, but yea this game is just sublime, might consider buying the full card collection for 50 bucks meaning all 250+ cards... which is nothing by the way, compared to Hearthstone prices its like 2-20% of that, based on ur RNG."

Drawback is that the playerbase is much smaller than it deserves to be. My main reason I switched from Hearthstone is that luck is not as important. Here the better player usually wins.
,Not Recommended,397060,25834708,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Scarran,"With the removal of purchasing the core set from the store coming in patch 0.9 (12th October) I cannot recommend this game. It is evident the game is becoming like every other card game with the rng gambling card packs, that people throw money at in order to try and get the cards that they want.What set this game apart for me was not only its unique gameplay but the fact any new player coming into the game could easily get on a level playing field with other players by being able to purchase the core set.Currently new players have the option of spending the price of a AAA game to get on a level playing field but after 0.9 I cannot see how any new player is going to be able to compete.  But of course these type of card games are never about level playing fields it's generally all about milking your player base for their cash through rng card packs."

It´s not as easy to start with as Hearthstone, but with a great tutorial and single player mode, you´ll soon find yourself familiar with new game mechanics, not to mention a generous reward system which really helps you build your collection quite fast (I´m free-to-play player). Landtiles, Faeria pools and action-wheel gives another layers and options, while still keeping the games quite fast. What drew me to this game was an amazing art, and honetsly I didn´t think I´ll play it more than HS, but Faeria won me over completely. For a game in Early Access it´s extremely well-balanced and I can´t think about any OP cards at the moment.There is a lot of comparison with Hearthstone, but don´t me mistaken, Faeria is very different game, which you might not notice at first, but more you get into, you´ll see it. The feel of Faeria world is also different, more whimsical, fairy-tale, eerie world."

76561198109537536,Recommended,397060,23208878,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,OaiaNeagra,"I gave this a try today, here's my opinion so far.Constructed is fine, but Pandora is flawed. You get those ""artifact"" cards that you draw randomly and they give bonuses like +6 faerie or a charge card etc. Problem is the guy who draws the artifact has a huge advantage that turn, which is absolutely flawed. Same goes for when the 5th artifact is drawn, the guy who's turn it is has a huge advantage of tempo. That's bad design if you ask me.Despite all this, the game looks promising. It's all in the execution and we'll have to wait and see how it's tackled.Atm I am not tempted at all to invest in buying anything, as there are flaws, I randomly get disconnected for instance. Also the special effects and sounds are lacking which make for an incomplete experience. I could also add the fact that the minions are very small on the board which raises questions about this becoming an esport or being playable on smaller devices.Yet, again despite all this I can see potential. There is strategy in positioning, so it's not only the deck and draw order. Unfortunately there will probably be guides for net decks that will spoil this amazing concept, but you will still have a lot of freedom in coming up with strats due to this added element of depth. I just hope the developers don't limit strategic options like Hearthstone developers do, but instead give players exciting options and let them come up with the strats. If anything is OP, nerf it.TL DL We need special effects, animations to make this look less static, sound effects, a better Pandora mode without listed flaws. We also need bigger minions for smaller devices and viewer experience. Apart from this, the game looks very promising and I think I've already made the money back in the 4-5 hours I played - had a positive winrate in constructed with my first ever deck, but failed miserably in Pandora and was terribly annoyed by the artifacts."

Replayability is limited at the moment due to available cards during early access. Worth checking out for MTG fans for sure, big MTG vibe here.My recommendations to the devs:More interaction with the map - give structures 3D models rather than using a card thumbnail when placed on the map, that'd look awesome. The game needs more cards which interact with the map, such as land destruction.Improve the thumbnails of cards in play, the portraits are very small and not immersive.More powerful sound effects and attack/spell animations, they are a little underwhelming at the moment. A bit of screen shake wouldn't go amiss! :)Make it so units can swap places with one another by taking a movement point from each, so you don't have your own troops causing blockages which is rather unthematic."
76561198053709958,Recommended,397060,25924406,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Taiyodori,"Faeria, in short, is an awesome mix between your usual CCG (collectible card game, like Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Scrolls, Duelyst) and a strategy board game. If you like one or the other genre, this game is for you. If you like both, you’ll love Faeria.About me: I played Hearthstone for more than two years now, got bored of how expansions became more and more about (badly designed) rng, strategy mattered less and less. About 4 months ago, despite some pretty negative reviews here, I decided to give Faeria a try. And boy, I didn’t regret it!For those of you, who are interested about some details about Faeria (general gameplay, grind, other stuff), there’s a big wall of text below.For everyone else, here’s aTL;DR:+ CCG with a surprisingly great amount of strategy and unique board+ Beautiful artwork, magically soothing atmosphere+ Competitive constructed ladder and monthly tournaments with $-rewards, for anybody to qualify+ Affordable Draft-mode with good amounts of rewards+ Single player content, with puzzles and special npc challenges (and rewards)+ Fair grind (~6-9 months of just the dailies to get a full collection)+ Developers read community feedback and are sometimes accessible via the official dischord channelWall of text (you have been warned!)1) The familiar - Faeria’s card design:You can build a deck of 30 cards total, where you can include each card 3 times at maximum (1x in case of a “legendary”). Cards come in 5 different colors (Grey (“neutral”), green, blue, red, yellow (“colored”)), which all more or less have their own themes. You can combine each of them as you wish; even decks that use cards of each color are viable options. Card types are distributed into creatures (mobile units), structures (immobile units) and events (spells). Like in many other CCGs, your creature cards have two primary stats (attack and life) and when creatures attack each other, both of them are dealt the damage of one another. Costwise, there are two requirements for the colored cards – faeria (mana) + a specific land requirement, like “2 forests”. Which leads me to the next part…2) Gameplay/Strategy – The board:The most unique element of Faeria is its board. Unlike many other CCGs, in Faeria you can NOT just hit your opponent’s life (“orb”) the turn after you played a creature or as long as there are no other enemy creatures in your way. Instead, you have to place each creature on one of your own hex tiles and make your way to your opponent, and probably past his creatures.Which tile belongs to whom, you ask? Well, that is part of the strategy already: The board is actually built anew each game. All tiles start as ocean tiles creature’s usually can’t move onto, and players have to place lands, starting from their own orb. You can either build 2x neutral “prairie” (fast land building), or 1 of 4 different colored lands (slower land building, but necessary as a resource).Cards of a specific color (green/blue/red/yellow) can only be played, if you have built a certain amount of the specific type of land (forest/lake/mountain/desert). In case of colored creatures, you can only summon them on their specific land type. Therefore it’s strategically important when and where you place your land, especially if you combine the colors within your deck.In general, creatures can be used the turn after being summoned. They can move one tile per turn and attack one adjacent enemy unit. After attacking, a unit can't move anymore until the next turn. One tile can only ever have a single unit on it.Hence, positioning (of both, land and units) is key; blocking off an opponent creature's path with one of your own is a usual strategy.Faeria (mana) is stored and carried over from turn to turn. You don’t lose any unspent faeria. Instead you can collect your faeria over several turns and plan to make a big move. Consequently, you don't have to wait until the end of the game to play your big creatures, but to save enough faeria in general.You gain +3 faeria each turn by default and you can also collect faeria with your creatures from faeria wells. Those are the four little blue orbs at the far right and left of the board. They are a key element and most of the time you have to fight over them with your opponent.3) Game modesRight now there are basically 3 different game modes:Constructed - casual and ranked ladder.Pandora - a draft-mode; with a sudden death element at some point.Single player - puzzles (you're confronted with a preset board situation you have to solve), practice vs npcs (for new players), special challenges vs. npcs; (all with a ton of rewards to get you started!)4) Artwork, atmosphereFaeria has a very nice atmosphere and artwork. It kinda reminds me of Ori and the blind forest (another game I’d really recommend, if you like platformers). Each card comes with a beautiful piece of art, though some of them aren’t finished, yet. Other than that, the game looks very polished already, even though it's still early access.If you seek gimmicky, comical artwork, though, you might be disappointed.5) The grind – how (long does it take) to get all the cards?If you come from Hearthstone, the system well seem quite similar at a first glance: 100 gold/booster; card rarities are common, rare, epic, legendary. You can disenchant surplus cards for memoria, which you can use to craft specific cards.HOWEVER, the grind is so much faster already, and will become even faster with the next update on October 12th.Faeria is very generous about giving gold and rewards. You get rewards from pretty much everything: Wins, daily quests, draft-mode, beating the single player content, your ranking each season (months), leveling up.One daily and about 1-3 wins per day earn you enough gold for a booster already.The chances for rares, epics and legendaries per pack are pretty high: 1 epic in 2-3 packs; a legendary in about every 15-20 packs on average – which is about twice as often as I was used from Hearthstone, and with a lot more packs to open, too! As a new player, you also get like 50 packs worth of gold from the single player content plus a starter set for each color, along with some draft mode tickets.You also gain exp for each match (even vs friends, at least 3 times per day). With each level up you’re presented three cards of a set rarity (depending on the level, I guess), all of which you’re guaranteed not to have 3 copies of yet, and you can choose one from. Each pack gives you the option to reroll the card of the highest rarity for another card of the same rarity. So it's not too hard to gain new cards later on.I played Faeria for ~3 and a half months now and I’m pretty near getting all of the cards I probably need to build every single one of the current competitive decks (and that was without the previously mentioned new options to reroll cards and pick one of three/levelup). With the new system, I should be able to complete my collection within the next 3 months just by doing the dailies.That said, I’m sad to see the option of buying the full collection for $50 go away. BUT, considering you only need ~6 months total to literally get every single card in the game without spending any money, this is the fairest f2p model I have ever seen in the CCG-genre.6) CommunityFrom what I’ve seen, Faeria has a very nice community, accessible in the official forum and dischord channel. The developers read community feedback and are sometimes available for discussion on the official dischord channel.---------------So for those of you, who actually read through all of this, I hope this was some helpful information on what to expect from Faeria. Thank you very much for your time. :)"

I’m going to compare some gameplay elements and other aspects of Faeria to Hearthstone, as far as that is possible. Btw, the game time shown on steam doesn't represent my actual game time, as I have mostly been playing on iPad in early access.*Basic Mechanics*Right away, the most obvious difference in mechanics is the board. Faeria is actually a sort of hybrid between Collectible Card Game (CCG) and strategy game. This aspect immediately adds several layers of complexity to the gameplay. Placing land, positioning and moving your creatures the right way is crucial to successful play, and the right way to do it is different for each deck and gameplan. This is also the reason why Faeria takes a bit longer to learn than Hearthstone but is, i.m.o., a much more rewarding game. Sure, sometimes you lose due to bad draws, but it hardly ever happens that you lose with the feeling that there is nothing you could have done to prevent it. Consequently, winning also feels more rewarding as you usually know where you made the right decisions and how you earned your victory.Another key difference to Hearthstone, and most other CCGs is the fact that in Faeria you don’t lose unused “Mana”, or “Faeria” as it’s called here. your unused Faeria carries over into the next round. This means that playing “on curve”, i.e. trying to spend all your Faeria each round to play as efficiently as possible, doesn’t apply, which in turn allows for more elaborate plays, as you may save your mana for a big swing turn for example.*Cost*Compared to Hearthstone, it is much more viable to build a competitive deck within a reasonable amount of time. This is due to several factors:• There are less total cards, meaning that now is the best time to get into the game while it’s not too hard to catch up on your collection.• Legendaries are not crucial. There are several competitive decks that don’t use any legendaries, and overall, with some exceptions, most legendaries are actually not that good and mostly have niche roles.• There are few bad cards, few “pack fillers” in Faeria. There are very few cards that you are sure will never see competitive play. This means opening packs will actually meaningfully add to your collection.• If you decide to spend a bit of money, the value you get is simply much better than in Hearthstone.There is much more to say, but this review is already quite long. Best to check the game out for yourself. Also have a look at the official Faeria website for decks and guides:https://www.faeria.com/the-hubIf you decide to give Faeria a go, please add me as your recruiter.

The ""living board"" alone adds astounding depth to the game.  Over-aggression may be met by a starvation of resources, and attempts at control overrun by cautious and crafty land placement.What has impressed me the most, though, is the full collection offer.  While I have not yet partaken of it myself, the ""fairness"" of it is unheard of.  A mere $50 to unlock the entire core set, and a full refund (in gold) for any previously opened boosters?

We are far from the RNG of Hearthstone, and I really hope we won't get closer (I haven't seen any random damage target, for instance, and this is good !!!)atm, the strategy is more present in Faeria than in Hearthstone, which makes this game a 'must have', at least to make more player come and make the community gather more and more players.N'joy!"

The developers are becoming more and more greedy and the game is turning into a ""pay money to gamble for a chance to play on an even ground"" card game, which for me would be okay if it was like that from the start, but hating this type of model the only reason I bought the game was because I could skip all the gambling. Also, there are a lot of different card games out there if you want to pay a huge sum of money, some of them even have a grid based board. Why would you pick this game over them, except for the art maybe?The game has lost it's unique selling point and the signs the developers are giving are not good. And at the moment there is not that much variety either. On top levels there are only a couple of decks that are played and the player-base is quite small. I don't like giving this review because the game is quite fun, but I feel that the game is not going in a good direction and I would definitely not have spent money on it in its current state.Update: And now the developers announced that a part of the solo content will be locked behind a paywall, and they also said that they will not really change it. Which is bad because the best thing about the solo content was the rewards that are now effectively removed.

This game has potential to be the next HS as Duelyst has kind of fallen off the charts.Out of the 4 games I mentioned, without a doubt Faeria requires the most skill to win. The problem with card games is that if its too simple, anyone who can get their hands on the meta cards can become a top player. That is not the case with Faeria. It is like a game of chess, there are many possible moves each turn and it takes a true tactician to win this game. Also what I dislike about HS is the class simple. I loved it at first, but it felt like it make deckbuilding too straightfowarded depending on the meta. Faeria is setup like MTG where you can combine different ""colors"".

It's a much more economical option than buying boosters.I purchased the steam special starter which gave 20 boosters + 10? arena entrances, which also grant packs.This game definitely takes some time to learn, where as a good hearthstone player can easily pick duelyst and play that at a high level.Edit:  Ask for a refund before you've played two hours.

As a level 23 noob, I got matched up against the same level 17 player who killed me within 7 or 8 turns twice in a row, after searching for over nearly two full minutes.   In regards to the level system, it seems to be the same as hearthstone ranked play where you earn stars that grant you level progress.  Games in this game are often fairly long, taking 30+ minutes where as Duelyst games are very fast paced (end in 15 minutes before turn 10).  Hearthstone can be either fast or somewhat long if two control decks are facing each other.The stupidly low player base should tell you that not many people are playing this game, as searching for a regular match often takes over a minute as well.

Take that as you will, but resources such as Luuu90's video series make getting into Faeria less scary and more thrilling. Every move matters, but let that be empowering rather than crippling, and you'll have a good time playing the game.Try it out -- it's free, and the solo content and once-daily free draft are enough to start quickly getting your feet wet. The draft especially (Pandora mode) allows you to play on entirely equal footing with other players, and the Codex sets of cards you'll get from the solo content will allow you to be competive in Battle mode as well.

For me personally I have to say this game is looking to be a complete disappointment. I love the concept and the original selling points of this game (for me anyway) was that it was a different take on the ccg genre and I about a year back (maybe two?) I watched a few games of what looked to have a ton of potential for an interesting and unique ccg experience.Fast forward to present day and after a looooong development cycle and an apparent reboot/overhaul and I was suprised to see this game pop up on steam as an Early Access title. I had honestly given up on this game ever getting any kind of release so I was excited and jumped right in to find.....1- A game that is very clearly trying to look exactly like Hearthstone (the card art style and setup is  nearly identical) which was immediately disappointing. Personally I am just not a big fan of the H-stone for a number of reasons and the art-stlye presentation is defintely on the list. Perhaps there will be some tweaking to make this comparision less obvious as EA plays out and if you like H-Stone art well you won't be as sore as I am to see what they did here.2-I went through the first couple of hours just learning the ropes and came to a realisation that at the present moment the game is just kind of ""blank"" in terms of a theme. I mean it's clearly fantasy and there's some pretense about you being a god etc. but nothing about the game makes me FEEL like I am god or that I am interacting in a fantasy world. It just feels like I am playing a board game which is Okay but not up to the standard of alot of other ccg's out there. Maybe some of this will get fleshed out as EA progresses a bit but right now the game just feels like I am playing a knockoff of Hearthstone with the tactical map.3- The skills and keywords of the current selection of cards are a bit underwhelming and bare bones.......taunt, flying, charge, production, are all present in some form or another in many other games in the genre. There are some exceptions here and again EA so perhaps this will expand...4-The tactical map is bright spot and probably the only reason I am going to keep checking back. I really enjoying have the positional element come into play with my strategy games so any game that takes this into account gets a plus one from me.Have you noticed the number of times I have said ""Well Early Access"" thus far? Well it's early access so here's hoping they can correct some of the issues....but my gut reaction is if this is what we get after 3-4 years of development I am losing faith that his one is going improve enough to be more than a badly mangled H-Stone cash in. I get that H-stone is where the money is being made so imitating the industry leader makes sense in that regard. However there really needs to be more than just one thing (Tactical Map) that will make you stand apart you from the game your imitating. Otherwise it just feels like it's the same song with a new dance for more cash/time/investment.Purely as a tactical strategy game the new(ish) ccg The Duelyst blows this game out of the water. Though there are problems with that as well I would advise spending your time (for free) with that game as compared to paying to beta test this one.4/10 thus far......In case the developers want some more constructive feedback on specific features -----Biggest disappointment for me was that you have this great concept of having a hexagon/map/board and yet the play lands to fill it in mechanic should be the highlight of the experience. Yet it comes off so flat. I feel like they have a golden idea here but the implementation of it breaks down to which resource should I stock up on 90 percent of the time. Having different factions of creatures requiring a certain tile to enter the map is a nice touch and does add a tiny bit of flavor but there is so much more that should or coule be done with it. I mean how about giving each of the lands some kind of character/ability outside of just being another pile of resources and creating a new launch pad for qualifiying units? How about being able to move an extra tile if you start your turn on a plains or gaining a defensive boost but inability to move for a turn when a unit starts on a mountain? Or being able to burn down forests with a spell? or requiring a particular setup to build structures i.e. they require you to build on a desert tile that does not touch any water to get the full benefit?  There are some cards that take advantage of this aspect but I really think the game needs to do a 180 and make this the FOCUS of the game. As it stands the map/resource setup is really just a feature that feels slaped on to try and make a standard ccg feel a little different.Some of the abilities and cards from the lake/blue archtype are the only mechanics I found to be of much interest. Building off of those ideas and expanding them into the other factions would be a good place to start."

That is the projected actual release.You build lands across a map and use your deck of cards to do battle with the opposing player. Your mana can carry over from turn to turn so curving is not quite as important as in other card games.The game is interesting, albeit slow (as demonstrated by their attempts at having widely viewed competitive tournies).The barrier to entry is far below Duelyst but your ability to be competitive is crippled much more here. The meta shifts wildly with every patch so unlike Hearthtone for example, you can't still climb with the shell of a deck you had that was previously successful.The balance is sketchy at best and quite inconsistent. I have two good examples of this.When asked about a mind-control style card (Magda) the developers admitted that it was meant to have no place in competitive play, but once it found a super strong niche they eliminted the card altogether.Then, in these patch notes below, they admitted to trying to make a card overpowered simply because they liked the idea of a ""wild and exciting change"".https://faeria.com/news/patch-notes/33-patch-notes-april-27th-2016I like the game, but it is not worth the ten bucks. Card crafting exchange rates are extremely unfavorable, but there is no cap to how much you can farm in a day which is nice.Negative feedback is unwelcome in the discord server, as Taiga claimed.

Faeria, on the other hand, has much deeper strategy, as it adds the mechanic of zoning your territory and positioning your units on a hexagonal battlefield. Furthermore, the game's namesake mana is something that accumulates each turn, so there is no pressure to have a ""mana curve"" or to dump your hand on the board. You can simply bide your time and be at no disadvantage (as long as the enemy doesn't make significant gains in board control). This leads to situations where, say, having a 10 cost creature from turn 1 may actually be beneficial.

It might seem like a card-games like any other one - because it's obviously a card-game -, but once you're starting spending a little bit of time into it, you'll realize how deep the gameplay can be.Just to explain a little bit : every turn, you gain three Faerias (the equivalent of mana in this game), and draw a card. You have the choice to either draw another card, gain an additionnal Faeria, or put fields down the board. There are 4 Faeria wells, that each give a Faeria if one of your creatures manage to reach them, and replenish every turn.And then, strategy strikes. Controlling the board is a necessity, but so is controlling the Faeria wells. You may want to turtle near your orb, or rush the enemy to prevent them from getting any. There are plenty of different strategies available, plenty of different decks, of different combos that you can pull off. And that's what makes the game amazing.Be warned though, that the game will be in Free to play once it'll get released, in September; but that the early access will let you start with additionnal packs, and an orb and an avatar exclusive to the Early Access players.Do I recommend this game ?

Although at first glance it may look like a Hearthstone/MTG knockoff, it's so much more! Where other CCGs will have you play minions to smash into your opponent's minions or face, the addition of a hex-grid opens up a vast amount of strategic possibilities. As mentioned things work a little differently in Faeria. The first thing to note is that mana(which is called faeria) is cumulative. You gain 3 every turn and there and there are 4 sidewells to harvest 1 faeria each turn from with your minions, so if you save up the first couple turns you can play some big stuff pretty quickly! This can be risky too, though, as if you haven't played any creatures you won't be able to harvest from the faeria wells to get ahead of your opponent's faeria curve.Cards in Faeria must meet two requirements: 1) The faeria cost & 2) The land thresholds. There are 4 types of elemental lands: Forests, Mountains, Lake, & Desert that you can make one of each turn, and a 5th type of neutral land, plains, which you can create 2 of per turn. Switching between these two is key to developing the board aggressively & getting your creatures into your opponent's hero orb. The colored cards will need to be played on your corresponding colored land types, but your neutral cards can go on any field you control, so keep that in mind too when developing a deck. Neutral cards are also very handy because they don't require you to have elemental lands.Developing a board effectively is both challenging and rewarding. Figuring out your opponent's deck/playstyle is key to winning card games, but inFaeriayou can use more than just their faeria(mana) & cards they've played. Have they played a couple of mountains? You better expect some damage dealingredcontrol cards. Have they played two neutral lands and a desert directly towards you, sacrificing the ability to farm faeria from the side wells? Chances are they're ayellowrush deck & you better decide if you need to play defensively or face race.There are many decisions to make in this game on every turn, which is why I ultimately feel like this game surpasses Hearthstone in terms of how much control player skill has over the outcome of matches. But don't worry, there's still a little a RNG thrown in w/some cards if that's your thing. The developers are constantly looking @ the way games are played & fine-tuning/balancing is done very conservatively & with careful consideration.I paid a few dollars for early access & feel it was worth every penny, but if you're conscious of $ it IS free to play & some of the best players in the community pride themselves on being F2P. With monthly tournaments(doling out prize money, mind you), a rich art style, a vibrant meta(new strategies are always being discovered/developed), multiple ways to play including single player, constructed Casual/Ranked, & Pandora(similar to Arena from Hearthstone but with OP treasure cards each player drafts into their deck), and a very friendly community,you'd be a fool to not try it.Just make sure you sacrifice a yak to appeaseGarudanfirst.

Essentially, you get mana every turn automatically, which can be used to cast things. In addition, you're able to create one special land, like a: forest, island, mountain, or two plains. To cast specialized cards, you need to have mana, in addition to a number of these special lands. But you're not just placing these lands for casting purposes. You also use them to alter the playing field, literally.Like Dungeon Dice Monsters, you need to create a path to the opponent, so you can strike them and lower their health pool of 20 to 0. You can do this in a variety of ways, from manually creating lands, to playing spells or creatures that make them as an additional effect. Whenever you create a land, you are able to use it to play a spell on. Basically, you can cast a normal creature on any land, a mountain creature on any mountain you have, and etc. Creatures can then move across created lands, using them as a bridge. Lands generally can only be played and connected to eachother, meaning you can't just make one wherever you please. This is where paths come in.The goal of the game is to not only gain control of the board in terms of the number of monsters you have, but also in where you play your land. By cutting off your opponent's path, you can for the most part, prevent them from creating lands further into your territory, which would have allowed them to cast monsters closer to your life points. It's a fun and interesting system, that gives the game a unique feel.However, there is another layer of strategy on top of this land creation system. You can choose, at your disgression, to instead gain one additional mana or card draw for a turn, in the place of making a land(s). In addition, there are a number of wells on the map, that when a creature is beside it, will grant you one more mana. In essence, you need to balance between offensive, defensive, and utility based actions every turn, to be able to create the best strategy to win.In terms of buying card packs, the game is pretty much the same as Hearthstone. You get gold for winning matches, and doing daily quests, and upon obtaining 100, can buy a new card pack. Fairly typical stuff.It may not be the best game out there, but it's certainly worth a go if you like card games."

It does borrow from big names such as Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, but brings fun new mechanics and a living board which makes it feel fresh. It is also very generous with gold earnings and Pandora (Arena-like draft mode) rewards, allowing it never feel like a grind. I just play because its FUN.Early Access Score 9.5/10What's new and good?-This is the first CCG I've played in a long time that brings more than just a couple fresh elements. The ""board"" being the most obvious one. Puting down land tiles to create the board in which both players play on is unique (as far as i know) and incredibly fun. Faeria Wells are in each of the 4 corners of the board, and you can go collect the Faeria, which is essentially your mana used to pay for cards. Or you may want to pressure your opponent instead of farming resources, or meet somewhere in between. It adds a lot of strategy and decision-making to the game.-The art style is beautiful. Some card art in this game is worthy of being hung on a wall. The board and surroundings all play into the feel of the game, and the sounds and music are very calm and satifying at the same time.-This game has very minimal RNG outside of Pandora mode. Pandora is Faeria's version of Arena, and it is very random. However the normal play (Battle mode, ranked and unranked) is incredibly skill-based. With up to 3 copies of each card (aside from legendaries) stuffed in a 30 card deck, you can make a very narrow and on-task deck. The only real RNG is the card draw and opening hand. Aside from that, there are a few cards with random elements but very few and they aren't actually that good. Some people might like a HS level of randomness, and if so I guess this is a downside for you, but I really appreciate how tactical this game can be.-This level of affordablness is a pleasant surprise. You can purchase the entire collection for 50 bucks, while other ""f2p"" CCGs would cost hundreds dollars to collect all the cards. You get 10 gold for every single win in Battle mode, along with daily quests. I find myself sitting on 500 gold without even realizing I was saving up (packs cost 100 and pandora runs 250).ConsI really only have one complaint, and it is a personal preference, therefore I can't really say this is an objectively negative aspect. Pandora mode feels messy. Every 10th card you draft, you get to pick a Pandora Card. They are incredibly powerful and game changing, which is fine and fair since everyone gets to pick 3 of them.Pandora games function similarly to Battle Mode games. You start the same, gather Faeria, fight for board control, etc. However each player has ""Pandora Shards"" shuffled into their decks. Once 5 shards are drawn, pandora opens, the Faeria wells are now empty and you gain a fixed amount of Faeria every turn. You also start drawing your pandora cards.I think this mode is so frustrating. I spent the game gathering Faeria, getting board control and an economic advantage, then all of that is gone. The wells shut down so your board position doesn't have an economic benefit anymore. Plus some of the pandora cards are strong enought that the underdog can mount a comeback. I have lost to pandora cards, and I have comeback and unrightfully won with pandora cards. Neither feels good.In the end, you don't have to play Pandora, and it isn't THAT unfun, I still do a run every now and then, but this did bum me out, as I typically love draft modes."

While Duelyst and now Shardbound feel a little more like tactics RPGs mixed with card games, Faeria feels like a CCG board game. Is that a good or bad thing? To each their own, really.But the game is excellent. It doesn't quite have Hearthstone's visceral fun but it's a deeper game (big surprise I know). And I say not quite, the game is still quite satisying just to play.Unlike almost all digital CCGs nowadays it had a couple things from MTG we lack - a nonlinear reasource system and an organic color/faction system. Faeria, the game's mana, is actually stockpiled rather than per turn. While you gain 3 each turn, it's not entirely linear as you can harvest more with your creatures from the four wells in the corner, creating a battle over reasources as well as the opponent's face.But perhaps more important is the color system. Hearthstone just has you pick a class, you get that class's cards. Duelyst and Shardbound essentially do too, but call them ""factions."" Solforge and Elder Scrolls Legends let you pick two of the game's factions/colors per deck as a hard limit. Hex & Eternal have a soft restriction on colors, but it's also just a simplified version of MTG lands. From what I've played, only Infinity Wars has an innovative faction system, and even that is still based around limiting what you can initially put in your deck.But Faeria is different, and its color system is integral to the way the game plays with its board. Each turn, you can create either two ""plain"" lands, or one of the 4 colored lands. Each card will have a requirement as to how many of a given color of land you need to have to play it, and creatures can only be played on lands of their color.So, you can put any number of colors in your deck, but the more you do, the more you need to juggle creating different lands to fill out the requirements - but you have control over that, rather than being subject to the whims of a draw.The F2P model is akin to Hearthstone (as is everything, really) but more generous - especially, I feel, with the amount of 'dust' I seem to get. But maybe that's just because I'm getting more packs, since for one you gain the equivelant of 10 gold per win, not per 3 wins. Plus, packs let you ""Reroll"" one of the highest rarity cards in the pack, which is pretty neat. Much harder to get screwed by a bad legend.Lastly, the game is *gorgeous*. It has a consistant mystical-fairytale (a little whimsical but not in a cartoony way) art style and a beutiful UI (it's been updated since the steam screenshots, not that those look bad)."
,Recommended,397060,30561380,Posted: 16 March,all,R79,"At first I was like ""cheap HS clone"", as I saw this game as a sponsored vid on kripparians YT Channel. I could not have been any damn wronger!To keep it short, this game combines chess, magic the gathering and really small parts of Hearthstone (controlled, free trading), while giving the game some completely new mechanics with the mana being kept in between turns and the ability to choose between building new lands, getting another mana and getting another card each turn.Trust me, the amount of decisions you're doing in this game is absolutely insane. Also, it feels like every move matters, especially with a control deck (played Control Warrior and Freeze mage in Hearthstone a lot, it's nothing compared to the most basic control deck in here).Aggro is not ridiculously OP and can be outplayed when done correctly.There is not that much luck in this game. The luck you got is purely ""calculated"", as in you can calculate the probabilities of what's probably going to happen and play with that in mind (which, by itself, is fine in a card game in my opinion). There are no ""complete random cards"" with a massive difference between ""playing this just lost me the game"" and ""playing this just won me the game"".There are some more things to be said about the amount of gold you get and stuff like that, but I didn't pay that much attention to that so check out other reviews if you're looking for that information.to conclude: if you like Games where you have to put a huge amount of thoughts into every decision you make, this is the one you've been looking for since you were too lazy to go that chess-club or too bored of Hearthstone or too poor to get those standard-cards for magic."

You can freely try any idea you came up with, and enjoy.What if you don't? Perhaps you just don't think the limited card collection worth that much?Or you just decide to get a wasteland insteadThen that's why I downgrade it.- Heavy in-game purchase. I'm not saying this is bad itself. But, you see, this is NOT a free game. Players pay the entry fee, which is not too low for a card game with limited cards. Then they just find in-game purchases as expensive as other free games.- Poor card balance. This is not bad itself, again. No one expect the legendary to be same with normal, just as no one compares Avacyn to some 2/4 bird. But along with the first point, this brings bad experience. After the entry fee, some purchase and some grinding, you find that you are equiped with poor cards that are neither strong nor interesting.- Poor crafting. It looks nice at first that a lengendary costs only 320 mysteria, until you find that a normal card is disintegrated into only 1 mysteria. So this is exactly the ratio for HS. But none of the exsistant legendary is as powerful as in HS.- Unstable environment. Here comes the final strike. Let's assume you, a persistent player, finally make your favorite legendary and ready for a match. Then next morning you find a new fix, and your card is nerfed to ash. While HS allows you to get full amount of dust in this case, what do you get here? Nothing except one fourth of the cost as usual.- Not innovative abilities. Except some abilities to put lands, most abilities are just the simplified version of HS ones.You can expect this game to evolve better later, but for now it is not superior to most of its counterparts."

By that I mean it's fun, and incredibly deep. This is why, kind of reluctantly, I recommend it. Board control mechanics in combination with card mechanics make for awesome play-making potential. If you plan ahead and outsmart your opponent, you could suddenly flip things on them just when it looks like you're about to lose, and defeat them all in one turn. It is so much fun to plan out your strategies and perfect them. The game is incredibly well thought out and it shows. There simply is not another strategy card game out there with better gameplay or as much strategic freedom.BUT, there's a big problem. You used to be able to purchase every card in the game, the core set, for $50. They removed this option in favor of just purchasing card packs. The removal itself I have no problem with. This is a little game with big aspirations. They need money to get there, and a flat rate just wasn't cutting it. I can understand that. Also, it is perfectly possible to earn and craft tons of cards without spending any money. But here's the problem. Anyone who already bought all the cards, still has them all, and anyone who didn't buy them will really struggle to get all of them. That's pretty unfair.I don't want to say that this necessarily ""disadvantages"" new players, but it definitely severely limits their strategic opportunity compared to older players. At least at first. It does depend on what strategies you want to play. For some, you don't need any rare cards. Personally, I haven't spent any money on this game, except for when I bought it (it wasn't always free to play). When you start, you're given 24 packs of 5 cards each, and you'll earn more as you play. I have almost all of the cards I want, and at the time of writing this I've spent 59 hours ingame. Some of it was idle. I do think I'll be able to get them, but I doubt I'll be capable of getting ALL the cards. So, realistically, the disadvantage isn't huge. I'll be able to play the strategies I want, but I won't have the freedom to try them all. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's definitely unfair and it will bother some people a lot.So, if you're willing to put in some time to learn the game and earn some cards, you'll be able to play on equal footing with core set players, and you'll have a lot of fun. But you probably won't be able to get all the cards, and it really is unfair. I am recommending Faeria for its excellent gameplay, but really you need to decide for yourself if you think it's worth it or not."

The game has a lot of strategic depth as it not only matters what cards you play but also their position on the board, for example a big bad monster that is on the wrong side of the board is no threat to your opponent while a smaller well placed one is. The gameplay is driven forward by strategic resources, that can be harvested to increase your abilities to play cards, which creates incentives to move out on the board.The game is already a lot of fun and with the planned additions and future expansions it will only get better.

,Recommended,397060,30492450,Posted: 13 March,all,Ajido,"Pros-Pretty fair game for free to play players, developers are very generous with the amount of chests and gold given from doing solo missions on a new account.-Has more strategy and less RNG compared to other popular card games.-Has decent customization options to tailor the board to your liking. Can change the avatar, the orb it sits in, your mana wells and card backs.Cons-Deck building UI needs a major overhaul. Limited search and filter options, lacks sorting options, needs ability to insert cards past deck limit and trim down later on.-Not the biggest fan of Pandora mode in the Arena, would prefer if there were a regular Arena and Pandora arena.-While the game is pretty generous with its rewards, they're mostly tied into the solo game system, which can begin to feel dull and boring rather quickly. After a certain point, you just want a human opponent to enjoy the game with. This tutorial/solo play can take around 10 hours to fully clear if you buy all the extra solo mission packs. I would like to see this shortened and some of the rewards pushed into multiplayer quests."

Feels like a mashup of Hearthstone and MTG, but very approachable. Does not feel grindy.This game is a ton of fun. It has a lot of charm and really great ideas. You are basically playing Hearthstone, but on a board. It kinda has a MTG feel with the different land types, but much more approachable than MTG. I really love the solo mode with quests. These quests are like ""Win this turn"". The board is setup and you have to figure out how to kill the player in one turn. Very fun! I play lots of Pandora which is like Hearthstone Arena, but with a twist.I am not sure why people say this is Pay to Win because it is like any other CCG/TCG. You have to buy packs to get cards. I am able to get free packs easily playing solo or Pandora and I don't feel like it is very grindy. It is about as grindy as Hearthstone or any other digital CCG...However, in this game there is alot more going on then getting good cards. You have to think about placement of creatures, building land in the correct spots, blocking your opponent, building the right lands (as you may have a multicolored deck), and then you have the cards. Don't get me wrong, having good cards does make it easier to win, but buying packs helps the devs...Hearthstone is becoming less and less fun everytime I play it. I am tired of the crazy RNG and I need a bit more complexity than getting a good hand or randomly summoning a clutch minion. If you like Hearthstone, but you need a little more, then get this ASAP."

Relatively simple base mechanics end up with very complicated and deep gameplay. Deckbuilding is not my thing, but new decks pop up very frequently, and the meta changes as better and better decks are found constantly. Card balance is very good, with almost every card being playable or close to playable, a sharp contrast to most CCGs. The developers listen to community feedback and balance quickly. The streamers and community as a whole (on discord rather than reddit) are really high-quality as well."

Structures, creatures, spells and enchantments all combine to create an incredibly enjoyable and replayable experience that involves players fighting over Faeria pools and eventually destroying the enemy's ""Orb"" on the opposite side of the field.ReviewFrom the beautiful and consistent aesthetic to the mysterious, interesting lore and amazing soundtrack to the addictive and well-paced gameplay to the entirely reasonable price ofcompletely freeI really can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoyed Hearthstone but wish there wasn't such a heavy RNG focus and the gameplay was more complex; If you enjoy CCGs and tactics games at all or if you're just looking for a breath of fresh air in a world of over-used gameplay concepts, you'll love Faeria.The developers lovingly care about their product and have an amazing understanding of when to trade-off personal vision for community input, something that is at least in my own experience, incredibly rare for what seems to be a fairly new studio. There is some serious talent and passion at Abrakam, and it definitely shows in their product.I want to write more, but I think my review is glowing as bright as the sun right about now and I'm worried I'll burn your eyes out; so I'll just say two words:PLAY FAERIA"

76561198300282092,Recommended,397060,30417532,Posted: 9 March,all,Thriller,"First thing you notice about this game, is the gorgeous art. The game is just so eye candy. And it has really a nice immersive atmosphere to it. Compared to other CCGs the economy is rather generous, and you get the feeling that your collection is growing all of the time.  In terms of game-play itself, the game is really deep while still very easy to get into. The cards are not that hard to understand, but because players build the board as they play, there are A LOT of options of how to play each turn. So while I am only an average player, I imagine the skill cap of the game is very high.  Another nice thing about it is that they have done away with the mana curve that other CCGs use. Instead you get 3 mana each turn and more that you can collect from wells... and.. you get to keep what you don't use! This makes it that even you don't have a small card in your oppening hand, it's not that big of a deal. This makes the game less of coinflip of who draws better and more of a skill game.So bottom line, if you are looking for a new CCG to try I think you have to give this one a go. I think it really stands out as unique in a market flooded with copy-cut immitaions."

You don't just throw your cards on the table. It's all about thinking where to throw your cards, when to throw them and how to use the terrain to your advantage;- The resource system makes deck building more interesting than other games;- Skill matters more than luck. Sure, luck is also a ''valuable resource'', but not like Hearthstone where, let's face it, luck plays a WAY too important role;- Lovely interface;- Fast loading times. Hell, VERY fast loading times.CON:- The business model. They basically force you to pay 50 euros, otherwise, good luck pal in doing anything in this game. Seriosuly, I'm trying really hard to stick to my 8 euros spent. But I'm starting to think that if I want to advance I might just have to open my wallet once more. I feel like smashing the keyboard against the wall every time I start a new battle, hoping to be able to do my quest, and there goes another player who bought the whole set and just destroys me.So all in all, do I recommend Faeria? Yes, if you are willing to buy a 60 euro-priced card game. If not stay away (hell in this day and age I wouldn't recommend Hearthstone for an absolute beginner).I'm not really sure if this game will have a long life or will just fade back into the nothingness, but it might be possible to survive. Probably a lot of frustrated Hearthstone players will give it a try. But I wish they'd made a mode for people who didn't pay the whole 50 euros. Even the playing field a bit. I really want to play this game, but I'm not into losing match after match till I, somehow, manage to gather a handful of decent cards. Hopefully the developers will do something about this (cause by the time this game launches in September, those of us who paid for access will feel even more stupid)."

Having the events play out on a board which you build as you play definitely makes it feel more ""tactile"" than, say, MTG or Hearthstone. It's still in development and it changes quite often, but each change generally make the game better (IMO) and I'm confident it'll continue to be excellent when it's done. I think I'm still not good enough to be a good judge of the balance, but I'm sure the designers are paying close attention to their analytics and ensuring that no one approach is universally the best. The price is very reasonable, although if you wait it will become free. IMO, slowly building up your collection through your own efforts is part of the fun, so I'd advocate going for the $8 package. Even with just the ""codex"" cards that you start with, you can make a perfectly good deck - the reason you'll lose a lot to begin with is because other players are more experienced and understand the game better.

The offer to buy the complete playset should be listed on the store page and not just the 20USD cover charge to get in. It's just a cash grab that takes away from a solid product.

The game itself has a limited format of play consisting of 9 campaign missions (30 minutes of content) and ranked or unranked pvp. I'm not taking into account 'early access' as a label into my reviews anymore. If there is a cash shop and it's taking someones money it's ready to be reviewed as it stands.Grinding out gold to purchase boosters is slow. I would say it's near the level of hearthstone. You get 10 gold per win in unranked and Zero for a loss (get used to that if you didn't buy the playset). There is one daily quest that should get you a pack a day. You get boosters for leveling up and at the start you are made to think that the gold flows fast with 250 gold rewards and packs every level. That changes fast. And it works to make that 50USD Buy Me Now button extra shiney.You have a decent product with your game Dev Team. Drop the 20 dollar steam buyin and put your $50 playset purchase up and market as a up front here you go and enjoy type of game. People would buy it and feel good about it. Gamers are desperate to find a publisher who isn't constantly in our pocket and your model is close to what I had in mind for a ccg. You lost the extra $30 I would of paid to get the playset up front and I'm sure there are others who are going to feel the same way. Release a playset and a new mechanic for $50 every 4-6 months and I think you would have a winner without the $20 entry fee. Some unique terrain type cards with modifiers drawn from the deck would be an easy example. Who woouldn't want a volcano to start spitting out random gobs of magma on thier face? And the cards to destroy land of course.The point is that you have a solid product, don't @#$% it up with sh** marketing. Make the game better by dropping that $20 cover charge."

While it is understandable why things are as they are, it does not make it less frustrating. At the same time Hearthstone is all about randomness. Being a good player doesn't let you win against a worse player, it just gives a small edge in.Faeria on the other hand is all about strategy. While maintaining 'Easy to learn, hard to master' mentality and intuitiviness of Herthstone, it also emphasizes strategy. From the first turn of the game you have to plan your strategy and adjust according to what your opponent does. There is randomness in this game like in any cardgame, but it is much more limited and not as gamechanging as in other games.P.S. The game is awesome!

Needs more unique abilities which I am sure will be added over time. As is almost always true with this genre this game could use a much deeper story to go along with the cards and some sort of reason that the players are playing. I've yet to see one development team take the time to actually bring on a dedicated writer.And is it really so much to ask for just one card game to add in some sort of trading cards between players and a halfway decent in game chat window?Basically what this game is missing no game in the genre has so we're looking at the ... fastest kid at fat camp. I want to be absolutely clear... I've tried about 7 recent card games and this is much better than the competition. But look at the competition and you'll realize thats not exactly as glowing as it sounds.Oh and plan to spend a bit longer in each game compared with most cardgames due to less RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t both players will have a tendency to actually be able to do something rather than taking turns steamrolling eachother.

,Not Recommended,397060,29540793,Posted: 28 January,all,keik,"29/03/2017 - UPDATE after game goin live down at the bottom!At first glance, Faeria looks like a fresh offspring ofOri and the Blind ForestandDuelyst/Heartstonegames. Mystical aura, runes, nature like feel, beautiful music and enchanting sounds.Falling under tactical card game genre, it surely feel fresh while hailing it's core inspiration which isMagic The GatheringCCG series. Unfortunetaly, it also brings major flows and annoyances from it.While the fact that you build with your opponent board and it directly correspond with your mana colors is fantastic and let you feel like a god deffending his altar, is at the same time huge movement limitation. Most units move single hex per turn while some dash even 4! Other units glide over map and don't even need tiles/hexes to land on, other jump and all of that on a distance of 5 tiles between altars. And as you may imagine, some decks are very fast and before you can act your 20hp pool is cut to 20-50% - I'll expain it in detail later.Decks are made of 5 colors (red - mountains, blue - lakes, yellow/white - sand, green - forest, gray - ""neutral"") and limited to 30 cards. Not sure if there is copy limitation but quite frankly, having 3 copies of a card take 10% of your deck space so it's rarely usefull to have more then that I guess.What's good is that you get fair amount of free cards simply by playing story mode, which is also the tutorial so you are rewarded fairly for the first hour or so of the gameplay. I really love that in case of small player pool even if you play ranked you'd play with casual player whose deck is at the same skill level as yours. It may sound unfair but so far all the cross-matches were well balanced and not in favor of ranked player.There are mentioned causal and ladder modes, tournaments in which you submit 3 decks and compete with other players and swiss where you get random pool of cards to compete against other deckbuilders.There's huge amount of cosmetics like skins for cards, shrines, avatars and so on but unfortunetaly, there's also clear line that if you wish to compete at higher level you'd need to actually spend some cash. And I complain about it because players who are willing to pay, will pound you. Competed with few people who did have had everything from avatar to shining versions of each card and never ever stood close to them. So the experience may be close to Heartstone.Major annoyances so far are: aggro goblin red decks with triggered damage bursts (MtG), rush sand decks (Duelyst), taunt with growth & fast expansion green decks (MtG), control and trigger damage/bomb/finisher blue decks (MtG) - and that's is huge flaw.Combining it all you either play against slow green deck with red gobblins damaging you each round for any combat, get 3-5 rounds to get to altar of enemy blue player who at certain point will either rot or bomb you from 20 to nearly 0 or get rushed by flying sand spirits which deal amplified damage to your altar/god.And it's annoying as hell! The fact that you are sluggishly moving 1 hex, mostly get taunt so you need to waste turn to attack just to be taunted by another cheap creep who also deal damage to you each times it's in combat... it's frigging annoying. So many decks are resolving about that to the point it actually feels like player is punished and only waits for the opponent to get all 4 mana shrines and torment their enemy. And I know it by doing so.You either smash or get smashed.Game lacks at the moment good comebacks like those in Heartstone or Duelyst (or Miracles in MtG).Limited card pool rewards some decks which have cards with ""draw random [color] card"" - sometimes I've drawn cards outside my unlocked card pool and sometimes I've drawn utterly unusable cards. It's good to have some control with limited luck over totally unpredictable heaven or hell draws, which leads me to conclusion.Despite being nice, gorgeus looking game it have major mechanic flows.I was a bit ashamed that at one point felt like this game could win my heart over Duelyst, which I've played outside steam for hundreds of hours, but it looks like at some point game devs felt a bit lost with Faeria and rushed a their ""beta"" (hard to call game a beta with fully working in game monetization) to start earning their money. And it all would be justified but with major flaws in core gameplay, cards and decks being so unbalanced you'd need to probably rethink it all and the store working just aggravates me. You can be fair like Duelyst devs - game is past beta but still young, there are monthly events, changes, fixes, rebalancing, and so on - I'm not here to bash one game and compare it to personal favorite but Faeria can't be good game.What I like about this tittle:+ general feel+ some cards have nice, fresh style compared to dead serious realism most games force+ audio+ boardbuildingWhat made me hate this tittle:- beta with fully working shop (don't call it beta)- some decks can freeze your already limited movement while blowing serious damage- altars are too close letting you rush easly- ""normal"" faction looks like scrap-ideas put together- balance is so off at the moment I doubt they'll sort it out properly- game copies Magic The Gathering in worst aspects- too much taunt, some games are cannon fodder/trench wars- either very slow or ridiculous fast often with one player dominating and no chances of a comebackOverall score:1.5/5 - great promises but without fulfillments-------------------------------UPDATE:Game slightly changed, got annoying tutorial now.Most changes are in UI and pricing, which went up.Imo, still P2W with paid advantage being gigantic especially in lower ranks.Still can't recommend this tittle to anyone, unless you are one of those ""little time, big money"" people who want to stomp other players few times a week, with your paid deck. And matches are really slow, halfway I started another game to pass time."

Throughout all of my playing I've discovered a number of things regarding gameplay mechanics, game allure, replayability, and overall design.I can't pin it down but I just DONT want to play the game. I paid money for it, I enjoy the mechanics and the gameplay allows for strategies to be developed over time. The atmosphere is different and interesting. The cards have a unique style to them, the music is fairly good, and this allows for a stylized theme.On paper this game is GREAT. Some minor bugs, balancing problems, and spaghetti code but overall for Early Access this game is a gem.BUT I DONT WANT TO PLAY IT.I believe it has something to do with allure. The FEEL of the game. As much as Hearthstone has bugs, crazy RNG problems, and clear issues with Ranked mode as of today it still has me charmed. There's a feel to the character profiles, the sound of the minions, and atmosphere of the tavern that makes me enjoy opening the game.I enjoyed Magic: The Gathering for years. The art, and style of the cards had my imagination bursting with excitement every time I played a card.I enjoyed Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG for some time for the exact same reasons. The foil cards had me coming back for more.Faeria doesn't give me that feel. That energy that makes my imagination come to life and burst with excitement.

A booster pack costs 100 gold. So ever 10 wins you can buy a booster pack with new cards. There's also 2 daily challenges every day which earn you even more gold. You can scrap cards of which you have too many to gain a resource which you can then use to craft cards.

They've slapped in things like ""Charge 1, Charge 2, Charge 3"" in there along with things like Haste, Jump, Death Touch, Flying, list goes on and on. While you get used to it, sort of, it's just overwhelming and not only makes balancing a deck really annoying, but makes it so hard for new players to get engaged in to the game. I'm level 9 at the moment at around 10 hours at the time of writing this, and I still have no idea what ""Events"" are because there was nothing about them in the tutorial and there's no obvious indication to what they are. I'll have to look it up on the wiki. It looks like it's referring to a SPELL, but if that's the case, why are they called ""Events""?

However, card collection size is still relatively small so if you are looking for a full complete package you may want to wait for launch; $25 early access is a little steep.The board mechanics and faeria resource management adds a really nice complex feel to the game. They did a really good job making it easy to understand but hard to master. I'm only lvl 10 right now but I feel that the progression is much faster than hearthstone in accordance to building your collection. They are going to be implementing Pandora mode (Hearthstone Arena) in a month or two which will help those skilled players gain extra coins to get their hands on some more cards.Honestly the biggest gripe with the game right now is just the lack of cards. With that being said, that's a really good thing. It's an early access game and if the biggest problem is lack of content, you know you are doing something right. One small gripe is the crafting prices. On one hand packs are cheaper and easier to come by, but on the other hand crafting is pretty steep and will take awhile to be able to craft that one legendary card you need to round your deck out.Out of all the other card games I say this one is a diamond in the rough. It requires a lot of thinking in terms of building your lands to block them from attacking you directly, trying to balance greed (collecting faeria) with aggression and mix and matching different elements in the same deck to optimize value."

If you want to try the game out, either wait until it's free to play after the early access period or buy it at the lowest amount which i think is about $6 on sale.I paid about $12 for the base game and what seemed like a decent amount of booster packs. But here's the thing. The game gifts you a large set of base cards for completing some basic tutorials and quests against the AI. Once you start opening your booster packs, you find that the SAME EXACT CARDS show up in those packs. That shows right there the devs see their gamers as a a bunch of idiots who are just happy to be opening packs.So after opening about 40 packs, I can sum up what I got in a single word. Nothing. Like, I got a few random legendaries and some scattered rares & epics, but none of it contributes to making an even remotely competitive deck against those who have the whole set. Not to mention, the amount of crafting material I have is enough for maybe one addtional epic and a rare of my choice. In short, booster packs are a terrible value because so much of what you get is duplicated by the base set, and you get almost nothing to craft with after disenchanting extras. It would probably take $500 in booster packs to earn the full set, so you might as well spend the $50 off the bat.tldr; Great game, terrible value unless you're committed to spending $50 on purchasing the whole set of cards."

It combines hte best of both worlds.  Want a resource system that is deeper than hearthstone, this has it,  Another example is it can like chess with cards, except the cards have a attack and health value.  The game shows a lot of promise for EA.Wish their was a co-op player for environement game mode in the game and also wish there was team versus team game mode.  It helps that the music is very atomspehereic and well done.This is one of those games where seeing it in action on a lets play or review of its gameplay is better in video format.  Though to summerize what I do and don't lihe...Positives-Resource system and battling area lets player be creative with their play styles.  Really promotes back and forth gameplay of coming back to win.-No resource system like Magic the gather and HEx shards of fate that would cause the player have a shortage / flood of resources based upon pure luck.  Win base of manuavering and out-thinking the enemy more of the time!-Music / Sound is very well done-Can buy the entire first set for $50Negatives.. AS a Early Access game, again as a Early Access game.-Deck is limited to 30 cards, would like to see it doubled to 60.-Maps need to be bigger, which will allow for bigger decks-Bigger maps mean more players can play at once."

They say their matchmaking filters you from the players that buy the collection;  it does a poor job. I had deleted my prior review as it was trolled hardcore, so I will make this succinct.I decided to come back and try out pandora. 3 games in a row I had one of the random cards come up, deal 3 dmg to everything and wreck me. Damn. Sorry I was rng fuq'd. I also felt like I was fighting constructed decks at times, they were just.. nuts. Thanks for compounding the issue. Pandora is a joke. For real. Please be smart and don't put money into this game. It's not a bad game, but it's not a good one either. I bought in early too. :(Also: They sorta disparage steam and the steam forums.. even though this is the platform they are on. They always tell you to go to discord.. and.. uh.. no? I bought my game ON STEAM. And, personally, I do not like discord. I generally dislike anything outside of the steam forums unless it is a closed alpha/beta. Or if I bought it on another platform (derp). It's nonsensical."

,Recommended,397060,23185822,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,Salugi,"Excellent game. Similar to hearthstone, but much deeper strategy both in the short term and long term. Usually, the more skilled player will win the game, which makes winning feel more rewarding and losing feel less frustrating and as if there is something you can learn from each game.Personally I've played Hearthstone for 18 months, throwing around £500 into it in order to play at a competitive level. Since discovering Faeria, every time I go back to try and play Hearthstone, I am thoroughly bored and just wish I was playing Faeria.I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategical card games."

This is an updated review on what I think about Faeria over the months that I have played it.Faeria is truly unique as far as strategy card game goes.  With a living board, it plays like a game of Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters (minus the RNG from the dice rolls) and Magic - The Gathering.  In essence, the player can create lands on the board and summon creatures onto it - with the goal of reducing your opponent's health to zero.There are many ways to win a match in Faeria.  The most practical is to move your creatures next to your opponent's orb and hit it until it explodes.  The next method - a favorite of mine - is to slowly chip away at your opponent's orb through the use of spells and monster effects.  Or, you could hunker down and brace for a war of attrition by protecting yourself with strong 'taunt monsters' and structures (currently, this method doesn't work because there is no single card that wins you the game).As far as card collecting goes, Faeria is very generious toward free-to-play players.  Every win is rewarded with gold (might be a bad design because it encourages fast game; however, rush decks were nerfed recently).  For the casual player, just logging in and doing the daily quest will only take about 30 mins to an hour depending on which quest target it is.  Just the login and daily rewards alone will give any player enough gold to purchase a pack every 1-2 days.  One thing to note is that there are 5 cards per pack with the option to reroll the highest rarity card.  In addition, leveling up through playing the game will also reward the players with rare, epic, and legendary cards.  Currently, the best way to level up is to play the solo missions.Faeria has come a long way since its early beta stage, and I'm glad to be a part of it.  It's one of those hidden gems that leaves you breathless the first time you see it.  With beautiful artworks and music, this game is gorgeous.With how smooth everything has been going, we can expect Faeria's first expansion later this year (fingers crossed)!I'll highly recommend this to any fan of strategy card game!  If you like playing Go (Chinese chess), Settlers of Catan, MTG, and/or Hearthstone - this is definitely the game for you.  It's free to play.  Give it a try and see if you like it or not."
