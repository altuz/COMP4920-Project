,Not Recommended,397150,26062944,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,[TBAG] Link,"I'm going to write a review that isn't from a backer of the kick starter.for the record I enjoy the game (what little there is) by review is based on the current lack of things to do after a period of 2 hours UNLESS YOU HAVE MATES THAT HAVE THE GAMEi will start by explaining that this game has been in development for a couple of years now and i read from kick starters that the updates come in nicely. i did some research on this to find that it was launched March of 2014.the next update which was a pre-alpha construction prototype, released on 1st September 2014. while those times seem OK , the following updates where 3 hot fixes.Pre Alpha came out 7th Jan 2015and Alpha was releases on 27th May 2015.Patch 0.8.3.2Alpha 2 multiplayer patch was released on 09th November 2015.Patch 0.8.4.0Alpha Blocky Blockade was released on 8th June 2016.these last two updates where added to the wiki  on 17 October 2016, at 19:13. AFTER i wrote this review.this brings us to October 11th 2016 the release on Steam.so my point is ... where is the next update? not even the devs know.today came a bug fix. not content. still cant recommendSo about the story. Its interesting, very very high potential. only on 1 planet which is OK i understand time is needed to get other areas right before release. but what no one mentioned was the story lasts an accomplished fps player up to 2 hours to finish the CURRENT story AND do the observation towers so we can TP to the next planet.. i might add a planet that has NOTHING ON IT ! so after 2 - 3 hours you are left to just explore and fight robots which gets boring very very quick. you can explore the other planet but due to it not being optimised, it runs really bad.I'm not a hater of early access, its helps indie teams realise the dreams. I'm all for helping by buying a title in good faith. but when we can see a period of over 12 months with NO UPDATE. that's when I start to ask questions.If you have buddies that have this game then great you can play creative together and have some fun building and shooting etc etc but that's it, in the current state of the game , with the lack of updates I cant honestly say to people BUY THIS TITLE ITS GREAT ! I'm having to say, buy this title its going to be great at some point in time.that doesn't fill others heads with confidence on the team or the title.take the case of Osiris:New Dawn. they where 2 men (they have since expanded) but with just 2 guys, they managed to release updates pretty much every other day, with content, bug fixes all of that good stuff. they are also transparent about what they are working, what we can expect in the next update also a rough time of arrival for said update.none of that here.no steam announcements, no nice welcome thanks for supporting our title.none of that either.... so make of it what you will. this is my reviewmaybe catch you on a planet other than Merx. or maybe not. we shall seeedit. this review will get ammended as and when new content arises. i will keep you posted. basically its not because i don't like game as to why i cant recommend it, its just the amount of stuff to do. so hold fire. watch this review"
,Not Recommended,397150,32586045,Posted: 20 June,all,Unhappyslave,"For the past 24 hours, i've made/played with everything this game has to offer. Now, theirs no such thing as 'lack of content' when you're a builder. I am not going to speak on the items/content because I believe that since you're buying an early access game that shouldn't be an issue since it's what you'd expect from a game that isn't fully developed.PROS: Decent controls,- good physics, (if you have them turned on),-comfortable user interface,- zelda-ish type of music/graphics,- gorgeous lighting,- questline, (though brief, fun),- connective/genius dungeon layout and so on.CONS: (For reference. I have an Nvidea GTX 1060 4G with a core i6400 450G SSD and 16 of physical RAM)-Rendering issues,-Exteme framerate drop even when on lowest settings for everything,-Buggy doors,-Buggy vehicles, (they don't despawn when you destroy them, leaving 10,000 'hoverbike' blips on your map.)-Railmotors are extremely bugged. Expecting them to hopefully get fixed next patch (Roadmap says it's supposed to update mid-2017.)-Unexpected crashes,-Losing inventory (backpack) when you die because it doesn't respawn with you.-Having backpack blip stuck on map because you died but yet your inventory didn't go away.and so on...TL'DR: Overall, Stellar Overload is a great building game with interesting planets to explore and a short (for now) but interesting questline with just purely amazing dungeons, but as of right now even though it being early access as mentioned I can not recommend due to the sheer severity of the current bugs and hair-pulled frustration of trying to fly a vehicle without it glitching out leaving you either stranded on a planet or soaring above the land with 10 FPS. Give it until next update to give it a try and im sure you'll love it.Also if you're a builder at heart and you loved being inspired and creative then this  is a game you will definitely love.Thanks for reading!"
,Recommended,397150,31149679,Posted: 14 April,all,Bitchmunk,"This review will change if my experience changes after the first two hours.Stellar Overdrive has a ton of competition. Empyrion, Space Engineers, Starbound, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, Rodina, even No Man's Sky- Each of them accomplishes its own goals in its own way. Empyrion has survival and crafting, with plenty of aliens. Space Engineers is all about physics and ship building, putting things together in space. Starbound and NMS have their infinite lineup of procedurally generated world's. Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous focus on the realism of quotidien life as a spacefarer. Rodina is a lonely experience, exploring four unique but barren planets, learning about a storyBut not one of these has yet given me the range of emotions an hour's play of this game has. The basic gist: Minecraft on cube-shaped planets, with more to craft, people to talk to, storylines, real vehicles, and the voxel variability that Minecraft is missing. But more than that, this game explores something Minecraft never did but the games in my aforementioned list do: Gravity. Each side of the cubic planets has a different time of day. And gravity reorients as you move. Want to dig to China? Go for it. See how the game handles it when you get closer to the core, and then when you go beyond. Want to fly through space to a forest planet, a desert planet with deep canyons, an ocean planet with little islands and trenches that go almost to the core? How about a moon? How about a lava planet? Build a ship...and go there. Each planet has a different ecosystem with different dangers, monsters, fauna, and enemies. It's a closed system, not open or infinite. But the groundwork is there for the story to expand, the variety to multiply, and the game to evolve.I know this review isn't very detailed. I'll be updating it after the game leaves Early Access. For now, let me close with this:If you are a fan of Minecraft but wish the world were a bit more sci-fi; if you're a fan of Elite: Dangerous but wish it were more colorful; if you're a fan of No Man's Sky but were turned off by the lackluster release; if you're a fan of Starbound but want a similar experience in 3D; if you're a fan of Space Engineers but want more survival; a fan of Empyrion but want a more thoughtful art design; or a fan of Rodina but want a game that's more polished with more variety......you know what to do. ;)"

That is whats going to make this game great and surpass many of even the bigger titles!I would buy this game to support such amazing devs!"

Because:- it's too short, 5 quest chains, you only start enjoying it - BAM, there is nothing to do anymore;- crafting is here purely for nothing, you get everything as ready-made items, there are basically 2-3 moments when you need something to craft, the rest is GIVEN (very wrong decision imho) after completing quest or just by looting;- gathering again is for nothing, you get resources as loot, I enjoy exploring the caves for the first time, but then I only have to craft once at the end and it was 30 iron blocks for space-ship ... 30 iron blocks ....................- exploring, only fun for ONE ""side"" of the cube, then it's all the same, pointless and barely interesting.- building, for nothing, no idea why someone decide to make electricity while game lack and doesn't required even concept of ""base"" (home), you do not need to build anything, all craft machines are there..- balance: combat is primitive, fighting the hardest mobs (bosses) is designed for 5-years old girl, you basically CAN NOT die, and then BAM, dungeon with lazers.. and passing lazers is totally strange skill which you have to master suddenly or you just die.. overall game is too easy, AI is too stupid and such..- too much hover-biking, go to teleport on the other side of cube, then back, again to teleport, again back, AGAIN to teleport, then back, then you get space-ship and game ends here (no quests, no guide-lines what to do, no need to do anything)..- I don't like the direction of game development, it's not crafting/building/surviving game, feels more like platformer of some kind (due to lazers, dungeon elements and poor dificulty of game).- there is no experience or skills, only locked craft until recipe and craft station is found.. there are too few items to actually use as items (2 armors, 4 weapons, 3 tools, food and healing), which lead to very repeated gameplay, too few enemies ~10;- the concept of square worlds is weird, crossing edges is ugly, gravitation in the middle is tricky..Game has potential no doubts, it's already polished and of very high quality overall.

76561198179974283,Recommended,397150,26054006,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,fredex,"Stellar Overload: AKA Gravity is Trying to Murder My Brain.My first impression of Stellar Overload was that it looked very good, had a great take on the block-based style and would surely be a lot of fun. After more than half an hour of talking and fetch quests though I was beginning to tire and really wanted to just dive into survival a la Minecraft. So far in my misguided quest to save the village I had managed to fill in large amounts of the well with dirt when I got frustrated trying to climb out of it, destroyed all the farms (and much of the surrounding area) whilst trying to harvest carrots and finally ripped down half the wall of a quest giver’s house by tunnelling straight through the berry bush I was harvesting and into their front porch. Compare this mass destruction to the tree punching start I was expecting and it was quite a culture shock.I don’t know if the grabber has the ability to specify the type of block you are trying to break rather than it’s default WMD setting... but if it does I haven’t found it.So for the sake of my sanity (and for the good of the villagers) I quit out to look for a survival mode without a story but only found Creative, where I was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer number of block types and items in my inventory and realised I’d likely have to play through the story to understand half of them. At the moment it appears there is no Survival mode and this is sorely lacking since repeating the story over and over is unlikely to be all that enjoyable.I jumped back into the story and was almost immediately given a jet pack after one quick chat and then I found a hover bike cunningly concealed behind a semi-transparent bush. So much for the usual grinding and saving of resources to build something cool. Apparently I would ‘require’ the jetpack for cave exploration which as explanations go is kind of on a par with ‘I require this armour-piercing-high-explosive ammunition for pest control’.Texas state law aside, it sounded like after completing the quest to find 20 Moonstone I’d probably get a rifle and armour too. Apparently I needed an upgrade... despite so far having only used my 200 rounds of pistol ammunition pot-shotting peacoc ks for their (assumedly) delicious meat that I have no way of cooking. In fact I had yet to encounter anything more scary than a squirrel who jumped out of a bush and startled me.It is quite a long way from those early Minecraft days of rationing your torches and being terrified to go outside in the dark because you have no health or food but need three bones from a skeleton in order to make fertilizer... in order not to starve... in order to continue on to actually make a sword rather than trying to fight with a spade.Needless to say I just wasn’t exactly feeling the sense of survival and achievement that similar games have offered...Nonetheless I persevered and after crashing the hover bike into one too many squirrels I found a nice big hole in the ground to jump into. Almost instantly I was overwhelmed by dozens of glowing crystals in various colours, none of which were the illusive Moonstone and still I found none by the time I’d reached the bottom of the cave.So out of frustration I decided to see what would happen if I attempted to tunnel directly through the centre of the Earth.For the first minute or so I wasn’t really aware that I was actually making any progress on my journey down as my screen was basically solely occupied by a single block which had constant particles coming out of it and then occasionally changed colour. Much like mining obsidian I thought it was simply taking ages to break the blocks. After all there was no way it could be so easy to go so deep, so fast at the start of the game right?It was only when I looked up into the black abyss that I had apparently created above me that it dawned on me that even blocks way down deep in the planet break instantly and how deep down I could go was basically just equal to how long I held the mouse button down for. It seemed that my suspicion was correct and that like some other games mining was just going to be unchallenging, boring and somewhat of an obligatory requirement tacked on to every block-based resource gathering game.Then I reached the middle of the planet and proceeded to spend the next half hour in a battle against the laws of physics.I assumed one of three things would happen when I dug straight down: A. I would die in lava, void, a rock monsters gastrointestinal tract etc. B. I’d hit bedrock and it wouldn’t let me reach the core. Or C. Gravity would get all screwy, it is after all a cubic planet.C is in fact correct however it is C to the power of ‘Ow my brain hurts’ screwy. I assumed (if I survived) then gravity would simply flip but I had failed to factor in the fact that I was not drilling through the centre of the quadrilateral planet and merely skirting through a layer of the cubic crust, nowhere near the magma and iron cube core.If there was an audio transcript of my experience it would be something like this:“Dig, dig, dig, down I go... what the... *incomprehensible screams*... WHERE IS GRAVITY? ...ok I’ll go this way then... *muffled*...what is happening? ...I’m scared. Help me.”Etc.I won’t spoil the fun of saying precisely what happened or how I got out of the middle of the planet as the first time you try it it’s like an escape the room puzzle... only where Newton’s first law of motion is plotting to murder you.However I will dictate the things that went through my head at the time:“I understand why they gave me a jetpack now.”“HOW? How do I have thirty seven thousand limestone blocks in my inventory.”“I hear birdsong. The surface! At last. I wonder what side of the planet I am on? Wait is that my hover bike?”...“I still have no Moonstone.”----------To give some slightly more helpful feedback and information however...Currently there isn’t a huge amount of content in the game past the first part of the story. Hence I spent a large amount of time finding ridiculous things to do in creative mode instead...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra9xaRtGjOQResources are so easy to find in huge quantities that there is scarcely a need to bother mining, farming or anything else. Most containers dotted around in the little hamlets, crashed ships, observation posts and the robot fortress contain stacks of hundreds of all the common elements and more medicine, food and ammo than you would need to survive against an entire armada of angry machines. Not that it matters because even if you die you don’t lose anything in your inventory and the only penalty is returning to your clone machine.If you do decide to mine then you can rack up thousands of coal and ore by just digging straight down for five minutes and jetpacking back out of the hole so you quickly end up with dozens of storage containers filled with stuff you have no use for other than building ten foot high carbon steel statues of yourself everywhere...I flew to most of the planets in creative mode and was impressed to find they actually exist even if at the moment they are basically just different biome templates with nothing much to do there. It would be great in the future if you could play on large multiplayer servers with people flying back and forth between planets in cobbled together spaceships. At the moment though the only way of getting a craft into space it seems is to build an extremely high pole that reaches space and launch the ship from the top since it wants to just hover ten foot off the ground otherwise. This works but the ship remains fixed to the gravity of the face of the planet you launched from so you are limited to two dimensional movement and can basically only reach planets in line with you.When the game is more complete and these issues are addressed I can see it being very addictive."

,Recommended,397150,33997758,Posted: 3 August,all,linuxpunk,"""Thumb halfways""Interesting game. More about mining and crafting than exploring (planers are kinda small). Kinda thrives to be what No Man's Space failed at.Having said that, I found the game half baked and not terribly fun to play. Shooting and FPS gameplay is kinda weak. The game looks gorgeous, and I have high hopes for this when finished, but it didn't hold my interest at it current state.The pacifist overtone of the story and the near to none options to customize your character were turn downs for me. Who wants pacifist, pseudo-oriental preaching when you want to play a shooter? And you can only choose between a blond male or blond (sexualized) female characters. Character customization in this game could learn a bunch from games like Starbound, imo.If crafting and mining is your thing, give this a go. If you are looking for exploration or action (FPS) gameplay, you might want to look elsewhere, or wait for launch.I appreciate Linux support"

,Recommended,397150,26020092,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,iDerp,"Okay, so I bought this game for my brother and I. $18 each or whatever, no big deal. Played solo co-op. We couldn't put it down until we reached the end of the alpha content (and even then, we went on to monkey around in Creative mode).Even if those 10 hours are all I ever get for my $18 (x2), they were WELL WORTH IT. This game is incredible. The graphics are very charming and pretty. I was correct in my impression that this is not really a mining/crafting game... that's all very much secondary.The game surprised me time and time again. Luscious graphics, wonderful shaders, well written story, amazing hand-crafted feeling to the building designs populated on your planets, and the sheer fun factor of cube-shaped worlds. Once we got the jetpack, my brother and I started playing around on the edge of the planet where the faces converge, and we ended up just having a blast with that for an hour or so (you haven't lived until you've base-jumped from one face of the planet to the other).We got kind of confused on only one mission where you have to find 20 moonstone. Those can be found 150 blocks DEEP, you don't need to actually mine to the center of the planet (although this is a recommendable experience in creative mode).I think if they keep pushing out story-mode content every few months and wrap up this game in a year and a half, I could be okay with that. It's not hard to see beyond the fun if you're paying attention and there's a lot of missing content here. Most importantly, they need to get planetary-travel space-ship building in the game. You can build hoverbikes, but that's about it for now. The game needs a lot of graphics settings options to be configurable that aren't currently, namely vsync checkbox, AA tweaking, FOV slider.This game makes you constantly want to test the sandbox universe with ""can I do that?"". Part of the fun for me was having the ultimate questions answered in Creative mode, so do play around with that!"

I must say I went in cautiously optimistic, with all the let downs there seems to be out there it is good to be reserved.This game is well put together and at almost every turn it is clear to see that the dev team is putting a lot of thought into its features and play ability. Considering that this game is still in early access I was thoroughly impressed. There is a ton of items and what seams to be a solid foundation for a robust crafting system. The quest line was interesting enough and showed off a lot of the features of the game. After sometime with the building system i began to get a real hold on the controls that were simple enough to use but powerful enough to make the most complex structures with retaliative ease. Absolute worth it, jump on now because once this game goes full release it will be 40-60 dollars.Pro's +-stunning graphics-natural controls/interface-building system is easy to use yet comprehensive-game mechanics are almost completely polished-good as a fps but also as a creative type.Con's --not all features are ready-some questing aspects could use tweaking-some balancing is required(but that is to be expected with early access)All in all i enjoyed my time with this game and look forward to more updates and future adventures.

Some gamebreaking bugs exist and some very annoying quality of life stuff.Uses 8GB of ram constantly(not a problem but found it interesting)If you die with no way to get back to your corpse and you have you beginning digging gauntlet on you can't regain the materials to make a new one. Get ready to restart (all the pots and boxes Iooted had no lv. 1 energy matierial)If you dig to the center of the planet you'll lose that inventory because you float into space if you manage to escape the center of the planets gravity.I've heard of performace problems with this game but I have yet to see any outside of when it saves(major fps loss).If the devs stay active check back in about two years and it'll probably be an amazing game.

However, I could only play for 40/50min stretches before requiring a break since I get mild motion sickness from the severly restricted field of view.Conceptually this game is fantastic.  The physics of the cuboidal worlds is genious. The environment is great to look at, the caves are fun (but too dark on my system), and the character models match well with the overall voxel scheme.So far 5/5 for just about everything, though I will eventually take a star off if the devs fail to add FOV and GAMMA sliders to the gfx settings.  Frankly, given the amount of time this game has been in development I am surprised these two extremely basic settings are missing.A little worrying that there seems to have been some stagnation over the past year - hopefully this isn't vaporware/conware like Cubeworld.  I found a let's play series on the yubtubs from around a year ago and the guy seems to be having so much more fun in his survival sandbox world than what I had in the current release.  Why did the devs fail to release the Steam version with a 'survival single player' mode?  It seems like it's been a possibility for a long time!Here's hoping the devs pick up the pace now that they've got the Steam release done. Hopefully there will be an open sandbox mode whereby you can fly off to other planets with friends to see interesting terrain, structures, settlements, allies and enemies.  Hope, hope, hope.  Assuming all that I just barely recommend this game, but only to the hard core and patient,  And only for the purposes of encouraging these guys to keep going strong with a game that has the potential to be absolutely massive."

The potential in this game is mind blowing. The story so far is good and a great showpiece for what the game can do, fan made levels could be awesome. The sandbox mode Is slightly limited right now but flying to other world's was fun. Even in its limited state it's much more fun than  minecraft building tools. The ability to lay large areas is awesome. Multi player locally on a lan was a blast and pvp would be icing  on the cake.  Fantastic and highly recommended."

Best thing about this help menu its not forced on you it's there if you need help.Crafting is a bit simple but its progressive and you unlock different items as you gain their recipes.There's a story line (not sure how long it is yet) that's there and it's pretty nice to have. As you follow it it explains how to do different things such as crafting your first gun and 'health potion'.I'm having to play on a lower graphic setting and i have a pretty decent rig so i'd like to see some performance increases but it is early access so we can hope for the best.Over all my only complaint is that i've got to play on a lower graphic setting. Overall i feel like this game might be really fun with friends (going to try and convince some of mine to get it) and enjoyable solo just following the story.

If it can be called that! It's more equivalant to digging to the core of the world trying to find the materials needed because there is no indication of where those materials may or may not exist, and then desperately trying to build/climb your way back up. It's extremely frustrating to fall down a hole in the game then desperately try to dig your way back up, you think these advanced characters who have mining gloves would at the VERY least have a different setting to auto-dig a ramp of some sort.It's got a lot of promise, but it looks like the devs haven't played through the game themselves to see what might annoy multiplayer groups.

In short,  Purchase this, invest in a long haul, because seeing it here after what looks like 2 years of development, means that they are FULLY interested in finishing the game.Pros:-The building is phenomenal and fast,-the graphics are well realized-the initial world is well realized-the gameplay itself is definely smooth-Weapons and Enemy AI, makes this feel like a borderland-ish kind of thing.-hunting! (more violent than I expected lol) <you guys messed up, I want cows, deer and an ability to make your own weapons lol)Cons:-NO real character creation (depressing)/ Fix by giving the lead a mask or helmet. I cannot identify with him.-planet edge transitions/ I get it, its a cube world, maybe if it wasnt so AWARE (for example, just a drastic time/lighting change instead of looking like the edge of a planet, but this is subjective. I just couldnt get used to it. so I didnt want to explore. maybe just call them guadrants.....-The world traversal.... I LOVE the look, but is there any way to smoothen the movements? Minecraft you had to jump up each elevation, butin this, though you dont have to, it still feels jerky, like walking up steps....the camera should not reflect that the world is blocky, it should feel organic.like the player belongs .each movement should feel smooth.-Ths game would benefit from a little atmospheric distance fog.I beleive if anyone should have a CON, it should be explained what might make it better for other people. That is not to say that this game would suck if they didnt tackle it. Its awesome as it is thus far, and if Im wrong about my cons, maybe give me some peace of mind.I neglect to play main story modes in early access games because I always have to start over in every update. but I will be visiting this game frequently.I love this game.  7.8/10"

,Recommended,397150,29276674,Posted: 15 January,all,Polraudio™⚔,"This game was a very fun game for what has been done so far. Ill just list the pros and cons to make things simple.Pro:-Story was good and i felt like i was actually a part of the story. I cant wait to see what comes next.-Pace of the game was a little slow at the start but thats good for new players and people who havent many of these types of  games.-Controls were easy to learn.-Lots of neat stuff you can make with the building system.-Love that the block size isnt to big or to small so you can build some detailed stuff and environments dont look like crap.-Music and sounds were amazing.-Loved that there were different ammo types. Id love to see gun customization in the future if possible.Con:-The map system needs a little work. Its hard to tell what side you are going to come out on. Id suggest making the map 3d if possible or at least some easier way to see what side ill end up on. I found myself guessing many times on what side of the cube ill end up on just to get to my objective.-The ability to destroy everything was nice but more annoying than anything. I find myself destroying stuff on accident in towns when i just mean to collect a little bit of it. Please make it so you cannot destroy most of the stuff in towns.-No farming from what i seen at least so i was forced to explore. I get that its an exploration game but it would be nice to have at least the option.-No shops or currency. Once again i get that its an exploration game but i often found myself wanting to go into a ""shop"" and buy stuff from the NPC's that looked like they sell stuff. I hope in the future they add at least some type of currency and shops for us people who love to just collect crap and make money to buy whatever we want.-Performance wasnt the best in dungeons. I find the game freezing up sometimes for a second while in dungeons and the fortress. Sometimes it almost got me killed.-Getting Lost. One thing that would be nice to add to the map system would be waypoints and bookmarks.---Overall the game was very fun and id recommend it to those who dont mind early access games. For those who dont like early access games give it a try once it releases because i see tons of potential for this game. Keep up the awesome work and i hope to jump in for another playthrough soon."

Tutorial seems not there. Markers they place for you to follow just vanish at times. This is a platformer game. Jumping puzzle game and bad puzzles at that. It isn't advertised properly. It needs to have different tags on it not survival crafting building game. Few items to craft. No way to off the bat to learn about making containers to store your items. Why on earth is that not into the tutorial?Blinding effects from hell. Teleporters and glow blocks which serve as torches in these types of games when underground getting resources, is pretty much going to blind you. No bloom OFF setting. No brightness control settings. And instead they tell you to go into the game files and adjust the settings yourself. Prepare yourself for ark survival all over again before they finally put in the remove bloom and adjust brightness settings which came years later.I hate reading poor plots for hours on end.  That is not working for me for my taste.  I have no interest in reading the great wall of texts. There isnt enough markers either.When opening your inventory, you will not even find a discription on the icons on the right hand side that pop up even when you mouse over them. After crafting your first weapon and reading a very boring intro or boring npc talk, you then get thrown into what seems like some portal 2 nightmare game. Where suddenly jumping becomes essensial just to continue questing. The plot doesn't have be at the edge of my seat. I suggest they hire a much better writer if they want to keep the gamer reading.The game will show you how to make a med kit but then hide one of the ingridients for it in order to make it. I can find everything but that one plant. Granted there were a few outside of the woman's home who teaches you but still walked half way around the planets and didnt find any more. Madragora plants are just not around after you pick the first few. So you can't avoid death really. Eventually it will happen. Your health doesn't regenerate as expected out of combat. Its like a candy shell game for modern times with very old stubborn mmo world settings from like 15 to 20 yrs ago.Took me like 5 minutes of guessing stuff before the NPC finally triggered for me to talk to him again to show me how to put bullets in my gun. Which only consisted of placing them in a slot that opens near your hotbar only after you talk to him. That's fine, but he wasn't even triggering to talk to him until like 5 mins later.Seems awkward. I wanted to build stuff gather resources etc. I don't think I even read this much in minecraft. Let alone waited to trigger an npc for that long. I certainly do not want to jump non-stop in this game either. It wasn't advertised as a platformer. I shouldn't have to deal with that as its not something I typically enjoy in game like jumping around like a chimp trying to figure out where to go next or the next blinding doorway. Next thing you know I was using laser bullets. Yup, you heard right. Laser bullets! lmao. If this would of said platformer, I would of not bothered buying it. I heard the questing stops rather early any way and leaving you with nothing else to do. They also have these lasers in dungeons however they do not even move. What on earth were they thinking? It's easily avoidable. Just skip it.Their crafting needs a ton of help. So far I can only make their version of torches, glowblocks, couple of machines and medkits which are missing their main component.I can't recommend it for impatient people who just don't want to jump or read the wall of texts. I can recommend it for those retired or patient people. I just wasn't one of those people. I will follow it from a distance and check up on it every once in a while. Wasn't inpressed. Would be fantastic if their tutorial in game has videos instead from their menu.However, my hats off to the person doing their art work. Beautiful game. Too bad I can't enjoy it because its so bloody bright. Not enough there for it's price. Let's hope the futures brings them more content and better in game settings as well with a much more entertaining plot and game. I wish them the best."

This is LoZ Windwaker in spaaaaace! Seriously, the cute graphics, serious background story, and dungeon crawling exploration make this game feel so much like riding a red lion in space!The only small thing I have to say is its not all the way developed yet. Its first missions feel like an exciting demo to get pumped for. That being said, the games EA is still worth the 20 bucks to buy and play it right now. The content is there and dare I say if it continues I'd call it as good as a triple AAA game.Now someone will say ""It's like Minecarft"" and sure it can be but its like minecraft if it had a storyline, really well made dungeons (although some can feel repeatitive), and instead of minecarts you build and customize hoverbikes. Hoverbikes are the base of every ship and, well, hoverbike which is actually a great idea to simplify the workload for dev's and players alike. The water physics are really cool too. It is a diggable material and I would rather it be gathered without scooping blocks of water and having a square chunk of ""air"" in the middle of a lake but it works well and the swimming is nice.I told myself I wouldn't make a long-winded review but look at me >.<I'd say if the game keeps being devloped in the direction its heading in, we seriously could see another top selling game on steam.Ok last thoughts on the game cause I need to stop ranting how much I love the game so far. I'd love to see this game have either some cool new tools much like the swapper tool and I'd go LoZ style by making the next area require it to progress and get another one.

If they come out with what is promised and update the game its worth a buy. Only complaint I have so far is I like the peaceful music til it gets to the random part where it just sounds like a doorbell going off.
,Recommended,397150,26072813,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,human,"-redoing my review-This game is pretty good for an Early-Access-Game. New Players should start with the story, because its pretty hard to learn the machanics of the game when you start playing. One of my biggest problem is the rotating of blocks, but i dont know how to do it better. The inventory in creativemode is too small and its hard to find what you want. Another big problem is that i (and i think many other players) can only fly a spaceship with inverted Y-axis. But the logic-system is so much better than in minecraft. You have electric cables and logic cables. Every block with fuctions like doors or lasers need enegry, and a logic input. The logic cables have different colors and can only connect with cables with the same clolor. There are also the AND and OR blocks that are like repeaters and comperators in minecraft. You can build a spaceship and fly to other planets.And theres something that need to be done, and that is to ""roll"" in space with Q and E so if you maybe have a spacestation (in the moment not possible) you would be able to turn on all the 3 axis, what would give it a more ""spacy"" feeling.Some oter things i wish to have in the game:-enemies that arent just a jumping or teleporting block or just an character that shoots you but are like monsters are-shooting blocks-pistons like in minecraft-rotators that can connect physical objects-the cockpit could be an output like a button so you can activate from the pilot seat with RMB and LMB a door or laser or something like that using logic cables-mods and settings for servers (rpg elements)There are many other things that should be made, but this is everything that should be done untill the release, theese other things could be modded or implemented in a later update.In maybe 2 years could the game be ""the new Minecraft""But this game is not the same as Minecraft, stacking up and bridging are really weried, this game is more a shooter and vehicle game so its not just a minecraft clone.Theres much to do on this game but if you like minecraft and want a similar and good game, you should buy it."

,Recommended,397150,35206856,Posted: 25 September,all,MR.EDM,"This title is very addicting, good graphics, nice concepts, controls are easy, doesn't throw you in the deep end straight away.  Overall it's a neat little game.I do have a few problems with it, but only 2 major things stand out for me right now.1. When speaking to NPCs, the English is so bad in places, im not sure whether they google translated the entire game or they didn't proof read their game. (You'll know what I mean when you speak to a few NPCs.2. The whole idea of the world rotating when going to a different surface of the planet is... interesting, to say the least, when on the surface, it doesnt throw you off balance or make you feel sick in any way.BUT....... when digging in caves looking for ores to mine, the game doesnt give you ANY indication when you're on a different side of the planet and so the screen starts rotating like crazy because you keep switching sides underground, but you don't realise you're doing it because the in-game map looks like you are dead centre of any given side. I hope they tweak the map so it gives you more information on your orientation, which side of the planet you're on and when you're about to switch sides underground."
