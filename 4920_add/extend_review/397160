76561198136072271,Not Recommended,397160,29218196,Posted: 12 January,all,Teralitha,"Keep in mind this game isnt finished.  Id only buy it if you want to help beta test and support the developer financially.  If you have read the negative reviews thus far, you will have found out that none of them even played beyond the tutorial campaign. (Which will be overhauled in the future) Even in its current state the game is still surprisingly quite fun and addictive, if you can tolerate dealing with the occasional glitch or freeze up or crash.EDIT: After much testing it seems that the game cant handle higher FPS settings more than 24 FPS without freezing up or crashing. 24 FPS is enough to play on high textures with minimal or no screen tearing.  Although you can set the game to use 60 FPS, the game will likely freeze within an hour or 2 of play if you do.The real meat of this game is custom survival games and skirmish games(vs other villages), either against the AI or with/against friends in multiplayer.  The multiplayer part so far appears to be LAN only.  But the dev plans to make it full multiplayer.Custom survival is that.  Custom.  You can create your own entire village of characters, though you can only control one at a time, but they will all be what you want, and all have whatever names you give them.   You set timers for events and how hard you want it to be.  The maximum time so far is up to aprox 16.5 hours with 99 waves of enemies.  Starts out rather easy but after a dozen waves or so you will be screaming for mercy as the types of enemies you face get stronger and stronger, possibly more numerous, depending on the settings you choose.   And then you will scream even louder if your game freezes up or crashes.  But crash or not, your characters progress is still retained, regardless if you have made a save game.  So thats still a reason to keep playing, anyway...Apparently the game is recording every change to characters in real time.  Every skill, every level up is saved as it happens. Your created villagers never stop gaining experience and levels.  They retain all their gained skill levels forever and have them in every game you play.  One of the achievments you can get is to have a character at or over level 1000.Skirmish mode is also totally customizable.  You can create a custom village just like with custom mode.  You can play with up to 8 villages on a map(or monster dungeons), but you can only control one villager at a time, always.  You are, however, able to group up and give commands to hired mercenaries and constructed golems and battle machines in order to conduct organized attacks/defenses.  If you do not control them, the AI simply has them do whatever it wants. There is no diplomacy.  Everything is out to get you and each other.The AI isnt that great right now.   The Developer is currently working on improving the AI.Despite the game being unfinished and with issues, it is still incredibly fun and engaging.  The tutorial is not however.  If all you play is the tutorial campaign and you think that is the game, then you would be mistaken and go to write yet another ill informed negative review.There is only 1 person developing this game, so progress is quite slow.  You can quickly tell from the game dialogues that this guy doesnt speak english as his first language.  Its up to you if you want to get it now.  But if not, I suggest following it and adding it to your wishlist.  This game has great potential.  I still enjoy it despite the freezes, crashes and bugs.  I believe the game will be well worth playing and very popular once the bugs are hammered out.Only buy this game if you want to help out with development, giving feedback, bug reports and ideas.  Its gonna be a long slog until this game is ready for release."

The graphics and animations leave a bit to be desired, and the UI is clean but fairly bland.  In spite of these issues, the gameplay itself reminds me of a combination of a use-skill-to-improve RPG (think something like Ultima Online in a microcosm) and The Settlers, where you build up a town with a supply chain (e.g., logs must be cut into boards to be made into some final product at another facility).  It’s an interesting hybrid-genre game, and its major strength is its insistence on making the player’s character a small cog in a larger, dynamically functioning economy driven by the AI.  It isn’t my strongest recommendation ever, but given its unique focus, I endorse it."

Same with the skills, some are situationnal and some are must have. And you're not limited because the avatar is persistent and can master everything in the long run, allowing you to tackle harder difficulties.The creator keep on improving and tweaking the game and is responsive when a bug arise.The game is completly playable with a campaign ( with 6 difficulties ), a survival mode ( you get a little time to prepare before the hordes appear in any number and waves you want ) and a skirmish mode ( with up to 7 IA controlled lairs or villages ).As a con the game is repetitive and the difficulty in the campaign is just HUGE numbers of ennemies per waves ( even on the second difficulty you will get over 500 mobs on the lvl 18 or 19 map by the last wave ). And the only difficulty here would be to craft the right items to destroy the fastest mobs then take a HUGE amount of time to finish off the 400 or so useless zombies unable to kill you unless you fall asleep on the keyboard.The IA of the villagers with you is ... lacking. They struggle to be anything else but some useless diversions littering the map most of the time. Then suddenly they awake and start to mass construct towers and golems and to spam the hordes with spells. Weird, would love them to be more consistent when fighting.But despite that the game keep on improving and we can hope for some more control over them and maybe even some multiplayer in the future."

I do however wish I could convince my friends to pick this game up so I could test the co-op or vs modes in multiplayer.With a little more pollish, and maybe some graphics overhall due to the RPG/game maker feel, this game could be one of the best games in the city builder/god genre*Tip to creator if they read these*Placing other modes into the non story modes would be better.  another plus would be to control your AI builds for citizens (like having the same option you have for your made characters)"

Give it awhile longer for the developer to get further a long.I'll start off by saying this game has NOTHING but potential.  But It remains to be seen if the developer will realize the games potential.  I'm giving the game a ""thumbs up"" because of potential and concept, and because poor reviews aren't going to help an in-development game AT ALL.  However,  At the moment its also not very pleasant to play, being extremely poorly optimized.   I would recommend to most to hold off, unless you really want to get involved with the community and provide lots of feedback and testing info to the developer."

,Not Recommended,397160,25557501,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Tyrannos,"Game has a very fun concept but it almost plays itself, instead of having a guiding influence or even leading the village, you seem to play as just another random villager with no more impact that the AI. The villagers spread out and don't work together, and sometimes the best interaction with them is building some sort of structure frame and having them finish it. Game is really fun but you feel more like an observer to some town building screensaver than an actual player."
,Recommended,397160,33164184,Posted: 2 July,all,Aro2220,"This is a tower defense inspired game where you play as a single hero in a town of heroes. It's a bit like Majesty, except you also control a hero. The other heroes run around, build things, fight, etc. The AI is not very good, but it's way better than having to control everyone manually.Buildings that craft things wear out...and rather quickly. So a big part of this game is actually upkeep. Your three stats (health, stamina and mana) all regenerate very slowly, so you need consumables to keep them up.You need to gather some raw resources, process them into refined resources, and then combine them in some other building to make the final product. Meanwhile, waves of enemies attack you.There are about 8 (?) technological levels that you progress through. During the campaign, it's after certain missions. But the campaign is a poorly written (many many many spelling and grammatical errors), kind of stupid, and for all intents and purposes it's just a tutorial to introduce you to the buildings/items step by step. Which is fine...you'll finish the campaign in an hour or two.What is nice is that your hero levels up every time you play it...whether it's in a skirmish map or during the campaign. As you level up you gather faster, hit harder, etc. There isn't a level requirement for any equipment though and the levels, while helping, aren't overpowered. Probably minimum to maximum level is double to quadruple efficiency. It's nice but...takes a long time to get there.The game is kind of fun to watch and play. You can set it up to be pretty easy, or very difficult depending on how many enemies you spawn and how many townspeople you start with. By adjusting those levels you could probably find a survival mode that suits you.But it doesn't take long to 'see everything'. And although there are different types of weapons and spell classes and so on...everything is more or less the same.The format of the game feels like it would do well with more creativity in weapon/enemy choice...the type of game is pretty cool. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's going to get much better than this.tl;dr: it's a cool sandbox survival game but the developers have made it pretty shallow. Play it for a weekend and then probably never play it again."

You should start small and build up a character before going into making big towns or tuning up the survival mode settings. aside from skill system this is also an epic action rpg in which you escalate from jungle fights 2v4 skeletons with sticks into 50v1000 elemental mages and giant stronghold fortress, the game scales in a really cool way, I think the small complexity is best early on for learning and training skills but epic wars are what you train to prepare for, you might die but keep the skills.I was going to sleep yesterday then decided to try this game -_-  Actually I think I'm about to play it again, the only problem of this game is the unrelated art style blonde girl graphics everywhere, it's jarring to see alongside such colorful graphics in the game everything looks similar to SNES but the mascotgirl or whatever I thought it was a main character I had to play but this game actually has a really good character creating system and the graphics look nothing like that (except in loading), so the loading screen looks bad is my only real complaint, (there are some bugs too but nothing too bad, I couldn't load all the missions but the other 2 modes are good and missions are considered 'tutorial') you have to play this game to understand how good it is, just close your eyes during load and you'll have a perfect time playing a masterwork game"

I see it as a mix between majesty, spellforce and settlers. You control your avatar but you're not the hero like in most games, instead you work together with the other AI to get things done. You can play a big role however by planting enough resources, starting buildings (so the AI finishes them for you), and gear up so you can defend/attack with your hero and golems, mercenaries you can recruit. The AI do as they please, sometimes very helpfull by setting up defense towers/ golem defense and attacking your enemy. Sometimes not so helpfull by building a bunch of buildings you don't need, gathering recources for the hell of it. They never seem to build a market though, unless you start it yourself. The campaign has 20 maps and takes about 7 hours on normal difficulty. There are 6 difficulty's so you know what to do. Survival and Skirmish Mode.I would like to see the option to hand out roles to some people. Make one person a landscaper going around planting resources. A builder focusing on setting up every building (and not 3 baracks for one town). This would allow the player to focus on more specific roles as well. One skirmish game I decided to be mercifull and keep one enemy peasant (I called him Bob) alive. While I build my artilly weapon Bob managed to revive his fellow peasants and they rebuild their town. The AI is pretty good, just needs a bit tuning.TLDR: Great game made by one developer, that continues on improving this game. If you are into this kind of games, the price is worth it."

76561197998578178,Recommended,397160,26260701,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,Wronskian,"This game is interesting and good for a few hours diversion at this point. I like the idea behind it, kind of an RTS/Simulation hybrid where you are only in control of yourself--the other villagers do their own thing. Your main goal in each stage is to survive against an onslaught of monsters or wipe out the enemy village and its soulless, nameless automatons of evil before they do the same to you. I like the fact your main character's stats are persistent across all the stages, and even free mode, so you can constantly grind up your skills to make yourself the Lu Bu of your tribe.It is impossible to really describe in terms of other games as I have never played anything quite like it, but it works pretty well and leaves me eager to see how it turns out if the developer keeps at it, which so far he has.Make no mistake, there are a lot of *cons*--the AI needs work, the scenarios need fleshed out, and the English translation needs attention from an expert (i.e., a native speaker)--to name a few. Still, on the whole they are off to a good start.$10 seems a little steep for what you get at this point considering you can get Skyrim on sale for $5, but it is obviously developed by a very small team experimenting with things that have never been tried before--and they have been updating it--so I don't feel bad paying it.I recommend this if you like RTSs and simulations and don't have anything against quirky indie games, or are on the lookout for something completely different."

76561198009250063,Recommended,397160,25535972,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,Tenno Heika,"So I was pretty bored one afternoon browsing through the steam game list, looking for something decent and RPGish... and then I found this diamond, concealed among hordes of other games.So the game had me create a character to play with, I created a cute catgirl hunter. Thinking, I am going to go to the woods and hunt wild animals and... do whatever I should do in this game to earn a living. And I ended up playing as a wheat farmer, with a windmill and a bakery, swimming in money and hiring mercenaries to take out adjacent villages, as close to a king as it gets.That being said, the game is very interesting. It consists of playing a character among many other computer controlled equals. So it is to be expected that the beauty of this game is it's great AI, which really gives the world a life of its own.What surprised me the most is that the AI characters are extremely clever. The game world is chaotic, with barren lands, having to work the land with magic to get raw resources, having to process those very resources to come with something useful all of this while having to defend against monsters and other villages and even making sure that they have sufficient resurrection spots to come back to life if they are killed. Most other game AIs would be a little dumb for such a challenge, but this game has the Albert Einsteins of game AI, they are surprisingly capable of coping and indeed thriving in their chaotic virtual world, and remarkably, build a thriving town given enough time.And funnily enough, as so often happens with something that appears highly intelligent (thinking of dolphins here), a strange bond starts to develop with these simulated characters. I was distressed when an enemy villager in horseback was picking off some of my village's weakest and poorest members (without horses or armor).The villagers are very helpful, defending when under attack, or even raiding the foreign village when they are well armed. Most of the time though, they go about their lives: farming, building their houses, building furnaces, generally speaking teching up their village and living within it, doing whatever they think is best for them and the village. I was building a tower to protect my windmill and left some stone lying about for that end, all of a sudden I had some 3 villagers helping me finish it, it was heart warmingly funny and awesome, then it was hillarious when an army of undead monsters died for good trying to invade my farm.It kind of takes me back to my early MMO playing days, harvesting, smithing and going out for some PVP kills. Except these are all AIs, and it is very satisfying to live and act in a world populated by these remarkable AIs, basically it offers near infinite game content with intelligent opponents.Goodness, I truly loved it, and it is not every day that I find a game worth reviewing. I love playing among AI characters, and the smarter they are, the better I find these AI sandbox games to be. It's like creating your own world where you can do whatever you like."

The major issue is not with a technical problem or a gameplay issue, but with the free version offered by the developer. The two versions are different in regard to content (the Steam Age along with all the items, buildings, materials, equipment and enemies along with it) are exclusively to the paid version. It is not much of a difference and the real conflict is with whether it is worth the price to pick up the paid version. I will go ahead and say get the free version to determine if you like this game; I am not leaving it at that though.The main objective of the game is to survive the increasingly difficult assaults of Dusk monstrosities. You create a character and journey to Aurora in the hopes of saving it from the Dusk while building your skills by participating in the activity each skill represents. Mine to increase miner, leatherwork to increase tanner, get hit to increase shields and build to increase builder. By increasing your skill levels you also increase your main level and perform tasks faster. There is a mana system for spells and spawning resource nodes, energy for completing tasks, and hunger that affects energy restoration. While you are accompanied by AI companions, you can also hire mercenaries to fight under your control. This makes combat a little easier since the enemy tends to split apart to strike multiple enemies, which is a plus given how some games just send enemies toward the player in a mindless rage.The game bolsters three game modes: story missions, wave survival and team deathmatch. During each story mission (which moonlight as the game's tutorial), you are given time to build and equip along side your companions until the waves of Dusk monsters strike. Wave survival is the same, but you are able to customize the number of waves, number of enemies per wave, difficulty of the wave and frequency of each wave. Team deathmatch is similar to a RTS style team fight with up to eight players. Depending on the difficulty setting, you could get through the story missions in three to four hours.What could make or break this game for someone is the focus on a passive community. You can either focus on assisting the AI controlled companions or focus mainly on yourself while they go about their own business. The contributions you make during each mission feels minuscule and it usually falls back to self-improvement to ensure you are as battle ready as possible. You can place defensive structures and buildings hoping your companions will build it, but a lot of times they decide to focus on their own agendas. It is quite possible to complete each mission by handing over your character to the AI as well. This kind of defeats the purpose though and turns the game into a visual simulation.The Dusk is not the only trouble affecting Aurora; crashes and select audio issues were present. These issues were present in the demo version and the current build of the paid version. Each mode is at risk of being hit by a random crash while I only noticed the audio cut outs happening in the campaign. Crashes occurred about a third of the time in the team deathmatch game mode making often saving a requirement.This game was rather difficult to properly judge. I have not seen a case were a developer was willing to release a demo version this similar to the paid version. The passive community brought an interesting twist to the table, but in doing so isolates the player in terms of personal growth. This could be why it was implemented; not knowing what the end goals of the AI can lead to an underwhelming force to combat the Dusk though. I will recommend this game, but I cannot stress enough how important it is to try the demo version before purchasing this game. It is the rare case you have a clear view of what to expect in a early access title.Pro- Robust demo (play it before buying)- Distinct art style for sprites and characters- Unique AI systemCons- Crashes- Audio errors- Passive community can be a deal breaker for someSpecial note: I also noticed several grammar and text issues during the course of the campaign. I did not use it in consideration of this review and honestly have no right to question considering my own faulty grammar."

The music is alright too.The concept of the game I love. It's very low plot but very rpg and tower defence as well as random generation. You create your own scenario which involves how common enemy waves are and how many enemies there are in each wave. Or you can chose the wave to happen in real time by simply clicking on the spawn wave icon. You create your own characters which involves race and gender (race affects starting skill levels but said character can still overcome and even dominate with their starting weaknesses) And have at it.Do you want to start with just that character, stand around a grow/build things for skill levels? Done. DO you want them to be alongside up to 100 other randomly created AI NPCs that do their own things? Done and anything in between. You don't have to fight even however that is a fun part to the game.If you aren't convinced that's A-ok! Watch the videos, look at screen shots and ask on the discussions.

For an early access title the game is quite fun. Before I knew it I had several hours invested. The game is broken down into three current play modes, a campaign style more to get your feet wet, a custom game that is time limited and lastly a skirmish setting. All are pretty fun at this point. There are a lot of skills to level of and fun tactics to use. This is a game that I would definitely recommed for the price as I feel you will get your moneys worth in return.Onto some of the current negatives. I mostly enjoy the custom mode. That being said trying to balance all of the changeable parts, i.e. number of townsfolk, number of waves and mobs and timing of waves, timing of ages, etc, is not an easy task. So far I have not found a group of settings that has proved challenging and at the same time allows me to explore all of the different crafts within each age. This is a negative I would expect to improve with time. The other negative I would say currently is the AI. The townsfolk do whatever they please including building a bakery while the town is being attacked and te monsters are even less intelligent. This is again something I would hope improves with time. At times the game does not feel very challenging but with the ability to change custom settings, I don't think this will be an issue unless you let it be.If you are able to weather the at times stormy nature of early access I would say go ahead and pick this game up."

Easy to learn and many things to explore and discover.You can go alone in a corner of the map and live in relative tranquillity if you don't want to many NPC in your way - but they will help you if they get close. Or you can play alone.This game has a bright future ahead and is perfectly playable in its actual state, even on my laptop (Intel 520 Integrated)."
