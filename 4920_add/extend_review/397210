Overall, if you're looking to learn Japanese as a beginner, you are better left just looking that up online OR take a college class of it. If they plan to add more, and depending on what, may change my review.It's nice to have, but is not probably worth to grab at this moment."

It is more of a memory mix-and-match type of deal. To make matters worse, the game itself is riddled with bad localization and transliteration errors most likely resulting from Japanese phonetical spellings into English such as (but not limited to): luggage - laggage, livelihood - libelihood.Doesn't come close to providing help for actual kanji studying. Don't touch with a ten foot pole."

This has so much potential!Regarding the advertising, call this game early access if you want. Its disingenuous to ask people to pay for an incomplete product.Perhaps you don't understand the significant difference between ""mostly positive"" and ""overwhemlingly positive"", from the point of view of both steam's algorithm, and for the user.  All you need to get rid of the negative reviews is to add a ""training mode"" where you can mouse over kanji and see a card showing the description.Pros- Nice soundtrack- Does contain all the kanji it claims toCons- No tracking of what you learn. If you could just keep stats on which symbols you got wrong, that alone would make this game worthwhile- The game needs atleast an endless mode. Where it redraws the board and doesn't repeat kanji until you get through all of those in the set.- Typos in gameYou can't use this game to learn but you can use it to solidify what you've learned.I'm putting down a yes because its usable as is, but the game is sorely lacking and should not have been published like this. I hope the dev pushes updates soon."

I loved the music and all the art, it was really pretty and submersive, but the game itself is lacking in actual ""gameplay"". It doesn't explain to you or micromanage you learning hiragana, kanji or katakana. You are given a chart on all the characters and the rest is a basic matching game. I don't mean to say that what the game is doing is bad, but I probably would have just gone for the phone app if I realized matching was all there was.As possible constructive critisism, I would suggest adding an area for explaining different parts of the language such as the kanji's two different ways to be read, or somewhere that explains the use a dakuten to the player. Something to give the game more of a learning feel, rather than basic matching romanji to kana/kanji."
,Not Recommended,397210,18270142,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,chethecat,"Avoid this one.You will not get trained in Kanji, hiragana or katakana from this.  At least not in any traditional sense.  You are presented with a bunch of tiles showing a character with the name or meaning above and you have to click on the right tile to move on.  If you don't know, you just keep clicking.  This is where the ""training"" could happen in that it BRIEFLY tells you what the one you clicked on is, but if you can memorize things that quickly, you're better off picking up an actual Japanese language book from the bookstore.There is less game to it than a visual novel.  And it's certainly less interesting as well.  If you already know Japanese and want a little bit of practice you might consider this when it's on the cheap, but then you probably already have practice materials.As others have said -- this is seriously misrepresented."
76561198163716391,Not Recommended,397210,18174142,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,nn sigma rhinocerii,Original review:  I was excited to see something that would make it fun to learn over a thousand characters but unfortuneatly this doesn't.  You basically guess at tiles and when you pick the right one it disappears immediately so it can't stick in your mind.  It's not the way to teach and it's not fun.  The first very simple fix is to show the meaning on hover so one has time to absorb.  There is obviously an origin to each character and many characters are similar so it should get into those things in a 'training mode' and provide some hooks for learning.  I WILL spend more time with it but I hope the devs study the human learning process and align this 'learning' 'game' with that.Review after an update:  Better because the right choice does not disappear but it's still not training.  There would need to be some kind of 'fun' schooling or training mode before each test to be both fun and educational.  I am still spending time with it because I really want to learn the characters so I hope it's expanded and I can give a thumbs up.

Even if you dont know them, this game will help you memorise them by trial and error. You will start to memorize them. The game is simple but clean, all I need.Cons: I would love to hear the sound of the characters, it is only written, but even so, it is a very good tool. You can chanche the transcription to romaji, so you can know how it sound like."
76561198038892067,Recommended,397210,29973806,Posted: 16 February,all,kaay,"As someone who spent quite some time learning chinese characters, i was obviously curious about a game called Kanji Training.This game could be useful for someone that already knows kanji and wants to test their knowledge or refresh their memory. The game is basically a series of simple match-it tests.Lets suppose you already know the rules of writing kanji, you know the traits and radicals and know some kanji. In this case the game could be useful in learning more kanji, but its not a very good method. The best method is reading stuff and using a good dictionary, because each kanji can have several meanings and often several pronunctiations.If you are new to kanji, this game will not teach you kanji, and it will not help you learn kanji.Sadly there is only one game that can teach you kanji, its called ""stop playing and start studying"".Please be warned that if you are trying to learn kanji by simply memorizing how it looks, you are doing more harm than good and wasting your energy for nothing.With the above reservations i would recommend this game, if used properly this software will be useful. One of the biggest challenges in learning kanji is not learning the kanji, but not forgetting the ones you already learned while you learn new ones, and this game will help with that.Also please take a look at the comments and you will see a developer that cares about a review and changes the store page description over it.Thats rare and worthy of respect."

76561198070754998,Recommended,397210,20229990,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,EnviousSquirrel,"This game is very simple.  It gives you a character from the Japanese language with many options to choose from.  This is helpful for memorizing and quickly identifying the characters.  Many people are quick to point out that there are no lessons in the game and that it won't actually teach you anything, however after being tested on several kanji that I didn't previously know I found out that looking at all the options and trying again and again to figure out which one it was made me remember it much better than simply being told, this kanji means this.  Also I found being quizzed and getting a little better over time, due to learning, oddly addicting."
76561198053438603,Recommended,397210,20919519,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,southpawami,"As long as the developer keeps working on it, it's a WIP (Work In Progress) and should be viewed as such.There is a reasonable number of kanji and all kana with the exception of the less common wi and we kana available for tests.Charts to study for tests are available for kana only; these charts also do not display wi or we kana.As of this review, there are no kanji charts though it has been posted as an upcoming feature.Kana tests allow duplicate visuals, which I hope becomes an option in the future.As of this review, there is no phrases, tenses, grammar, or dictionary.  For a touchscreen laptop about the size of a 10"" tablet, this could be ideal for the 1st month of the 1st semester of a college Japanese class because of the kana charts in combination with the kana tests.  As the kanji charts are not there, I don't see it being useful for studying kanji from an efficiency standpoint.If you have a summer of time to burn, and you really want to know Japanese, I recommend ""Modern Japanese: A Basic Reader"" Volume 1 and Volume 2 (Hibbet, Itasaka. Harvard University Press).  It's old and it's hard, but it's got all the kana and over 2000 kanji and a lot of reading in one course... assuming you survive, you could feel like you graduated a low end Japanese high school.  Seriously though, don't even think you can do that course in a month.  Get a ream of printer paper, a pack of pens, and copy the 60 chapters of vocabulary in Volume 1.  Then study what you copied.  Then copy the reading from Volume 2 and use the vocabulary you copied from Volume 1 as pieces to a puzzle until the puzzle is solved.  Repeat 60 times since there are 60 chapters.  Find three months and hit it hard.  Very hard."

Good luck in your studies, hopefully the developer is as active as they seem to be.PROs- Simple design- Standard, clear font- Option to play with hirigana, katakana, both, or kanji- The kanji has two different classing systems (one appears to be based on ability level and the other on complexity/number of strokes) so you can progress whichever way you prefer- Option to play with all 990 included kanji- Recent addition of *optional* highlighted mode assists you when you take too long (also a motivation to act quickly)- Grading system is niceNEUTRAL- I don't know if the game makes the characters you struggle with appear more frequentlyCONs (AKA improvements that I'd like to see)- No persistance outside of your highest grade in the kanji levels- No timer- No option to change grid size"

Still, there's quite a list of issues or things that could be easily improved. I encourage you, the producers, to invest a little more time into this game. Things to change:1) The highlight mode should have a timer function or at least highlight the proper answers a bit later. I recognize Grade 1 Kanji fast but I still sometimes need time to search for the right one. Same with hiragana that I practically mastered at this point.2) There's an issue with speech bubbles appearing once you place the cursor on a kanji you already clicked correctly.

Its a tool that will help me if i keep at it.Consno sound - there are no pronounciation sounds for the characters (hiragana/katakana) so you cant use this game on its own to learn the language unless you find another resource to teach you pronounciation.doesnt / will not - teach grammar, this is just a character learning tool, you wont be able to construct sentences without learning from another source.STROKE ORDER - this game will not teach you stroke order, this does not seem important to us none Japanese people, however the Japanese are very passionate about perfection when it comes to writing, and as a result they have a specific stroke order for how they write out their characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji). only using this tool alone could result in developing bad habbits when writing out these characters.This game is best thought of as Find Walley. Depending on how well you know your Japanese characters you will either find this game easy or struggle. Hence you have to learn from other sources.final note; I dont like how the Kanji learning section is, feels messy and poorly structured.OVERALLOVERALL I RECOMMEND THIS GAME."
