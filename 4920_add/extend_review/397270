Tired of pondering the intricacies of the greater universe unfathomable?""A Kiss For The Petals"" or Sono Hanabira is the answer. It is the shining beacon of respite in a world without enough yuri. When you may have troubled yourself as to life's mundane purpose, you smile, knowing that you must trouble yourself no longer, for it is done, and Sono Hanabira is on Steam.Notes:This was originally a mobile/iPhone supplementary game in the Sono Hanabira series, and this is clearly an experimental English license. Fans will be supporting this release wildly for further localizations, and for newcomers, it may seem a bit overblown. This is not a long visual novel, nor is it entirely representative of Sono Hanabira as a whole. With that said...""What's with 'Sono Hanabira?'""For long-time fans of the series, this is the seventeenth game, and one of two that are 'all-ages' (the other being Hanahira, for those of you interested in continuing your adventure into Sono Hanabira while staying within the 'all-ages space). Sono Hanabira started as a doujin nukige (doujin: amateur work by a small group of individuals; nukige: visual novel where the plot is only around to allow for 'plot') that was very well received for its tone, atmosphere, and high-quality character designs.""Finally, yuri done right!""A core cast of couples was developed, and multiple releases furthered the story between each of them. The success was too much to ignore, and after ten doujin releases, the company 'Yurin Yurin' was founded and it became a professional endeavour. ""St. Michael's Girl's School - Maidens of Michael"" was released as a full length visual novel that connected, expanded, and meaningfully explored the characters in a way that previous entries didn't have room for. A shorter sequel was released, focusing on the new couple Risa and Miya (the ones featured in this game!), as were wholly original ventures (such as ones focusing on a post-high school Nursing School) and even a ""New Generations"" series re-boot with an entirely new cast, as 'Yurin Yurin' was replaced as developers by 'St. Michael's Girl's Academy' (again, a company founded entirely for this venture).At this point, fans are dying to play Sono Hanabira in its wholly professional and full length visual novel glory, but, it has far outpaced the fan translators and official English licensing and releases are wanted. So, with everything we've got, fans support Sono Hanabira in its fullest with this game! With enough support, the more lengthy games will be licensed, and the age of yuri can be heralded!"
,Recommended,397270,18213444,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Ace,"This is a review from a longtime fan of this long running series.The Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo series of Visual novels is a purely yuri series, centering around the interactions between the all-female student body of the St. Michael's Girl's academy.Most the installments of the series tend to be light on choices, and contain a fair amount of adult content. Each chapter of the original 11 (drawn by Peko and written by Jun) feature an individual couple from the series, with the 11th installment, Maidens of Michael, featuring all the couples from previous chapters.This chapter, along with the overly chibified Hanahira are the exceptions to the rule of adult content as they are both all ages chapters.This (as far as I know) is the first chapter to receive an official western localization, and is a very light entry into the series, telling the story of Azumi Risa and Ayase Miya, a couple first introduced in Maidens of Michael and receiving their own chapter known as ""Maidens of the Atelier""This is simply the story of how they met. It's as cute as any of the pervious chapters, and features no adult content. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes Yuri, despite it not having any choices to speak of.Definitely work picking up if you have any history with the series (like me) or if you like Yuri at all."

,Recommended,397270,18193969,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,Solo Wing Pixy,"In A Kiss for Petals - Remembering How We Met, what seems at first to be a regular yuri VN in actuality has the two protagonists Risa and Miya present an interesting take on the position of Cartesian Duality, in contrast to the earlier Aristotelian rejection of Forms. This Visual Novel functions as in essence a prequel exploring the backstories of the two primary characters, a juncture where they were unfamiliar with one another. This unaccustomed disposition the two take establishes the analogue to Cartesian Duality, as outlined in the Meditations of Descartes.In this past instance where the two principal characters are recondite to each other, the comparison is established as a degree of separation is seen between the two. Just as they are separate, two very different characters with Miya the intellect as the mind and Risa the epicurean as the body, so too then are the mind and body, a distinction between the the bodily substance, res extensa and the thinking immaterial yet definite substance, res cogitans.However, as the two character become closer, there is a dramatic shift to a more Spinozan philosophy as outlined in Ethics. Just as Spinoza follows Descartes, so too is this represented by the growing attraction between the two characters, leading to their relationship. The couple is thus as a single thing, but with differing properties. Countering Descartes, the whole is as such and we can not draw a distinction between in terms of interaction. For Spinoza, there is no thinking substance and no extended substance, only the one substance, represented as the couple.“We say that they all form one body or individual, which is distinguished from the rest by this union of the bodies.”-Baruch Spinoza"

The two main characters Risa and Miya are the only true characters in the game, other people technically exist but are never shown and the minimal dialogue they do get displays such things as ""Girl A"", ""Girl B"", ""Teacher"". This is a kinetic novel, so no choices or alternate endings. We watch a school interaction turn into friendship, and something more, but there's not much time for any of it to sink in or have any meaning. There are undertones of family drama and serious problems but they are only touched on for the briefest of moments. The artwork is fine, just very limited in variety. Not the worst hour I've ever spent despite the ""No"" recommendation but wait until you get a break on the price if money is a consideration.(Total gameplay time: approx 1 hr.

Because this is one of the best franchises about ""Cute girls doing cute things"". And it's yuri. So, Remembering How We Met - is it worthy or not? Difficult question actually.Hanabira - the epic franchise about love relationship between schoolgirls. It's quite famous and lovable not because of beatiful sprites and backgrounds, not because of beatiful music, and not because of beatiful 16+ scenes, but because it's about ""cute girls speak cute things to each other"" and ""cute girls douing cute things"", not only illegal in their age. In few stories we have incest though. Nevermind.So, i look at my eight installed eroge with some nostalgia and instabuy this - A Kiss for the Petals - Remembering How We Met. What i got? Not what i wanted and expected, actually. Main characters have already appeared in two games of the main series, so the whole plot of Remembering How We Met is flashback/prequel tho the plot of first game whith this girls. Because of it, cute things is unimaginable. Whatever, i wanna say at first, but second problem - the plot. Plot of this game can be discribed in two or three sentences. Of course, this franchise don't have the plot of ""War and Peace"" - or ""Game of Thrones"" if you wish - but in earlier games it was nice and interesting. The only kiss at the very end - what happened after two games and not a part of flashbask - like a bait from developers: ""Look, we have nice girls in other games. Buy from us more"".I'm kinda dissapointed. I just hope that this is the first game of my favorite franchise on Steam and other will be better. Unfortunatly, steam don't gave ""Neutral"" rating - only ""Good"" and ""Bad"", so i chose ""Good"". Because ""Bad"" is not nice.After all this - Remembering How We Met is not a bad eroge. It's just not actually a part of Hanabira series. If you are fan of Risa x Miya or want a play some sort of demo - this is your choise."

,Recommended,397270,18205315,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Pokenatic,"As the fall season begins, Risa Azumi reminisces about how she and her now girlfriend, Miyu Ayase, first met, hence the title. It's the first visual novel in the nearly decade long Sonohana franchise to be officially released in the west, and the first non-spin-off entry to be non-H.The story is that, when Risa and Miyu first met, Miyu, the newly transfered student, would quickly start to skip classes very frequently which irks Risa, the newly chosen class representative, particularly because the teacher asked her to help Miyu get adjusted to the school. What follows is a series of events which leads them to develop feelings for each other.While it's a sequel-prequel to three other entries in the Sonohana series, it is somewhat newbie friendly due to the story concerning how they first met, even though there is a noticable gap between the flashback and the present day. On the other hand, it doesn't give newbies any indication how pornographic the series can get, even though the not so subtle raunchy parts of the dialogue from the beginning and the end is a clear nod to the fact that this series is an eroge series first and foremost. For those who aren't into eroges, Remembering How We Met is still good as a stand alone story, although some small details go nowhere without the context of the other installments.Clocking in at approximately 3 hours with auto enabled at a brisk reading speed, Remembering How We Met is a short, fully voice acted kinetic (linear, with no branches whatsoever) visual novel with no replay value aside from picking up some details in the dialogue you might've missed the first time around. Aside from the main story, there are a couple extras; a CG gallery, BGM player, and a set named Memories, which is essentially the entire visual novel cut up into multiple chapters, which is good for people who didn't make their own bookmarks (although the game will return you back to the Memories tab once you reach the end of that section of the story). The UI is pretty standard for a visual novel, and everything runs pretty smoothly, although the text will occassionally hiccup when set to auto as it will fail to roll out and most of it will pop up at once instead (thankfully, those hiccups don't affect the audio as well). At $8, it's pretty reasonable if you compare it to the cost/hour of anime (which, given that it's a kinetic visual novel, is a fair comparision) and it's a must buy for any yuri fans."

Half of the story, you get to learn from Risa's perspective, and half from Miya's perspective.Story- Story is pretty smooth and easy to understand... except for the last chapter.Music- Love it :)Cons:No Routes- A VN without any different routes, thats a first, right? I kinda wish there was a good and/or bad ending to this game.Last Chapter- Okay, I admit it, the previous chapters were understandable until this chapter. In summary: Last Chapter~ building up tension and relationship. Last Chapter: BAM, Yuri stuff happening. There was a whole time frame missing there.Yeah, I had fun with this game, even though it made me facepalm a couple of times."

,Recommended,397270,20966162,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,[!?] Barndo,"This game pretty much opened my eyes to the yuri genre.StoryThe game revolves the odd relationship around a goody two shoes class rep and a misfit with a troubled family and how they fell in love with eachother.CharactersI genuinely loved both the lovers and how opposites really do attract.Risa:Our typical hardworking student that cares a little too much on grades and attendance. Tends to get flustered alot. One day walking to school, she sees a girl and shes admires her beauty. This admiration becomes an obsession(she is to naive to realize she has a crush on Miya). The rest of the story is Risa stalking Miya and trying to get her to attend class.Miya:Our calm and collected, smartass misfit. She likes to skip class and finds school work boring.She hates her parents and transfered to St. Michaels to spite them. Whenever someone mentions her parents, she becomes angered.She is a bit of a pervert.Sexual ContentContrary to the Steam tags for this game, this game actually has no nudity or sex, though this game does mention sex andstraight up has Miya embracing Risa and asking her to have sex with her, but that never goes anywhere.If you bought or planning to buy this expecting it to be an eroge, you are gonna be disappointed.The only reason the game is age-gated is that the game itself is part of an eroge series.ConclusionThis game I feel is a great introduction to the Sonohana series. I'm wondering what else Sonohana has to offer(I have seen the ""anime"" adaptation of ""Joined in Love with You"" and wonder if the original game isn't just that ""particular kind of scene""). Overall I found ""Remembering How We Met"" a really enjoyable romance.Thank you Demo-senpai for introducing me to such a beautiful series."

76561198097727278,Recommended,397270,28568407,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Azure,"IntroductionThe SonoHana Series, a bunch of visual novels that revolve around the relationship of two girls at St. Michael Girls’ School, the series is very well known and loved by yuri fans. This was the first official English release of a title from this series. Usually this series covers some 18+ scenes, however this is steam, so this was just a short and sweet love story suitable for all ages.This novel is what you call in fanfiction terms a “pre-slash”. Which means it doesn’t show the start of the romantic relationship, but rather their friendship.Azumi Risais the sincere, kind and dependable girl loved by everyone at her school.Ayase Miyais the new transfer student. The student that has perfect grades and fits into the ""silent and cool"" type of character, until she starts skipping most classes. Risa can’t stand for having someone doing that in her class, and so she makes it her mission to get Miya to stop playing truant.Thoughts about the novelThe girls' personalities were very lovable and cute and very well developed throughout the short playtime of the novel. As much as how the main focus in the novel was about their school life, we got glimpses about their personal lifes. Namely, a slight idea about the relationship between the girls and their families. The interactions between the girls were really entertaining while the serious moments between them were quite touching. The dialogue in the novel didnt seem forced like most romance novels and it felt a lot more natural and it was backed up by the well done translation of the original.The art was very nice, but there are only apperances of the two main characters despite some other girls and teaches being involved in some of the conversations. The novel could have used more background variety and most of the CGs were really similar to each other. The voice acting for the two lead characters was great, but the supporting characters had terrible voice acting sadly. They should have left out the voiceovers for the extra characters since they didn't bother creating sprites for them.These issues aside, I'd highly recommend ""A Kiss For The Petals - Remembering How We Met"" for someone looking to put in a few hours in reading the background of a very cute and pure love story, it's a short read. But the playtime was just enough to tell the simply charming story of these two lovely girls."

It's great that steam is uploading more yuri titles and I can't wait to see wether or not they will upload more from this series. Okay enough fangirling/fanboying and on to the actual review.This is a visual novel and since it's a flashback based prequel, no choice options are given; therefore, while I, a self proclaimed bibliophile, enjoy this genre, I advise those looking for more interpersonal styled gameplay to rethink their purchase. Reading speed is subjective, but I managed to finish the game in about 1.4 hours; however, that might be too short for some people. The characters seem to simply be archtypes, but there is actually a deep layer of complexity underlying their personality traits. The dynamic between the characters is great and they contrast each other perfectly.The size of the fullscreen window could use some adjustmet, but otherwise there is nothing really wrong with the technical aspect of the game.In summary, I really enjoyed this game and recommend it as a great addition to one of the best yuri based series available."

(Then what's explored in the story, you might ask? Well, see below for story.)Story:(Spoiler Alert? Nah, I don't think so.)Everything begins with that Nosy girl chasing that Class Skipper girl every day.Day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day...And all of a sudden...BOOOO! they got into a relationship! Wooooo!Who knows how? They just got together! Nobody tells you how!You have no idea how embarrassed I was and how much I wanted to close the game (if not for the full achievement I absolutely would have) when I had to go through the cooked-up conversations.Besides, as I mentioned before, I was expecting, at least, the game to tell me something about the tragic past of the second girl in other ways (of course she refused to talk about it during conversations), but it didn't.Should've known that better *sigh*By the way, there's only this one ending. Nothing involves your choice. All you need to do is to sit and click your mouse like a robot.Other Notes:Approximate Gameplay Time:< 2 HoursHow much does the game cost, by the way?Game Arts and Graphics:It was ONLY them two characters, and they didn't go to too many places. I can't say too much about the art style, which depends heavily on personal preferences, but I can tell you the CGs are SUPER DUPER REPETITIVE.Music:Didn't leave me an impression. So, whatever.Conclusion:I really don't get some of the Japanese Animes and their fans now...Why would people even like this sort of made-up BS...Well...If you just wanna watch two girls doing those guilty pleasure things,I have to admit that's my initial intention, but the worst game experience ever COMPLETELY deprives you of the guilty pleasure of watching Yuri.you can give it a try, though."

It just have a few problems that i will explain in the next paragraphs.First thing first, the only good thing that i can tell about this vn is the plot, its decent enough and actually serve its purpose, it tells how lovey dovey this two girls relationships is, and how when they first met they actually didn't have a lot in common, but they are drawn to each other by fate.. (i think). It also tells what Rita and Miya (The two main heroine) like about each others dispite being kinda different. The title didn't lie, its really ""Remembering How We Met"" and it was really sweet and innocent. My critic though, its really short ! It took me 3 hours to complete that. 3 hours !! I expected more out of it.Now, i have to say since visual novel is actually only consist of plot, art visual, and audio. Visual is really important, the drawing in this vn is decent some of them are really cute, but there are only few of them. I seen about 8 background image and less than 15 characters sprites, i have to say that again, less than 15 !! The bad thing about that is, it makes the background image really boring because they use the same background in a lot of scene, and there's a couple of misunderstanding with their expression since in few of the scene, the characters are suppose to have a neutral expression or an annoyed expression and the character sprite that they used is a smilling sprite. There's also another problem, its not that big of a deal but i will say it either way, there's no character sprite for anybody else, except for Rita and Miya. It just strike as a lazyness for me, because they certainly could draw, but they just choose not to draw other background or other characters sprite.The other problem that i have with this vn is the voice acting. The two main heroine has a good voice actor, i didn't have a lot of complain about that, they really give personality to Rita and Miya. Even though for some reason Rita is louder than Miya by a huge margin, which is really strange. My problem is the other minor characters voices, like girl A, girl B, teacher, or driver. Its really obvious that this vn only have possibly 4-5 other voice actress to voice the other characters and that is suppose to be fine, if they give the other characters a generic voice. But, they give a unique voice like the ear destroyer child voices to 2 different characters ! So, we have the same unique voice for 2 different characters. Its really confusing and bad. Again, it just seems lazy for me.My conclusion is.. Visual, audio, plot is the main thing in a VN, unless you have a terrific plot and a beautiful visual. Having very few decent backgrounds that you use in a multiple scene, very confusing voice acting, only 3 hours in length, and also very few character sprites makes me cannot recommend this VN, even though the character development is actually kinda good."

The only thing that's missing is the lesbian sex, which is expectedly because this is an all ages entry. Despite the lack of this, the main charm of the franchise is the overly saccharine lovey dovey lesbian scenes anyways, so it's not the biggest loss. I'd recommend it for the low price of 8 dollars.While it's unlikely Steam will have any more entries of this series, (unless MG gamer makes all ages versions of those games), Hanahira getting a Steam release might be possible. That spinoff of the Kiss of the Petal series is known for being all ages on the onset. And for lolis."

It's a slight experience, taking all of 1 or 2 hours to read in its entirety if you skip through the Japanese voice acting. The production quality of the game is high, with eye-catching CGs, unobtrusive music, strong voice acting and what looks to be an excellent and very well-edited translation from MangaGamer.Story-wise, this is a leisurely and very cute story that paints a vivid portrait of its central characters and their peculiar cat-and-mouse relationship (Risa, a strict middle class student who strives to be an exemplar to her primarily rich and pampered schoolmates, spends most of the game obsessively trying to convince Miya, a highly intelligent but bored and possibly unhappy girl in her freshman class, to attend classes and become a more responsible student). It's fun to watch this dynamic evolve as they gradually start to become something more to one-another.If I have a complaint, it's that, for all of the build-up, we're never actually allowed to see when these two decide to fully embrace their feelings and confess to one-another. While this might seem like a bit of a cliche, it's a standard part of any romantic storyline, and the game ending without us ever seeing the biggest transition point in their relationship is a bit... anti-climatic. We see their loving and apparently passionate relationship after they become girlfriends, and we see most of the build-up to the change in their relationship, but the climax of the narrative is missing. I also feel that certain issues related to the character Miya's past are hinted at and then abruptly dropped, which was also disappointing.With that said, the engaging character writing, high production values, and excellent translation still make this more than worth the paltry asking price. I enjoyed every moment of my time available with this game, and I'd love to see more accessible shoujo-ai become available on Steam."

To make this clear, this is purely a Visual Novel: A written story that the player reads and may or may not interact with. This kind of gender isn't that common in non-asian markets, but it has been picking up momentum in the last couple of years with digital distribution being what it is now.Is this game Yuri? What is yuri?To give the short answer: yes this is a yuri game, there is no gray zone or subtext, no way to see it any other way, this game is 100% yuri. So what is yuri? It's a medium that has it's main aspect revolve around romance between two girls/woman. As I mentioned earlier, the game centers 100% around a romantic story between the 2 main characters. No male characters exist here and secondary characters are kept to a minimum.THE REVIEWThe goodThe art :The art, especially that of the two main characters is great. Both characters look cute, have great expressions and the game CG'S are all around great. The backgrounds, while not all that special, do set up a nice little environment.The main voice acting :The voice acting for the two main characters; Risa and Miya, is great. It shows emotion, is varied and as many fans of this type of game enjoy, is in japanese.The chemistry between the main charactersThe bread and butter of the game: the romance between Risa and Miya is adorable. While this story won't win any awards for it's originality or it's social commentaries, it's easy to enjoy the back and forth between the two and it's a cute, heartwarming story.The BadIt's too shortAs I said above, the story is cute and the chemistry is there, but the game is just way too short. The complete story can be finished in just a couple of hours. Also, a lot of back story for the two main characters is only vaguely explained, leaving lots of unanswered questions and makes it feel as if some of the main story's obstacles were taken out.The pacing is a bit weirdThis can also be attributed to the shortness of the game, but as I mentioned, the pacing is a bit off, especially during the last quarter of the game. The story of the game is mostly told as a big flashback, which is being told by the main characters. The start of the story goes in great details as to the daily interactions between Miya and Risa, but as the story approaches it's end, a good chunk of the story feels as if it's been left out. To say more would spoil the story line, but it feels as if it were missing a chapter or two during the ending.Additional commentsWhile this can't be added as a good or bad point, the game is linear from start to finish. It offers no choices, no branching paths and no alternate endings. While this was the way the game was made, it might disappoint some fans.A second point and a very important one for some.The game doesn't have any adult content whatsoever. This however isn't limited to the steam version as there are no ""adult"" or ""complete"" versions of the game. This version is the full and complete version of the game.All in all, A kiss for the Petals- remembering How We Met is a cute little yuri visual novel and a great way to get into this type of game. While it won't be remembered as a masterpiece and it is a bit on the short side, I would still recommend it to fans of yuri games or visual novels or for people that want a nice short way to try it out.The Score: 3.5/5"

It's also kind of weird in that it takes its title very seriously: the frame story is that the two leads are a couple and they're remembering how they met on their anniversary, but the story does not actually cover how they went from being friends to lovers, which you'd think is the most important thing. That is, it doesn't really contain the love story part of the love story. Maybe that story is told in some other Sono Hanabira game that's too saucy for Steam, I don't know.It's necessary that everyone buy this game so Steam is pressured to add the rest of the Kiss for the Petals games to the store. The voice actresses worked their butts off to make ridiculous slurpy making out sounds in their microphones (and, uh, other sounds, but you can use your own imagination there)--you won't hear that in whatever lame romance you're pursuing in your BioWare RPG or whatever.

I understand that this really isn't the specialty of St. Michael's; they're famous for their short and sweet yuri novels, after all. I feel like it needed a little more fleshing out, but I also think that I'm sort of comparing it with the above-mentioned novels - and it just feels a little unfair.Let me put it this way: If I were to liken Highway Blossoms to a yuri meal and Kindred Spirits to be, well, a yuritopia, this novel is a yuri snack bag - light, short, and sweet.

When the friendship shifts to a lesbian relationship .To put it bluntly .This is like looking at  a movie about an older established married couple in a  long flash  back  remembering how they met.   When you get  close to  where  you think your finally getting to . Where you find out how they actually became a couple . It flashes forward to them hoping in the mini van. To pick up the kids  from soccer practice or whatever.What held my interest was  I was waiting for the moment of emotional explosion that you knew was coming .That never happened perhaps other novels. In the series explain how these two got together finally and that  may be. Just to graphic for steam . As they may have paired that moment of expected emotional release  with a moment of sexual release as well.   .  However I would wait for either a price drop Or some sort of  additional free or cheaply priced   dlc that  shows you the moment they actually did  move from a strong friendship to a lesbian relationship."

I will be preparing for the upcomingA Kiss for the Petals - Maidens of Michael (Steam Version). Yep, it may be happening."
