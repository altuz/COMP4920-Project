I love running around caves as an adorable little goblin, and the roguelike qualities are a huge selling point (seeing as roguelike is my favorite genre.) Fun, charming, and adorable. Singleplayer seems really unforgiving, but maybe because I'm such a low level. All in all I'm loving what I've played so far. Well worth the money, especially to support what seems a very dedicated company!Bought for adorable goblins and their weenies. Stayed for the fantastic gameplay. Wonderful!"

Make them happy or annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of them.You start as archly, naked little goblins and your goal is to fight your way all the way up to the elven queen, who probably did all kinds of evil things to your people (or maybe not, she’s an elf, that’s enough reason). This is a great opportunity to loot and collect everything shining and sparkling you can find and buy amazing weapons and armour with it.You CAN play this game alone. But you need experience, luck and patience and the game is not made for this. So don’t blame the developers when you can’t do it.Here is what I like!Gear:The gear is hilarious; wear a stylish kilt, a copper pot as a hat and slay down your enemies with a pan or carrots or a cool saw blade thrower. Also, there’s a fez! This makes you play again and again, because you want do discover what else the developers have thought of.Working together is a game changer:Stacking makes you much stronger. Just jump onto the shoulders of one of your mates, and your hits will make more damage, AND both of your special abilities will now work for both of you. So with different weapons and abilities, you will develop your own strategies to cover all of the enemy types. But beware, your mate might throw you into a lava pit just for the lolz.Friends at war:You can throw mushrooms at your friends to stun them and steal some of their loot. You need it for that huge mace you unlocked, right? Well, he needs it too. Let the games begin.Ears:Just look at those ears flapping. Flap flap.What I don’t like: Stag beetles. They throw you around making it impossible to use your abilities properly. When you have a long-range weapon like crossbows or staffs your only chance is to find a high place where you can’t be hit, otherwise it’s impossible to aim. But this is early access so maybe they get a rework."

Yes, bright, colorful, cheesy, runs smoothly.  Goblins are funny, expressive and badly need pants.  Environmenrs have their own themes and its lovely to look at.Audio?  Well, okay, smacking sounds, clinking, more smacking and smacking.  It's cartoony but nothing to remember..  I didn't notice the music.  Goblins make ""WAH!"" sounds.Gameplay..  yeah, here we are.  I'm fine having to move from one arena to the next.  It's a loot game.  What really kills it is the fact that enemies are massive sponges.  I hope you enjoy spending 20-30 seconds PER enemy to chip slowly at the health bar.  chip, chip, a dot missing, chip.. and it only gets worse as you pogress, enemies of course scale with the level so you're just whacking enemies over and over.  It's just not that fun.  And since it's procedural, enemies just appear out of nowhere, are all identical copy paste versions of one another, just whack away.Also, lobbies seem completely empty.  I lurked for an hour during sunday afternoon with only one game waiting for players.  US server was unavailable so I was forced to play with people with a higher ping.All in all, it's a cute game, cheesy but the gameplay really kills it.  Goblins are very fragile, just tone down monsters' hp and add some variety in monsters"

Still, there is hope, we have gotten better on the last tries.I like the visual style, it runs very smoothly on my PC. Great idea of stacking two goblins onto each other!If I could utter two wishes:- scale the difficulty to the number of players, the monsters should not be always have same hitpoints and damage regardless of the number of players- minimap / automap - I am notorious for losing my way in labyrinth, and I fear it could take forever for me to find my way to the shop to the exit back to the shop"
,Not Recommended,397310,34849014,Posted: 9 September,all,jsabsd,"I really wanted to love this game. I bought a copy as a gift for my wife so we could play together. She gave it a shot, then asked my why I pick such masochistic games.The game is pretty, but it's not fun.The gameplay is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ The enemies are fast moving tanks, meaning gameplay is literally just running around hoping something eventually will die. If you stop moving, that something quickly becomes you. And since every shot here counts, be aware that only about 1/3rd will land on their target. The other 2/3rds will fly off into the ether because there is nothing to help you line up the shot in this 3rd person shooter.If this game were a blind date, it would lure you in with it's charm then underperform in the sack. You would make up a number to give it the morning after, then take the walk of shame."

76561198000561257,Not Recommended,397310,24966627,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Evnatia - The Mute Cynic,"Early Access Watcher Reviews LooterkingsUpdate Version: 0.7.1Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer.Before I get started, I need to clarify four pieces of information that have no baring on the final verdict.- There is only one difficulty setting currently available. Hard makes solo play rather frustrating and downright boring if you play it safe.- You must be online to play this game. While you can play this solo, you are still forced to create a lobby in order to enter the game.- There is nudity in this game in the form of goblin genitalia.- Options default the region to Europe, so if you do switch to US, be advised the lobbies might not be as populated.It is worth mentioning the visual aesthetic is pleasing on the eyes with very few clipping issues in terms of character animations. Texture quality is above par, the lighting is effective across the board and the user interface is clean cut with minimal screen clutter. It is a pleasant change from the usual pixelated decor and complements the subject matter beautifully.Utilizing the mouse, you can use a standard attack and a special attack unique to each weapon. God powers are also present, randomly created at the start of each round to provide your goblin with either a elemental attack, invincibility, invisibility, or even resurrecting a fallen foe to fight at your side. In multiplayer, these God powers and standard attacks can be empowered by stacking on your teammates or by allowing them to stack on you. If you happen to get knocked out, you will lose all progress including loot amount and gear, but retain all experience you received during your journey. This is easier to avoid in multiplayer due to the abilities to revive allies as long as one person is still up. Mushrooms can provide a little pick me up (or be used as a stun grenade) and are scattered throughout the game in varying shapes and sizes. Each mushroom type has some effect that will either heal you, damage you, or in terms of my third play through, instantly kill you. All this morphs into a combat system that favors teamwork with a simple, easy to use structure.Each game might have procedurally generated levels, but the standard dungeon crawler process is followed to a T. You roam a level filled with connected corridors and slay monsters that spawn in order to move on. Chests, pots and barrels clutter the corners with the promise of shiny emeralds and gold figurines to collect for equipment upgrades later on. You can have the loot to purchase new gear, but you also need to locate the shop on each level in order to view their wares. To progress to the next floor, you must locate the elevator or the boss room depending on the circumstance. It is a simple prospect in theory, but the alternative motives of your fellow goblins can make this adventure an absolute track wreck.The promise of loot and new equipment is a great incentive and your teammate's worst enemy. Chests spawn a limited amount of loot, which is the only way to purchase new gear. This means you either team up to eliminate the enemy and share the bounty or abandon the notion entirely for a chance to loot everything before they can. This conundrum is the reason this game is so difficult; even the death of a colleague will yield profit in the form of dropped loot. You lose the ability to use your God powers if anyone is knocked out, so keeping everyone alive is a good counterweight to the profit debate. I will be the first to admit that going it solo is entirely easier than dealing with potential multiplayer issues, but the frustrations of dwindling cooperation is also what makes this game enjoyable (if you are with your friends at least).Thanks to a great Godpower combination (Invincible with healing), I managed to complete the game, solo, in under two hours. Eight monster types inhabit the dungeon with five different levels currently available. Each floor is designed in their own unique way from the style of architecture to the type of chest/breakable container. Weapons and armour range from the hilarious to the practical in the form of unique special attacks and passive enhancements. I have only unlocked nine equipment items thus far (items are unlocked based on your overall level), but according to the Early Access statement, there is 16 weapons and 10 pieces of armor to satisfy your monster crushing needs. Content is sparse for the time being, but what is here is at least polished.I am rather impressed with the technical function of the game, nevertheless I did notice some issues. Loot can get stuck between the chest and the wall depending on the angle the loot is produced. Enemies can stand in place, ignoring you completely while you wail on them with your weapon. Some achievements activated without me being anywhere near the required number. None of these are game-breaking or overly annoying, but rather beneficial in the long run.This game is meant for those with friends, especially with the current difficulty. You can find yourself having a blast dealing with the issues of looters and team players, but when it is all said and done, the price is a little heavy for five floors. I am not recommending this title on the grounds of content, but I will commend the developers for the technical stability. I will revisit the game in six months to see how it has evolved.Pros- Visuals are refreshing- Multiplayer shenanigans both in combat and loot mechanics- Technically, I haven't run into many issuesCons- Content lite"
76561197971964488,Recommended,397310,24971973,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,[HdF] Almut Grete,"So far, so good.It is very early on in the development and a little short on levels, enemies and bosses.- Multiplayer is working very well, is stable and does not desynch.- There are ""only"" 4 dungeon-levels, that are randomly generated each playthrogh and they feel different from the way they are build up but still provide a feeling of recognition when traversing them.- Gameplay works well enough for the abilities, weaponskills, stackmode, attacks and general movement. Not clunky in any way.- The game is kind of hard but it lacks a ""normal"" dificultysetting (not yet in the game) and most enemys can be cheesed (all but 2 depending on the level and room). With 4 players there is no need to cheese, it just fun.- Loot can be used to buy items at shops and can be stolen from your fellow goblins (maybe that is a negativ for some ppl ^^).- If the party dies, the game starts again from the base level with wood swords and your little gobling-junk hanging down.Cons:- SP is frustrating and very repatative-cheesy.- The loot you can get is a little low compared to the prices of the items. It is not that you would need them or it should be more to make teh game easier, it just feels sad that you could buy cool stuff in various slots but you are just never able too in one run.- Well content ... but that is stated on the shop page, so i guess this will be getting better fast. although we do not know what kind of content they will and wil not add to the game. Prolly weapons and items are already all that there will be in the game (its 40 what mean you need 40 level-ups to reach them, what in turn is around 20-60 hours of gameplay - its not that fast to level-up)."

Some of the enemies is a little broken and in the start u need to farm a little bit, but later it's really good. I highly recommend this, since it just came out and is already this good. I haven't tried this alone yet, but if you play with a friend it's really good.It dosen't tell you that it's a shop in every stage/level until you find it, which is odd. My friend and I looked for about 45 min until we found it. Some of the tips are really usefull, like when you and your friends stack on top of each other, you deal a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage.It dosen't cost a lot of money, so it's defenitly worth it!"
,Recommended,397310,25033986,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,RabidBullFrog,"Upon completing the available content of Looterkings I hereby bring upon a few words of wisdom regarding the current state of the game.It is very apparent that allot of hours have gone into the making of Looterkings and it shows in its own quirky way, the character models are very well done to the drunken happy look of the goblins expressions down to the anatomy that you will notice upon your first few minutes in the game. The visuals from the hoards of rats and beetles that you will encounter are very well polished as are the dungeons in which you progress through, are very detailed and beautiful.That pretty much covers the visuals and character models in which I give the game a double thumbs up, however lets talk about the game mechanics and combat system below.The overall combat system in terms of flow and smoothness is excellent, the party up system with having a fellow goblin ride on your shoulders is a very cool perk and rewards the players for doing so with more damage and the ability to stack your ultimate abilities. The level up system could use some more polish as the only reward that I could notice was just the ability to unlock additional items. I would add in the ability to customize your character stats in some way (Adding in more attack speed/hp/armor/regen upon leveling up)The current state of the mob scaling versus the state of the goblins is in need of some TLC, I say this due to the only way to clear some rooms, mainly the armored beetle rooms is to stand on high ground and cheese the mobs with ranged weapons. You will find yourself standing on tables and perches to avoid incoming damage and an inevitable whipe.This can easily be fixed with reducing the amount of mobs on the map at a time versus how many goblins, lowering the hp pool of said mobs and tweaking the mechanics and scaling to a point where it is doable without cheesing the game mechanics.In the later levels there is reduced access to mushrooms, this can be rectified with buying items with regeneration on them and using your terrain. I also would like to point out that you should be able to pick your ultimate ability instead of having to restart the game over and over looking for invulnerable heal or invisible heal to progress though the first floor.Overall I give the game a 4/5 Shrooms, the game has allot of potential but still needs some more polish. I look forward to coming back when new content is released to make some more videos and do a follow up review.I have included a video of each floor and a completion of all game content below (Spoiler Alert)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOZDrU4M9Uohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMb0kaFUW14https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpeztfc1a5Ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXttg38wAfM"
,Recommended,397310,24960233,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Sanco Hoogheg,"So far this has been a fun experience. Me and a friend have done a couple runs and have managed to make it to the second stage and leveled up. The combat is simple, but interesting. The game really shines with the ability system, based on the god you start with and your current equipment. This allows for interesting abilities and variations. Combine this with being able to stack on top of another player to combine your abilites and things get very fun. Also, being able to steal from your fellow players is a nice touch. There does seem to be a bit of a grind to level up. Each level up gives you a new item to purchase in the shop, and the game is very difficult at the start since you will be stuck with the same equipment each run. Getting past this thought it opens up and gets more enjoyable. Will update this review as the game is updated.8/10Also goblin dongs +++"

I've played all currently available 4 worlds/levels solo in ~2 hours.Pros:- the worlds are pretty designed with some interesting details- the basic concept of this dungeon crawler is rather refreshing- great idea that the game allows you to play with up to 3 friends- most of your enemies are well balanced for playing solo- you don't loose your level upgrades and the items unlocked in the shop when dyingCons:- some enemies (the bugs) are not so well balanced for playing solo - they are too strong- the fights in world 4 become increasingly repetetive- some fights end up in permanently fleeing from the enemies in circles and waiting for your special abilties to load up- the game is too expensiveConclusion:Great start for the Indie studio Looterkings, but much room left for improvements!I would like some puzzles and more variety in the gameplay.Please add some good background music!"

,Recommended,397310,25043050,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Jacob,"TL:DR Version: This is a very fun game to play with friends or w/o friends. There are endless ways to play this and the dungeons are all very nice.Actual Review: Have you ever seen the movie Gremlins? If you haven't watch it now. Now that your back from watching it I think you will know what I am talking about. When the Mogwais ate after midnight they turned into gremlins. The gremlins are very wild, crazy, and they STEAL. In the movie you will see them constantly stealing candy, cigarettes, beer, toys, etc. This game is like if you put gremlins into a dungeon crawler. For some people that may not sound fun, but considering Gremlins is my favorite movie of all time this is my cup of tea.Performance: The game is very optimized and I have no problems with it, which is saying a lot because most TRIPLE A GAMES are terribly optimized for PC.Graphics: The graphics in this game are very nice and I really like the art-style.Now for the most important thing of all...GAMEPLAY: This game has one of the best replay value I have ever seen. The dungeons are very different in this game because they do something I have rarely ever seen in a dungeon crawler game. They made it where not every dungeon had enemies. Instead they made it where some rooms have parkour. Now, you may not like games that have parkour in them but I am obsessed with it. Other than the parkour they also made something that I enjoy a lot in games. They made it where you can screw over your friends. Whenever you are hit in this game you are stunned for almost a second. That makes you vulnerable to getting robbed. The main goal of this game is to get as much loot as possible. It is pretty hard to do that if someone is constantly stealing from you.Now for the bad thing about this game. You will be extremely lucky if you get someone in a game with you. I personally have played alone most of my playtime but still.Summary: To sum this game up I can gladly say that this is a solid 9/10. I have major hope for this game and I am hoping that this will grow to the game it is destined to be."

I really enjoy Looterkings. Those little goblins are cute little fellows, although I still wish there would be female goblins too, I know and understand why there aren't any.In the beginning I had some problems with the controls, but that has more to do with my skills in playing without a controller than the game.I think the whole game was programmed with a love for little details, easter eggs and interessting opponents. The chatwheel is hilarious and we had much fun with it and the progamer skins today. (Vallerik FTW ^.~)What is really needed are the churchbells for the SgtRumpel skin. It would make me laugh so much.I am so looking forward to the next updates / levels, because today we reached the end of the game for the first time and I didn't die so often. So you see, I'm getting better at Looterkings.So thank you for this interesting and hilarious multiplayer game. It always makes for interesting converstations with my friends and I recommend it as a party game, if you have enough laptops/computers to play on.So ... let the looting continue for a long, long time.P.S.: I also like the individual Looterkings Team Speak Server, although I personally use another one with my friends."
