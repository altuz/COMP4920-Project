This enhanced version features higher resolution, widescreen, a zoom in and out funktion, native gamepad support, it works like a freaking charm, I would had never expected ever to play a LBA game again, let alone play the first one in 2015 but with a controller and with way better and intuitive gameplay. This how a re-release of an old game should be, I hope the devloper gains licenses to other old games and gives them the same tread. Thanks for this awesome pieace of gaming history!"

I did play the original many-many times and the lack of keyboard controls shocked me at first, but that shock was gone in about 5 minutes. The game works just fine with controller and even mouse, so it could be a point-and-click adventure.Otherwise, this is a gem. It still looks and sounds as good as I remember it when I was a child. Totally recommended!"
,Recommended,397330,18590959,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,Bitty,"Recommended, with reservations. Movement is mouse driven ONLY unless you have a game pad. The lack of keyboard movement with the arrow keys like in the original can cause many moments of rage, and makes for long work of puzzles that would normally take seconds. If you remember and love this game but lost the disks or just can't get it working on modern hardware, it's worth the reasonably low price. If nothing else it's worth it for the convenience of having it in your Steam library.I would strongly recommend to the developer that they patch in the keyboard control as soon as possible. It's going to be a showstopper for many."

This review has been revised due to post-release changes to alleviate some of my and others concerns.It's fantastic to finally see the original Little Big Adventure on Steam! The ""Enhanced Edition"" now available on Steam contains a port of the mobile version along with the original emulated in DosBox. I really recommend getting this version not due to the mobile port, but rather due to the original bundled herein.If you have never heard of this games series before and do not intend on playing the mobile port there isn't much more to say; stop reading now and get this gem! You won't regret it.The intended main attraction of this ""Enhanced Edition"" is unmistakenly a port of the mobile version for Android/iOS and as of writing this retains the controls established for said port. Contrary to the original which is controlled by keyboard alone this Steam version can only be played using either mouse or a gamepad. While not being my preferred way of playing this game the mouse works mostly alright but detracts from the way I feel this game is meant to be experienced. Gamepad controls are severly underworked and bugged at this time, where control of the character is snapped at strange angles.Showing evidence of misplaced priorities on part of the DotEmu team when porting this game from mobile to PC (read Steam), we can see that the main focus of this release has been a change of the aesthetics. I'm sorry to say but icons look like they've been made by a 12 year old trying out Photoshop for the first time and fails to retain the original feel of the game. The look of the menu have also been changed, having gone from the distinct LBA blue color we know and love to being gray and dull.Now don't let the two paragraphs above get you down. This game is still fantastic and truely unique, it's a must for any gamer who may have missed it up until this point. Just don't play the ""Enhanced Edition"" at this point in time and instead launch the original version.It's also well worth noting that all DosBox releases of LBA have issue in common with mistimed audio tracks (music) and poor midi quality out of the box. Just make a search for how to fix this on the forum here on Steam or on GOG and you should be home free."

The gameplay is great. You can interact with the environment to look for items, talk to people, fight enemies (or even friends, if you so desire) with your fists or a magic ball that bounces around, etc. The game world is very lively; every NPC (and the game has hundreds of them) is voiced, and have at least a couple of lines to say to you. Oh, and the NPCs have their own agendas, which is quite nice to observe.The game has a semi-linear progression. The maps are actually big, and you can explore every nook and cranny of them. And you have an entire planet to explore. Certain locations in the game are initially blocked from us until we progress in the story, but after a while, you can go almost anywhere.The graphics where amazing in 1994, and even though are a bit dated, still look quite nice today, at least the backgrounds. Everything is colorful, with lots of little details scattered around. The characters aren't very detailed, since they are in (quite ugly) 3D, but are very well animated, at least. The sound department is great. While the voice acting is cringe-worthy, the sound effects remind me of a cartoon, and are very fun to hear, and the musics are great (in CD quality, BTW). Lastly, the storyline is simple to understand, but interesting enough to keep you in the game until the end.This Steam version comes in two flavors: the Enhanced version (based on the mobile version) and the original one (bundled with a pre-configured Dosbox).This Enhanced port changed a few things. While the original version used tank controls (like Resident Evil), and could be controlled with the keyboard, this version only uses the mouse (and a few keyboard keys to center the camera, open inventory, etc). At first, I was confused, but after 5 minutes, it felt quite good. Just click AND HOLD anywhere on the screen to move, double click and hold to run, click Twinsen and drag to jump or throw the magic ball, etc. It's a bit weird, but manageable. I would rather have the original controls as an option, and I hope DotEmu add them in the future, but the game IS playable as it is.Not everything was changed for the worse, however. You now have a VERY GOOD zoom feature, and you can actually zoom out a lot, enabling you to see an entire area. Also, the new status bar is very helpful, and the save system that was broken on the original version was revamped.Anyway, its good to have this game on Steam. I recommend for the fans, and for anyone that likes action adventure games with lots of exploration elements. ^^And bonus points for DotEmu for bringing the original version as an option too. ^^"

76561198067499340,Recommended,397330,25759447,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Bastov the Vigilante,"The game is good, but the redone controls are problematic.  The controls are good for just moving the character around, but what they seemed to have missed ( probably didn't even play the game through) is that it is practically impossible to ""push"" objects around (such as the numerous dungeons) to orient them properly or to move the object on a button that opens an adjacent door.  When you click on the object you want to move, the character will try to move around that object instead of pushing it. When you click the character to move ""ahead"" of the object, the character will still, go around the object you're trying to move.  This quicly becomes irritating to the point of madness.  At some point the object you're trying to move onto a button that opens a door simply gets stuck and I can't get passed this dungeon.  This makes the game unplayable at the moment.  Currently stuck at ""Temple of Bu 3rd scene.""  The only way to beat it is to use arrow keys instead but you can't activate the arrow keys with the remastered version.  The only other alternative is to connect a gamepad (which I don't have) to the computer and play it that way.The game is great, and it works but the controls are a huge bummer.   Please fix this issue. Again, this issue makes this game unplayable and unbeatable when you have to move objects."

LBA actually came out for the PSone too but it was weird to play already there but made somehow fun.Im sure about that this game was a ""cult classic"" (might still is) but it really aged poorly.- The grafic is sure out to date, like very very much. For me, thats not really a problem (since i love old games) but i count it up since its early 3d poly grafic and those looks nowdays very very bad next to old sprite-art games...- the ""style"" of the game was maybe in the time it came out ""nice & new"" but games like the first Fallout games did it way better. Its pretty simple and the riddles are...more or less quickly done. Its more like go to b to get info c to open place a, thats it. As i said, it might was nice as it came out but it gives a lot games which did it better.- the weapon...or main attack ""thing"" they choosed was a ball. Yea, thats right.a freakingdump bouncing around""magic""ball.As i was a small kid i sure enjoyed the idea but nowdays i really ♥♥♥♥ing hate this ball. even in the enhanced edition, its hard to aim with (i tried to play it on controler and it still dont give me 360° freedom to aim!). next to this, every ""throw"" costs you magic, if you hit something or not. Also, the magic only let the ball bounce more often, nothing more.You sure still can go melee against the weakest enemys but thats just the opinion you have if you go for a suicide trip.Why? You dont have a ""invulnerability time"" after a hit, thats why. If someone shoots you with a shotgun-like weapon, you can eat ALL pellets at ONES. if you stuck ""sadly"" in a corner, the enemy can smack up your face and if you are badly surrounded by some enemys, beware your♥♥♥♥♥♥- The voices...okey im sure it was maybe one of the first games which used ""voice"" for everything but the actors....i mean...no...its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and i played it in german and they were even MORE bad. i mean if you can talk to a horse and your character REALLY SAYS in german ""Hello, the horse"" i only had to laugh and cry at the same time.- the plot. without spoiler to much but the plot is just a old-well-known-standart thing, nothing more.- The playtime. The game is actually not really big, it even gives a achievement for finishing the whole game in less then 4 hours.So....without any Dickos (yea, a race in this game is calling ""Dickos""...) losing on my way, the game sure had its fame time and might be a cult classic but if i see other games from the same timeline did it better, ionly recommentit to people who go into this game with ""no idea"" or hardcore fans. I didnt finished it yet (i did on the PSone as i remember) but if i have more time i sure do so, i guess im already near the ending somehow anyways."

76561198130063094,Recommended,397330,33692148,Posted: 21 July,all,MuzzUK,"What can I say it's Little Big Adventure as you remember it but remastered and made to work on modern operating systems like Windows 10 and Windows 7. The graphics have been slightly improved and a few bugs from the original have been corrected and a couple fixes applied. The developer has done well enabling the game as a point and click/mouse game. Essentially Twinsen follows your mouse cursor now instead of having to hold a direction key on your keyboard or gamepad.A few people have complained of bugs and things being broken due to the point and click system but I cannot see any problem. Being able to zoom in and out to view rooms and areas is a nice addition. Once you get used to pointing, clicking and Twinsen following the cursor which takes less than 5 minutes the game plays nicely. It still feels like the original and you can still sneak, run, fight and jump as you did before as you move around the gameworld.Overall a good remake of a classic it's the same excellent story line and a must play at this price!The game hasn't aged that well in terms of graphics and sounds but the improvements are alright but the story and gameplay make up for this. If you've never played Little Big Adventure it's basically an action adventure game in a semi open world... but don't expect anything as big as Skyrim this is a 1994 game after all.Anyway game play wise you are Twinsen a member of one of several races on a planet under dictatorship from an evil bad guy (standard story no doubt). Without giving too much of the story away you must break out of prison and follow the story laid out. There is a set story line but you can semi explore certain areas and find secret places. There is no levelling or skill tree but you do have an inventory and acquire new items from time to time. The game mechanics have you dodging enemies, solving puzzles, sneaking around and doing things like jumping, fighting and finding the correct route out of an area along the way. You should get at least 4 to 6 hours gameplay out of LBA it's a very simple but playable story and isometric adventure."
