It's a fun sandbox for sure, the devs are active and the stuff you can download from the community is simply amazing.  However.....this sandbox toy is very bare bones.  The interface is a bit clunky, the ingame textures, enviroments, and sound are below average.  There is currently no multiplayer support, which is a shame, because this would be great fun with friends.  This has the potential to be a lot of fun, and if it's on sale for less than $10, I would recommend, but understand you will probably spend an hour or 2 messing around with this and then get bored.  With some more content, bug and graphical fixes, and multiplayer support this would be a game with much more value."

Most of the reviews out there are by a lot of very impatient people.-~=THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR THE IMPATIENT OR EASILY FRUSTRATED=~-SimplePlanes is a simple game about building, ironically, not-so-simple planes. This game is really for engineers, such as myself, looking for a challenge. The aerodynamics in this game are rather unforgiving and it can take hours to properly tweak and ballance a plane, but dang does it feel good once you do.People compair is to KSP, and rightfully so to an extent, but keep in mind- this isn't KSP. It's about building airplanes, boats and VTOL cars within Earth's atmosphere.Take it as it is. It's a game. About building planes. That requires a LOT of practus and patience.Quit your whining about how it's unfinished and oh how bare it is and oh how it's not KSP, boo-hoo, cry me a river, the LITTERAL name of THE GAME is SIMPLEplanes. SIMPLE is in the name, litterally.I got the game on sale, I have a lot of fun with it, it's a welcome challenge and helps mah otter brain to get a bit smarterer.It's easy for many machines to run, unlike KSP- it's easily modded, it's got a workshop bigger than the Earth itself and allaround, it's just *plane* and simple fun.It's not a sin to make something simple AND enjoyable.Now quit being eliteist, whiny and impatient, sit down, and build a Gosh-darn plane. That's the whole point."

Played it before it was on Steam, theres no change between this and the standalone verssion besides Steam integration (which is nice)Basically you just build planes and fly them.

After downloading an Osprey, it became clear that the fuselage block can be customised to pretty much any shape, and if it can't be made with one, add more.After my first a/c, which barely took off, I gave up on the flying variety of transport in favour of, wait for it, an airboat, wooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo! It was a simple beast, so I added a control stick for a bit of eye candy, and to practice using the gizmos.The physics are sound and extra features have been added for the beta version (which I used to create the airboat). There are thousands of player creations that can be downloaded from the simpleplanes website with a facility to upload your own. It also has an intuitive search and tags function, making it easy to find the aircraft you want.Finally, it isn't all about the planes, as mentioned earlier. You can even build cars with an engine block in the current beta version. I have also seen an ICBM launcher and even a pinball machine.Well worth the money."

However, it needs A LOT more work done for me to say anything good about it. A few problems here include;-Bad AI, the planes literally crash and kill themselves once they can't find the player.-Awful editor mechanics, but at least doable.-Not a huge of variety of parts. I would love to see stuff from different eras, such as WW1 Biplane parts and Korean War jet engines.-Some ""simple"" fill-in paint mechanics that can definitely be improved on.-Map. Variety. It sucks to just be around ONE SINGLE ISLAND for the entire game.-Not a lot of game modes.I also hope that this game doesn't succum to the Early Access hell with the devs abandoning it. I really do see some great potential here to be either an actual competitor to Flight Simulator and the IL-2 series, but maybe I'm asking a bit too much here in such early stages. It's not that I think that this is a bad game with my current rating, but it's just a game that could've been released much sooner. I hope that with how mediocre it's current state is we see more updates in the near future, and I wish the devs good luck trying to make this amazing concept come true."

The only difficult thing about this is deciding what vehicle to use. You don't have to build just vehicles. This review took so long to write because there is no short way to describe what can be done with SimplePlanes nor the types of fun to be had. This is the only place I saw a cat piloting what looks like a larger metal cat. I've seen working submarines and spacecraft. Car races can be held here. This is not something I can review and feel like i covered everything. This is something that has to be experienced. I recommend this to everyone that ever wanted to build something. I also recommend this to everyone who likes to test things that people share such as locations and vehicles.https://youtu.be/0e2CtKQXfPw

Some people might like that, but that wasn't what I was looking for."
,Recommended,397340,31391969,Posted: 27 April,all,Vykynge,"If you like building things and have the slightest interest in aviation, I can recommend this game without hesitation. This is a fantastic, deceptively simple little game because it provides ample room for exercising your creativity, unlike your usual flight game. The range of planes (and land/sea vehicles, among other things) you can build is staggering. As a matter of fact, the game is let down by the default planes included with it - they are all far too, well, simple, and don't even come close to giving an accurate idea of how advanced your builds can get.The flight model is rudimentary, but complex enough to make it necessary to learn basic aerodynamic principles. It's incredibly rewarding to build planes that look beautiful and fly well.___________________________________Things I would like to see:The arbitrary limitations in the editor should be removed. There's no reason to limit the dimensions or orientation of certain parts, or the power of engines, or weapon damage. It's absurd to think that regardless of whether you're building a wood and canvas biplane or an SR-71, you only have the same structural blocks available. Just let users specify the strength/weight of the blocks they're using, within reason.Subassemblies don't maintain their grouping once they're attached to an aircraft. It's really frustrating to craft complex parts and add them to a plane, then try to move the subassembly and find you've just dragged one block out of it. Subassemblies also don't work well when mirroring an aircraft - for instance, if you create a bomb that's made up of smaller bombs, then mirror the aircraft, the subassemblies on the other side don't hold together.The UI needs improvement - instead of clicking 19 times to get the value I want, I should be able to just put in a number. Planes should be able to be organised in folders. When using the search filter to narrow down the list, it doesn't retain the filtering when you do certain things like delete a plane or subassembly. User-configurable keyboard shortcuts for all available commands would be invaluable. Even if this is only configurable via an XML file, that would be great. The highlight color for selected parts should be configurable - if you're creating a black plane, the bright yellow makes it hard to see when you're aligning edges, etc.Parts shouldn't just attach to whatever other parts they happen to intersect with, the user should be able to build a skeleton that's the only thing that parts connect to. This would make it much easier to take parts out of a complex build and put them back on without disrupting the entire structure.The UI should have a snap-to-center feature for engines that places them so that the centre of thrust isn't off-center, i.e. it should be simple to make a plane have perfect trim by default instead of painstakingly adjusting numbers in XML files to three decimal places.A toggleable snap-to-center would also be great when attaching parts to each other. It's no fun to build a complex plane, and find out its trim is off because the wings are slightly off-center vertically by an unnoticeable amount.It would be fantastic if more complex control over functionality could be made possible using scripting.More complex environments - flat ocean from horizon to horizon gets pretty boring fairly quickly. Procedurally-generated landscapes using algorithms like Terragen's landscape generator would work beautifully, I think. Twisting and turning through valleys and flying nap-of-the-earth is 1000x more interesting than flying over miles and miles of flat blue ocean.Performance - at the moment the engine occasionally has performance lag, especially when a large island pops into view. I'm sure there's a lot of room for optimisation here.The website doesn't present images as well as it could. The default background for taking screenshots is a dark grey, which doesn't work very well with the white background of the rest of the page. So if you have a dark-colored plane on the dark grey background, the rest of the page is so busy burning holes into your retinas you can hardly see the plane itself. The rule of thumb is, the object of interest always needs to be more prominent than whatever surrounds it - not the other way around.___________________________________Having said that, this is the most fun I've had out of a game in a very long time. Highly recommended."

I also find that the controls are a little finicky at first, and they could definitely be fine tuned.  When it comes to the physics of the game, they are pretty close.

There's not a lot of gameplay to be had, and mostly it's just an empty sandbox. The name is honest. It's simple, and there are planes. This is a game that seems to want to do the bare minimum.The developer barely updates, and spends time on diversions like cars and drones, rather than fleshing out the core concept.

So I was worried about putting jets on wings cause i figured it woudl rip them off. Thats a non Issus, I got a carror to go Mach 4.It's a very fun game, and it's only 12 bucks.

I built an Antonov A-40 style flying tank. that was a fun afternoon.*I was once able to spin a nearly unstable plane in a speed-based stall. However, it was not recoverable. I think I will test them more.Now for the Cons.-Overly simple flight model is very unchallenging, almost boring.-lack of proper stalls (AoA) is upsetting and unrealistic.-lack of realistic or in any way really limited engine power makes designs fly funky. you really only need control surfaces, barely wingsFor the most part, most players will have a lot of fun with this game. people who like the Challenge of FAR will likely get bored quick, but it is ""Simple Planes"", not ""Totally Accurate Area Ruling and Everything Planes."" My gripes are really just personal, and I would refer you to look back through the positives, as they are more important that my negatives.If you just want to build and fly planes, this is probably the game for you."

I recommend this game if you don't see multiplayer as your kind of style, but like me and most of the community, it would be nice to have an built-in multiplayer option. I understand why they can't do it as you need servers and all that, but atleast make it available for people to make dedicated vanilla servers. Because right now, everyone needs a mod to connect to a server, and even then, you cant shoot anyone down, you can still pause the game (???) and you can collide into another player and do no damage. For people who like to mess with friends in multiplayer, this isin't the game for you, BUT it still is a good game, and eventually I hope they add multiplayer. Atleast local multiplayer please."

But mine was a replica so I tried to get it as close as possible do I made the COM and the COL not so equal , And I realized that when I moves the Wings a bit more forwards and added more Weight to the front and made my Roll Control Surface bit larger , I realized that my U-2 could have been an acrobatic plane!

With a solid physics model and a suprisingly beautiful world to explore, bombard and conquer the possiblities are endless for what you will do.The only gripes I have are concerning a update focused on Naval Warfare as most of the map is open ocean and a fleshing out of the already interesting world with things such as deverse ""targets"", ports, cities, and commerical air traffic. If possible a multiplayer would be interesting to see but I am perfectly fine flying about on my own.Overall, if you have a vested interest in building things of a mechanical nature, get it, you wont be dissappointed."

The game offers fair tutorials on how to build, fly and land a plane. The biggest issue is it gets a wee bit fustrating and boring after awhile.-Pros:-Flying-Runs GREAT on low end computers-Re-mappable controls-Building a plane is like using legos. Easy. (Getting it to fly is the hard part)-Build more than planes-Map is huge and expansiveCons-The cockpit does add a bit of weird weight. When trying to make a rocket, the builder will say its balenced but even if its perfectly semmectrical, the primary cockpit will always throw the weight off.-Maybe just me, but the yaw is always stiff and doesn't do anything, land or ground.-Camera is iffy-Another balence issue, my planes, even when perfectly symmetrical, tend to leane to the left or right for no reason.-While you can build anything, cars and boats are a bit of a hassle for one reason or another.I recomend this game along with the Random Planes mod here on Steam. Most of my hours on this game were just getting a random plane and flying it. Then blowing it up. Then getting another plane. Turns out I got a boat. Etc, etc"

Its the same game as the one sold on the apple store, or at least is close enough.There are several things that the game could improve on, to make it more realistic, more enjoyable, to improve its flight physics, to remove the touch-designed UI and go for a more minimalistic one, to add more features like speed brakes and flaps, to add simulation of stuff like having the air density change with alttitude and so on.

The basic physics and thoery of flight are really close to accurate, and you can make amazing aircraft.But the developers seem to have started to care very little about their game, and have decided to 1. Slow down updates to almost a whole year of waiting, and 2. Work on other games and poorly managing time to work on other existing games.In the most recent 1.6 update, they added Gyroscopes, Windsocks, and Wind physics. Only 3 itmes of almost a whole year of making this update. Plus, the gyroscopes were already a community mod way before this update came out.I'd rather have a game that updates frequently with little content added each time than a game that takes almost a year to update and adds little content.Now, you'd think I have little room to talk, seeing that I only have 70 so hours on this game.

This game allows you to build so much, with so many options. You can either make a ""Simple plane"" Or you can make a highly detailed airplane such as a Fw-190, a P-51, A B-17, whatever your fancy. This game is definitely worth 12.99 at this point, The only thing i have to gripe about, even though i don't usually care, because to me, gameplay and experiance is better, however the graphics in this game look like they would be perfect for the Playstation 2 era games. I mean, I know this game is supposed to be ""Simple"" but the graphics, Like i said, i don't think graphics are the most important, but i definitely don't think they should be the least.Now that i think about it, another thing i gripe about, and this is the 2nd most important thing a game needs in my opinion, Is sound. Sound is a very important factor on immersion, i feel like sound is more important than graphics.The thing that kinda annoys me in this game, is the fact that the Radial engine in this game sounds like a Merlin V-12I wish we could add custom engine sounds, or atleast get to modify all that jazz without having to go to unity maker and make a new part.Also... Things in this game explode way too easily, not in crashing, but the weapons... It's kinda boring if one round hits the plane and a nuclear bomb goes off. If i have something like a B-17 just explode after a single hit every time, it gets boring, it's not fun seeing a nuclear explosion everytime a plane gets struck once by a small projectile...

Joystick is a must if you're planning on doing some of the challenges.- Difficult build mode controls, but you can get used to them after about 30 minutes of building.- Not enough warbird parts/weapons.- Not enough air intake parts for Jets.- Pulsating glowing rings in race matches are annoying, they mess with your depth perception.-Weapons are too powerful, 1 bullet will make your aircraft explode no matter where it hits.-Some bugs when it comes to part collisions, specifically the landing gear.-Lack of texture for planes, though this can be atributed to the art style or the fact that it's a mobile port.Cons:-Some challenges are too difficult for the average player.-The Lack of flares / missile countermeasures make fights with missiles repetitive."

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy"

The building system is comprehensive enough that it would take a good couple hours to get a proper plane built, but there's frankly just not enough to do once you have something airworthy. There are a handful of races and events available. Yeah you'd need to build a couple different aircraft to complete them all but once that'd be done you would have nothing to do.On top of that the game did not detect the rudder axis of my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flightstick; no amount of configuration would get it to work, and it works fine in other games. When I attempted to use an Xbox 360 controller instead, I found that no matter what buttons or sticks were mapped to increase/decrease throttle it would still reset the power to 0% the moment I decreased throttle. Anything other than keyboard bindings wouldn't work as intended for throttle.Uninterested in taking the time to meticulously craft an airworthy vehicle I downloaded some custom aircraft, beat a few of the events, tried a couple AI dogfights (which helped me notice that many of these planes control like absolute garbage), then turned it off and requested my refund. If you are willing to spend time making aircraft and have little concern with content beyond that then give this game a shot, but if you just want to fly a bunch of different planes get FSX or X-Plane."

Elaborating a bit further, this is as described, a plane building game. You have a range of parts to choose from in order to construct an aircraft. These parts range from undercarriages, to jet engines, to props, to guns, to bombs, to fuselage types, to different wing types. The list is pretty much endless. And the game supports XML modding too, so the list is even more endless.Probably worth pointing out that there's a right and wrong way to build planes in this game. As a rule of thumb, keep the centre of mass in front of the centre of lift. That will help you make something that is partly flyable.Obviously, there's a dedicated website for all the uploads, which also has a forum section, which is useful for mod requests, logging your progress, starting discussions and complaining about how you're going to quit because nobody upvotes your planes... I imagine a lot of the negative reviews here stem from the butt hurt from that last point.Although, if you're hell bent on getting upvotes, you have to be an active member of the community and make unique concepts or good replicas... of just your own thing. I've noticed a few people making some really nice looking battleships ... yeah, you read that right, this is a pretty versatile game. People can make anything from cars, to tanks, to ships, to flying houses. Obviously, the primary aspect of this game is the planes though.The Dev team is pretty damn dedicated too, and seem to work their backsides off in order to provide new content, keep the website running, and probably a lot of other stuff that has flown over my head. A relatively new feature from the Dev's being the tournaments, in which users compete to make the best plane for its class. Currently there are three classes: blade, unlimited and mod class. Each has there own set of rules. Also, if your wanting to hoard points, I suggest entering these too. Oh, and the live twitch stream of the tournament gets put on youtube.Given the clear amount of shear effort put into this game, one has to wonder why people would not recommend it.But yeah,This game...is fantastic"

I like the freedom this game has, mostly because of the wing editing and all the possibilities of wing shapes. You are tasked with being creative, while finding a good way to. Make it fly, I did try to make an X-Wing from Star Wars, although there seemed to be a very slight problem in the physics (It kept pulling to one side, forgive me if that's not the problem, it was symmetrical and all, I checked the stats.). So, overall, this game is really enjoyable for creative and somewhat patient minds, it might take you a bit to get some basic flying designs down, but there's a feature in the game specifically for that!

The game has a ton of non-planes too (tanks, cars, boats, cities, butterflies, iphones and I think I saw a dragon at one point)Though the first statement was a lie, the flying bit of this game is spot on (though the physics could be thought out; yes, I'm looking at you invincible cockpits...) But beyond that, it is alot like KSP's spaceplanes (move the C.O.L back, plane becomes stable but sluggish). BUT this game goes into ALOT more depth than KSP, for example, the control surfaces in KSP are seperate parts, but in SimplePlanes they are integrated into the wing and can be configurated. Secondly, THE FUSELAGE BLOCK, my favourite block in the entire game (minus the miniguns, of course).Now, about negatives... Here is a list of what I believe, are this game's shortcomings:No symmetry mode (there is a symmetry option, but it's manual right now)Game seems empty (they are working on this, at this moment)Limited Part Palette (Steam Community is being added for mods)In total, this game is probably the most in-depth game based on what you can build with the selection of parts avalable.

First off, don't take my ""not recommended"" as if i don't like the game, because i do.Several features in this game are great, especially all the different modes of play. Sandbox can be quite boring after a while, so it's good there is something else to do as well (dogfights, races etc.) which pushes your designs comfortzone.However, as i have played tons of hours in Kerbal space program, which also features plane construction from modules, I find the construction in simpleplanes very tedious.KSP manages to comfort me in construction, in simpleplanes I'm afraid to click somewere in case a part goes away from where I want it and it's an♥♥♥♥♥♥getting it back.KSP makes symmetry easy (one button toggels symmetry and it shows the symmetric part while constructing), where as in simpleplanes it's a menu option to symmetry (or mirror in this case). Usually one would do one side of the plane and finish off by mirroring, however if corrections are made to a part, a new mirroring is needed and that just feels inorganic for my construction habits.Flying is where the game is strongest, planes fly realisticly and feels like actual planes. They stall, spin, tumble and crash if the centre of lift is in the wrong place.Pleny of flexibility in locations, airports, airstrips, approaches and carriers, which is great.And of course a healthy modding scene adds up for a lot.In the end, I just find Kerbal Space Program more fun to play around in. Constructing is intuative and fast.In simpleplanes it's just fiddely and the black backdrop in construction is just boring.Simpleplanes however, allows more flexibillity within aircraft design (helicopters yay!)"

It could be better though, there are some questionable downfalls to the physics and aerodynamics, but its still a great game, and you can fly the planes. You can probably get at least 30 hours of pure enjoyment just downloading other peoples creations and flying them/crashing them etc.Very fun game, I'd highly recommend it.

Online has things like Tie Fighters and Star Destroyers even! The hardest thing really is just getting over each stage of learning to build a better plane. I have 3 Jets one Euro jet that will do 1800 mph and 12,000 ft above sea level, my stealth fighter (an F-22 with a working missle bay that holds up to 10 missles or even a spare fuel tank) ... my stealth fighter is actually too smooth and I have had trouble getting air to go into the vents at higher altitudes where the air is thiner thus the F-22 goes only 1300 mph and flies up to 65,000 feet before losing too much thrust to maintain stable flight. I also have an American style super fighter that is just a little bit slower than the Euro fighter both would make an amzing match for each other in real life and it's awesome that the game allows you to put your planes under AI control and the AI will actully fight back, although right now there is now difficulty setting for AI so if you give them a decent plane with the right missles they will kill you and you them since missles are very very accurate in this game.Pros;Build your own planes, Jets, VTOLS, even cars, helicopters and boats!Real life physics are very reward as you learn to overcumb the real life obsticles of flyingMap is very large with 3 Biomes on 4 main islandsEasy basic tools for starting out and advanced tools for as you progressThe Challenge mode is pretty coolCons;Some physics seem stiff and springy while others seem weak and washy, yaw being the worst.The map is mostly water with most of the land being bare, no rocks no trees and few buildings.No online multi player mode only single player against the AI.there is very lil reward in completing challenges and you don't even need to build your own plane you can use premade ones to complete the challenges with no added bonus for if you did it with your own original build.Overall a very fun game for those who like airplanes and have always wanted to build their own. If you just would like to fly tho and you are looking for a mission based game this is not it. I have spent 80% of my game time building and tweeking my planes 19% of the time testing the planes and 1% of the time actually playing missions or completing challenges. I would like to see that 1% grow as I don't always want to build I would like to fly more missions but for now it is what it is."

I have been playing this game for over a year now and I think that ever since it has come out on steam, I have been doing a lot of procrastinating when it comes to writing a review for it and a few guides on the things Ive learned. Simpleplanes is problably one of my favorite flight games that Ive played just because you get to fully design and customise your planes from the shape of the wings all the way to making your own custom cockipit. (problably my first ""in depth"" review. feel free to bash the ♥♥♥♥ out of me in the comments)Pros of Simpleplanes:1. It does not require a medium to top notch P.C. to run. You can play this game on a potato2. The etitor. The editor alows you to make your own planes that you can post to the simpleplanes website. It is easy to navigate through and allows you to build planes3. The races and other levels you can play. Once you get bored of just building planes you can test your skills in ""arcade"" style gamemodes (I swear im not using that word right). From races to practicing shooting down enemy planes, its hard to get boredCons:1. Learning to build planes. I think that this game has a steep learning curve and without help of experienced users it takes newer onew a LONG time to learn. When I first got this game on my mobile device long before it was on steam I never would have been able to make something fly If I wasnt taught by Me600. The tutorial dosent help much but reading through the website and the reddit would help.2. the A.I. is horrible. In dogfights they typically just crash into the ground and are generally just stupid3. Bullet physics. Getting hit by a bullet pretty much destroys the whole block it hits, which pretty much means that you are done for.4. The locations. NO north runway location, no north runway final approach, no wrigh runway final approach etc. Pretty much a downgrade from the earlier versions of the gameI really like this game and reccoment it to people who love flight simulators, building things, and anybody who wants to show off their creativity."

It also seemed to run better on low-end PCs. One day I felt like building a plane so I got the game....Its harder than you might first expect. I mean, we've all seen what airliners look like, right? Just put some wings on, strap on some engines and off you go! ...except you then do lots of flips and then crash into the ground.This is a game that isn't for everyone- some may just play it once and never again. Others might play it loads. I'm somehwere inbetween: I only tend to play if I have some ideas about what to build. Its like a concept testing ground. I like to see what sort of unusual designs will fly.If you want to build stuff in 3D and see if it flies, this game is probably for you. If not but you're still considering it, its probably worth watching some YouTube gameplay first to see. PhlyDaily and JackSepticeye have done gameplay videos on it, to name a few.P.S. it really does run well on lower-end machines. I get good FPS (cannot notice any FPS slowdown) and I use a nVidia GeForce 210. Kerbal Space Program is essentially unplayable for me in comparison (15 FPS at good times)."

I only have one blemish, I hope they fix the problem, that when you redo one step (Strg+Z) the whole creation moves forwards or backwards a bit. This is especially annoying when you need to redo allot of steps and the creation moves out of the screen. Still this is one of the most amazing games in therms of freedom in creativity (Compared to games like Besiege) and I hope they keep up the good work."

Think of it like KSP, with a full focus on just the planes, the experience in building them and fun of flying your own creations. Think of it like that, except with slightly simpler but more diversified possibilities. For example - Can you very faithfully replicate the Fiat G.91 in KSP? No, of course not. Sure, KSP technically has more to do, but this game caters to the people who just want to have lots of fun building planes and testing them out. If you find that sort of creative freedom boring, then well. I won't judge, and I also won't recommend the game to you.

Hell, this kinda in it own catagory. Obivious comparisons to KSP (Kerbal Space Program) of course, SimlpePlanes is more arcadey then KSP, plus KSP has a much bigger scope and is alot more complex then SimplePlanes. Unlike KSP though, i was quite drawn to this, (I was also drawn to KSP, but i lost intrest in it). You can still expect trial and error, like KSP but, i've had more sucess then failure then in KSP (You mile-age may vary).Its good for both quick fun and/or long term sessions (Something that all ""building"" games worth its salt should be able to do). It also not just planes, its got cars aswell (Yeah, its a bit late for a name change, we all know that). I suspect there will be boats before long (although we do have ""Float Planes"" F.Y.I). So yeah, something for everyone.TL:DR It keeps itself ""simple"", so you can do ""stupid"" (Flying toasters wit bread rockets anyone? [its not stupid, but you should get the point} Really good Fun)"

I have not yet witnessed an Aggressive bot take off, they crash 100% of the time.-Spawn more than one bot a time. Of course you *can* do this already but they spawn at the same point in space and explode.-If something is spawning in mid-air, any landing gears should be retracted and some speed should be given when it spawns.

You can make your own plane, or download one in the easiest way.Cons: Graphics are better in FSX, But I think they give a nice touch in this game.YSFlight:Pros: Better graphics, and Aircraft rangeCons: No AI, unlike YSFlightKSP:Pros: The ability to design an aircraft, Addons are easierCons: Nothing I can think ofI was going to buy KSP, But then I found this, and I am hooked on it!!!

It's a bit like the Sims in build mode, a tiny bit like google sketchup, and in the direction of Kerbal Space Program. It's simple enough for beginners yet has enough possibilities to keep an enthusiast busy for hours- I speak from experience!Pros:-almost total freedom to build what you want-engine calculates Centres of Mass, Lift, and thrust, which is pretty darn cool when trying to build a flying machine-very involved devs, quick to respond to questions on steam and have indicated they're going to continue releasing -updates-passionate community, multiplayer isn't supported in vanilla, but fans are working on a MMO version, as well as thousands of downloadable planes- ease of mods (I presume). thanks to relatively simple graphics and physics engine, I would imagine we'll see a lot of mods for this.Cons- not yet a mission mode. Must content yourself with building, racing, and shooting down AI- could use more building parts (this is the turbo nerd aviation fan talking)- flight model could be a bit more advanced (for example higher stall speeds in airplanes with tiny wings and high weight)*the devs have mentioned they're working on these ""cons"", so they aren't even really cons*Anyways, I love customization in games, and this one has tons of it! I'm not sure exactly how but they've managed to capture some of the most fun elements of my 'golden days' of gaming- before everyone just made FPS games.This is definitely an indie studio I have no problems supporting.

,Recommended,397340,19980213,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Alexcalibur,"Oh man is this game fun. I have been playing it for hours these past few games and it has been loads of fun. The building your own plane concept is really something. However, I am mainly writting this review so that I can label some key point s that this game needs. Keep in mind that these comments are going to be for improvment, not that it is bad.1. A select tool: I would love to see a tool that I can select certian areas, and copy and paste them elsewhere.2. More parts: The amount of parts in the game is a bit limited, and I think that there can be much more, such as more things in the ""Gizzmos"" category of building materials.3. More Challanges: I think that there should be more challanges, as I have beaten 4/6 in little over half an hour.4. More Battling: There should be more battline modes, like capture the base/flag, or defend the point. I do realize that they do have a defend the point already, but it is difficult to try to keep the same speed as that stupid bomber.5. Create your own gamemode: Now this is a longshot in the world of being added to the game, but I do think that if this was added, it would make the game very fun indeed, seeing people upload different gamemodes and whatno like they do aircraft.6. LAN support: This is one of the biggest things I would like to see in the game. My father, who despices computers, actually took interest in me playing, and has been trading off playing the game with me. I would love to be able to fly around and do dogfights and races and other noncense with him on a LAN server. If anything this shoud be added.7. Server support: This doesn't really need an explanation. Maybe perhaps locally hosted servers or maybe hosted by the devs. Don't know. Pretty sure the title explained itself anyway.8. Flying in general: Not going to lie, the flying in this could be better. I currently have my own Logitech joystick and some rudder pedals, which help with the game experience. I am a pilot however, and do understand how a play should react under certian cicumstaces. I think that the devs should put a little more work into the flying mechanics. Ex. being that I could not get the planes to go into a spin, even when I delibretly tried to get it to spin.9. Controler setup: Setting up my controller was a pain, for the resaon being that I did not know what half of the controls did (still don't). I think that they should have a more indepth and brief tutorial explaining these key control points.10. Building Revamp. It is somewhat annoying when I am building my plane, and the camera angle just does not want to go where I am able to place that one block. I think that it should be possible to move the camera angle by controls WASD SHIFT & SPACE.11. More Maps: Currently for the sandbox there is only one map. It would be really nice to be able to fly around other areas, like a city or something.12. Pontoon: Not that this might not be in the game already, but I would love to be able to make a floaty boaty. Unfortunatly I cannot find it. More of a reason to have a better tutorial.These are some things that I believe should be added to the game, however the game does opperate fairly well without these features in it. I can only imagine what the game would be like with these features. Another nice point of the game is the music. I have been able to play it for a couple hours at a time and not be annoyed at the music.Would I recommend this game to someone? It really depends on your preference. If you are able to take a little for the whole learning curve, then you shouldn't have a problem starting yourself up on this game. However, there is a definite short time needed to take and understand all of the controls and understand how all of the parts fit together. Other than that, all you really need going into the game is an idea of what an airplane looks like.TLDR: If you have time and know what an airplane looks like, buy the game. Its awesome."

In this are the parts that you snap and slap together in order to make your very own plane. There's quite alot of them, but they are all quite distinct and do their own jobs correctly. Like many other games out there, there is a basic 'Sandbox' mode which allows you to develop your airal vehicles for what purpose you like. It is literally just you, random planes flying around, and the environment. There are also loads of other things in the game like challenges, dogfights and tutorials to engage you in the game further.I also managed to tack on a cockpit and some wings to an airliner engine and made it fly.9/10 I feel like the game needs some more content/weapons/parts in order for it to reach top marks for me."

You see, I was planning a vacation course for some of my elementary students based on aviation and flight and had two weeks of activities all laid out. Still, I was looking for a nice way to polish off the course and this came my way.I know they are into video games and the ""Minecraft"" way of doing things, so on the penultimate day I got them to design their own planes, which I brought home, built through thsi game and then recorded the test flights and design modifications to play back the following day.Needless to say, it was a hit (especially when the planes went wrong), so for my review, let's catalogue my journey to classroom success.Game purchased and downloaded and this was followed by the basic tutorials. Yep, straightforward enough, let's go.Ambitious start; let's build a twin-engine plane ina fighter configuration. Test fly it... Nope, that didn't work. Make a few tweaks and discover another way of creating a fireball. Forget that! Bin the design and start again.I decide to base the next design on real-world plane and go for a SAAB Viggen lookalike. Visually it all makes sense. i feel I know enough to judge that, in principle, it should fly. Wow!More explosions.Decide to go back to the drawing board, but before I do i download a couple of pre-designed planes. Yep, they work, so I start thinking about where I'm going wrong and slowly, slowly, better working aircraft begin to emerge from my internal design house.13 Aircraft in, plus 4 variants, I was ready for the kids designs.All in all, the game has a solid learning curve and presents some nice challenges. The construction screen sometimes moves pieces in weird ways, but practice and patience gets you past this easily enough. Exploring the options and displays helps you figure out what works and what doesn't and (if you're of a problem-solving mentality), will have you sitting there pondering just how to get that centre of balance just right.It isn;t the most visually appealing sim, I'm not convinced that the physics are always spot on and the game has no real objective beyond that ""Yes, I did it!"" moment, but frankly, that has been enough for me. It is surprisingly good fun and even though the course has passed, I'm back on the game trying to refine and improve upon myown designs (and will perhaps see if I can improve a little on some of my students' designs before next semester).As a fun way of experimenting with your understanding of planes, it is great and I highly recommend it."

,Recommended,397340,20365991,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,AK-58,"It says ""Simple"" in the name, but it's only simple if you count just wanna stap engines and wings to a chassis. Because you can totally do that, and the thing that you just cobbled together might actually fly. Of course, if you wanna getreally[/i] into it, there's all the stuff there to do proper engineering stuff.As someone who also owns Kerbal Space Program, I can say that SimplePlanes definitely has much more ease of use when making flying machines.""Oooooohhhhhhh he said Kerbal Space Program!""Yes, I'm just going to compare this game to KSP. But that's probably what you were looking for, wasn't it? An answer to ""how does this compare to KSP?""Well, SimplePlanes has (as you probably guessed) a much stronger focus on making aircraft that operatewithinthe atmosphere. This means much more contentinsidethe atmosphere, which means that you don't have to understand rocket science. You just have to understand how to fly the hunk of crap that you just threw together.The biggest difference between KSP and SimplePlanes is that there are challenges you can try your handa at. There's air races, combat scenarios and... wait, I think there are only two types of challenges.Erm, let's talk aboutt the combat shall we? Yeah, there's combat in this game. All you gotta do is strap some weapons to your plane, and you're ready to get in a dogfight! You can either play one of the combat challenges, or play a quick 1v1 dogfight against an AI. The 1v1 mode also lets you make the AI opponent fly any plane you want them to; you can even make them fly a plane that you made (and then watch as they crash because they can't figure out how to fly your scrapheap-with-wings)!Overall, SimplePlanes is a good vehicle creation game that's perfect if KSP seems like too much, and still worth a look even if you're a fan of KSP.Just uh, don't get carried away on your first plane like I did.EDIT: put the whole rest of the review in because I clicked ""post review"" WAY before I was done writing it because I'm dumb."

You can also download planes (and soon mods) from simple planes' vast community. Building is not just limited to planes though, you can also make boats, ships, tanks, cars, helicopters, quad copters, blimps, and hot air ballons. It also comes with full mod support! Some problems with it (their are few) are the paintig system which requires you to go and make a mod if you bwould like to do more than just use the fill in bucket, Ai aircraft haven't gotten to grips with activation keys, and VTOL, and they don't do to well flying hard to use machines and they don't have a space mechanic because I have got out of the atmosphere when you look at altiude but there are still clouds above you, and that beautiful sky you see, well it is just a wall paper, but I am fairly confident these problems will all be fixed soon.

The simple graphics allow this to run on almost any machine, and the planes are realisticaly simulated. Some nitpicks I have are the plane controls being unresponsive at times, and when parts in the creator stick together, though that can be fixed with a cockpit.

Now there Planes, Ground vehicles, and even Boats and other weird contraptions.Ive modded games like 1NSANE, 4x4 Evo, and RoR for years.  The Unity game engine is very easy to work with and has all sorts of helpful tools available to speed up the process.  I was able to make addon maps to allow Rock crawling/Offroading (the standard map lacks the detail to really do this).  Even kind of managed to get some mud working.  I have made all sorts of vehicles with the ingame editor.  From rock crawler/offroaders to jet boats for running down rivers and jumping off sand bars.  All my stuff is available on the official website.  I also highly suggest getting the ""Fine Tuner"" mod wich lets you scale and rotate the parts for more detail on your builds.The physics are decent.  I will say that the traction code and power delivery needs some work.  Currently there are no transmissions at all.  Vehicles tend to slide easily...however they seem to be able to climb steeper hills than they should be able to.Highly recommended if you like to build things or mod games.-ian8811946"

That was a mistake I would not suggest trying to learn this game on your own, as the mechanics are quite complex. Even now I struggle to make anything that can get off the ground.Once I made a plane that could fly SimplePlanes got 1000%  better. It Can be incredibly relaxing to just drift allong and listen to the music(which is great by the way) or you can enter a dogfight and destroy enemy ships. Also there is so much to explore and do it takes a while for the overworld to get boring. There is also really great workshop content if you are starting to get bored like a space map, planes capable of reaching 10,000 mph, or massive war blimps.There are a couple of things that I think should and probably will be added. First, I know everyone is ranting about multiplayer and I agree it would be awesome to fight other people to the death,race your epic ship against theirs, or simply play around. Also I would enjoy more maps such as a dessert or city. Some new parts such as heli blades or cannons.But in summary I think this game is worth the money and the effort to learn how to build a simpleplane."

The community reminds me of the old Spore community with how people share things socially .The game is addictive, It's easy and fun to make aircraft and they follow areodynamics very well, It's tremendously fun to tweak your aircraft for the challenges and when you finally perfect it, it is quite rewarding.The Graphics are fairly simple with the textures being solid colors with varying gloss levels but people make amazing models of real aircraft with custom modeled and functional cockpits and even some basic instruments, Albeit simple the possibilities are endless!If you are creative and a fan of aviation I would strongly recommend this title...100/10, Would get addicted to building planes again."

You can save various part constructions for that 'copy and paste' function but thats all it has going for it.Pro's- Freedom sandbox fun- Game was super cheap- Community free vehicle downloading (very cool)- Multiple play stylesCons- Don't like music- Building system is too clunky- Textures look kinda crappy but ok7\10Will play again some day to check new stuff

Truth be told, I've not been this interested in flying since Flight Simulator 2004 (which I spent over 1000 hours or so on). SimplePlanes has that potential. Is it there now? No. Some things like pusher props and such should be acounted for, and smaller builds to emulate WWI aircraft and such, however, in general, playing this game is almost like another meditative state for me.

You can start off with an idea for a plane, build it, test it, tweak it, test it, tweak it again... and then it's three hours later and you have a plane that you've evolved into something unique.The plane building tools are easy to use and quite intuitive, and controlling any vaguely competent plane in the air is fine.  The challenges and races included in the game are limited, but good for giving you a start.  After that, it's coming up with your own designs, or taking on design challenges posted through the online community that keeps you coming back for more."

It's not pleasing to listen to, not sure if it can be change, but just listening through the background gives me headache and pushes me to  destroy my new build plane.> Gravity is not realistic enough(?). As I read from previous reviews, gravity is weak.> Weak physics engine, I once took off from an aircraft carrier and went straight to the water and bounce up and flew straight to the sky. I mean is that even possible?> There are a couple more, but it has already been mentioned by other reviewers before me.Overall, I give this game 6.5/10 because there is still room for improvement."

I'm a big fan of Kerbal Space Program and just bought a new flight joystick, so I bought Simple Planes just for fun and ended up having a blast.  Looks a bit intimidating at first, but with some patience, you can pick up the building controls pretty easy and start building right away.  Would love to see more online functions like playing against opponents in dogfight mode or just a multiplayer free-flight, but overall, a really excellent purchase.
