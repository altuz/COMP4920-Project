A shame that Lords 3 didn't feel as good to play as this one did.Works well on Windows 8.1, and has the expansions included as well. Most certainly worth the $3 it costs to download."
76561197971341065,Recommended,397350,19468800,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,sfnhltb,"Classic game that I spent hundreds of hours playing back in the day - in a lot of ways a big improvement over its predecessor, the graphics and interface are much more friendly, the combat is much improved (although a certain amount of cheesiness of tactics is opened up in terms of using your archers range advantage to create one sided results in many battles if you have the patience). The only downside is the much simplified economy, which is far less interesting and challenging than the original.The general idea of the game remains the same - build up an economy, raise troops, go out and conquer more neutral counties/countries to build even more armies so you can defeat the active AI opponents that are doing the same. Unlike the original there are a number of different maps to conquer, rather than just the single England and Wales map, although the gameplay doesn't really change all that much between each map (you don't grow different crops or find different resources or build different military units).As noted the economy is much simplified - for agriculture you only have two options, grain and cows/dairy. Even worse the lack of weather (except as special events) and fertility/crop rotation means that in practise you just always switch over to pure grain production as soon as you can as it frees up the most workers to your military industrial complex, as the risks of the previous title in specializing like this just aren't there.On the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them).Particularly for sieges this can get cheesy as you can dodge incoming fire with a bit of practise while the AI just stands there as you shoot at it, although this requires a lot of patience...especially when you have dozens of counties to capture during each campaign. Overall it plays much more like an proto-RTS game in this phase, and is much more fun and interesting that in LotR1.As a whole then the game is far more accessible and friendly to play, so it would probably be the recommendation for someone that hasn't played the series before, although due to its age it likely is going to have an audience mostly limited to those that played it many years ago, who don't need a review to know what the game is like."

Even after all these years i continue to come back to it, yes it is simple compared to todays strategy games but it does what it was designed to do so well, i have countless hours of gametime on LOTR2 and i imagine will continue to do so for the next 10 years.LOTR2 was an improvement on LOTR1 with graphics improvement and management, i played LOTR3 but they completely changed what made this game so great. Here is the formula for a great strategy game.This game has always been on every pc and laptop i have ever owned since its release, to this day its the only game i done that with, only other close is warcraft 2. I never got to say thank you to Sierra and Impressions games for making my favourite childhood strategy game so if anyone that used to work for them see's this well thank you for making an amazing game.Should you buy this game? yesif you cant handle not so great graphics compared to todays standards and dont enjoy simple but rewarding gameplay you might want to reconsider."

Lords of the Realm 2 is a priceless RTS game that was way ahead of it's time. At it's core is the mechanics of the game itself. Everything fits together seamlessly - the economy, the warfare, how you need proper map awareness and decision making. It's truly remarkable how brilliant this game was back in it's day - everything meshed together in perfect harmony. In my opinion though, the heart of the game lies in the soundtrack. It captures the atmosphere in an unbelievable way. In many games soundtracks eventually become monotonous but with Lords of the Realm it is a pleasure the entire time. This is a very special game, and one of the craftiest RTS games ever. Worth every penny."

,Recommended,397350,28983823,Posted: 3 January,all,the_rock0123,"If I could choose neutral for this review I would.  This game is around 21 years old and should firmly fall into the category of abandonware.  More addictive retro games are given free legally by content owners.  I bought the game hoping to rekindle memories of a fantastic game and if I were playing 21 years ago it may well get a 5 star review, with little else like this.  The trouble is, since then, Total War has been made and even the original Rome Total War stacks up 100 times better than this game (i.e. Rome Total War may give you 100+ hours of fun, but this game 1 before you get bored with how basic it is).  I thoroughly enjoy retro gaming but have come to realize retro gaming serves a purpose when there is no other game like it, it is a unique proposition.  So I can still play Railroad Tycoon for 100's of hours, or Capitalism Plus, no other business games have been made so well in so much detail.  Well made classics like the original Civilization still provide a challenge, as does Rome Total War which in my opinion is better than the latter Total Wars.  Bullfrog's Theme Park is still unique enough to offer something different to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series.  Sadly though, this game shows its age, the user interface feels dire compared to more modern games, the skirmishes are crazy, the gameplay fairly simple and not complex enough to satisy modern strategy gamers - more modern games offer more depth in gameplay, better graphics, UI and AI and satisfy the same urge.  But, if it wasn't for this game, we might not have had the same modern games that developed, or Stronghold (by the same developers), so this was very much a fore-runner of its generation.  Unless you really want to give it a go or absolutely love this game, I would avoid this in favour of more modern games.My rating (as of 2017) 5/10 : 50%.  I give it a ""Yes"" because of its historical importance to modern wargaming and strategy."

Lords of the Realm II was developed by Impressions Games, and published by Sierra Entertainment(Just saying those names takes me back)and released in 1996.-Detailed breakdown review-""The year is 1268 A.D. The King is dead... ...There will be dark days ahead.""Lords of the Realm II is set in the lands of England and Wales, every petty warlord is scrambling to take the throne for their own purposes, you must conquer the usurpers and force them to recognize your superiority in battle, economics, and leadership.Gameplay:There are two key characteristics to Lords of the Realm II: World/Map View, and Combat View. In World View, you govern your people, keep them happy, feed them, plant crops, allocate food and supplies between cities/states/provinces, direct where your peasants should work to maximize efficiency... really, just about everything takes place in the map view, and most of the strategy takes place here too.As with most strategy games, there's a lot of details to cover, and in a review there isn't really that much time, the basic gist is: Get as many people as possible, make or buy weapons, build an army, ""conquer thy neighbors"".The combat view is where you can implement rather creative tactics. If you're fighting on an open plane, you can try to formulate a strong defense using your natural surrounding, or just charge in and smash against the enemy line.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624363664Achievements:Can I have an achievement that says ""I played this game as a little kid, and wasn't completely terrible at it""? As far as older video games goes, this game isn't nearly as brutal as a game like X-COM: UFO Defense, however it's just as much fun to play.Without the nostalgia factor I don't know how much someone else might enjoy playing this game. But when I saw it was available on Steam, I tried to ignore it for a while, but ended up purchasing it within a week.(As did my brothers, I might add.)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624473659Price:Lords of the Realm II, was definitely the best of the series. Lords II hours is priced at $2.99, I snagged the game, and then proceeded to played for 5 hours, 2 where I completely forgot I was supposed to be working on my next YouTube Video Review, and 3 hours spent streaming it on twitch boring my audience with my nostalgia gushing.There is a ""Lords of the Realm Complete"" bundle for $12.99, I always wanted to know what the other games were like, so that's the bundle I purchased. Stay tuned to hear my reviews for those games as well!(But it seems the general consensus seems to be: Lords II was the best.)Conclusion:If you cut me right now, I would bleed sound clips of ""WE'LL BE SHOT TO PIECES"", ""ARCHERS HO!"", ""FOR HONOR AND GLORY"". My apologies if this review has too many inside jokes and references, but this game... this game...LETS GET DIGGING! (4 out of 5 peasants agree, Lords of the realm II is the best. The other one was shot by a crossbow man.)"

Lords of the Realm 2 is a game that revolves around attempting to take over a region, which is split into a number of counties.  Each county provides your effort with resources such as food, lumber, money, and men.The computer AI is remarkably good considering the age of the game.  It can accomplish many intelligent context based tasks.  For example if the computer sees it does not have the manpower to hold an endangered county, it will wreck what it can and transport away all the resources so that they do not fall into enemy hands.  In combat (which is done RTS style) it can organize a cohesive attack when it has the advantage of numbers, or attempt to turtle behind cover when it is at a disadvantage.  The computer can organize small expendable raiding parties designed to burn your crop fields and cripple your economy, and knows to press the advantage if it spots a lightly defended territory.  Overall it cannot match a human player, but it greatly lowers the need for computer advantages still used today by many games to artificially inflate difficulty.Computer controlled Lords have personalities and voice actors assigned to them for flavor, and although the voice acting is generally terrible, I must admit that it makes the game more enjoyable to have The Knight insult me in his exaggeratedly arrogant tone, or The Baron politely inform me of his intent to annex my territory.The UI is easy to understand, and a marked step up from LotR 1.  There are tooltips and help topics; a brand new player will have no trouble diving right.  There are even auto saves, which was not a given at the time!  Very convenient!LotR 2 is fast and fun, a truly great game for its time.  If you never played it, and are a fan of strategy, it's certainly worth a look!"

76561197971502431,Recommended,397350,19598313,"Posted: 10 December, 2015",all,One Dollar AIDS Pill,"If you played this when you were a kid then you must play it now. If you remember when CompUSA would demo computer games, and if you played computer games, you probably played this one. Highly reccomended for 2 reasons - Nostalgia & playing it again as the older, better version of yourself (just to see how much easier you crush this game). The music is still great, the unit vocals are still great and hilarious. The fighting was pretty good back in the day, even better than many current cell phone apps, but it does not compare to Total War. If anything, this is Total War before Total War was Total War.Here's my strategy (you don't have to read this):After playing every single Total War series, this game's economy and production is pretty easy to manage.If you haven't noticed, the AI likes to garrison its' starting castle very quickly. This takes away from the labor force. They also like to take over counties very early, within about 10 turns or so. They are spreading themselves too thin. Within the first 10-15 turns, they have successfully sabotaged their production and increased their borders with armies of peasants, maybe a few archers and pikemen, and if the AI is The Countess, a little bit of macemen too.The biggest thing to note is every AI has a seriously damaged economy and production. They've got hundreds of peasants in each army... empty towns... ruined fields... high taxes... unhappy populations.I've found the -best way for me- to deal with this is to spend your first 10-25~ turns spending ALL OF YOUR MONEY on IRON and WOOD, leave your forestry, mining and quarrying OFF. You can make up to 100 weapons PER TURN this way. As you're doing this, make sure your garison is at maximum troop levels. Archers and pikemen will hold anything. I particularly like to have a garison of 50% archers, 25% crossbowmen and 25% pikemen.So you're making tons of weapons, having a happy and healthy population of over 1700 people. Meanwhile, poor defenseless counties are being invaded one after another. No worries, your enemies are spreading themselves thin, crippling themselves with peasant armies and terrible economic management. ALL GAME you must keep spending your money on Iron and Wood. Unless a food shortage is imminent, spend some money on that, but by then, you'll have tens of thousands of coins to waste. On the England map, I made a Stone Castle in EVERY county, by buying most of my stone, and/or turning off any production that is not STONE in counties with quarries.This is basically a HEAVY defensive strategy but when you're rolling around win tens of thousands of coin, with over 3000 weapons, NEVER using PEASANTS in your armies... it really doesn't matter how many counties the AI have. You will crush them.Have no more than 4 wheat fields in a county with a large amount of total fields. 3 Wheat fields is pretty standard. Put tax at 7% when you're at 100 happiness. Put tax at 5% when you're around 80~. When you're below 60 happiness, have 0% tax, and buy some damn ale if you can.It's pretty easy to be the greatest noble with the most coins, most troops, happiest people, most castles and most counties. The easiest way to get there FIRST, is to have the happiest people and the most coins... except you will be spending all of those coins on Iron and Wood during early game meaning, you will have the MOST and HAPPIEST people. Have a solid defensive garison and victory will be yours. The AI will try very hard with its peasant armies and crippled counties to take your castle. Be sure to keep an eye on SINGLE TROOP armies, which consist of 40~ peasants whom will raid your crops. You can easily ungarison your troops and auto-resolve these pests. 40 Peasant armies don't arrive until after you have smashed a greater army.You can easily defend your castle against 2, 3, even 4 or 5 times the odds. Sometimes I just say, ""Hell, I'm gonna let them in"", and I lower the bridge. Prior to this, I make sure all of my men are at the last and final chokepoint inside the castle. For a Motte and Baily, It would be the tiny palisade surrounded by water. Pikes at the door, archers and crossbows off to the left or right so that they may shoot over the flag tower. Royal castles are particularly easy to defend, especially in combination with the 6 boiling oil pots. Just send all your men into the flag keep, pikes at the door, crossbows and archers behind, and just lower that damn draw bridge and let em' in. Have your oil pots at the front gates and just dump on them as they come in. Aim for their pikes and archers if you can. As for a Stone castle, that is an easy defense too. Just put all of your ranged ontop of the flag, and pikes at the only two stairways that lead up to the flag.Have at least a Motte and Baily, because that second wall that they have to break through is where the money is, in any castle. Let them in through the first wall, don't allow them to use any other siege equipment by Letting Them In! Then just dump oil on them till their crippled force reaches your second gate, followed by a pike wall guarding your archers and crossbows.There is no need to compete with how fast the AI takes counties. Don't be intimidated. Be a Prang Mantus, wait for your time to strike, preferably with over 600 men, including a majority of maces followed by swordsmen, then crossbows, then knights. Make sure to engage with your swordsmen first, with macemen following right behind your swords and/or with a hefty group of maces to hit the AI in the flank. ALWAYS use your knights to engage in the AI's flank AFTER they have initiated your melee units. Crossbows will sit right behind the melee lines and fire away. As for the AI's boiling oil pots, just send in 1 knight to tip them over before sending in your main force.It's okay to train up a ton of army after you have made tons of weapons and garisoned your castle. If you've got 25 happiness, that's okay, either tax your people 0 or 1%. If you're gonna run out of money because you've been spending it on iron and wood to make weapons, just sell 10 or 15 swords, or knights here and there. It's okay to lose some more population due to unhappiness after raising an army. Because with an army at this size and professionalism, it can smash any AI army, because they all have peasants. Just make sure to front line with your armoured units, flank with your fast units, and dont let your ranged get touched.Super easy. Easy game. Fun though. Never thought I'd get to this point when I was a kid when this game came out. I couldn't even get past the first level when I was 8 years old. Now I just watch the AI be feeble and aggressive while I build up my ONE ARMY TO RULE THEM ALL. It's a pretty nostalgiac feeling to have a 1500 man army with zero peasants and stone castles in every county.Let your people build and repair! Buy those goods my lord.Without trade, you cannot expand your empire to ridiculous sizes.Without patience, you cannot secure your realm.http://i.imgur.com/uUYgGFI.jpgPolitics do not matter. No amount of words will change the idiocy or willingness of the AI.Mid-game screenshotshttp://imgur.com/a/yFqLX"

In my opinion this is an improvement over LOTR. The graphics and interface are friendlier and the combat is much better.  On the flipside, the economy has been watered down, making it far less interesting and challenging than the original.The overall objective of this game is to♥♥♥♥♥♥ pillage, and conquer the neutral as well as the enemy controlled counties of the map. Each map varies in the number of counties such as 4 or 6, for example. In order to meet the objective, one must build up an economy, raise troops, and go out and conquer the surrounding lands. All the while, the AI is doing the same.As noted the economy is much easier to handle in this game. For example, agriculture has two options, grain and cows. However, there is also the buying and selling of iron, stone, and wood as well as varies weapons that the prudent seller/manufactuer may make money on.On the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them).Please note that you van also build a castle for your county-counties. They range from a motte and bailey to a full stone castle with defenses such as burning oil. Its always nice to have your castle seiged just to kill the enemy with arrows and burning oil.I wholeheartly recommend this game to anyone who played it intially and to anyone who likes strategy games. The graphics aren't in anyway as fantastic as COH but the game is fun and will frustrate you (in a good way) and make you laugh in a sadistic way."

I used to spend hours at night when I should have been sleeping playing this game, sending insults to The Baron while I was heavy-eyed and dozing off.  It was one of my introductions to games like Civilization, and I am not sure where to be thankful or angry at Impressions for that.And I think comparing it to a small-scale Civilization is a good way to put it.  It's a lot simpler and more focused than Civ, and nowhere near the scope of Civ.The concept of Lords 2 is that the king has died, and five pretenders to the throne are fighting it out with diplomacy and warfare going county-by-county.  Each player starts with a county, and can conquer thier neighbors while forming alliances and starting wars.  A second part of the game deals with commanding a battlefield in real time as you storm castles and conquer towns.Part of what made this game special in its time is that the two  game modes combined two different strategy genres perfectly.  The main game was a turn-based strategy with a small amount of micromanaging of counties, while the skirmish mode was an RTS reminiscent of Warcraft without the building aspect.The included ""Siege pack"" expanded on the RTS elements of the game, adding a Skirmish menu for custom battles and sieges.The game is still a lot of fun, but doesn't quite hold up after nearly 2 decades.  The AI is not very competent in the skirmishes, and the controls during those battles is awkward.  Issuing orders in mid-fight can be a pain.  Fortunately there is an option to skip the battles and ""autocalc"" them, if they are frustrating.  This can be done at anytime, before the battle or during.The micromanaging might be offputting to some people, but it is not particularly complicated.Ultimately the game is still fun and immersive, but doesn't feel the same with all of the excellent strategy games that followed.Avoid Lords 3 at all costs."

The reason this is a bit like Stronghold outside the fact that it's the middle ages is because of the resource managment, you have a population that grows based upon health and happiness which is determined by how much your feeding them or if your feeding them at all and taxes, let it drop watch them die to illness and emmigrate to opposing towns. This is crucial that you make sure you keep them around as they are your workforce and your military when you recruit troops not only do you need to procure the weapons for the troop type you need the citizens to carry them so you have to find a balance of troops and workforce.As for total war the campaign map is turnbased with the hybrid turns (everyone takes them at once) with towns slapped across the map. Also on the map you will see farm field which there are 3 types of and strategic resources being wood, stone, and iron. Here you will manage your peasantry and direct their work building castles, training troops, buying from the traveling merchants, and of course proving their can be only one king by slapping your neigbors silly.There is abit more details I could throw in there but that's the core elements and if it sounds even slightly interesting to you definately buy it and then join me in moaning why these game mechanics haven't been replicated in a modern game engine."

Just remember that this game is really old and that will make sense...Lords of the Realm II features real time battles, an easy micromanagement, castle building/upgrading/repairing, resource gathering (wood, stone, iron), smithing, farming, turn based strategies (each turn is a season, and each season provides different challenges, like harvesting in autumn), very basic diplomacy, army provisioning, people's happiness and more. All in all it's a nice and winning mix: I can say there is no other game around like this, but many games copied from it.I find it very satisfactory to station troops in enemy counties and let them feed on their crops; or to weaken enemies by sending small armies to their ""capital"" county, destroying all its fields and killing all the cattle! And enemy lords do that too... damnation to them!The soundtracks are amazing, even if they're played continuously I never get tired of hearing them... they're very ""medieval""!The voice acting is nice too: low rank units (paesants, archers, macemen, pikemen, ...) sound rude and uneducated, like they really were; while high rank units (swordsmen and knights) are more polite. Very nice to hear!I bought Lords of the Realm II without thinking twice out of nostalgia, but I really think it still has a lot of ludic value."

There are two campaigns and a lot of maps for custom games available for playing. You can modify the difficulty in a lot of ways especially for the custom games, so you can decide if you want advanved farming or not, eating armies and how strong the opponents are!The gameplay itself can be very addictive, prepare for long gaming sessions especially on the larger realms.The graphics are ok for their age, it is decent VGA graphics sufficient enough for the gameplay.The OST is really nice and adds some atmosphere to the game.There is also some kind of humour, especially when listening to the troops or when some of the other nobles sending you a letter in rage. And if you beat the campaign you can listen to a funny song!(and if you are too lazy to play through the campaign look for it in the game folder ;-) )Are there any issues with this game? Well, while it overall runs without problems sometimes strange glitches occur like enemy armies or merchants going over mountains or even the ocean. While I stumbled upon these problems in very rare cases they can happen sometimes. Also I recommend to disable any software that might interrupt the gameplay with notification windows as it is very prone to crash in this case! Fortunately it auto-saves after every turn, still this can be annoying.Aside this the gameplay also is in some regards unbalanced from my experience. Especially the strenght of the troops. Archers are the cheapest unit to produce only needing wood, but they are the strongest with their high range and fire rate! While knights are despite their high costs not so strong and the other ones are mostly uninteresting. Ok, macemen can act as ""cheap knights"" with nearly the same speed and rather low costs to produce, sacrificing some armour.The siege part is also a bit odd, you can build catapults but these won´t do any damage to troops, I guess for balancing issues, so they just destroy the walls of a castle.Also the animation and movement of the siege weapon looks very odd.In fact you don´t need them except for a battering ram for the two stronger castles to destroy the drawbridge after the moat has been shoveled up.The enemy AI is sometimes not that smart, making some games rather easy to win.Another strange thing I encountered is that none of my capturing programs can record this game - neither FRAPS or Bandicam or other ones did recognise it. Not a real disadvantage, but in case you might to record it for Youtube or other means take note of this.Despite these little drawback the game is overall enjoyable to play and highly recommended for everyone who likes medieval strategy games.If I could with for something then it would be the addition of the german translation and dubbing for this game. It is overall well done, rather near to the original and some voices sound even more funny."
