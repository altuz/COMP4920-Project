The faces look really strange to me.  Gone are the old players and side banter that made playing previous versions of Hoyle fun - I miss Roswell, Rhett, Marvin, and others.  There do not seem to be a lot of new games over the previous version, either.  I used to enjoy playing French Tarot in the 2005 edition of Hoyle, which they removed several versions ago and never added back.  I like that Hoyle is on Steam now, but they really need to go back and try again with this one."

I wanted to get a computer cribbage game for those times when I need my crib fix and my wife isn't up for a game.  This serves that purpose.  It's decent, but not fabulous.Pros:-- Game runs in full screen.-- Seems to be totally bug-free (at least cribbage and gin rummy...I haven't had a chance to play the other games yet).-- The AI is alright.-- Some of the other reviewers seemed upset because, apparently, the AI avatars and voices in this version are inferior to previous installments (or something).  I dunno...I had an older version of Hoyle's card games on my old computer several years ago, and I personally don't remember the AI's ""personality"" being anything even remotely memorable.  I honestly don't give a rat's behind about any of that.  I just want to play crib, and this game lets me do it.  I guess it's important to some other players, but it wasn't an issue for me.Cons:-- The soundtrack is atrocious elevator music.  Fortunately, it can be turned off.-- The game uses rookie scoring methods for cribbage.  Anyone who plays crib knows that a pattern of cards like the following, JQQK or 4456 for instance, is known as a ""double-run"" and is worth 8 points.  But the AI scores it like a noob, counting it as two runs (3 points each) and a pair (2 points).  Here's another example: in crib, a three-of-a-kind is known as a ""pair royal"" and is worth 6 points, but the AI counts it as 3 seperate pairs, worth 2 apiece.  Why does this matter, you ask?  Well, first of all, it's totally annoying to veteran players who are used to the standard scoring practices.  And, secondly, because one of the best parts of cribbage is watching your opponent overlook something as they count up their hand, and then stealing those points for yourself!  It's known as the ""muggins rule"".  The game does give you the option of playing with the muggins rule enabled...but, jeez, I can't imagine any better way to suck the fun out of it and make it a tedious ordeal, than by using the rookie scoring methods the AI employs.  I mean, I guess for someone learning cribbage for the first time the scoring MIGHT be helpful...but they could have at least given the player an option in the options menu to choose between ""veteran scoring"" and ""beginner scoring"".  Meh... :PConclusion:6/10.  When push comes to shove, it gets a thumbs up...barely.  It sucks compared to a real opponent, of course.  But the lame crib scoring methods and the sound issues are what really drag it down.  I got it on sale for 75% off, so I'm happy with the purchase overall.  I would have been disappointed had I paid full price.  Wait for it to go on sale."

,Not Recommended,397420,23150363,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,Barclay,"TL;DR: Give a it skip.UPDATED: Since the Sept 2016 update, I can only say the game is even worse. The Face Creator makes death-mask-truly-gruesome-players.  We're not talking fun zombie type characters or even ghouls here. We're talking bony, ugly, emaciated, scrawny, staring-at-you-with dead eyes type faces. Creepy but not-fun-creepy.The NPCs are even worse. You have Satch who is--you guessed it--Sasquatch, a pirate, a character with a pretty un-nifty cowboy hat. It sounds like exact TWO people voiced the male and female characters--and not with a great deal of talent.While it no longer sounds like you're playing with a malfunctioning Stephen Hawking voice device for every character, the voice work is just GD painful--although not as painful as the awful script. The kicker: you can't turn it OFF! You can't shut them up! You can turn the volume off. You can make them talk a little less. But there they are--lips flappin' at you, slowing down the gameplay.You can't even pick which NPCs you'd like to play with or against. In the Sierrra version, I always picked Elayne as my Canasta or Euchre partner. That tough-as-nails NYC girl was a wicked player in some games.I still can't, in good conscience, recommend this game--unless I wanted to torture you ... with banality ... and make you hate me ... like, for years ... while you burned me in effigy over a black candle ... naked ... at midnight ... under a full moon ... after sacrificing a goat.----Compared to the version done by Sierra many years ago, this game is flat. Sierra's version had a wonderfully rich set of characters who were fun and engaging to play with.The characters in this version sound like badly synthesized text to speech. They have no personality. The elevator music ranges from odd to grating. It reminds me of the really bad MIDI files one could download years ago and sound just as bad. And who knew there were so many solitaire games! In that, I have to admit one gets their money's worth! *tongue squarely embedded in cheek*I get that they had to write this so it could be playable on a number of devices, hence its flat look. It just pales compared to past versions. Would that my old Sierra CD still work!Good effort. Just not a terribly interesting game."

It's of the quality that even EA would probably be too embarassed to put in their 'on the house' section, but again, it's a collection of card games, so....Don't get your tightie whities in a bunch about that: it's card games, and it goes relatively deep.  It has dozens of different solitares, kiddie classics like go fish and crazy 8s, amongst more complex ones such as bridge, hearts, pinnocle, gin rummy, and quite a few others i haven't heard of or delved in to.There's a lot of unwarranted negging about it, but those complaining solely about the price, you're 100% correct.  The only problem with this collection is it's WAY overpriced. I bought it on sale for 6 bucks, and even that much made me raise an eyebrow after i opened it for the first time.  It really should be a 5 dollar game that goes half off once in a while.If you like to have a no brainer timesuck card game sim in your library, this is the one, though i caution you to mind what you pay for it.  Certainly not worth 20 bucks."

There is no interaction between you and the other players.  You cannot create your own characters.  All these characters talk in a monotone and the joy and enthusiasm that was in the previous version of Hoyle Cards is absolutely gone.  I don't believe you can say this is an updated version at all!

They're version is  as unrefined as the first product that came out way back in 2003 and is a complete rip off at 22 dollars. Steam  should hold there suppliers accountable as the product demo states that it took all the best of the Hoyle games from the last 10 years and made this product. A complete and out right lie!

I just bought this pack this morning and took a quick look at it. The spiderette solitaire seems to work the same as previous versions. Looking at some of the others it seems they took the logic and RNG from the last version (pre-steam, by Encore I think) and used that engine for this game.So what's different. The windows are given the windows 8 treatment for colour and style.  They took a sampling of previous games and included them. The face creator creates creepy faces. There is a selection midi music. The backgrounds, card faces, and card backs are okay but bland and don't seem to have any common theme going to match them together by color or style.In terms of recreational card play, I think this game is the same as previous version.The look and style is bland but varied. The entertaining characters are gone.  So with sound off and my own music going this makes a reasonable coffee break game.3 of 5 stars."

Unfortunetly the bridge game only plays sometimes. Very disappointed that my 83 year old mom pays for a card collection game set just to get the bridge game and it only works on occasion. Maybe your company should not sell this product when some of the games do not work. I have read other reviews as well so I know it's not just the bridge game. I definitely do not recommend this collection to anyone unless the program is fixed.

Now that you have widescreen active, I am thrilled to once again play a few hands of Canasta, Cribbage, solitaire, etc.  I do understand you cannot use the old Sierra characters and program, but you have brought a diverse range of characters to the table, but the voices seem all too similar.The amount of games is acceptable, though I do miss Black Jack.  There are a few new games added as well.I am also glad to see the absence of the Hoyle Bucks, and the ability to change backgrounds and card backs.  Now, we need the ability to choose (or block) specific characters.  Personally, I find Satch's voice way too effeminate and annoying.  It's worth it to have a bunch of my favorite games back."

Not a patch on previous versions.The card faces are either not clear enough or very heavy, and there are no definite edges to the cards which cause them to meld together in a very eyestraining way.The overall game colours are garish and not properly defined, and no, it's not the fault of my pc.There are so many faults with this game that to list them all would be an undertaking for a wet weekend when you are broke, and feeling particularly depressed.Please take note..... this is a terrible game and easily the worst version Hoyle have ever produced. To be frank, even if it were free I wouldn't bother."
,Not Recommended,397420,31500285,Posted: 1 May,all,BasicJewel,"So, I had this game in my wishlist, even though it had not-so-good reviews. I waited until it went on sale to buy it, and that was the right decision. I am an avid card game player. I LOVE PLAYING CARDS! I loved that it had so many games that you could play, but there were too many small details that just urked me. From the other players being rude, to the way the cards were ordered. I also feel that the graphics of the game could have been a lot better.I thought that despite the negative reviews, maybe I would like it anyways and that the others were just too picky. But, they were all right lol. Even the face creater. Horrible. I didn't even think I would care. If you want to try it..you may be one of the people that aren't affected by any of the fine details of this game. I am too picky in the way I like my cards ordered and the play style. I just would not recommend this to anyone. You're better off using apps for your phone or the windows store."
,Not Recommended,397420,26223684,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,Blech,"Mostly an OK game, but the AI needs serious work. For example- Canasta. The AI is a friggin joke. They hoard wild cards like they are rare and precious jewels and won't use them even when they could have gone out or made canastas multiple hands ago.I stopped counting the number of times we could have gone out if only the AI would make a Canasta with a wild card, Then you have the times that it would meld with the exact card that was just placed on the pile which would have allowed our team to pick it up, but choose NOT to pick up the pile while melding with that exact same card and then the next player would immediately pick up the pile and score a huge number of points.And then you have the times that the AI instead of throwing low value cards like 5 pointers, it would discard higher cards which were sure to allow another player to make a meld. Whoever designed the AI for this game either didn't care, or has never played Canasta in their life.There is nothing more frustrating than watching hand after hand be lost and be forced to discard card after card that you could have melded or played with, to eventually get what is needed and go out to find the 7 or 8 cards your partner is holding are mostly wild cards.The AI issue happens in other games where you are playing with a partner as well, so it is extremely frustrating. My 10 year old can play Canasta with more logic and strategy than the AI can.The other thing is the voices are beyond annoying. The chat comments from the computer players is irritating.Not sure I would put this as recommended- especially since I paid full price for it. If isn't bad if  want to be able to play different card games or learn how to play new ones, as long as you don't mind being frustrated and knowing you will need to turn the volume off so you don't have to hear the stupid dinosaur, dog, and sasquatch talk."

Traditional bridge bidding is non-existent.  The bidding reminds me of 4 people who just met on the bus and decided to meet in the park (""Harry'll bring the beer!!"") to play some bridge which, by the way, none has ever played before.   Did the person who added this game to the Hoyle packet decide that all the bidding conventions were too complicated to program into the game so he/she just didn't bother?  Perhaps you are interested in the other card games....."
