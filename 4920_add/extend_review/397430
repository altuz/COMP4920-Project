,Recommended,397430,18736196,"Posted: 28 October, 2015",all,chris_kicks,This game is exactly how I remember it. And that's a good thing. Zoombinis is about a group of refugees who look for home on a new land. You get to meet many racist locals who discriminate you based on your appearance and  you can work as a slave by making countless pizzas for an insufferable anthropomorphic tree stump. 10/10. Highly recommended.

The Zoombinis had to make it to a better life, and it was my responsibility to save them, no matter what absurd logic-based contrivances blocked our path.I'm sad to say some Zoombinis never made it, and were left waiting in the uncomfortable cells of treehouse campsites for a rescue that never arrived.Until today.

There are 12 puzzle levels revolving around discovering patterns and logic, where you must take the Zoombinis through their path. You can also change the difficulty of the puzzles, if you find it too easy or too hard.It's a nice casual game, nothing special, but still fun to play for kids and people of all ages."

,Not Recommended,397430,19299071,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,NinjaDuckie,"I played this, or rather, the original game, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis, when I was very young, and I can remember absolutely adoring every moment of it. I still have the CD! I tried to install it on Windows 7 and you can only get so far before the graphics card just errors out and displays everything in inverted colours or worse.This remake, while close to what a Zoombinis game ought to be, is not what I had hoped it would be.While the graphics have been updated to a very high degree and the animations have been redrawn etc for all the characters, and allowed for proper resolutions higher than 640 x 480, the charm of that delightful original game has sadly been lost, and that's really what I wanted to see again. It's a shame because the graphical update is simply fantastic, and the inclusion of the ridiculously enthusiastic announcer and other voice and musical content from the original game is spot-on. However, there's just no charm to it any more.The Zoombinis themselves move at the pace of a crippled snail - it's become a chore just to watch them move to the next place - and there's no sound for their footsteps like in the original. Zoombinis with feet would have steps, the wheels would make engine noises, springs... spring noises. When they ride the rollercoaster in the crystal caverns, they would yell out 'wahey' or 'yippee' on a successful run, and it just felt so lively and excitable.The issue with the charm of the graphical update is that the Zoombinis themselves suffer from the TV Tropes entry ""Conspicuously Light Patch"". This is where, because of their drawn style, they stand out way too much from the beautifully drawn backgrounds, as the obviously only animated figures, whereas in the original, they had lighter outlines and shades to match the background, like they were meant to be there. Here they stand out so much it's almost painful to look at.What's ACTUALLY painful to look at is when the Zoombinis walk over a patch of the background that's actually in the foreground. In the original game, at the Crystal Caverns, it was possible to see the mine-cart Zoombini travel behind the supporting struts of the track. In this release, the characters are always, without fail, on the topmost layer of the foreground. It's particularly noticeable because of the way they stand out so much from the background, too.The worst thing about the game is the hotspots. Good luck trying to enter your name on the very first screen of the game. I couldn't until I restarted the game in windowed mode. Perhaps resolution plays into it too. I'm not sure. I just know that you will have issues clicking on certain things.At least Mudball Wall survived. ... well, partially. As I said, the Zoombinis' walking speed cripples the pace of the game when you have to wait 20 seconds each for them to get into position. Maybe I'm being nitpicky. The puzzles are sound and, well - puzzling! Especially on the harder difficulties. It's a decent game; I do recommend Zoombinis. But I personally wouldn't recommend this specific remake. If you can find a copy of the original and install it without issues, do that instead."

I really appreciate the retention of the original sounds though. Unfortunately I ran into way too many bugs, especially on the last two levels(crystal mirrors and bubble abyss). The algorithm for the abyss is flawed, sometimes it's impossible to get all your zoombinis through in one go. And the mirrors are so glitchy when you try to move them sometimes. There's also a stark lack of instructions for the puzzles, especially on the harder levels there's basically no idication of what you're supposed to do, even as someone who played it before I had trouble figuring it out.Despite this it's still great, really challenging but fun."

76561198117013866,Recommended,397430,30092418,Posted: 21 February,all,KewlNerd20X6,"-DISCLAIMER-I'm going to talk about this game assuming you've played the original version and I won't be going over the gameplay that much.At it's heart, this game is the original ""Logical Journey of the Zoombinis"" with new and/or smoothed out graphics. Given how fantastic an edu-tainment game the original was, you'd think that all that and more would make this game the superior version. In my opinion......it's not......or at least it isn't yet.Probably the most noticable change to people who played the original game is the redesign of the Zoombinis themselves, as well as that of the backgrounds. All of the backgrounds have been redrawn, and overall, they look really cool! As for the Zoombinis have more of a horizontal oval shape as opposed to the original egg shape, and their features have been redrawn to look either better, or completely different. I think they look pretty cute this way, and it would be a great change if they blended in with everyone else! Although the Zoombinis have been redesigned, every other character in the game has been ripped from the original and they had their pixels smoothed out. Even though the nostalgia factor from this is nice, they feel very out of place when viewed next to the Zoombinis, especially considering that they didn't even bother to give the characters any new frames of animation to make them look smoother. In fact, in some cases, it appears the animation has gotten worse! In the original game's puzzle with the frogs, the frogs had very neat authentic looking hopping animations. In this version, their animations have been dumbed down so that they just kinda move to each lilypad.I'll spare you the other aesthetic errors I've found as they are relatively minor. honestly, my biggest complaint is that this version is actually very glitchy. I've run into puzzles where I'd let go of the mouse and my Zoombini would just hang in the air, forcing me to leave it behind and ruining my perfect runs. As far as I can tell, the game is just a port of the original with new graphics. How did they manage to screw that up? To be fair, it's been a long time since I've played the original, so it could have been just as glitchy as this game is, butit doesn't make it any less frustrating. if the original did have the glitches, then this would have been a great opprotunity to fix them.However, at the end of the day, I really didn't regret getting this version of the game that much. Again, at it's heart, it's the original game with really good new/revamped graphics. All of the puzzles are the same as before and all of the great voice acting from the narrator to the pizza trolls is still there. If you haven't played the original and wanna give it a shot, this is probably a good way to do it! I give the game an 8/10.In conclusion...Hip hip! ZOOMBIIIIIINIIIIIII!!!!!"

Somehow, despite 14 years passing since the last time I touched this game, I am still filled with a dark souls-esque level of frustration during the later difficulties. Still, often, due to my own impatience and hubris. But don't worry; it's a good thing. This is truly a game that children and adults can both play, and find mentally stimulating. Well done.That said.

Kept me entertained longer than I dare to admit. When I saw this on steam I felt so happy to see it once again, and that other people loved it as much as i did and wanted to put work in and transfer it to a modern platform, I was not disappointed and its still as good now when i first played it many years ago.This is the best educational game you could ever buy if you have children and honestly without this game i would not be who and where i am as an adult.Most Educational games are boring, but this is one of a kind, thinking back i remember the excitement i got from figuring out how to get my blue little friends to safety, the constant positive reinforcement. But now I think back the logical and mathimatical skills created and trained with out even knowing it are priceless.Parents with young children, this could quite easily be the best game you will let your kids play.

Years went by, then I suddenly remembered, and wondered if I would ever get the chance to play it again. Enter TERC, who have released this remake of the original title, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis (1996).  Yes, this is a game for children, but I so happened to play this game for years as a kid. Due to that, I just had to purchase this title upon immediately seeing it had released.From an adult perspective, the puzzles aren't too challenging, but you may not know what to do straight off the bat. From there, it won't take too long to figure out. If a child is playing this (depending on their age bracket), I'm sure they'll spend a decent amount of time on each puzzle, probably asking for assistance along the way - I know I did when I was younger. Hopefully they'll learn a thing or two along the way. And, if it gets too easy, there are various difficulty settings you can bump the game up to.The developers of this remake have kept to the games roots in terms of the audio, with the dialogue, score, and sound effects remaining the same from the original game. It's definitely noticeable, however it's a nice throwback and it adds to the nostalgia. From the visual side of things, the game has received a nice graphical upgrade.I probably won't play this for lengthy periods of time at once, but I will boot it up for when I want to remember those good times as a kid. I don't remember completing this game as a child, so it'll be nice to go back and achieve that.This is a charming and well made remake. Kudos to TERC."

I am here to tell you that they might actually be BETTER than I remembered. The game adjusts its difficulty based on how well you are doing. The puzzles are all different and interesting. At higher difficulties, these puzzles can still push even a full grown adult's mind and make you really work for those victories.And the zoombinis themselves are still adorable and REALLY excited to have some help getting to Zoombiniville.

Honestly I bought this with the intention of using it as a substitute for Solitaire.Playing the journey mode starts with easy as the only difficulty but if you prove how pro you are instead of slacking about the difficulty will pick up and you can't turn it back down.If the fourth difficulty over the entire map still isn't good enough for you then at least you only have maybe 5 more pilgrimages to go for the ending.Some seem to find the narrator insulting but I find him kind of funny when he's being overenthusiastic.  He's like one of those uncles that makes a laughingstock of himself for their 4 year old niece or something.I'm not sure what to say on story but at least we have fun characters where they could have just put cardboard cutouts enforcing the puzzles.
,Recommended,397430,19314463,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,kantra19,"I'm back in Elementary School. The graphics look a bit better and it plays well on the Mac. It also gets difficult rather quickly, despite being what should be a comparatively simple puzzle game. I'm only on the second difficulty in some areas and that's pretty tough. Maybe I just never saw this, but I don't remember there being a specified number of zoombinis you had to rescue from their first home, as in there are like 400, I think, to start with, and every saved bunch decreases that number until, presumably, 0. I remember the part where you can see how many zoombinis you save and there's a limited number you travel with for each journey, but I don't remember it having an end goal of rescuing ALL the zoombinis. I seem to recall it was just an infinite number of them. So I like that change. I don't know what happens when you've rescued them all. Probably just game complete. They also - from what I can recall - added some minor animation in Zoombiniville. As you rescue more zoombinis, you can see buildings appear. More huts show up. I think they also added some brand new buildings.I have found a bug. The crystal chamber glitches out sometimes - I can't pick up new zoombinis, although I can pick up new crystals and I can move to the next area, leaving behind the zoombinis I haven't tried to help. And even when the whole zoombini side isn't frozen, it's a pain to try and pick them up off the shelf.I do think that the ""help"" option is kind of silly. I understand the ""help"" of repeating what the narrator says so you can look at it, since that does occasionally give you a clue for what you're doing, but for most of the puzzles it is completely useless. The rock puzzle is essentially just keep guessing until you figure it out.  The hotel puzzle makes no sense whatsoever outside of easy difficulty, and gives you the least margin for learning error of all the puzzles in the game. There are no clues that I can find, whatever the help says about ""you have all the information you need to solve the puzzle"".There are a few UI issues. I don't think you can change the difficulty manually, like I remember doing when this was a CD game, which is incredibly frustrating. I like the puzzles outside of the hotel puzzle, and if I could just lower the difficulty for that one to bypass it, I would use that route. As it is, I avoid the route entirely. I also don't see a way to skip through the mini cinematic stuff, like when a zoombini gets knocked off something when you screw up and they recover. You have to wait until they finish moving and whatever interacted with them finishes talking. This is incredibly frustrating on the rock troll puzzle, where you have to sit through dialogue after nearly every single move. There's also no way to know how many tries left you have on the rock troll puzzle. I have yet to lose any of my zoombinis on that, even on the hardest difficulty, so maybe it doesn't matter, but it's one of two puzzles where you can't visually tell how many tries you have left off the bat (the other being the boat puzzle). Tecnhically that's four, but you can learn how many tries you have on the pizza puzzle pretty easily, and the same is true for the other one.I also have no idea what was behind making a rock troll in a game for Elementary School students say ""move it toots"" to what essentially a blue pebble with legs of some kind. It's the only problematic dialogue I can think of in the game and it is so incredibly random.Overall it's a nice nostalgia trip. Maybe a nice puzzle game for children. Wait till it's on sale, though."

,Recommended,397430,18738393,"Posted: 28 October, 2015",all,Techbane,"Perhaps the crowning achievement of Broderbund and the edutainment genre -- shortly before it collapsed into shovelware limbo -- Zoombinis is a pretty simple title designed to teach kids puzzle-based pattern recognition and analytical thinking. It's basic enough for an eight-year old but has enough foundation and staying power to still be a fun diversion to me two decades later. The difficulty scales up gradually the more Zoombinis you manage to get from start to finish, to the point where things get legitimately REALLY DIFFICULT to solve. Now if only we could get Alien Tales the modern treatment!As far as port jobs go, this one seems pretty bang-up at first glance, but the threads start to show under closer scrutiny.+ Everything's redrawn for HD support while staying pretty faithful to the original.+ All the old voices and music clips are there in their 90's low-fi glory.+ Seems reasonably well optimized and stable.~ Newly redrawn scenery has bizarre choices of colour pallette, apparently in the name of making things seem less cheery and more adventurous. Some of them are pretty nice, at least.- No manual or instructions for any of the games.- Apart from the Zoombinis themselves, most of the other character sprites are clearly low-effort traces of the original animation cels.- Loads of sound effects missing.- Titanic Tattooed Toads, which was already the weakest point of the game, is now drawn out AND lacking almost any animation.- Some pretty serious glitches, like difficulty never advancing, not being able to interact with the Zoombinis on Mirror Machine, and Bubblewonder Abyss generating unsolvable layouts.- English is the only spoken language available, where the original was typically also available in French and German. This may not be of huge significance to those playing it for nostalgia, but the game was a great incentive as part of a second-language curriculum for children and now that aspect is gone.That being said, the underlying framework holds up well and it's a nice nostalgia trip that I would recommend. I just hope it gets some much-needed patching."

I remember playing this game on the computers in my third grade classroom whenever it was recess on a rainy day. Zoombinis a puzzle strategy game where you must guide a heard of blue innocent creatures called Zoombinis to a safe haven called Zoombiniville (great name). Each puzzle is a point-and-click as you spend the game thinking about how to apporach each puzzle without putting any of your Zoombinis in harms way. Think of it as a kiddie watered-down version of Lemmings without the stress of keeping track of every single member in your heard. Each puzzle gets more complex as your progress and after carrying one heard all the way to their safe haven you must direct the next group down that same path. To avoid repetition and boredom the game has branching paths  where you can choose the sets of puzzles you want to complete and this makes solving these puzzles more worthwhile. The game is also nice enough to increase the difficulty by the time you've done at least one or two runs of a certain path. There's even a practice mode to help train you on the puzzles that give you some trouble. The game's graphics have also been enhanced from the original game's format. I like how some of backdrops looks like paintbrush strokes. This game can help anyone improve their critical thinking skills if they spend enough time learning the ropes. $15 isn't a bad price, but if possible, wait until the Steam sales for a price cut. The game provides enough otherworldly, but relaxing atmosphere that makes brings out that springtime joy. If you haven't played this game before, try it out! You might like it."

The main reason being that they either A: Hold the players hand through the whole thing, resulting in the player not learning anything. B: Are boring to the point where just playing the game is tedious. Or C: Don't keep a player invested enough to get the most out of the game.Zoombinis however avoids each of these issues. For the first problem I listed, most games feel the need to make the puzzles they provide insultingly easy or outright give the answer to the player, Zommbinis however will only give the player what they need to complete the puzzle and nothing more. Leaving the player to figure things out for themselves.As for the second problem, most educational games feature bland enviroments, characters, and very bland music. Zoombinis avoids this by delivering beutiful enviroments that feel alive, characters that have actual personalities, and music that you will remember for years. (I know I did)As for the final problem, most educational games don't offer much in terms of variety, often times players are met with the same puzzle over and over again. Zoombinis however avoids this by having each puzzle be different, and even in some puzzles that feel similar to each other like the Allergic Cliffs and the Stone Cold Caves, have something that sets them apart from each other. Not only that but due to the games steady difficulty curve the game stays fresh for far longer than most.However while I will continue to praise this game for being such a masterpiece among educational games, it does have its flaws much like every game.For one, the game does become boring after you've saved a couple dozen zoombinis, and some puzzles on the higher difficulties can prove very difficult, even for some adults. However apart from those flaws, everything else is just nit picking.All in all, I strongly believe that Zoombinis is one of the finest games for any child and adult. The game is fun and beneficial to children but can provide a welcoming challenge for adults. Personally, I give zoombinis a full 10/10."

I can barely play for longer than 20 minutes before I get bored. Also, I've experienced glitches with the mirror puzzle on Very, Very Hard in which the images displayed on the crystal for the first Zoombini is what it wouldv'e been for the second zoombini.  Overall a good game though."
