,Recommended,397460,18669112,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,daveydweeb,"We host parties every month or so, and tend to have two groups of people show up - my friends, who are mostly gamers, and my partner's, who mostly aren't. We have a pair of TVs set up in the lounge for mine to play on at these parties, and the rest tend to play Cards Against Humanity or socialise elsewhere in the house.I was immediately impressed by how quickly both groups sat down in the lounge to give the Jackbox a go when I first bought it yesterday. We started with a round of Fibbage 2, which was loud, funny and silly enough for everyone to feel comfortable giving it a go without having to feel like they were joining the 'gamer' half of the crowd. Since you're controlling the games from your phone, nobody has to feel like they're out of their comfort zone with an Xbox controller or constantly waiting for a turn with a gamepad. Both the gamers and non-gamers in the group were able to play together, which is a really hard trick to pull off.The games in the pack are varied enough to keep things interesting, and none of them are disappointing. I will say, though, that while the bomb disposal game is still pretty hilarious and engaging, it is a LOT harder than the others - the story mode is purely cooperative, and it can be a lot harder for less engaged players to feel like they're contributing. It also supports fewer players, which ended up cutting our playtime short in favour of the other titles.I tried really hard to find a deal on this game before I picked it up, but I'm pretty happy with the $25 I paid for it in the end. We're going to be cracking it out again in the future, and it's a safe and reliable option for crowds who aren't necessarily full of gamer types."

Then I stumbled across Jackbox and fell in love with Quiplash and Fibbage. I decided to put the games to the test during a birthday party I held this past Feburary, and it went fantastically. I played the game with 7 other people, and the game functioned flawlessly. The game was hilarious, and I've gotten oh-so-many inside jokes out of some of the games we've played in the pack.A few months later, I thought about hosting another party, and what came across my mind? Jackbox. I thought that I simply got lucky the first time and that the second experience would be repetitive. Alas, I was wrong, the party felt completely brand new, with exciting new prompts and new inside jokes. Overall, I think this pack takes the cake for the most fun party game you could play at a party.TLDR;Visuals: 10/10Concept: 10/10Functionality: 8/10Fun: 10/10Quiplash: 10/10Fibbage: 10/10Earwax: 9/10Bomp Corp: 8/10Bidiots: 6/10"

Fibbage is a really welcome holdover from the first pack (one of the two best games), Earwax seemed ridiculous at first but is actually really funny (have more than three people though), Quiplash XL is hilarious (again, you need more than three people for this one), and Bomb Corp is AMAZING. The one I was disappointed with (as were the other people I've played with) is Bidiots. It seems to take too long and isn't as fun compared to the rest of the games."

I think Earwax may be our new favourite! This is designed to be played locally, and it's great fun if you can arrange to meet up and play. It can be played over Twitch, but it can be difficult to set up, so just make sure you can actually play it before buying. It's totally worth your time if you can get the group together though!"

All the owner of the pack has to do is choose which game to play and everyone in the room connects to the game with their phones by going to Jackbox.tv and entering the room code that appears on the game screen.  This party pack is even better to play in parties if you connect your computer to a TV monitor.  Additionally, if you want to play online, al the owner has to do is stream the game and then viewers can play by connecting with their phones.All of the games in this pack are absolutely hilarious!  The rules are simple so it's easy for everyone to understand - even for non-gamers.  It's a great party game for adults especially with certain prompts like, ""Premature Ejaculation"" and ""A Classic Video Game Turned into an Adult Series"".  Just about all of these games get fun pretty quick.  Alcohol is definitely recommended while playing this to ensure more hilarity."

,Recommended,397460,30480967,Posted: 12 March,all,SolumnMushroom,"The first Jackbox Party Pack was a blast, and it's sequel is even better.  Using the same netcode as the first game, this version I recommend more than the first game.Fibbage 2 has more questions, a lifeline, and audience integration for parties with more than 8 people.  Also, it's Fibbage.  Enough said.I have not been able to convince people to play Bomb Corps.,  Earwax, or Bidiots with me, so I can't say much about them.My personal highlight of this pack is Quiplash XL.  The game has you responding to prompts, then voting on said responces.  This is a game where having an audience can make all the difference, as many can attest to.Overall, this pack is a big step up from the first one, however it may not be for everyone.  There is a much greater emphasis on audience participation, most notably through the livestreaming service Twitch.tv.  It's still fun locally, but the intended buyer for this game is someone who both has parties, and streams to Twitch.  Oh, who am I kidding?  Buy it for Quiplash and Fibbage."

,Recommended,397460,28522727,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,ItsLeAshton,"Ah, Party Pack 2, Easily earns the #1 Spot in order of favorite pack out of the three. This pack's filled with gems, and honestly, there are more games that I'd give a higher rating here than in 3 and 1 combined. Each and every game in this pack gets a high rating from me. Let's begin, shall we?Bidiots - 9.3/10 - Bidiots is my 3rd Favorite Game made by Jackbox, with first being Tee K.O, and 2nd being You Don't Know Jack. Bidiots is an absolutely hilarious take on art auctions. I have no clue what I'm doing, and neither does anyone else I play with, but it is oddly very competitive and addicting. Draw 2 Drawings based on silly prompts you're given (much like Drawful), and then let the auction commence! Each person has an art professional on their team that will tell them three paintings worth a big sum of cash. But since this is Jackbox, you've gotta try and guess which of those paintings you're seeing at the moment, or if you're not seeing a valuable one. Are they saying the beer bottle painting is worth a good sum of cash? Haven't seen a beer bottle and you're over halfway done? Shucks man, that beer bottle you're looking for could've been that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥looking painting you didn't bid for 10 minutes ago! We're not done yet though. The host has a hilarious British accent, this game takes the Screws from You Don't Know Jack which you can use once per game, forcing the person you use it on to bid on artwork. Best of all, there is a loanshark company in this game with the catchiest jingle you've ever heard. Dammit Jackbox, I played this game for the first time in December, and I still have the Predatory Loans Jingle in my head! Anyway, this is an absolute masterpiece, and it takes the cake for this pack with Earwax JUST behind.Earwax - 9.2/10 - Earwax is incredible. Your goal in earwax is to take turns judging the other players on the sound combinations they choose. You're given silly prompts such as ""What ItsLeAshton does in the morning."", and ""Batman on the toilet."", and you're given about 8 Sounds at random to choose from. You must choose a combination of 2 sounds that fit the prompt the most. There are over 500 Prompts, and at least a good 150 Sounds. The first to 3 Points wins. The gameplay itself is one thing, but the biggest thing that gives this game such a high rating in my book is the incredible replay value. I could replay this game for MONTHS and not get bored of it, and I feel that everyone I've played with could easily say the same thing. This game leaves me redfaced due to laughing lots as well. Laughter IS the Best Medicine. If you want to live a long life, play Earwax or any other Jackbox Party Game. A gem of the pack for sure.Fibbage 2 - 8.6/10 - I will not go into too much detail here, as I've already stated tons about Fibbage during my Fibbage XL Review for Jackbox Party Pack 1, but Fibbage 2 is basically an upgrade with more questions, a few jingles, and Defibrilator, which allows you to narrow your choices to have a better chance at guessing the truth.Quiplash XL - 8.0/10 - Quiplash is a genius game. Quiplash XL includes all of the prompts from the original Quiplash, the Quiplash DLC, AND over 100 More! In Quiplash, you're given 2 prompts such as ""Make up a swear word."", ""A good reason to travel back in time to 2 weeks ago."" and ""A great use for a spaghetti noodle."". One other person will get the same prompts as you, and after everyone is done filling out their prompts, everyone's answers to the prompts will be pitted against each other and everyone votes on the funniest answer. It is the first Jackbox Game I discovered, and is still one of my favorites. It has a great replay value, and tons of hilarious prompts, AND a hilarious host, Josh Schmitty Schmittenstein.Bomb Corp. - 6.0/10 - Bomb Corp is honestly the most unique Jackbox Game there is. It has a storyline. You are an intern at Bomb Corp, a Bomb Making Company, and you have many problems to face. Start with defusing bombs, then filing explosive cabinets, then defusing bombs with manuals written by CHILDREN, then solving explosive keypads, then making coffee, then fixing a copy machine, and THEN delivering an ALIEN BABY! This game is really amazing, and has a comedy line the whole way through just like You Don't Know Jack that keeps you reeled in."

,Recommended,397460,28865975,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,RANVEERA CHINGAAH,"Me and my Skype friends love playing Jackbox Games. We are now pleased to have The Party Pack 1, 2 and 3 in our collection of things to enjoy doing together.As with the original Party Pack, all of these games are played with shared view of the host's display, using smartphones or other input devices to play through jackbox.tv. Only one player, the host, needs to own the game.Quiplash XLThe most reliable stand-by and favourite of my group. Players are provided with two prompts and write responses to them, and each prompt is given to two different players. Then, each prompt is displayed and all other players, plus members of an audience if you have one, vote on which answer was better. Get all the votes for a Quiplash and extra points. In the final round, everyone is given the same prompt and has three votes they can give to anyone else's answers. Unfortunately, some of the prompts occasionally leave us uninspired and bored.Fibbage 2Just like the original, but with a new set of ridiculous trivia knowledge. Make up something to fill the blank in the bizarre fact, and compete with other players to be the most convincing and guess the truth.BidiotsIt took us a while to figure out how this worked, but it has become a favourite. At the beginning of the game, everyone draws two pictures from given titles which will be content for the game. One at a time, pictures will come up available for auction, and each has a hidden value for which it will be resold after the auction. You will know the value of three art pieces... But only by title. You have to guess which picture is which. When someone else buys a picture you drew, you get half the money for it. Aside from that, you can take out loans from Predatory Loans, an unscrupulous bank with a bucketload of absolutely hilarious marketing jingles. This will give you more money to bid with, but you pay 150% back at the end of the game when you collect the money from your sales.The presentation of the game is amusing, and it plays awful tricks - the titles of different works are very often designed to produce images that could be confused with each other.Bomb CorpA tangled logic puzzle for up to four players which clearly takes inspiration from Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. In this game, each player has clues about how to disarm a bomb, and one or more have the buttons they can push to do so. Instructions become more convoluted as you progress through the ""days"" of your story as a bomb diffusing intern, and will begin overriding one another. This game accomodates smaller groups, but the intellectual challenge is awesome if you have a few friends who like logic puzzles and are feeling alert. The balance between taking enough time not to make a mistake, and going quickly enough to beat the timer is a tough one to hit. The extra time you didn't take in the challenges is your score at the end of the day.EarwaxProbably the weakest showing in this party pack, at least for us. Each round, whoever is judging chooses one of the game's prompts, as you might in Fibbage. Each player is then presented with titles for a bunch of sound effects and has to choose two of them to respond to the prompt. You don't get to hear the sounds before you select them, so the outcome can be surprising. The judge then chooses which combination fits the prompt best. First person to three points wins. It's not a bad game, but is somewhat less involved than the others and has a degree of randomness."

,Recommended,397460,35119988,Posted: 21 September,all,Black Bean Salsa,"I bought the first game on a Steam Sale, but loved it so much that I bought the second one at full price. Definitely worth it. If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just ""look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code."" I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage.PLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.This one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Fibbage 2, and Quiplash XL are THE games you need, though.Fibbage 2 is one of the games you're buying this for. It's like the original, but it just feels more well made and tightly focused. It's a trivia game at it's heart, but the questions are less ""fact heavy"" and much more obscure/funny. Sometimes someone will know the answer, but most of the time you're guessing. After everyone has sent in a guess (or the time limit goes off), the game presents a list of options to pick from, which are composed of everyone's responses mixed in with the answer. If someone pick your guess, you get points. If you pick the right answer, you get a lot of points. That means you can win for being convincing with your answer, rather than actually knowing it. Really, really fun game.Earwax is pretty good, but I've noticed it's a love-it-or-hate-it type of game. Basically, every round a new person will select a prompt from a provided list on their phone. Then, the announcer gives everyone that prompt and each player is given a list of sound byte titles to pick from. You have to select two sound bytes to play sequentially, then the person who picked the prompt will pick whoever the winner is. For example, if the prompt was ""What really happened at Roswell..."", you might want to pick ""Man saying 'Hello!'"" and ""Laser noises."" You can either be funny or try to be accurate, it depends on who is picking the answers.Bidiots is like Pictionary, except everyone has to ""bid"" on everyone's drawings. It's honestly a little confusing, but it's not terrible. You're given a prompt and have to make a drawing for it using your touchscreen, but you're also given a list of drawings you need to buy, which are really the other players' prompts. The drawings are put up for bidding and you have to pick out the right drawings based on your list of things to buy. You can also outbid other people just to spite them. If you want a Pictionary type game, though, buy Jackbox Party Pack 1 to get Drawful. or just buy the standalone Drawful 2.Quiplash XL is the second game you're buying this for. At the start of the game, everyone gets two prompts that they have to make up a response for. Prompts could be like ""A sitcom where two pairs of twins marry each other"" or ""Titanic 2: _______"". The catch is that one other player has your same prompt, and everyone is going to vote on the best response of the two. You get points based on the number of votes you get. Sounds simple, but that's why it's so good. It's probably the most approachable Jackbox game.Bomb Corp. is a more team-oriented game. One player is presented with a series of wires and a time limit, while the others are given a manual for how to defuse the bomb.

,Not Recommended,397460,19031022,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,EdenCrow,"As I said inmy review for the first game, The Jackbox Party Pack is a wonderful idea for a party game. Unfortunately, the second pack is mostly disappointing.My most immediate gripe is that it is such a shame to see this as a separate game, as opposed to DLC for the first party pack. Switching between the two during an evening is an annoying waste of time and shows that the developers aren't particularly interested in creating a long-lasting product. After purchasing it was also disheartening to see that the main menu was less stylised than the moving game boxes from the first game. A small problem, yes, but it just comes across as a lack of effort.Moving onto the games themselves and it is clear that you and your friends will spend much less time with this selection of games than the last. Bidiots is too confusing and not gratifying enough to be a good party game. Bomb Corp also doesn't work well in this setting either, although when playing with just you and one friend it does have a small amount of fun to it. Talking of fun however, the rest of the games are more enjoyable. Unfortunately one of them is just more Fibbage. This does mean a wider selection of questions for those who love the game, but it is again sad to not see this as DLC for the first pack or integrated with Steam Workshop. The last of the games (Earwax and Quiplash) are the most enjoyable and fresh. However, they can both get repetitive more quickly. Earwax is fun to play to laugh at the silly sounds, but is rather lacking in real gameplay and Quiplash is perhaps too difficult to keep everyone laughing.After mostly having an absolute blast with Jackbox Party Pack 1, it would have been nice to have seen more work gone into new games. However, overall the sequel just doesn't put as much effort in as its older brother and still lacks DLC and Steam Workshop support. Such a disappointment.Read My Other ReviewsCheck Out My Curator Page"

76561197998825270,Not Recommended,397460,21717245,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,The Dorf,"As I did when I reviewed the original Jackbox Party Pack, I'm going to divide this review into several little mini-sections: one for each game in the pack. The Jackbox Party Pack 2 is at its core, the same concept as its predecessor - a bunch of multiplayer mini-games where your cell phones are the input devices. The novelty here is that because your phones are the input devices, no one knows who typed or drew what except for the author. So now on with the review:Fibbage 2This is exactly the same game as the first time around, but with new questions. The game presents you with a weird fact, and you have to fill in the blank to try to trick your opponents into guessing your answer. Still pretty much Balderdash if you've ever played that.EarwaxIn earwax, you're presented with a category or an event or some similar thing and you have to choose a sound effect to match what's presented.  Then two player's selections go head to head and a judge votes on which is the most appropriate sound effect. I thought this game was pretty weak and the selectable sound effects started to repeat with just two or three rounds of play. Disappointing.BidiotsThis was the strangest game in the pack. It seemed like an attempt to evolve on Drawful, which I believe to be the strongest game in the previous pack. In Bidiots, each player draws several art pieces based on several prompts. The pieces are assigned random monetary values, then players bid on each piece. Sometimes you'll be given clues to what a piece is worth based on the prompt that was used to draw it, but it's not always clear what prompt matches with what piece. And sometimes, you're not given a prompt at all. It turns one of the best games in the previous pack into one of the most unsatisfying experiences in Jackbox Party Pack 2. The rules are unclear and the games take way too long. The fun and silliness of drawing and guessing other's drawings turns into a boring bidding game. Bidiots was also a huge disappointment.Quiplash XLThis is pretty much Earwax but without the sound effects. Players type in responses to the game's prompts to fill in the blank, then a judge votes on the best one. Quiplash still seemed somewhat lazy to me but was slightly more enjoyable than Earwax, only because a freeform response seemed more creatively satisfying to me than picking from pre-defined sound effects.Bomb Corp.I'm not sure who worked on this game whether it be a different group internally or a secret different studio altogether or something, but this game is so different from the others in the pack, both in visual aesthetic and gameplay quality. This is definitely the highlight of Jackbox Party Pack 2. In Bomb Corp. , each player is given a crucial step to disarming a bomb on their phone, but all steps need to be followed in order to diffuse the bomb correctly. It's a really fun excersise in communication and cooperation as all players need to work together to diffuse the bomb properly. This game was pretty coolSummaryEven with the inclusion of the excellent Bomb Corp., The Jackbox Party Pack 2 was still a disappointment to me. Other than Bomb Corp., the pack felt like a rushed package with incomplete or creatively dull ideas resulting in unsatisfying gameplay experiences. The absense of the well-known ""You Don't Know Jack"" mini-game was puzzling as well. I'm not sure if they tried to rush this package out in order to capitalize on the success of the first game or what, but that's what it felt like. If you haven't played the games from the first Jackbox Party Pack, I'd strongly reccommend giving those a look first. But if you have, prepare yourself for a disappointmentFor more game reviews, check outhttp://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/"

Ill quickly go over each game.Fibbage 2 - Basically an expansion on Fibbage, players pit answers against a question and try and fool players into choosing their choice. 5/5Earwax - One player chooses a question and the other players choose 2 sound effects that would fit as answers. It's not great as sometimes you have sounds that have NO relevence and it just becomes awkward and stupid at that point. There are some a few good moments however. 2.5/5Bidots - Discount Drawful; draw pictures and then you go into a virtual auction and attempt to buy art with ""tips"" on which is worth the most amount of money. Boring and long. 1.5/5Quiplash XL - Great game if you have a bunch of people (4+).

While Part Pack 1 was carried mostly by Fibbage and Drawful for me, I feel that all of these games are superb in one way or another! I will be giving this game a score out of 20, with 4 points for each game seperately! These are in no particular order so lets get started!Bomb Corp:So I don't know how many of you have played the game Space Team on your phones, but this game is very similar to that game. In this game everyone recieves instructions on their phones about what wires to cut on a bomb that is on the screen, what instructions to ignore, what colors change and many more aspects. This is a very fast pased game and it is really fun to play with other who don't have much gaming experience because I feel that they will like this type of game seperatly compared to traditional video games.3.5/4Fibbage 2: I'm gonna be honest with this one. If they made the original perfect, than this game is beyond perfect for anyone! I'm sure that you have all heard of fibbage so I won't go into the details on what its about however there is a new rule to the game that might change up how you get some points. Its called the DeFibulator, and what this does is it narrows your choices down to 1 truth and 1 lie. I love this addition and it is a great way to mix up the gameplay, but keep it familiar so that veterans of this game will still have a lot of fun!4/4Earwax: Going into this pack I felt that this game would be worst game in the whole pack. I mean a game about sounds doesn't exactly sound like the most fun game to be honest. However, I'm glad to say that I was suprisingly wrong! This game is an absolute blast! Basically, its sort of like fibbage where someone chooses a prompt and each person answers on their device. However, in this game you try to form a small story by chosing two sounds from the six that you see on your device. Its clever, the sounds are really good and some of them are actually spot on to what they would sound like today, and I love that some of the prompts even bring in player interactions such as, ""The sound of Bob waking up in the morning."" Its a great edition that I'm really happy to say is one of our favorites!3/4Bidiots: Ladies and Gentlemen, the cousin of my favorite game from the last pack, Bidiots. If you remember from last pack, there was a drawing game called Drawful. It was a plesent game and it was really easy for the yonger audience to pick up on. However, it seems that they have completly switched up the forumla in this one and decided to go and make this game a bidding game. So Everyone starts out by drawing 2 drawings. Then the ""Auctioneer"" will auction off each and every drawing. Now the goal of this game is to have the most money by the end of the round, and the best way to make money is by buying art. Now the trick is to outbid everyone else, buut you don't want to go over the actual price of  what the painting is worth, because then you will lose money. You gain tips from your ""Art Buyers"" on your phone and they will tell you what to do relating to the current picture up on the TV. Its a clever game that has a lot of twists and turns. It is a little bit confusing at first, but other than that this game is a huge blast!! I do consider this game to be the weakest in the group, but all of the games are really fantastic in their own way, so I still love you bidiots!-2.75/4Quiplash XL: This is probably my favorite game in the bunch. Never have I seen so many laughs out of any game, and I love Quiplash because of this reason. So this game is compilled of three rounds (Just like Fibbage). Where you will be given two questions on your device and you will answer the questions with either funny, truthful, or down right stupid answers that will try to get the audience to vote for your choice. Once all of the responses have come in, then each of the questions will appear on the TV. Each question will have two answers and everyone will vote on their favorite answer and the players who answered the question will recieve points based on how many other players/spectators choose their answer. This game is absolutley amazing, and is by far the bset game in the batch!- 4/417.25+.5 for Spectator Mode on Fibbage, Quiplash, and Earwax+.5 for Family Friendly Mode on Fibbage, Quiplash, and Bidiots=___18.25/20I highly recommend this game. Its a great party pack and its a great way to have lots of laughs!"

Earwax was probably the one everyone thought was going to be the word spud of the group but in reality it is just as fun(ny) as all the others. Bomb corp. is a really fun and frantic gane where you and your buddies have several bombs to defuse, filing cabinets to sort, keypads to be figured out, and so much more, that everyone will enjoy it for years to come. Fibbage 2 is just as good as it was in the last installment with just as wacky categories to throw everyone off. Quiplash, the game where making an inside joke wins. Bidiots is the drawful of this party pack where everyone tries to buy a piece of art work for a lower price than listed. Overall the go-to party game for you and your friends!"

,Recommended,397460,21081605,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,✨ hex maniac emily ✨,"Fibbage 2: The gut-buster from the first Party Pack is back and better than ever! This trivia game for liars features some outrageously funny new facts — much more than the first Fibbage — and now your audience, whether it's your Twitch/Hitbox viewers or leftover partygoers, can join in on the fun too. The novelty might wear off once you start getting repeats, but that won't happen for a long while. 9/10Earwax: ""Cards Against Humanity but with sound effects"" is a cool concept, but ultimately it falls short. It's not that the sounds are bad, and the prompts are pretty good too. The problem is the execution. You're given six random sounds and you have to pick two to fit the prompt — without being able to listen to them. Sometimes you don't get anything that fits. Sometimes this happens for the entire game, and you feel like you had no chance from the start. Jackbox doesn't lend itself well to games of chance. Another point against it that it doesn't stream well on Twitch (Hitbox, given its lower stream delay, is fine), and if you're trying to play it with friends on Skype, forget it. 3.5/10Bidiots: Most people are calling this a worse Drawful. I respectfully disagree. ""Art auction"" seems like a bizarre concept for a party game, but Jackbox managed to pull it off. Each player gets two short descriptions that are eerily simular to everyone else's prompts. For instance, one player might get ""eel"" and ""getting a tan"", while another gets ""garter snake"" and ""needs sunscreen"". The challenge is figuring out which is which. It's honestly a lot more fun than it sounds, and I'm sorry that I can't describe it any better. 8.5/10Quiplash XL: Quiplash is the best game that Jackbox has ever released. Yes, even better than any of the You Don't Know Jack games. Even with repeat prompts, you'll practically never run out of things to say. It's a freeform Cards Against Humanity, and it succeeds in places where CAH doesn't — namely, you get to make your own jokes, which is perfect both for people who don't like vulgar humor and for those who want to kick it up a notch. 10/10Bomb Corp: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but not as good. Sure, there are extra twists to it, but it just feels too similar (and inferior) to its direct competitor. Fun for a bit, but ultimately a dud. 4.5/10OVERALL: 7.5/10 (average score: 7.1/10). Three hits and two misses, but there's more than enough here to justify the $25 price tag."

Grab some friends and indulge in pure comedic genius in video game form.Fibbage: A quasi-trivia game where you have to make convincing answers to trivia questions for your friends to pick, and then try to parse through the lies to find the truth. A personal favorite.Quiplash: Each player is given two prompts, and they have to try to make a funnier answer than the player with the same prompt. The other players have to vote on which of the responses they find funnier, and the responders get points depending on how many people voted for theirs. More fun with more people, and ideal for streaming, but still fun no matter the occasion. Except funerals. Probably in bad taste there.Earwax: Quiplash with one prompt, one judge which changes each round, and, most importantly, audial responses. Not as good as the former two, but it can be fun for a few rounds.Bidiots: Each player draws a few paintings, and then players bid for them depending on what they think they are. Not as good as Drawful before it, and definitely the weakest of the bunch.Bomb Corp: The only co-operative or single-player game of the bunch. Players need to work together to defuse perplexing bombs by cutting wires according to certain rules. Essentially Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, except more thinking-based and with a less complicated manual. In other words, a riot."

Sometimes when the overheat button is on, meaning dont touch anything or you lose, it never goes away, which means you just lost and have to restart. Then, on Day 15, not only can this happen, but the copier segment often just doesnt start, this has happened repeatedly and is inexcusable.EDIT: so i legit forgot I made this review, the game has long sicne been fixed, i now fully reccomend the game, bomb corp is fun now that it works, I actually like ear wax, fibbage is great of course, i really enjoy bidiots even though i prefer drawful, and as for quiplash, well, if you can get a full group it is good, but even with 4 people that is not a large enough number to really enjoy it"

The players don't get to hear the sound cues until they's played on the screen so the players have to select the sounds by their written description. Earwax is played until one player reaches 3 points which makes for disappointingly short games some times.Bidiots is probably the most difficult of the games available.

With so many people connecting with different devices, there is a lot that can go wrong technically, but the game runs flawless and have not had issues with getting anyone to connect. Definitely a must have for couch-party games."
,Recommended,397460,32182269,Posted: 4 June,all,Spookicidal Tendencies,"Jackbox Party Pack is one of the few games that anyone can play and enjoy. I play it with my family and my friends. I personally prefer the third Jackbox to this one, but it's still great. I'll go over each of the games and my thoughts on them.Fibbage 2This is a great game where you're given a question and everyone types in an incorrect answer. Everyone's answers show up along with the true one. You take a guess and if your answer is correct you get points. If not, the people who gave the answer your chose gets points. One of the best games of the pack.EarwaxThis is one of the less competitive/serious games of the pack. A scenario is given and one player is selected to be the judge. Everyone else picks two sounds that would best go along with the scenario. The judge then picks their favorite. It's fairly simple, but can give a good few laughs. My only problem with this is that for me it got old pretty quick, but it's still a good one to try out.BidiotsI love this one. It's very similar to the board game Masterpiece for those who have played it. At the start of the game each player draws art which is then assigned a random value which no one knows. Players will be given chances to bid on other pieces of art and they will be given hints by art experts on what is valuable. For example, an expert might hint that a painting of a bowl is what they're looking for, so if you see the painting they're talking about you'll know to bid high. Because everyone gets different hints it gives a good element of strategy to the game. The artists also get a percentage of the final bid on any of their paintings, which gives them a reason to try to drive the price up. But if they end up buying their own artwork they get no money in return. This is my personal favorite of the pack, but most people I've played it with don't feel the same way. I couldn't tell you why, but that is something to keep in mind.Quiplash XLI haven't played this one much, as I got kind of tired of Quiplash after the first Jackbox. It's a fairly simple game where two players are given the same prompt and try to give their best and funniest answers. The audience then votes on who they think did better. This game is best with larger groups of people, at least 5+. It's also the best game to play if you're streaming Jackbox on Twitch. It's not bad with the right group of people, but not one I'm a big fan of.Bomb Corp.This is the only cooperative game in the pack. You work with the other players and communicate the information you have on your devices to try to disarm bombs before they go off. It's very similar to Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. It is a very fun game, but keep in mind that it does have an actual ending. You can play randomized levels for infinite content, but the premade levels are finite. Also, don't just buy Jackbox if you're interested in this game. While it is fun, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes simply does it better.Seeing as the third Jackbox is out now, I would recommend that if it's your first time buying a Jackbox game, but if this is on sale pick it up."

76561198053293597,Recommended,397460,28694403,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Pig,"Fun mini-game package with very entertaining games. These group games are very easy to pick up but can provide hours of fun.The only downside is that because many of the games involve trivia, there eventually will be some repetition of clues after playing for a while. As the owner for a few days, I have seen a couple of repetitions in four or five hours of play.Other than that, great party game.Edit to Party Pack 2: Adds a few really interesting new games, compared to Party Pack 1. Bidiots especially. One downside is that some of these games seem a bit luck-based (like Bidiots). Overall, still quality. Would recommend buying 1 and 2 in a sale package."
,Recommended,397460,30200962,Posted: 26 February,all,haphapidiot.exe,"Jackbox is a good game to use if you nothing else to do at a party and every just wants a good laugh. If you want to yell at each other and confuse everyone, Bomb Corp. is a great party game for that. Wanna choose sides, see some really dumb answers, and have a catching theme song to start off the game? Quiplash is the choice for you. Jackbox is really worth the money and time you spend playing with friends and family at get togethers."

Earwax is the only game in the pack that I don't think is very good, unless you get a laugh out of hearing random sounds."
