Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 3 hours into this game:-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved.Not recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream."

This evil has brought legions of ghosts to the land and has frozen it deep in darkness and ice. There are indications that all of that is a result of a ""Great Job Breaking It, Hero!"" from the first game, but... that does happen from time to time in game universes.In this game, you start out at level 20, so... realize how nasty the game will be from that.Also, one of the first companions you meet/gain is the hero from Legend of Mysteria... with all that entails."

,Recommended,397500,31909723,Posted: 22 May,all,YPRPG,"Labyonia RPG 2 starts years after the first game left off, with a refreshing twist in the story (and a transformed world). The party configuration is more dynamic, and has a larger cast of characters, although you don't get to choose your companions - it changes depending on your progress. The style and quality of Part 2 is largely the same as Part 1, but you will likely rely more heavily on your game guide, since you acquire access to the open world fairly early in the game. The two games are essentially two acts of the same play, so if you enjoyed Part 1 enough to finish it, go onward."
,Recommended,397500,29361792,Posted: 19 January,all,Axel Sama,"I wish there was a neutral option. Although it's a good game, Labyronia 2 feels like it has taken several steps back, in comparison with the original. Most of the stuff that I disliked were new features and story direction that the creators were trying out. It's clear that they're attempting to improve the entire structure of their series, and kudos for them, but it just didn't work out.The cons:- Travel is much more linear than it predecessor. (In the first game, you could go to about a dozen different areas from the very beginning. In this game, you're limited to only 1-2 new places to visit at any given point of the story)- Some labyrinths were pretty straightforward.- Certain battle functions aren't coherent and bug out sometimes (Mainly AoE attacks, especially Garic's).- Plot is short. Dialogues are long. Tends to be boring and time consuming unnecessarily (Especially before difficult boss fights that you die through a few times. )- Most ""puzzles"" weren't even puzzles. You just had to move boulders around, light stuff on fire, and that's about it.The pros:+ Challenging from the start.+ You get more party members early on.+ Battles are more strategic. Even random encounters require fighting strategically if you wish to survive.+ Some labyrinths had interesting obstacles to overcome.+ Main characters have some decent writing."

76561198365236399,Recommended,397500,30348005,Posted: 5 March,all,Awai,"Fan of RPG and having played the first one, I had to at least play the sequel. The sequel will differ dramatically from the first game in the following ways:1) You get party members early in the game that you can keep (last game gave you party members near the end of the game)2) Everything is dark + bleak to set the story's setting (which I think makes sense for the story plot, but for the player, the very dimmed gameplay just makes it irritating to play - note: later in review I elaborate)3) You don't start off very weak (you aren't at level 1 so you don't have to grind as hard to reach max lvl - 60).4) Slightly more story plot in the sequel than the first (this will only apply if you played the first and then play this, but then again, why would you play the sequel only...)I liked the changes in the sequel, but the dimmed setting can irritate a player. The story's setting has the world of labyronia plunged into a forever winter where monsters run rampant. While the dimmed lighting, purposely darkened screens, and darkened setting serve a purpose in setting the plot, it annoyed me as it was very difficult to distinguish on-screen graphics. Because everything was dark or a shade of black, it is hard to tell if that is a space you can/not walk on in Carralan - irritated me since I had to kept walking back and forth to figure out where I was suppose to go at the beginning. Other times, you just miss things all together because everything looks black-ish, or you are forced to keep walking around in a trial+error fashion. IE: labyrinth mazes are pretty much annoying because you seriously can't see much until you explore + remember the whole place.Another change in the game is the 'cues'. It used to be you learn skill(s) from finding 'cues' but this sequel has removed almost 99% of the skills learned from 'cues'. Ann, to my knowledge, is the only one that still learns skills via interaction with objects. Everyone else learns via leveling or finding/buying manuals. I liked the aspect of finding cues and I do miss this aspect of the game. Truth be told, slightly disappointed that there wasn't a final skill to be learned when you max out the character's level. :(I notice some imbalance of exp + gold per monster. The difficulty ratings of a monster should be correlated to the amount of exp and gold reaped when you slay it. Some monsters do not follow this very well and it can be a very tough time at the beginning of the game where you need some gold to progress + survive better.Improvements from last game:In the first game, there were large stages where you can easily get lost, because the map loops itself. In this sequel, there aren't as many overly large maps that you can wander lost forever now. The stages are still large, but most of them are more constricted. Although, the last section of the game's map was very annoying. I think the next part of the game (Labyronia 3?) will benefit the most if they remove the last bits of maps that are like this.The graphics are similar, but monster sprites look better now. They aren't as pixelated. However, I noticed that in the armagen battles, the battle scenes are delayed or the monster stops attacking me for no reason. Especially in the final boss battle, I entered all the battle commands (IE: defend/attack/etc), but there is a delay before the characters act them out.In the first game, you can get lost as to what to do first, but this game has improved on it where it's mostly linear and it should be clear as to where you are progressing... until you get the airship, which it's up to you to remember where you are in the game. However, it should be clear still and it is a definite improvement from the first.The puzzle aspects of this game are definitely better than the first. It took me awhile to figure out the Hallway of Mirrors and the side quests inserted into the game made it more amusing to play. The puzzles were largely not hard and just makes you feel good about yourself since you can solve them after a little thought.""Hidden secrets"" in the game. There are just a few of these that I found and those mentioned from others in the discussion page. I wished there was a bit more in developing this area, because everytime I play an RPG and I get free-range of travel (airship/teleportation), my first thought is to travel and find secrets. If you played the first part of this game, then you will mostly know where you want to go to check. Otherwise, you will need to follow a guide to look for some. Although, the current guides don't cover them 100%.Overall, the game is enjoyable and has improved since it's first one, I didn't get as frustrated until I reached stages of the game where shadows and dimmed parts are inserted (aggravation). If there is going to be a labyronia 3, I look forward to trying it and hopefully it keeps all the good parts from Labyronia 1+2 and none of the bad. 8/10!"
,Recommended,397500,25549640,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,elBez,"This second installment in the Labyronia series will be much appreciated by fans new and old. Our story continues where the first game left off, as you begin play as Garric, one of the original heroes of the first game. The world has changed into a wintry nightmare filled with demons and undead, and its up to you and your allies to locate Arres in hopes of finding a solution.The graphics are much improved over the first, and the music is a little tighter as well. Gone are the most frustrating aspect of the game, those darned labrynths - they've been pared down to a more reasonable difficulty. There's plenty of puzzles to be found too and there seems to be a lot less of a need to endlessly grind out levels than there was in the first. One of the things that I appreciated the most was how quickly I found a second party member; who ironically, was the father of the hero of the first game. Fans of the first game will recall that you only found the next member of your party quite close to the end of the story, so locating Windir early on was a relief.I would definitely recommend this game to friends interested in the genre, and have done so. It's so cheap that it's practically a steal, and furthermore, your entire party of heroes are all middle-aged or older, something that you hardly ever see in a game. If you want to save the world and give horrible monsters an elderly smackdown, this is the game for you!Pros+Graphics, sound, and puzzles better than the first game+Continuation of an amazing and original storyline+Fantastic use of a somewhat limited game engine+Geriatric smackdown!Cons+Could have used some better editing"

(some spoilers)I just finished Labyronia 1 and started playing Labyronia 2.I loved it.Originally I was worried that L1 characters might be overpowering and less challenging, but I love the design of L2 especially the starting scenario which was carefully thought out to present a sense of challenge.What makes L2 fun was:a. 2 starting characters have no healing spells. This makes it necessary to spend money on rations and make money really precious. It also require some planning to drop by a town to stock up ration, else we will just die.b. The starting characters are challenging because they cannot hurt certain monsters and have to flee from them. This both add a sense of urgency and a need to survive in the game. Wonderfully done.c. Several things add to the challenge. Getting lost running in endless circles without the compass, running from monsters in the dark, etc make the game a lot more fun and time critical.d, I also love the fact that there is no choice of difficulty level, otherwise I would have just played the game on EASY and that would have spoilt the sense of challenge in the game.So developers --- very well done for Labyronia 2 and I would love to immerse my entire weekend in the game. I look forward to providing you more feedback when I finished L2."

Even the special leveling island returns from the first game but the fights there only give 10,000 exp per fight, there's no incentive not to powerlevel in the vicinity of the first town, as there's no risk and its much quicker.The most annoying part is that you can't clear the last boss battle without having gotten a spell in a chest within some little island's cave, I wandered the world map for over and hour and didn't see it, why do this? Seriously.Considerably worse than the first game, but still interesting for the story, hope future games learn from the mistakes made in this one."

So, it's a point to improve, the side quests, the extra bosses (big big ones), more areas to discover, etc...-The world map is very similar in every area, it's normal because it's a bleak world, but also in ""Chrono Trigger"" we find  that destroyed areas with more contrasted places. That's why the Elves area is like fresh air for the game.-The designers are very creative, and we want more :)Summarizing, you will not regret buying and playing ""Labyronia 2 RPG"", it's necessary to play the first game to understand the story and to empathize with the characters.Have fun with ""Labyronia 2 RPG"", and we hope to have third part :)"

It's the beginning of the game and that is a terrible way to sell it.

Spent 24 cents for it and it's one of the best games I played on Steam along with ""Labyronia RPG"" and ""Legend of Mysteria"". All 3 are by the same developer.The first day I played ""Labyronia RPG 2"" I spent 8 hours. Not straight but still. It was that addicting.Really love such games.Also love how you learn new spells by leveling up. Think it was the same in Pokemon Emerald (haven't played it in a while so I am not sure) which is similar to ""Labyronia RPG 2"" in a way. Unlike the first game here you can buy spells not only find them.Great music, art, characters, story, everything. It didn't crash like ""Labyronia RPG"" did so that's a plus. There was only one drawback that I was going to mention but I forgot what it was so it must've been something minor.The 3 games are connected so make sure to grab them all. Being really cheap, the pricethey have is fair. Can be easily worth more as they deserve it. 24 cents for ~14 hours of gameplay. Actually ""fair price"" would be an understatement to say at the very least.Takes some time to 100% which is good. Personally I had a great time playing all 3 games. Looking forward to buying other games by this developer. I think they are doing a great work.Whichever way you look at it, ""Labyronia RPG 2"" is a must buy if you are into RPG games. Even if you're not you can wait for a sale an idle for cards. Yea, I know some people do that, lol. Gotcha!"

Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 2 hours into this game:-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved.Not recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream."

The story sets in several years after the first series, in a land which has become frozen due to the events happened before. In order to enjoy this game fully, it's better for you to finish Labyronia RPG first. I will explain some differences between both series later on.StoryUpon starting a new game, you'll be presented with a prologue which basically explains whatever happened between the first and the second series. Unlike the first series, your main objective is stated clearly from the start. However, although this series is using some characters from the first series, Garric's characteristic changed to be more talkative, and i'm sure that Ann's hair somehow changed (unless i forgot that her hair is changed by the end of the first series). The party talks become merrier, although the jokes seems forced to me.The story itself isn't delivered smoothly imo, although i can understand what the dev is trying to deliver. It's quite funny seeing that people can change their opinion in just a few dialogue/battle(especially the battle before the last boss). Some dialogues need some words to polish up its atmosphere before delivering the final blow.GraphicsMost of the maps used in Labyronia 2 are modified maps from the first series. The modification is including the addition of walkable body of water (or platform), the color change of the environment (to darkish blue color), and (or) the destroyed parts of the area.There are some graphic changes in the main character, such as Garric which is using blue bandanna instead of brown. However, most of the art seems blurry (although it can be because of the snow effect). I also got confused by the mapping of the walkable water and the sea. I tend to thought that you can't walk on both. The same goes with Carallan (third town) with its transparent platform and the ""pit"".I'm not that impressed with how the lighting is done. Most of the lighting are lazily done by changing the tile floor. It should be done like in Hall of Madness (third dungeon) where the light looks like glowing/shining.Some of the mapping looks bland and empty, such as the ""almost-nothing-room"" in Ann's place.Lastly, the NPC in the shelter is blocking the path because the path is only using one tile. Perhaps the dev can change the NPC movement area or making the path bigger.MusicI know that it's kinda hard looking for an appropriate BGM for an area, but i think that the dev doesn't need to force it. Although i can stand that some of the music doesn't suitable with the area, there is an additional music playing in Hall of Madness (third dungeon) in each area of the dungeon, which sounds ridiculous. I even heard Harry Potter's sound when he spoke to snake.Some music, like the overworld map, is using the same music as the first series.The gameThe first thing that needs to be mentioned is that you'll have 4 party members in the game. The other good thing is that you'll meet your first party member very fast, unlike the first series. However, the party composition looks ridiculous with 2 wizards and 1 priest which need MP to survive. Guess what? There is no MP regen equipment in the game like how the first series is.Because there is no MP regen equipment, resting (in the inn) has become necessary. However, there is lack of healing spot in game, which forces you either to return to the city or use item to restore MP. I did the first option, and i think that a significant amount of my gameplay is spent in doing so.There is a learnable skill outside of the level up skill in this game (by using a spell book). However, learning the learnable skill in bulk can be quite a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because you have to access menu screen in order to learn it and it always closes whenever you learn a new one.This game has more puzzles than the first one. However, most of them requires timing and quite unforgivable, and one of them can take you to the game over screen if you fail.The dungeons in this game are smaller and easier compared to the first one. The dungeons tend to make up for it by using a small lighting in it. I have tried creating a map for Labyronia's first dungeon before and it's very big. I doubt that the maps in this game is bigger than that (except in the area with a very large maps, of course). Speaking of very large maps, there are two very large maps, although one of them is very easy with no monster in it. Luckily, there is no time limited maps like the desert in the first game. There is a time limited room though.I don't think you need to grind in this game, but there is no random encounter in the areas of the map. However, there is a random encounter in the overworld and you'll spend a lot of time walking over there before you get an airship.Some enemy buffs are not shown in battle, which make it hard to check (especially in the last battle). I don't know that the enemy is buffed before i check it in a guide. You also can't defeat the final boss without a certain additional spell.Lastly, you can't continue the game after you clear the game.Pros:- 4 party members- 2 types to learn skill from: level up and skill bookCons:- Blurry images- No MP regen equipmentConclusionYou'll need to play Labyronia RPG first before you play this game. This is a continuation from the first series with more story and less for the other parts.Should you buy this game?Yes.It's a decent RPG Maker game. I don't think it's better than Labyronia 1 because it omitted my favorite part (the labyrinth), but for those who have trouble with it might enjoy it a bit more. You'll need to understand Labryonia 1's ending to enjoy this game to the fullest though."

As much as i wanted to abandon the series, i couldn't because i paid for the bundle and i'm kind of OC with my achievements lol. So i was surprised i found myself okay with it. The game is more fast-paced now. The story felt more relevant, the grinding was still troublesome but it wasnt as frustrating as before.Bottomline, am i recommending this game? Yes. If you played Labyronia you'd want to know what happened afterwards right? Well, this won't disappoint. It got answers. Althought it's hinting on another sequel. I think.

The developers wanted to ensure hundreds of cheap deaths and an equal number of negative reviews. The concept of the room is fine, and even neglecting to put a save point nearby is fine, but the controls are not nearly responsive enough to make it a challenge of skill. The characters simply do not move that quickly or accurately.The product is faulty.
