However this game is a simplistic space shooter and bullet hell. You fly through dark space and only your shots can light it up. Black bubbles everwhere. Then appear the bosses in a row. Like rotating red and yellow bullet spreading twisters, rotating lasers or bubble spaceworms. One is changing gravity so that all background bubbles come from one side. Tho the game is flat 2D and the powerups are not very useful or there isn't even a decent tutorial the game makes fun for a short while. If you get hit your dot shrinks down to a minimum dot. A nice game mechanic. Achievements just count from normal difficulty up to nightmare. Local coop included, steam leaderboards and a techno loop soundtrack. Nothing special but quite enjoyable."

,Recommended,397570,22053472,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Mastic x),"If I had to describe Shmadow in a few words I'd have to say it's as if bullet hells, endless runners, and sidescrollers had a child. There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.The GoodOne of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.You can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.You don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).Due to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.Very short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.Regardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.Several difficulties/modes.Really cool bosses.The BadSuper short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.I like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.There's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.You have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.If you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it. If you aren't poor you've got nothing to lose no matter how much playtime you get out of it."

You illuminate your surroundings with your bullets and with the ball of light that serves essentially as your vessel. Plenty of random blobs of darkness hurtle toward you like asteroids, and will darken, and even blackout the area until destroyed or passed. Occasionally you face bosses, whom will drop various power-ups.That’s really all there is to the game, and that’s the trouble with it; I want to like this game, but there’s just not enough to it. The shadow gimmick remind me a bit ofLimbo(though the art isn’t nearly to that caliber), and it’s kinda a neat one, but there’s very little to the gameplay. There’s no levels, or end boss, you just play for a high score; and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing (both the originalGeometry WarsandWavesare twin stick shooters that do just that), the gameplay isn’t gripping enough to compel me to aim for a high score. The levels and enemies are randomized, so that at least helps mix up the gameplay a bit, but it’s still not enough.I want to be able to recommend this game, but I can’t. After playing it for a mere 15 minutes, I’m probably not ever going to touch this one again. It’s not bad per se, so much as it’s not enough. Still, I only paid $0.50 for it, so it’s not like my wallet is hurting from it. But if you need a twin stick shooter, you’re better off buyingGeometry Wars 3instead. It’ll cost you a bit more than this game, but it’s well worth it."

The dots of shadow that are randomly flying around would be fine if the area you could see was not limited.  The area of the screen that you can see them consists of a where you are shooting and an area around you that get smaller and smaller as you loose health.  The other enimies you can always see, but it is hard to deal with them when you cannot see your suroundings.Another problem I had with this game is that the controlles did not feel right.  (Although it may just be me)  In a shmup game like this feel is every thing.  When the movement and shooting do not feel right it is hard to enjoy the game as a whole.  (I played with keyboard and mouse and with an xbox controller)Although I do not recomend the game, I do like the music and I think it could be a great game."

This game is an exercise in torture: it's a simple mouse and keyboard shooter, but the majority of your enemies are little black dots that you can't actually see until they're half a pixel away from your character. This means that when you try and fight and dodge the real enemies you end up randomly dying. Combine that with your view radius getting smaller if you get hit means that it actually gets harder if you make a mistake.Maybe I'm weird, but I don't want to play a game just to die from (virtually) invisible enemies every time it starts getting interesting.Plus the soundtrack is terrible.

Sure, with enough training and experience you can make ugly people look attractive and make all of the shame disappear with a few brush strokes. It's a powerful thing. But any random kid using it can make something way cooler. Photoshop is full of fun little tools that can make it look like you know what you're doing when you really don't. That's why you need to pay for it or, you know, just find a free copy somewhere. Just lying around. I found it. So it's mine.And it looks like someone else found it too, because they made something pretty dank.It's a game! One whole game.Nice job with the gradient tool, guy. You made some nice circles. Nice going. You did it.This is... uh... well. It's a game, yeah, but... the title is... well, uh... How do I put this lightly? Ha, that's kind of a pun. Light. Heh. Because the game's name is Shmadow.Shmadow. ♥♥♥♥ing Shmadow.Shmadow? Really? REALLY now? That's what you're going with? Shmadow? Of all ♥♥♥♥ing titles you're gonna name it like you're naming your Sonic original character? Is this named after your fursona, Shmadow the Shmedgehog? This is by far the stupidest title I've ever seen. If you named the game ""Black Ball Assault"" we would've gotten the same idea. The idea that you made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and dared to charge real money for it.Well, what is Shmadow exactly? Besides the stupidest sounding word I've heard since ""twug"", which is apparently short for ""Twitter Hug"", Shmadow is a little PSchee game on Shteam. Shmadow, according to the developer, is a portmanteau of ""shoot-em-up"" and ""shadow"". Because that's what this game is, summed up in a word. Kind of.It's got the basic building blocks of a shoot-em-up. You move around the screen, aiming your nonstop barrage of white particles around with the mouse to hit all the black things coming at you. Like an interracial porno. The little white circle is you, the good guy. The little black circles are the bad guys, because they're black. You need to stop them from mugging you, or banging your wife. Or voting.You can acquire power-ups and charge up special attacks to help you take down the bosses that'll randomly appear. They'll be made of a fancier gradient, and shoot bigger balls at you. Very fun sounding, I'm sure. Maybe not so bad for a dollar or two.But Shmadow plays like a fancy version of Asteroids. Only instead of jagged triangle shapes they're just big black balls. There's no structure, bosses just kinda drop on you randomly and in no particular order. Things are just kinda flying at you from all directions, and your only real purpose is to get points. It's like someone's final project for their Flash class, but they waited until the last minute on the character design and just said ""♥♥♥♥ it, we're doing circles"".""Inspired by light and shadow"", yeah right. ""Limbo-inspired graphical style"". Sure, buddy. And Shmadow the Smegma is actually a knockoff of Shmonic the Smegma. Totally not original at all. You got it, buddy. Whatever you want us to believe.It's shmallow and dull. There's not even an interesting hook to the game, unless you think a black background with a white circle as the main character is a totally killer art style. You could easily google ""Asteroids"" and find a free version of it to play online, which would probably entertain you about as long as this does. I've played better on Flash game websites. I'm not even knocking it for being arcadey, I've played some really fun arcade-style games. It's just not fun to play, it's not shmatisfying at all. If I waved around a flashlight in a dark room for a few minutes I would've had about as much fun as I did playing this game.What I find most offensive and off-putting about this game is that the name probably came first, and then the game. I can totally see someone sitting at their desk, thinking of the name ""Shmadow"" and saying ""Oh my God, thish ish the funniesht name I've ever come up with, I better make a game about it right now"". Was Shmadow really the best you could come up with? Really? I shudder to think of what names didn't make the cut. Were there worse names? Is it possible to have a worse name than Shmadow?There's a lot of better things you could do with a dollar and some change. Like use the dollar as a little scoop to scoop the coins into your mouth. At least then you're getting your daily required copper and zinc. Important nutrients for a growing body. And maybe if you're lucky one will get caught in your windpipe and you'll get the rush of choking to death."
