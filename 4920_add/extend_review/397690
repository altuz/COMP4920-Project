,Recommended,397690,18402517,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,Epilexia,"Inspired bySpace Invaders Infinity Gene, this lovechild from Tetsuya Mizoguchi’sRezand Kenta Chao’srRootagesurpass in each of its 5 minutes songs the dazzling intensity found in an entireCave shmupHeavily influenced in its design philosophy by Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s magnum opusRez,HyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Editionis a love letter to abstract japanese shmups such as Kenta Chao’s cult classicrRootageor Taito’s contemporary classics likeSpace Invaders Infinity GeneorGroove Coaster.And do you rememberHalf Minute Hero? In this game from japanese studio Opus, the premise was to doing a postmodernist retelling of a classic JRPG structure by synthesising all its mechanics in 30 frenzy seconds.HIIIdoes something similar with the shooting genre. Each one of its 10 main levels is played individually with separate leaderboards. And each level is designed based on the structure of a musical track, transforming incorporeal sounds in fascinating musical allegories that talks about the overuse of drugs and the mysticism found inPac-Man Championship Edition DX+’s neon glow corridors.With the duration of each track running in the 3 to 10 minutes range,HIIIdoes a magnificent work condensing in such a limited time frame the refulgent 0rgasm sensation of doing an entire 50 minutes loop in your all-time favorite shmup. Each song has a very different taste and feeling based on the pulsing tempo of its BPM. Sometimes, playingHIIIis an experience similar to enjoy the classic approach of aGalagaderived shmup full of charisma and cheerful love likeEschatos. And in other occasions, it’s more close to play a Bullet Terror Hell Madness that occurs inside Michael Haneke’s perverted mind.The key to express whyHIIIis an instant classic and one of the better shmups conceived in the last decade is the term Destruction. For years, the shooting games have been obsessed with the idea of putting more an more bullets on screen. In the mid-‘90s, this increase of the number of bullets on screen had a sense. It was a manner of breaking the technical limitations of its time period, pushing the hardware to make captivating and almost impossible dreams of the past come true. But with this race to increase the number of bullets on screen, comes a problem. In the last years a lot of shmups have focused its experience in the immaterial act of dodging bullets, rather than in the physical and sensitive pleasure of spreading the Chaos and Destruction causing a lot of things to explode.HIIIis able to put put dozen of billion of bullets at the same time on screen. But it never lost its focus from the infinite pleasure of Destruction. And even its smart scoring system is centered around the idea of Total Destruction. Every single ship destroyed makes more an more powerful our main weapon. And we have an even more destructive secondary laser weapon that can trespass small bullets, clearing the screen of enemy fire. BecauseHIIIis conscious that making a billion of things explode at the same time in an utopian chain while it burns our retinas with abrasive flashing lights, is much more fun that simply see some solitary bullets floating in the vastness and solitude of space.After decades of playing every single shmup classic, I can say that none other game has been able to equal the frantic sense of intensity and absolute level of Destruction found inHyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition. And the proverbial idea of making of each track a full playthrough, highlights this captivating-senses joyful destructive feeling, fusing Eros and Psyche in a dazzling and cosmological 0rgasm. Condensing in 5 minutes runs the sense of realization of be able to complete an entire shmup classic. Distilling only the most intense and significative parts. And showing in every second the reasons we play videoagmes. The reasons we love videogames.And the random nature of each level and its adaptive level of difficulty, makes of each playthrough a completely new experience. Every time that you playHyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition, you have this magic sensation of going to your favorite arcade in the 90s, seeing that a new shmup cabinet from Toaplan has arrived. This incomparable feeling of experimenting for the first time a completely new universe full of flashing lights and captivating electronic tracks. That comes packed with masterful bullet patterns and a perfect crafted scoring system.HyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Editionis the most accomplished occidental shmup to date. That feels like one hundred of forgotten japanese classics in the same game.( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors.

Sometimes it'll get to the point where you'll wonder where the hell you are.Levels are randomly generated, I would be the first to approve of that, but in this game it feels poorly done and unbalanced, there are way too many situations in which the player has no chance not to get screwed.- Level 10 aka Retro Mode is one of the worst things you'll ever get to play. It has 100 waves ala Space Invaders to go through, it's terribly unfun, its music is awful and repetitive, it lasts fffooorrreeevvveeerrrrr, and you'll get owned by barely seeable white projectiles way too often (because the dev thoughtwhite projectileswould be the easiest thing to see in a level with a background full of stars and filled with white-ish visual effects... pure genius). Trying to beat level 10 for a while will just make you want to go out, take a deep breath of fresh airAND ♥♥♥♥ING MURDER EVERYONE AROUND YOU. HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO MAKE SOMETHING SO ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL ??? HOW ???- The game crashes often when I hit ESCAPE, it crashes often when I beat levels too...- ""LEVEL 11 CLEAR!"" achievement is broken since last update in February 2016.- The dev no longer gives a squat about his game and is apparently not going to improve or fix anything. He's probably satisfied with the mess.This is the second version of the third installment of the Hyperspace Invaders series, and after so much time spent and work put into this series by the dev, delivering such a huge amateurish pile of garbage is genuinely unbelievable.There have been some games that made me wonder why I was wasting my time trying to complete them when they are so average or even bad, but so far HIIIPE beats all of them."

Dim the lights, crank up the volume and get comfortable with a controller, and enjoy the awesome experience.Essentially, in this schmup, you only need the left stick and a button.Shooting is on auto, so all you gotta do is dodge. As you kill stuff and collect 'souls', your main weapon becomes stronger. If you push the button, you fire a beam that kills bullets, but weakens your main gun. Simple mechanic, yet jam-packed with possible strategy.Pros:+Awesome trippy bullet hell experience that is totally unique+Too cheap+Music is really great, and the game goes along with the beat+Visuals find that sweet spot between being really overwhelming, yet never too chaotic that it is frustrating+Steam leaderboards keep me coming back for moreCons:-There isn't a ton of content, BUT it'll take you a good bit of time to finishIf this looks like your thang, don't hesitate - I assure you that it is."

It needs the mother of all photosensitive epilepsy warnings!I have a feeling my eyeballs are going to hate me tomorrow, but they love me today. Oh, they love me today!If you look at the trailer, you will have no idea what's going on. At least, I didn't.What's happening is you're a little shooty thing that forever shoots upwards (autofire! nice and relaxing!), and all the hundreds of other things on the screen heading downwards are enemies, bullets and power-ups.All you really need to pay attention to, in order to survive, is you need to not run into anything that's not a power-up. It's fairly simple; there are only two power-ups, and one of them are ""souls"" that auto-target you when you hit an enemy. Oh, and - you can move anywhere, you're not restricted to left and right. :)As well as your autofiring gun, you can push the fire button to shoot a second gun. This gun kills (most) enemy bullets, and is powered by the souls I mentioned earlier.Each level lasts as long as the music that's playing in it. The idea is to shoot as many enemies as you can in that time, keep up a chain, and not get killed too much.So - fun, simple, classic arcade-style mechanics, a challenge that seems *just right* (well, it scales up as you go through the levels, but it seems eventually doable), plus crazy visuals (this is an understatement!), good music, tight gameplay that doesn't give you a split second to blink - all makes for a great, exhilarating time!But I think this is a game to play in short bursts.Just in case my eyes decide to go ""you know what? this is too much! we quit!!"". Haha!UPDATE: Just so you know, the next day arrived and I turned out not to be blind after all!"
,Not Recommended,397690,23997383,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,Schatt3npakt,"WARNING: THIS GAME CONTAINS FAST AND BRIGHT LIGHT EFFECTS.There should be a warning in game or on this product page.That can be f****** dangerous.This game was bought during Summer Sale 2016 for 0,49 Cents, which is a fair price.The full retail of five Dollars is to much for the content this game delivers.What you get are around 7 playable levels based on the technotracks that blast in the background.The Gameplay (=number of enemies) seems to fit the music curremtly playing.GameplayFor the game itself, the gameplay is acceptable, decent even.As this is a take on classic space invaders, you are shooting at enemies coming from thetop of the screen. you can move left, right, forwards and backwards.That, excluding the inspired sprites, concludes the similarities to the base material.Instead of having a static screen, the screen scrolls upwards with enemies coming fromevery side. Some enemies can shoot, too, which fills the screen with loads ofenemies and bullets. If your defensethingy touches anything, you're dead.Your ship constantly fires, which was a bit confusing at first, but consideringthe loads of enemies on screen, you would not want to stop firing anyway.Alternatively, you can press the fire button to concentrate your fire into a redbeam. Doing so will deplete your powergauge, but is also the only way todestroy enemy-bullets. This is the must strategic feature in the game.Come to think of it, I wonder why they bothered to base this on ""Space invaders"".This is a bullet-hell shooter. And as a lowprice game itself, this might be fun for an hour.As a game compared to the genre, this game clearly has some flaws.First, the game is light on content, which is compensated in the price.However, the full retail is still a bit much for a shooter wthout alternate modes(or local multiplayer).The Shooter-part is solid, but unimaginative. wiggeling left and right, shooting,trying not to get hit. Not much more to it.Audio und VisualsSpeaking of trying not to get hit.The goal in a good bullet-hell is to see patterns in enemy attacks you can navigate through.That might not always be easy, but managable, with a clear visual distinction between enemies andbullets, powerups and so forth.That being said, the graphics and audio of this game were a dealbreaker for me.Shooting your way though the walls on enemies unleashes lightning effects close to thepain level of getting laser eye surgery on the white hot surface of the sun.It's hard enough already to navigate to the random waves of enemies, bullets and powerupsthat all seem way to simliar, it gets ten times harder when, everytime you hit anything,your game screams ""FLASHBANG"" and scorches your retina with explosions ofwhite, blue and red.Hell, I played Beathazard Ultra and this is the first instance I needed to squint my eyesto avoid agonizing pain.Also, the technosoundtrack is a bit heavy for my taste, but whatever.Considering all of this, I would recommend this game for the discounted price, you'll geta fun hour out of it.For full retail and as a shooter in general, there are far better titles you can play.And considering this might be the last thing you see before your eyes are torchedbeyond oblivion (and hyperspace, i guess), you might reconsider."

The video and screenshots don't make it justice, during the whole gameplay your screen will be flashing more than those old flash videos that purposely tried to trigger epilepsy attacks on people.Epilepsy attacks aside the game is pretty neat. It's a fast paced bullet hell with a single button that turns your auto-firing attack into a laser. Your laser is stronger than your main attack and it can destroy enemy projectiles but it drains your score and power. Everything else is standard for bullet hell games.The game doesn't has that much content so I suggest getting it during a sale.Anyway, I enjoyed it even though I get a headache every time I play it."
,Not Recommended,397690,30174316,Posted: 25 February,all,Mastic x),"Seizure SimulatorThe game is cool for about an hour or two but once you get to about LVL03 it becomes seizure simulator. The game tries to make you feel like you're a god when you play this game by making bullet hitboxes MUCH SMALLER than they actually appear to be. I didn't catch onto this till that first hour or two was over. The hitboxes become an issue once theres tons of crap on the screen because you literally can't even see what you're shooting. Considering the game is a bullet hell and it's not even possible to see what you're shooting at (after LVL02).  Don't believe me? (The game lets you play any level of the game at any time.) Buy the game, skip to to LVL03 or beyond and then refund it.I suspect the upvoters of this game for the most part would disagree with me. Take a look at the achievement stats and then look at the amount of hours most of the upvoters have. Most people didn't even dump enough time into this game to get to the seizure levels. They just picked it up, played it for an hour or two then never touched it again.Waste of money."
,Recommended,397690,22258386,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,The Puddle,Installed this game a few minutes ago. Ended up not breathing for at least 2 minutes. I went into shock. As I fell to the ground all I saw was flashing lights and pixels coming at me at high velocity. After 3 minutes I had learnt there was no point in life that is why you are given 5. After dying around 30 times I decided maybe this is too fast which then lead me to think what the harder levels are like. My eyes oh god my eyes. Why? how? what did you think would happen if you added that many lights to one pixelated screen of tourcher.Over all I would give this game a 8/10 only missing 2 score as I cannot see anymore and it made me question life.

And I mean in real life.I'm not sure how long I played for before writing this review. I don't consider it a bad thing if it took me two minutes or thirty minutes to come to the conclusion that this is a psychotic rave party in outer space where dodging the things you're supposed to pick up is more than a bad idea: it's a fatal mistake.Touhou? Why the hell would I want to shoot anime girls when I could shoot a strange mixture between the ghosts from Pac Man and the aliens from Space Invaders without ever having to press a fire button even once?Great music. Insane graphics, lights, explosions, space constantly. You won't know which end is up when you start playing, and by the time you've become comfortable enough in your new electro-trance strobe light home, you still won't know what's going on - only that your eyes hurt, your points are going through the roof, and everything is dying, including you. Something's different about this game though - I don't feel as if I'm punished when I die or even get game over. It just happened, and rolls off of me like it was just a natural part of the game. As someone super competitive and always out for the high score in games like this, that's never happened to me.Claims to have controller support but I can't get it to work. No big deal.12/10 would develop epileptic tendencies again. Excellent buy for 50 cents, much more enjoyable than a gumball or chocolate bar."

,Recommended,397690,29285506,Posted: 15 January,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Hyperspace Invaders II: Pixel Edition is an extremely flashy combination of Space Invaders, Galaga, and Cave-style bullet hell shoot 'em ups like DoDonPachi. It's a fast paced shooter that is both hard, yet somewhat forgiving since you can easily destroy and shield yourself from some bullets. All levels are entirely based on the tempo of a techno soundtrack and enemy waves and patterns are procedurally generated. HIIIPE severely needs an epilepsy warning, but some gamers will be able to adjust to it's apperance with time. The Fire Mode arguably makes this game easy, but the onslaught of enemies, bullets, and colors will make this game hard for casual shmup players.I learned of this game from the developer on the Shmups facebook page. I finally got around to it after about a year and in some aspects, it reminds me of Really Big Sky, in which I reviewed in 2013. I have revised the review athttp://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/recommended/201570You start by choosing a level based on a song (I suggest going in order), and you are push into a scrolling space background where your ship automatically shoots. You generally will only need to strafe left and right, but you can move freely which will be needed for a few enemies that chase you. Your gun shoots a straight bullet shot, which can be upgraded by collecting blue drops from every enemy. Killing enemies also increases your power meter and a multiplier. Some enemies drop gold squares that give you a temporary additional wide shot. They drop frequently, so the majority of the game is trying to dodge bullets to survive and and grab these squares to kill a screen filled with dozens of enemies. Some enemies like bigger ships, minibosses, and snake like enemies require alot more hits, which can more easily be dealt with your beam by pressing the fire button, which also slows your movement speed. This beam also seems to provide a shield and can destroy enemy bullets. The beam depletes from your power meter, though, I never felt like I would ever run out since by the time you need it - the drain doesn't seem heavy and you usually have enough power to deal with the amount of bullets sent to you at a time. I feel you will only loose it if you hold Fire the entire time, which is a  bad strategy since it slows you down from dodging.I found many big budget games come with unnecessary Epilepsy warnings, but HIIIPE doesn't, which should be a crime because I can't think of a better candidate for one. Besides colorful, flashing enemies, bullets and items, some level seeds have manic rainbow patterns that I would imagine to easily trigger somebody's epilipsy. That said, I was able to handle it (since I'm not epiliptic). The game is too visually busy for me to stick with and finish, but my shmup gaming skills kept me entertained in the few levels I did complete.  Each level is based on the tempo of a techno track, though the way enemies generate are random, so this game would be near impossible to master and somewhat tough to one credit clear because of this. Many of my deaths were my fault because it is VERY EASY to cancel bullets, but often times, bullets or enemies are hard to see because of the visual noise which lead to a few semi-unfair deaths. Player deaths doesn't really stop the the action besides some invicibility frames and maybe killing some enemies, so you can still keep playing at the fast pace this game wants.I can't recommend HIII to a casual shmup player if you are expecting to beat the game. If you're willing to pay the price to get destroyed in it's colorful environment, you might find some fun in the early levels before you are overwhelmed. If you are an exprienced shmup player, you'll find a game that is both easy and hard and the extreme visual design will be the deciding point in whether HIII is worth your time and money."

The shmup-feel is good, difficulty curve is good, controls are fine. There is a mechanic where you can drain your drain your overall shot level to fire a laser that does high damage and also destroys enemy bullets. Except when it doesn't. Some enemy bullets are immune and I don't fully understand what the difference is yet. That and the fact that it can be difficult to know even what is going on, let alone pick up powerups and dodge bullets are my only two complaints. But the intense confusing hectic approach is part of what makes it a good experience, so I wouldn't want to change it. Now, just how hectic is this game?Well.Allow me to take you on a tangent: My favourite restaraunt is this Mongolian Grill place where you stack a bowl full of food of your choice, then add scoops of sauces at your choice before they  cook it for you. At the sauce selection station there is a peanut sauce, and I always get a scoop of peanut sauce. Not because I'm a huge fan of peanut, but because I know that some people are deathly allergic to peanut, so I feel like I should enjoy it just because they can't. Kind of like I am flaunting my ""I am not deathly allergic to anything"" privilege. Well, this game feels like I am flaunting my ""I do not have epilepsy or a history of seizures"" privilege."

But by ""sick"" I don´t mean ""cool"" or ""insane""; I mean unhealthy. May sound weird, but it may also be right. I am not affected to epilepsia or heart condition, seeing issues or motion sickness. I didn´t ever experience any harm caused by flashes or sounds or anything, I do usually get along with those things. But this game profe me that I have a limit. After half an hour of playing I got some headache. Not a serious one, but my eyes hurt. The developers just overkilled it. On the higher levels all the screen is filled with moving, neon glowing obstacles, pulsing and blinking not only temporarily. This isn´t only confusing but might also be dangerous to people. I am not sure about that beeing right or not, but at least two of my friends confirmed me. But let´s talk about the game itself.It´s horrible. The gameplay only consists of moving to the left and to the right (if that shall even be possible) and pushing spacebar down. The last one makes you fire a huge blast you can destroy enemys´ bullets with, making you survive pretty long without doing anything else.To name an example, I got something around 75% on the very last level this way, I have simply been untouchable. But there´s still such a spam of bullets that it´s nearly impossible to finish completely, there are deathtraps to happen you can´t get out anymore. So yeah, it´s lame and unfair. As mentioned before, the level design itself is only made through fast moving randomized color-flashing pixels filling all the screen at some parts, so that you can hardly even see your own spaceship, which is an ugly yellow invader. What annoys me even more is the so called ""music"", which is even worse than the VFX. Basically just repetive syntheziser notes sounding like something industrial-dubstepish, but in the worst way possible. So the music is neither good nor motivating, it´s just confusing, missleading and a pain to hear. (What makes it pretty suitable to the rest of the game.) There´s one last thing I have to admit: This ""game"" doesn´t even work completely. Once I had figured out how the heck to control the menu, the game kept crashing. After pressing ""F""-key for example the game get´s windowed. There  is no way to do it otherwise. Not such a problem, but after going back to fullscreen, the graphics brake down, you see your ship twice, the level mirrors or increases size, making the game more unplayable than it has already been before. Then you need to quit with backspace, yeah, with backspace, escape has no effect. Also sometimes my Notebook, which isn´t a bad one, couldn´t take over the ammount of particles and just stopped the game during a level. It crashed. Not only once.If you have read until here I want to let you know that I don´t know how I could stand this for one entire hour, neither how this can have such an ammount of positive reviews. Maybe I get it all wrong, but for me ""Hyperspace Invaders II: Pixel edition"" isn´t any good at all. And by saying the name I realize that it doesn´t even make any sence, there isn´t any part one or a non-pixelated edition of this anywhere. I don´t even want to know, for me this will always be the ""Seizure Simulator 2015""..."

But ti turns out that this game is a /decent/ bullet hell. Nothing really to show off that keeps my interest. The bullets are about as bright as everything else and the mess of colours makes it hard to keep track of where my ship is, and what to avoid. The powerups are noticeable, but I find myself accidentally avoiding them because I can't keep track of what they are. The game has potential, but it kills it overall for me because it wants to be flashier than it needs to be.The game does some things right, like a ""Bomb"" mode, as I've called it, that allows you to get out of tight spots as a form of insurance. The soundtrack is catchy, but nothing I'd buy specifically for the music. The graphics are well-done, but a tad too bright.Overall: 6/10 full price, 8/10 on sale."

A lot of the time death is just plain frustrating since it's hard to tell what killed you but it's easy enough to jump back in. Die enough times and the difficulty is dialed down a bit which is great for morale.If you aren't prone to seizures and want a decent shmup pick this one up.
