I bought it again here since I kind of love it.Just Go With ItThis game goes out of its way to be strange.  Every aspect from the possibly questionably claymation art,the noise rock soundtrack,  the nonsensical item descriptions, the randomly generated dialogue for non-important NPCs, and the 90s pop art attitude exude a casual absurdism.  Eventually, a new logic emerges that, while non-sensical, stays consistent and lets you get lost in a world completely unlike reality.  Don't worry just go with it.  Throwing the flesh of your fallen foes into a meatgrinder at the entrance of Death gives you more Meat Points?  Just go with it.  Frozen burritos are powerful projectile weapons while warm ones are healing items?  Don't worry about it.  Eat up.  A random NPC in the Mortal City raises insects?  Not a problem.  Kinda gross though.Mechanics to Match the MeatIf all Hylics had to offer was the weird, then the game would be hard to recommend.  But Hylics uses its absurdism as an escape from convention, allowing it to explore simple but interesting new ways to tweak the traditional JRPG formula.  There's no leveling to speak of.  Instead, you have to explore the world and find new equipment and abilities to grow stronger.  Remember that part above about depositing meat into a grinder to gain more Meat Points?  Meat Points are health.  This means if you've defeated any enemies before dying, your max HP can be be upgraded upon death.  In that same area you go after a death, a counter lets you into a room to get a new ability after 3 deaths.  Items can be bought from vendors, but like the cold burritos that can be turned into healing items by warming them up in the microwave, items don't give straight statistical boosts.  Similar to Atlas games, status effects actually debilitate your character, so a technically better item might be less useful than something that stops a certain effect.These moves to make death interesting, growth non-linear, and exploration central to progression make Hylics a fantastic cheap and short game that will burn through an afternoon and leave you satisfied and mildly confused.TL;DR:  Hylics is weird, smart, pushes JRPGs in new directions, and costs less than a coke and candy bar.  The ♥♥♥♥ are you waiting for?"

,Recommended,397740,18295620,"Posted: 2 October, 2015",all,zooboo,"Hylicsis an indie psychedelic RPG game by Mason Lindroth. I'll be honest with you: I have no idea what's even going on with this game. It's incredibly weird and fantastical -- and that's probably why I love it so much. This game features amazing art made with clay and rendered in Photoshop for the grainy pixelized look. The battles are done in a typical RPG format with trippy battle animations. There's a lot of procedural text generation in this game, making the dialogue extremely fun to read.Everything about this game is an experience. Guitars scratch and croon in the background as you explore its strange world. Backgrounds sway gently and can make you nauseous. Exploration is peaceful, but it also makes you feel slightly uncomfortable as things get even weirder. In 5 minutes of the game, I'm reading poetic talk that doesn't make any sense, learning battle techniques by watching television, and making sandcastles on the beach in the afterlife.It's a really strange game.I honestly don't think I can recommend this game to just anyone. It's one of those art projects that's probably going to polarize a lot of its audience, especially on Steam. However, for $3, it's a great grab for anybody looking for something odd and different. It's pretty short, it should last you no more than a couple of hours. In this game, what you get out of it is what you put into it. I play it to relax, explore, and laugh. I hope you can embrace its strangeness and just chill to its dank tunes.TL; DR:For fans ofYume Nikki,Beeswing,LISA,EarthBound, andUndertale."

,Recommended,397740,22890484,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,Noto,"Hylics is the kind of game I was sure never existed, as much as I wish it did. I always had a dream about this surreal spectacle, one to subvert all the conventions of the video game medium, something truly special and different, a ♥♥♥♥ing strange game unlike any other. It wasn't until a week before this review that I saw the trailer for Hylics when I felt like the sheer bounds gaming can in fact be expanded and thoroughly toyed with to mold this weird as♥♥♥♥♥♥ silly, off-the-wall alien world of meaty clayflesh and some bug♥♥♥♥fest galore that was just positively psyche-protruding.In the same way the game bends gaming conventions, I'll bend the convention of a positive review and go on and rant about my disappointment for ""Hylics"" even though by all means the game is still great, really. I never really got the impression the game was promising anything more than just being a weird little fun thing, so I only have myself to blame for wanting more out of it. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥did I want more, though. After watching the trailer I thought this may be ""the one"" -- the real video-game-medium subverter, the real one to make you question what a game can do, what a game can be -- a true candidate to push forward in the whole ""games as art"" debate that's still going on now. I can now safely confirm with conviction this game doesn't carry that weight, so I'll keep searching. But it's still a neat diversion.I should probably get the bad out of the way, before I do come to its positives. The most prominent disappointment to me is the game's narrative, or lack thereof. In Hylics, there's no attempt to make any kind of decent story, even a nonsensical or non-coherent one. There doesn't exist a world to get lost in, or characters to care about or be invested in. The furthest it goes in having any sort of plot (besides its ending, which I won’t spoil) are the very brief sections in which you play a caped-man who sets off the game's ""acts"", though there really aren't any. In these sections, and through the rest of the game, there are strange, pseudo-poetic verses that are often spoken, and carry no meaning. It seems to be randomly-generated gibberish, and although it lends to the game's atmosphere, it doesn't serve any other purpose. It's more or less the same with the dialogue, though there's often less continuity there, because some of the humanoid characters/creatures speak that total fake-poem nonsense, and others talk completely casually and normally, like people. While amusing, it definitely takes you out of the experience, since the two extremes clash, more than anything. The main characters (especially Wayne) are themselves brilliant in their design, but are memorable only for their design alone, which is unfortunately the most shallow quality a character can have, even for a surreal game. I got the impression weaving together any sort of story in the game was one of the last priorities in creating it -- which was a painful impression for me to get, as a game like this would have benefitted so much with an inventive, creative absurdist narrative.It sounds like I’m being harsh, but it’s just testament to my disappointment for the game. Wasted potential hurts, but I’ve never felt it become tangibly part of the game as much as Hylics. The gameplay was so straightforward and repititive, too, that those were the only thoughts in my head as I had to tediously traverse the landscape back-and-forth RPG-style and grind through countless pointless enemies. Herein lies the other primarily problem -- the lasting factor, and how the game’s effect almost immediately begins to wear off on the player. When I first began, I was floored by the atmosphere and feel of the game, just as I thought I would based off the trailer. This lasted in about the first twenty minutes in the game, and then the oddness just wore off. This surreal world was no longer weird, then -- in fact, I was shocked to find it was contrived and boring and normal. The game is much too-quick to let up on its oddity, and stops delivering almost immediately on everything but its visuals. The intrigue of the world, characters, and story all fade away when you realize there really is none. The only thing left *are* the visuals, and while they’re fantastic, many times I felt like they just weren’t enough to make the game compelling. I began to lose my drive to keep playing, because there was nothing driving me forward except what kind of environments I get to experience next. I wasn’t even anticipating any sort of surprises at this point, because nothing strange or unexpected really happens in the game. As far as unforeseen and unusual events, it’s actually extremely tame. Everything that happens is incredibly predictable from a game-perspective.To give a particular instance, I ran into an enemy, and the screen went to black for longer than normal. I thought to myself “holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some weird ♥♥♥♥ing thing gonna happen now? Is it going to be a new room I accessed on random, or something?” and then the battle just started, as normal, nothing else happened.The closest the game gets to hitting on these are when control is sporadically and spontaneously taken from Wayne and given to the caped-man who sets off the game’s next act. Every time this would happen, I would feel a glimmer of potential in the increasingly-mounting normality, but it never follows up on it.Pretty much the sole thing I’ve been praising it on so far is the visuals, and they’re extraordinary. The visual style ranges from rotoscope, to claymation, to traditionally surreal digital art, and it all blends together seamlessly to make something distinctly unique to Hylics and Hylics only. You can absolutely tell the background of the game’s developer, Mason Lindroth, is in art, rather than game design or storytelling. And this isn’t necessarily bad, because it works. The art truly shines through, and makes the three-dollar admission price more than worth it, even if nothing else is good. That’s how strong the visuals are, and that’s why there’s far more fanart of this game than any other form of fan media. Nobody cares enough to speculate about the world, or the characters, because that clearly wasn’t the game’s intention. The intention was to give off a distinct feeling in the visual style of the game, and in this sense, the game succeeds with flying colors more than any other game in recent memory. However, they lost their power on me twenty minutes in, and for that reason Hylics isn’t very memorable. I distinctly remember every criticism I had about this game than I do its actual content, and I wasn’t even looking for them.I kept finding disparity because the whole experience comes together ultimately with very little lasting impact. It’s as if everything but the visuals were a contrived mechanism or tool that existed just because for it to be a “game”, they needed to. And it’s really sad to me, that a game so strange turned out to be extremely standard. The very, very worst thing a weird game can be is normal. Underneath a thinly-veiled brilliant surreal exterior, Hylics is just a really generic RPGMaker game with nothing else special to it. But it’s still so ♥♥♥♥ing unassumingly odd in a sea of boring♥♥♥♥♥video games that it still manages to pull together on its surreal and absurd visuals alone. It’s sad that everything else is so terribly droll that when a game like this valiantly fails it still ends up succeeding."

,Recommended,397740,24023613,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,CircumSamurai,"For $3 or less, Hylics is a unique and entertaining experience via visuals alone. Hylics takes all the weird surreal claymation stuff from around the 90's, and cranks the dial up while giving an above average RPG type game to play.The game is far from perfect, movement can be clunky, it can be hard to tell which stats do which, and the randomly selected pretentious dialogue can be pretty cringey, but I don't think it's supposed to be anything but that.The music is fairly nice, along with the mix of digitized 'actors', claymation, and drawings. They all blend very well. The gameplay is somewhat standard to an Earthbound type game, something I don't have much expertise in. I usually do not like turn based combat very much, but the animations and everything does make the combat much more pleasing to someone like me who does not enjoy turn based combat much.The game is short, 3-4 hours to complete the 'story' for the average player, but this is acceptable considering the price and how entertaining these few hours are. Acheivements for certain in-game milestones, or at least a percentage amount to know how much you've left to find for a 100% completion would help make players want to play more than 3-4 hours. Cards and badges I feel would also be nice and fitting for this game.I recommend it."
,Recommended,397740,34674939,Posted: 1 September,all,unprecedented amounts of clout,"nice little cheap adventure; took me a little under 4 hours in game time to finish my first playthrough (although i'm pretty slow at rpgs), wasn't disappointed. if you're expecting a really in-depth rpg in any aspect from gameplay or story, you're looking at the wrong game, it's more of an art showcase set to music (i'd dare to label a genre like prog rock but that's barely my alley) featuring interactive landscapes and characters.hylics is built with a version of rpg maker so anyone whose played an rpg maker game before (LISA, for example) will feel somewhat at home with the mechanics but many are stripped barebones and are super simplified if utilized at all. the combat isn't much, but it doesn't take away from the game. there's a nice variety in this game's items and equivalent to 'magic' in other rpgs; afaik many of the possible stats an instrument (weapon) or wearable object can have don't have any significance or bonus at all, and some have separate bonuses that aren't made obvious or are mentioned in the item description instead of as an added status effect, or something.game isn't extremely hard but i died a lot; frequently at the start trying to get my bearings (so don’t be discouraged), by trying to avoid instant-death enemies (more-so intentional obstacles), and intentionally not taking the time to heal or take care of my characters because death has almost no penaltyevery time your party dies, you’re taken to a hub where you can pick one of eight activatable checkpoints to transport to that you find throughout the game, and you’re thrown right back in and can go refight (or avoid) whatever killed you from full health/will (MP). this is also where you ‘level up;’ killing enemies gives you ‘meat’ which you can take to the meat grinder in this after-life hub to gain more health; initially making you stronger every visit back.you can become stronger and gain more bonuses (some of them nearly essential for fighting certain enemies) by buying items at shops, although, there’ll be almost next to no need to revisit shops, and there’s very few across the entire game, so it won’t be a huge deal after you’ve bought and found some of the best equipment. special moves that use will (basically MP) to cast are learned from interacting with TVs throughout the map and can all either damage enemies, heal your allies, or remove status effects (although I’ve got no clue what some of them do; the game won’t always tell you, so whatever), and there’s a comfortable amount of variety. i haven’t even found them all, i’m surethere isn’t really much of a cohesive story and the dialogue is insane and nonsensical; it took me a while to realize it but as far as I can tell most of the dialogue with minor importance is pre-written pieces of sentence interchanged with randomized gibberish (as in, you’ll get a different spiel every time you talk to some characters), which definitely adds to the game’s weirdness factor, already pretty high because of the aesthetic and the music.the art and the music (which pretty much makes up the core of the game) is likely not for everybody, but if you can stomach the trailers and screenshots and just wanted to know more about the game before you spend all of a little over 3 dollars (canadian), you should definitely pick this up.also, the final boss’ name isgibby. ♥♥♥♥inggibby."

,Recommended,397740,21019435,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,kindred.dread,"Hylics is a hidden gem, and from the screenshots alone anyone can see it looks utterly unique- it's a crazy trip. A lot of the reviews talk about that aspect and the insane, randomly generated writing, so I'll focus on how it plays. Hylics was quite a bit deeper than I expected in terms of mechanics and what it offers up.Combat at the start feels pretty meh when you're a one-man team, but even so smart use of the moves at your disposal makes combat interesting and as you start finding companions (they're all missable!) and learning more moves you get a pretty interesting combination of tactics! Battles are a rather standard affair otherwise, being turn-based. However there's no random battles, and enemies stay dead once defeated- they literally turn into a mushy pool of blood and bones on the map forever. And of course the animations of attacks are a pleasure to see and your foes have... interesting aesthetics, to say the least, so it offsets some of the monotony. At the end of each battle, you'll get Meat for the enemies you slayed.Adding onto to that, death works differently here. Instead of the usual game over, you're put into a kind of hub only accessible by death. The Meat you found can be grinded to increase your HP- since there's no leveling up, at least not visibly as far as I know- so if you've saved some up the same enemy that killed you may not be so tough next time. I ended up here a lot at the beginning. I really enjoyed this, it's very different from pretty much any other RPG Maker game.It's also fairly non-linear. There's the main path, of course, but hidden NPCs, companions, and items encourage exploration which is fun thanks to the fact that there aren't random battles. Usually, those discourage me from exploring freely.So if you're a fan of RPG Maker games, or unique aesthetics and writing, this is for you. But it's also just a really solid game, and I'm surprised it has as much as it does. You can play through and disregard the bells and whistles and you'll still have fun, but for completionists or those who want an excuse to soak up more of Mason Lindroth's acid-fueled world, it's a good time."

,Not Recommended,397740,32229281,Posted: 6 June,all,Byers Hintz,"This game is certainly something. Coming from the brilliant mind of Mason Lindroth, Hylics is a very distinct game that unfortunately doesn't seem to get noticed by the RPG community. Right off the bat, you'll likely notice the art style, which is made from digitized claymation models, with a nice pastel color pallet, making for a very visually pleasing adventure. Said adventure follows Wayne, a yellow dude with a moon shaped head, and a biker jacket. As Wayne, you will traverse this strange world collecting tokens, watching tvs, and overall having a good time. However, Hylics is not without its flaws either.  Firstly, the leveling mechanic. You're most likely used to killing enemies and leveling up in these kinds of games, however Hylics is different. When you kill enemies you gain meat. Meat is still essentially xp, however in order to increase your hp from it, you are required to die. It just seems odd that death is not only encouraged here, but required. On top of that, this is a very very vague game. You never get any direction, you just stumble into a place and hope you found what you need. The npcs never say anything of use, and even after killing a boss to unlock a cut scene, it only presents you with more poetic gibberish. Now for rpg ""experts"" this may not be a big issue, but even if you've played your fair share of rpgs, you will still most likely be stuck. And this games obscurity also means that the guide you'll end up needing doesn't really exist. I would give this game a 6/10. It was a great game, and I truly enjoyed it, however its glaring issues make it hard for me to recommend it to others."

It's not helpful nor funny it's just... there. I actually gasped, ""oh!"" anytime I actually ran into dialogue that was useful or interesting.Non-linear for most of the events, but this means you can miss party members or get them tragically late in the cycle and screw them out of health from ground up meat. You can equip a certain shield to combat this health deficiency, but it's a big bummer if it happens.There is a possible way to screw yourself out of progressing the main line by spending too much money, but I bet most people will figure out how to avoid that before getting the funds. Combined with enemies that don't respawn, this is an actual threat.BADThis game is a chore to play. At first it's fine and the way death is handled is extremely interesting, since you can't really game over from wiping, so the next worst thing is you can fight enemies that waste your time and drag out the fights. This occurs when fighting enemies who spam blind and paralyze attacks which are unfortunately frequent. You're probably saying, ""well duh just cure the status ailments"" but the only means of combating the status effects are either: equip items to prevent the status effects or find the ONE TV in this game that gives you a spell to remove status effects. Combined with getting party members possibly late, this means you could fight battles with minimal party members and being blinded for way too long. For crying out loud there are ghost enemies that love to spam the blind move and have naturally high evasion. I almost say just flee from enemies that are this much of a hassle since winning just seems to be a way to get more health in the long run.SUMMARYHylics is a gem of an RPGMaker game that everyone should experience for $3. I can't say playing it was fun nor will I boot it up again, but the art and music are such a treat I can't say it wasn't worthwhile."

Each party member has 10 lines of text each with no motivation for why the join the main character (Wayne) in their adventure (example: first guy joins because you found a paper cup, second one joins because you found his gloves).- A few characters  seem to have a history together but is never flesh out in any meaningful way. This leads to the inital intrigue generated by the trippy aestethics and the world built on it evaporating within the first half hour.- The combat is bare bones and is imbalanced, maybe by design.Example: There's a skill that allows a party member to heal itself for 30% and costs 25 magic points (each maybe starts with a flat 100), which everyone can learn. There's another skill that heals EACH member for 50% of their health and costs only 35 which EVERYONE can learn. Think about that.- Due to imbalanced combat, encounters become trivial to the point of irritating, again, maybe by design. I avoided a lot of fights because I had learned how to exploit the system and enemies did not scale well with my progress.-A majority of dialogue is randomly generated, as such I avoided interacting with most of the npcs and I made it through 95% the game through deductive reasoning.-The major lack of direction or guidance leads to a fustrating start.Conclusion: I get the feeling this was Mason Lindroth dipping his toes into the RPG waters or maybe wanted to make an ""experience"" or perhaps a parody of the conventional rpg. What resulted was a subpar game that feels like wasted potential.Honestly I would've paid more than twice as much for just the sound track or maybe an artbook in pdf form.The biggest thing I've taken away from this is how not to design an RPG or a game in general, so maybe the experience was worth it after all.I see people comparing this Earthbound and Lisa, but both of those had direction, and not only gave you reasons to keep playing but rewarded you for it, as a game should. This does not.So, as a (potential) parody, it fails. As an experience, it overstays its welcome and feels like less than the sum of it's parts. But as a learning tool I think it's reasonable."

Its creator, Mason Lindroth, has described it as ""a recreational program with light JRPG elements"" instead of a ""video game"", and that's pretty accurate. The joy of Hylics doesn't lie so much within its turn-based battles (which I still find quite fun) as much as it does within simply experiencing the various corners of the absolutely absurd world that Lindroth has created here. It's stunningly beautiful even as it eludes comprehension. I could give details but you owe it to yourself to jump in and see for yourself. If playing alongside friends, the game will be a hilarious misadventure in random-text generation. If played alone, it  will be a stunningly artistic experience. I absolutely love it.

The visuals and sounds create an overall feel I found rather compelling, along with the frequent use of randomly generated text that resembles odd poetry. I found the RPG parts somewhat challenging but not insurmountable and at times requiring some strategy, which was generally enjoyable. Though I will say that until you acquire at least one additional party member, it may be best to try to avoid battles as for a single character against multiple foes it can be fairly easy to die. On the other hand, death has few consequences and even some benefits in this game, so if you do die it shouldn't be too much of a big deal (hope that's not a spoiler)A few hidden things (maybe just one or two) were perhaps not so intuitive, but mostly things weren't too tough to figure out, as exploration and attention to the surroundings tended to suffice. It's not a particularly long game, but I didn't find it overly short. Perhaps I did take it slower than some players might, but that's difficult to gaugeDepending on one's particular tastes in different aspects of RPGs, it won't necessarily be for everyone (elaborate storyline and character development, for instance, aren't its priorities, as it focuses more on the exploration, atmosphere, and battles), but at any rate it certainly has a distinctive aesthetic going for itDifficulty of predicting whether other people will like it aside, I certainly found it a worthwhile experience personally"

I believe this lets the player project traits or personalities onto these characters, making them more likable. The music is... strange. It's not really good or bad. It has an unfinished feel to it, but it suits the world very well. The story is so nonsensical that it's not even necessary. Don't get me wrong there is a story, it's just hard to understand in my opinion. My favorite part, without a doubt, is the dialogue and humor. Whether it's enduring glands for thousands of years or buying squirrel food, the dialogue always made me laugh. The best part about the dialogue is that sometimes it foreshadowed events in the game, but I never realized until the second it happened! The one gripe I have is the length. It perfectly suits the game because I was fine with how long it was, I just wanted to see more of the world because of it's uniqueness.In the end, Hylics is a game definitely worth buying and playing at least once.

76561198106958679,Recommended,397740,32546588,Posted: 18 June,all,Pigeo,Hylics is an extraordinary trip into the mind of Mason Lindroth. I was drawn to the game by the artwork and psychedelic visuals but I was surprised by the engaging gameplay and wonderful world. Hylics isn't for everybody but I think that it is a great example of individual style and is a great interpretation of RPG elements.

The claymation aesthetic reminds me of classic adventure games such as the Neverhood (as does the irreverent humour), but with a distinctly Terry Gilliam-esque twist. The music is unfailingly disconcerting, embellishing the quirky world with a thick, slightly sinister atmosphere. The surrealist style is spot-on, and never fails to catch you off guard from the moment you first try to loot a rubbish bin only to accidentally crush it.The game isn't massively challenging or grindy, and won't keep you going for 100-odd hours with drawn-out melodrama, but it will leave an impact. I can promise you that much."

Loaded with interesting design choices, that aren't often seen and are pretty unique, stuff like:-Attacking stuff has first person animations-Most things you see is made and animated out of clay-Really weird and surreal atmosphere that's pretty unique to me-Death is a mechanic that lets you level up, instead of having to re-load a save and waste time-Plenty of 'attention to detail' mechanics like making sand castles that don't serve a purpose, that you might not even find unless you're just exploring and messing around with stuffIf the game interests you from the preview video and screenshots, and the stuff I mentioned above sounds cool to you, it's 100% worth the incredibly modest 3 dollars."

The clay and the simple sounds made it feel literally hand-made, a quality that is tough to get across in a digital product. The ocean waves, for example are made out of blue clay with finger lines drawn through them that bend and flex in a simple animation. So someone's hands crafted your graphics. :-D"
