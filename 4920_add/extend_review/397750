76561197960772933,Recommended,397750,25853244,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,Jaffa,"This is a well thought throughgameapplication (I won't call it a game, because it isn't one).I've had spells of meditation in the past, especially during troubling times... So I am talking purely from my own experiences here (I'm not a meditation expert). But I definitely think that this is aimed at a particular audience... I'll share my views below:Good bits- If you're easily distracted like me, then this game WILL help you to learn how to clear your mind. I used audio guided meditation for some time, then progressed to relaxing music.- When you play this, make sure that you're comfortable. A cushion helps if you're on the floor, or find a comfortable chair. It helps.- The voices for the guidance are fantastic. If you are the kind of person to find particular voices relaxing (Morgan Freeman, David Attenborough etc) then you'll really like the guidance in here.- There's MANY choices for guidance that cover a decent array of issues. You can choose to have guidance to help tackle anxiety, or you can go for Zen.- You can choose between 2, 5 and 10 minute sessions. It gives plenty of choice if you're pushed for time. However, this leads on to a bad point:The bad bits- You can't select more than 10 minutes, or if you can then I didn't figure out how. So, you select a 10 minute Meditation, you're placed into this wonderful, serene, picturesque landscape, you're guided into a relaxed state over 10 minutes.... Then suddenly the landscape vanishes and you are back at the menu. This needs fixing ASAP. It completely destroys the experience for me.- It needs an 'open' mode. You're supposed to try and use the same space for meditation, I think once you're accustomed to the surroundings you could visit without the need for guidance or voices. Just a mode where you can visit a place and stay for as long as you like would be nice.(Sorry if any of these ARE features, I couldn't find them if so)There's nothing more to say on it. This game is worth the money and will hopefully have additional features implemented in the future."

""Guided Meditation VR"" is pretty much amust haveapplication if you happen to own HTC Vive VR headset. I admit, I was very sceptical first when I saw this on store page. After seeing so much crap in Steam, I was worried this was going to be some dumb joke at the expense of VR consumers. Fortunately I was wrong when my curiousity and hunger for more VR content made me grab this ""game"".There are currently 12 environments to choose and they are all breathtakingly beautiful... Almost at same level with games like The Talos Principle, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, The Witcher 3 or heavily modded Skyrim. But as I said  ""almost""... Unfortunately there are still some graphical errors that are very noticeable, even distracting. Luckily you don't just ""sit still and chill"" in one spot. You can also move around in your chosen environment and pick a spot you perfer. The environments and your power to move around is what makes this game a worthy purchase if you're into this kind of thing. Not only the ""Guided Meditation VR"" looks good, but it also runs with perfect framerate. No issues with performance so far.The music, sound and meditations are decent. However, I felt the sound levels are bit unpredictable. Even if I mess around with options menu. Some of the meditation sounds seems lower than others, sometimes even difficult to hear. Hopefully this will be fixed. My only wish for the future is that we can use our own music from our local folders. Mostly for those who already own meditation CDs in their home.The biggest issue I have with this app is that how it forces me out from my chosen environment. I spend 10 minutes in my location, relaxing, then all the sudden I see myself in main menu again. Not sure if Iam missing something, but this is really irritating. Even after meditation, the app forces me out. Even if I have a controller and I can enter the menu whenever I want.If you're interested in meditation and other ways of relaxing other than shooting and fapping, I highly recommend Guided Meditation VR even at it's current state. This is a game I never asked for, but I certainly needed it."
76561197970667201,Not Recommended,397750,31114967,Posted: 13 April,all,Thornfoot,"A wonderful idea, poorly excecuted. I would like to see the concept pushed forward so I hate to ding this program too much, but I have to. Here is the deal. The Visuals are poor. Low quality textures, low poly trees, sprite grass and bushes, lots of clipping, the ground itself is just a painted sheet, the water looks all wonky, colors are too bright and cartoonish.  Sit on the floor and as you teleport about you will rarely be placed on the ground. You will either be in it or floating above it. Teleporting itself is so terrible I had to close by eyes tightly to avoid getting slapped in the eyeballs with a blinding flash of light. If you don't care for the 'guided' part of the meditation you will do better to simply get Steam Destinations and find a place you would like to sit. Vesper peak or some of the other Valve workshop postcard locations also all look much better than this program. Or try The Blu, just sit on the ground in the deep ocean instead of poking about or chasing fish. I am sorry, but it is so frustrating to see this implemented so poorly because I know that tools like Cryengine Sandbox can make better visuals right out of the box. It is early access so I won't ask for my money back and I wish them well, but I doubt I will bother firing up the program again any time soon."
,Recommended,397750,25846146,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Ess2s2,"So, I took a chance on this game, and I must say, it paid off.Full disclosure: I bought this experience for my hippie girlfriend. She likes to meditate.I bought it and logged in to check out the features and made sure it ran on my PC as I am running Windows 7 and this game is intended for Win10. Thankfully the game runs and I'm hoping they do some more testing and optimization for Win7 for future updates.The interface is smooth and clean, though can select the wrong inputs if you ""outrun"" it or go too fast for the interface to keep up. The number of environments is very decent for the amount this experience is going for. The environments are widely varied and all are in full 3D and can be explored through teleportation. Movement is not restricted to the ground, and you can also teleport and move through the air, giving some very interesting and revealing views on the environments.There is a limit to immersion though, as no element I could find was interactive. I understand this is intended more as a guided meditation aid, but I think simple activities such as making ripples in a small pond, raking the sand in Temple Adonis, or brushing aside hanging vines would increase the ability to get lost in these environments and find another type of zen stress relief. Not sure if this kind of interaction is possible, but I have a feeling it would be welcome for those who are interested in getting lost in a world.As for the guided meditation and welcoming nature of this experience, I can say that while my girlfriend loves VR, she has always left one headphone out as a way to ground herself. This was the first game where she put both headphones in, smiled, and allowed herself to go through a few guided relaxation sessions. Afterward, she told me she wanted to make this a daily routine. The smile on her face is all the answer I need.For anyone who has the horsepower, graphics options and in-game supersampling are included, and effects are applied in realtime, allowing you to adjust a scene for optimal performance.The amount of options when it comes to music, meditation type, narration, duration, and environment are pretty staggering. There's options for 2-minute routines, 5-minute routines, and much more, with different levels of meditation, and different guides and topics to help you achieve a more personalized session.There were certain areas where you could ""peel back the curtain"" and see angles and areas you weren't meant to, but as someone who likes to explore, I actually found that fun. The graphics are well done, detailed full 3D models and are certainly not the same as the geometric cutouts in the main trailer.As this software is still in Early Access, I am definitely looking forward to seeing what additions and enhancements are made, as well as seeing improvements in the UI and less background noise in the spoken narratives.All in all, I highly recommend this experience for anyone who wants to get away and find a lot of calm in another world. Although if you're someone looking for a game, with stuff to do and things to win, this isn't the purchase for you. as for myself, I love the worlds on offer here and even as static backgrounds, are fun to walk around in with some cool music in the background. I can't wait for more."

It's awesome. What I would suggest is /please/ make some Japan-based locations? And possibly some snow based ones? I think Japan has so many places of potential for this game; Sakura gardens, zen gardens, temples, flower meadows, bamboo forests, shrines, festivals, tokyo cities, open hot baths/hot springs, kyoto areas, Mnt.

My initial impressions are peaceful scenery, beautiful music and great meditation guides. I see a lot of replay potential in this experience. Keep adding more scenes, music options and meditations. Maybe even use the environment as a visual meditation aid, such as imagining yourself climbing a mountain to reach your goals in life. Thanks for developing this. I look forward to exploring more meditations."

If all you're looking to do is sit at a very scenic spot and meditate as perhaps this program is intended for, then you'll be content. Fantastic environments, with birds flying around in some, moving waterfall, rivers. Cannot recommend at full price because of the lack of the true magic of VR when you interact with things/creatures/people in beautiful enviornments. But then again, I dont think it was the developers intent to make it it possible to touch and feel in the environments here."

Transport yourself to a jungle, a penthouse suite or a beautiful secluded garden and sit back and relax.For an early access game this is surprisingly full featured. It has 12 environments that you can move around in and many, many choices of guided meditations.as someone with anxiety and a difficulty relaxing, this game has proven a great aid in helping me to calm my mind and 'be here now' instead of living up in my head.I would like to see some shorter meditations and some bug fixes, but overall this is a great game for the money even though it's still in early access."

Very relaxing experience in fantastic environments. Im not a fan of any of the guided meditations included in this app (luckily you can turn them off), but it is great to sit at a very scenic spot and meditate and/or listen to music or the sounds of nature.Would like the option of adding my own music and changing scenery without going to the main menu every time. An option for standard settings (guided meditation on/off, music track selection, or environment sounds only)  would also be nice."

Be warned if you use the latter you will see 'behind the scenes ' and noticed an assortment of breaks and gaps within the world construction models.My favourite is the autumnal forest experience, of coarse it ain't real but, when you take off the Vive there is a feeling of having come back from a special place - as I said I am not the biggest supporter of the music and voice over choice but, you can turn that off and enjoy the fluttering of branches and I think birdsong ( may have imagined that - if so it speaks of the immersive experience on offer here.)  Note to the Devs, can you please add the ability to select music from other sources please.If like me you enjoyed other VR experiences such as 'The Blu' or the stunning country Church photogrammery contained within the Destinations app, I would recommend you give this a try. Credit to the Developers who have clearly spent a lot of time working on this product.Parting tip, if and when you find a relaxing location, find a chair or cushion on the floor and sit / lie back and enjoy."
76561198027755480,Recommended,397750,26001334,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,RkRock,"Brilliant!Really shows that VR can be much more than gaming..Lets face it, for the forseeable future we wont get any propperly playable epic RPGs ala Sword Art Online, but we can get these really nice experiences. In a way this is where VR really shines, you get a experience and there's replayability in it.In something like TheBlue you get a really awesome experience but the replayability is lacking unless you go back in for the relaxing part of the experience, here you get that relaxing part but fleshed out several times over (even if it lacks the aw and wonder you get in TheBlue).As someone that suffers from Bi-polar disorder Guided Meditation VR is simply awesome, I normally find myself struggeling to motivate myself to meditate even though I know it helps me a lot and raises my general well being for days. But this program just makes it something I really want to do.I have found that this type of meditation has two big benefits for me.1) As someone who grew up with and in a way in games and gaming entering one of these tranquil places almost feels like coming home to a calm childhood home.2) You get the benefit of a calm suronding that lets you focus, and that doesn't get boring and makes it easy to let your mind drift out if you wish, at the same time the fact that you can't actually SEE your own body even with your eyes open actually makes it a lot easier to focus inwards as well and really FEEL your body.As for the actual meditation parts there lots of stuff to choose from and a bit of fitting music if you wish as well. Setting up a meditation pass is quick and intuitive. The different locations you can choose from are varied and all are interesting and unique in there own way.But yes, it's worth a buy, do yourself a favor and pick it up and give it a try even if you don't see yourself as the kind of person who likes meditation, do 5 or 10 minutes a few times during a week and see for yourself why it's such a nice experience."

This leaves you with nothing left but to concentrate on yourself and the gentle voice that tells you where to focus.

It's wonderful being able to travel all around a scene including high above it floating in the sky. So much content to experience and explore in here. Music and guides are great.

,Recommended,397750,25967666,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,DustAndRust,"I've been following the progress of this title for a while, and purchased as soon as it was available for the vive. I finally was able to spend some time relaxing with the application. My initial impressions of the program are very positive. The ability to put on the Vive, and spend 1/2 an hour sitting high up on the cliffs overlooking the bay, with birds flying around nearby is my favorite so far. The environments can be thought of as virtual scenes, which give you the ability to move around, pick a spot you like and sit down and relax... don't expect to interact with the environment.  There are plenty of scenes to relax in, the weirdest being a Luxor type Egyptian temple and a high rise apartment. I really like the crumbling Buddhist temple and the  cliffs overlooking the bay. The meditation narration and music choices are ok, but it would be nice to be able to make your own playlist from your own audio files. The teleportation navigation works ok, but there are issues with clipping if you move too far out of the scene ""sweet spot"". The developer is active in his app discussions, so hopefully enhancements and more content will be coming. While vr gaming can be great, this app and VR Fine Art Museum show the potential of VR outside of gaming... teleporting from your room to a different world doesn't mean there always have to be zombies around the corner."

Enjoying it none the less and probably spend as much time in this app as on most games. 10 minutes in meditation and a couple of minutes or so loading environments per session.Perhaps slightly longer sessions could be added, as some of the guided meditations seem a little rushed, even at 10 minutes.

Whilst my wife was probably more forgiving in that department but wasn't really able to find any of the environments particularly appealing, and the audio instructions seemed not entirely professional and a bit rushed, considering they are supposed to be Zen and relaxing. Maybe we missed it too, but we never encountered a tutorial for the movement and my non-gamer wife got herself into some annoying positions. I feel like a more restrictive approach of discrete locations rather than free range teleport would help here. Also some form of rotation by control rather than needing to change your physical orientation since my this doesn't reposition the menus and they end up off screen. It seems like the devs really tried to build something helpful, but I get the feeling they were just too budget constrained to deliver a polished product to the point that you aren't constantly reminded you're in VR and not able to achieve maximum comfort, which is really essential if you're seeking relaxation or a therapeutic experience."
