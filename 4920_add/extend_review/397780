I felt a lot less involved with characters and the story than normal, and things just felt rushed. It's not a bad game, but it might be among the weakest ""choice of"" games I've played, so I can't recommend it unless you've finished all their other games, and just ""need"" to play a new one."
,Recommended,397780,17906655,"Posted: 5 September, 2015",all,Talon,"I'll preface this review by saying I love the ""choice of games"" series and CYOA novels in general. As a standalone CYOA game, I believe that it performs admirably especially when accompanied by a suitable youtube mix (I recommend most epic music ever by HDSounDI). While as a whole, the text was uniformly above average, there were certain sections where I thought that the choices presented and the outcome that results were disjointed or even directly contrary to what I chose. These moments only occured twice, yet it was the first time I've ever encountered an event like that in any of the choice of games series.When comparing this title to previous choice of games I couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed. While the obnoxious use of weird pronouns evident in the previous title ""Versus: The lost ones"" was not present, the choices presented seemed less meaningful. Directly prior to playing this I played ""Choice of the Deathless"" and when I finished that, I felt a deep sense of contentment; a belief that the choices I made in the novel shaped how the story unfolded. Sadly, I did not experience anything similar to that when I finished this interactive novel. In fact, I had barely any sense of closure from finishing this, which makes a certain degree of sense due to it being the beginning of a new series but was still quite disappointing.Due to my profound love of this genre, I would still recommend this game, yet if you are just getting into the choice of series, I would advise you to play choice of robots or choice of deathless first as they are much stronger novels. Following that I would play the greek hero story, then Versus and the heroes rise trilogy. Once you finish those and are still aching for more, there are a variety of text adventures on their website which can be bought easily using google wallet. Basically, what I'm saying is play their other games first, and if you need more then come back and buy this.TLDR: Yes, but only if you are a veteran to the Choice of games series. Otherwise go buy choice of deathless or choice of robots. They are much better uses of your money and time."

Never once had a feeling that choices or stats actually changed anything (except for relationship, obviously). But it is an overall nice story. Grab it if you like a nice read, but don't expect anything amazing like the, I dare say, masterpieces that ""Champion of Gods"" and ""Samurai of Hyuga"" were."

It's a very interesting take on the ability to stop time, and it seems to me that it can go in a number of ways.I didn't get a whole lot of the romance, but maybe that's because I didn't try as much for a single character.One point I enjoyed was the character creation, and generally being able to create a believable backstory and feel like a full-fledged person.I'd also like to touch on the actions you can take: they're fun.I honestly couldn't help but indulge my inner kleptomaniac and swipe some things while time was frozen, and it was fun.I whole heartedly recomend this to fans of powers, and the idea of a regular person getting the ability to stop time."

And surprise, the character's behavior is completely at odds with the choices you made previously. I kept choosing low key options preferring discretion, only to be told how, in space between the chapters, my character had used his power to fight crime, or saved someone who was about to be injured, or skipped out without paying a bill. It was so disjointed, considering that when I had the opportunity to make similar choices, I had chosen the opposite behaviors.Either let the player direct the character's behavior or you do it. A mix of both leads to inconsistency."

I was feeling like my choices mattered, and I really liked their diversity (one particular scene had no less than 14 options). However, one does not simply play a game like this only once. One plays it again to see how different the story would have been if one acted differently. And that's when the whole positive idea I had of this game fell to crumbles.In my first playthrough I was very careful and paranoid. I didn't use my time-freezing powers for personal gain or anything evil, and tried to stay under the radar as much as possible. On the second one, I went the completely opposite route: I used my powers to pester people, robbed people and organizations multiple times, and generally tried the dumbest options I could, just to see how different the game would turn out. I made over $200k in money on this playthrough, compared to less than $1k on the first, but that didn't seem to change anything. The game still treated me as if I was poor.All the major events still transpired in largely the same way, and I got the exact same ending!As an example, even if I was a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥to my friends and refused to comply with the instructions of key characters, I still found myself going through the same situations with them. Even by stating multiple times that I didn't think my roomates were my friends at all and that I thought they were annoying, towards the end of the story the game was still treating them as my friends and saying the main character cared about them. It makes no sense! This is only one example among many.The things that changed didn't really matter in the end, and I got a couple more achievements. That was it.Other reviewers recommended other games by the same company saying choices matter a lot more in those, and I truly hope they are right. Because this one is only worth it for one playthrough. Don't even bother redoing it."

,Not Recommended,397780,18137676,"Posted: 21 September, 2015",all,Kind Buddy,"I typically enjoy CYOA games, but this one just wasn't for me. I forced myself to play to a conclusion, where I died, though I'm not really sure what I did wrong. The stat mechanics, though much more simplistic, weren't as intuitive to me as most Choice of Games titles are (Heroes Trilogy, Hero of Kendrickstone, SLAMMED!); sometimes you can use your powers with no or very little ill effects, others you'll do something that seems much simpler and generate a huge amount of fatigue. I basically focused on the powers all the way through, learning more about them and trying to get better at them without overusing them, but I suppose it's possible I was too cautious.Though I never attempted any of the romance options, I suspect there's likely a lot of content there as is typical of CoG games. Overall, if you're REALLY itching for a CoG style CYOA, this is pretty inexpensive and you might like it, but as for me, I'd say to give this one a pass."

I played it through twice.  Too many of my rather divergent choices led to the same result for my liking.  In my second play-through, I'd intentionally set myself up as a much greedier and self-absorbed character and yet I ended up the City's Guardian and was told I'd been using my powers during downtime to thwart criminal activity when I really hadn't acted in ways that would make that likely, including stealing a case of money from an armored car!The writing was solid and I did enjoy the game.

You find your character in a number of contrived situations and you get the choice of how, or whether or not, to use your power to stop time. In my first playthrough I chose the options that best represented what I believed I would do, and while I found that the options were (usually) sufficient for that, between chapters I was given a narrative about how my character had been fighting crime and helping people with his power, which was completely contrary to how I had been behaving, as for the most part I'd been conservative with my powers, and those few times I had used it, it was for the gain of myself or my direct friends, not random people on the street.Aside from that, I feel that many of the things that happened were quite unrealistic. For instance, stopping time, doing something, moving back to the position you were in and then starting it again - There is simply no way that you'd be able to get your body back in the exact same position it was in, and to other people, it would appear as if you suddenly jerked in an unusual or perhaps even impossible way, and this wouldn't be ignorable. Yet somehow nobody seems to notice.If you can look past the issues I've mentioned then I suppose I recommend this novel, but if it sounds like things like this would get on your nerves, then I don't. Personally, they got on my nerves."

Mainly, the illusion of choice is too easily shattered on a subsequent playthrough. Avoiding spoilers, you're cautioned about being too flashy with your powers and drawing attention to yourself. In one playthrough I followed this advice, and on the second I did the exact opposite. At the same point in the story, no matter what, you run into *spoiler.* Other than that, its a well crafted game with some great scenes and characters to fill them; all I can say is, use your powers often."

I am not going to say that I didn't enjoy it becasue I clearly did, it just didn't feel like it had that big of an impact on me compared to some of his other work. The characters in all of his stories are phenominal and the situations he places you in always feel real, and this can be said for this game. But in my opinion of where this game falls short is consequence. I didn't ever feel like I was doing something wrong or that a choice I made could alter the story heavily in any way a.k.a there wasn't a breaking point for me. Another issue would have to be the fact that although the characters were very well made, I didn't feel a real connection to them compared to some other reads. It also didn't have me yearning for more after it was over or during it to be honest. It was a slow ride that I went through and like a decent book I only picked up whenever I saw fit.My review however may be slightly biased becasue I am comparing this work to ""Zombie Exodus"" which is a completely different setting. There really is nothing wrong with this peice especially if you are into the ""Choice Adventures"" so I would reccomend it, but I personally just felt slightly disappointed in it. I just don't know how to share my thoughts on this piece of work correctly, so instead I will leave it at a rating. 7.75/10P.S. He has a current sequel to Zombie Exodus in the works right now.

Yes, I know I gave a thumbs down to it's previous game - Choice of robots - which will make me seem biased torwards text games. However, even though I gave a thumbs down to Choice of robots, I had some fun with it, and at least finished the game to the end.This title, ""A Wise Use of Time"", however, I cannot bring myself to even FINISHING it.The pacing... is slow. Oh my god is it slow. I appreciate the fact that it's trying to build itself up, but it managed to break my will to read another chapter.But really that's not the real problem I had with this game. I do not enjoy the fact that the choice of this game is mainly divided into 2 factor. ""Good"" or ""Evil"" - like the ""Paragon"" or ""Renegade"" system in Mass Effect. I personally hate this, because it over simplifies our emotion and desire. Previously in the ""Choice of Robots"", you had to choose what purpose you will give to your robot. Will it represent beauty and grace, or will it spread fear and overwhelming power? Or, will it act like a living human being, and become your friend? It was up to you. The world evolved around you, which is the sole purpose of a ""text adventure"" game.Here, it's not like that. Yes, it has many branching paths, but the main dilemma is ""Will you, or will you not overuse your power to bend time for your own benifit? Consequences may happen."" And this alone may be an interesting book or a conversation - but not a game, which is about the ""game play"". And it feels like the choices that this game presents are not intriguing enough for me to choose this game over a well written book."

The choice that they offer in their novels is really top notch though. Small decisions effect paths you can take later down the road.It is well written and gramatical errors are very seldom and when they do occur do not detract from the overall meaning of the piece.I also like the very easy to read menues that allow you to keep track of relationship statuses/ attributes/ and even morality.My personal favorite ""Choice of Game"" project besides their ""Choice of Robots"" which was also stellar. The story is exeptional and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Overall i would easily recommend this to someone who enjoys text based, choose your own adventures.

This game tells a really good story, and I absolutly ADORE the choose your own adventure aspect. When I bought this game, I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but as I read on, I became more involved with what was going on. The choices that you make determine what happens in the story, and you can't go back, giving you a desire to replay and learn what you could have done. All in all, great story, well diverse people and interests, and intriguing sub-plots. Can't wait for the sequel or spinoff to this game. 10/10 would stop time to read this again."

Honestly, I'd give this a 10/10. It's been years since I just sat down to a story out of curiosity, and I found myself unable to walk away from it. The plot twists were great, and the character building was awesome. I loved that every single choice I made in the game had some type of impact. If you've tried any of these similar stories on Steam and enjoyed them, you should definitely try this one. You WON'T be disappointed."

However the more I played the more I got sucked in and I can honestly say this is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. I just finished the game for the first time, but I will be playing many more times, just to see the other endings, not to mention the other story arcs I can explore."

It's well written and engaging, and it's fun to read not only the first time, but even on the second, third, and fourth playthroughs (I'm an addict)! I won't give away any plot details or anything, but I can say, without doubt, that this game is... A Wise Use of Time. Fun, fun, fun!"

Its written well enough to not be a chore to re-read over in subsequent plays. I'd certainly like to see a spin-off or sequel to this, but I can easily see the difficulty in doing so. That said, well worth the price."

Though it is somewhat shorter than some other CYOA it still has a high replay value to it.

It's quite replayable, as although the major story structure remains the same, the side-stories vary depending on your actions.  There are also plenty of achievements to get, which encourages multiple playthroughs."

76561198098491982,Recommended,397780,28270907,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,Wikikid,"This game has more story in it, a lot of background about others, and a blank slate of your own character for you to start with (As choice of games are very well known for). I recommend it, it has replay value but not as much as other games (If you want a lot of replay, I recommend Choice of Robots).Pro:-Great story.-You actually need to work to gain love interest and some achievements.Con:-The bad guy is a bit bland, a generic villain. Not the kind to go ""I'll take over the world and kill everyone"" but the kind who thinks he's doing the right thing and will not listen to anyone else saying otherwise.-The background choosing affects your stats, but it doesn't really affect how the character acts. Just saying."
