However we can play LBA2 now through steam. Excellent!The original came out in 1997. It was one of the best games on PC. I had great times running around and enjoying the world of Twinsen. It came with mysteries and opportunities, puzzles and action. The music was enjoyable and suited the game well. The cut scenes added an extra dimension and the social interaction was also nice.As you can hear, no real cons.The only things with this version is that it is running in dosbox, which runs as 640x480 in a window. I don't see any options to change that. Also, it is not running smooth yet, however back in the days I remember my PC not running it smooth either. Not a real problem for me since it is still a great game.Sry for possible failures in language, I'm not a native speaker ;)."

This is a true gem that still holds up today.Thumbs up, all the way.This is one of the games that have by far moved me the most during all my years of gaming, in part to me having played it over and over again during my childhood but mostly because it is an enduring experience that can be played over and over. This one will entrance you, it will charm you, it will fascinate you, you will feel like a child again; it will pull you into an imaginative adventure unlike any other.If there is any game that is a winner - this is it. What better game to invest in here on Steam than a real winner?"

This is pretty much my favourite PC game of all time.The graphics may seem outdated to some but I still think they're appealing. The characters are quirky and fun and the story is great: You play Twinsen, the hero of the planetoid Twinsun (which has two suns - clever, huh?) who defeated the evil Dr. FunFrock in the first game. Everything seems fine and dandy until the weather suddenly gets worse, your friend gets badly injured and even aliens land on your homeworld, so you better go grab your magic ball and tunic and prepare yourself for some more adventures.You don't necessarily have to play the first game to completely understand this one - you'll get everything important by interacting with books, signs and busts - but it certainly helps to get into the right mood.You may find the controls a little awkward at first, since it doesn't control like recent games. Forget about WASD. Anyway, I don't think this should be a problem, since it's pretty easy to get the hang onto the controls.I highly recommend this game."

It's an amazing game and it has basically defined my childhood but I'm not sure it would appeal to anyone who haven't played it back then. Still, if you have never played it before and like old-school games, definitely give this a chance!The world and setting are amazing and the music is SO good, easily one of the best OSTs I've ever listened.

Good music (I LOVE the ending and opening theme song, still listen to it occasionally) interesting story filled with a plethora of events, colorful characters, world and lore, funny dialogues, interesting environments, entertaining small easter-eggs and a variety of interesting different things you need to do that keep it diverse and intriguing.

I could tell you about the amazing things I saw when I just started this game, after I finished Little Big Adventure 1 and I defeated FunFrock back in 1993. This is going to be a very long review.A game originally produced by Adeline Software in 1997, with help of Frédérick Raynal and Phil Vacey. Sadly, Adeline Software didn't make it further then 2004, where their company had to close. Luckily for us Frédérick Raynal has gained control over the rights of Little Bid Adventure, so... maybe there is a third one coming up? For more reviews from professional people I have copied wikipedia and posted it here;"" Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World said, ""With its unparalleled sense of marvel and imagination, engaging story, and deft mix of action and adventure, Twinsen's Odyssey is a true delight and simply the most charming game I've ever played"". GameSpot's Ron Dulin gave the game 8.1 out of 10, stating ""Fans of adventure games will not want to pass this one up"". José Dias of Adventure Classic Gaming said ""Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure is among the most original and intriguing adventure games ever released."" and gave it a 4 out of 5. ""But let me tell you. Do you remember the first time you launched a game that you were so excited about? Like many of us we played black and white games like Castle Adventure ( 1984 ), Pac Man ( 1980 ) or one of the best-sellers from Apogee like the Duke Nukem, Cosmo, Crystal Caves and I could continue for hours! And suddenly you find this game with a UFO on the cover, a blue coated man with a S-pendant around his neck and this beautiful woman next to him. You flip the big carton box and you see these amazing 3D pictures. You are thinking "" Is this real gameplay or just a short clip? "" Remember, back in the days we didn't had any source of information about videogames like we have today. I bought the game and decided to give it a try.That, my friends, is where my adventure began. I never seen anything so well detailed in 3D graphics. I could turn 360 degrees and see my character from all sides. I saw all these funny, but not terryfing creatures that I never seen before. There are bunny-people, fox-like creatures, walking sausages and evil citicens from Esmer who are trying to invade your world. The magic is in the storyline, where Twinsen needs to save a terrified group of schoolchildren who were abducted by an evil villian ( no spoilers! ). One of the best parts of this game is the humor that Frédérick Raynal and his designers put into this game. Trashcans and catuses have villians in them, funny conversation lines, pun-intended puns and an amazingly well formed story. Where Link would raise the item above his head, Twinsen is happily waving his arms up and down! Don't forget about Joë, the clumsy but joyfull elf that always seems to get Twinsen and himself into trouble! And what about Dinofly? You ever played a game when you were young where you ride a dinosaur?TL;DRCombat 10/10 --> Combat you never seen before. There are many magical spells that can help you fight enemies, but there are obstructions in this game that you need to overcome. Your magic ball is standard level 1 and can only hit certain enemies. You need to find ways to upgrade your magic ball to hit tougher enemies. The magic ball bounces which means you can kill enemies from afar bouncing the ball against the wall. The allout powerfull Ring of Lightning will make all those juicy sausages feel like they just came of the barbecue! And don't forget about throwing pointy darts, spit seeds with your Blowgun or simply fight of your enemies with your Emperor's Sword. Your behavior is a big part of this game that is relevant to how you throw your ball, how you wield your sword or how you preform certain actions with items.Adventure 10/10 --> You travel from Twinsun, the planet of our hero Twinsen, to the Moon together with Baldino, you go to the casino on Zeelich and you are trying to follow a robot-chicken to find a key. Biddi Biddi! Biddi Biddi! And don't forget Island CX, that is the most deadly island in this world. For those who are willing to explore the whole game there are special items and spells you can collect that can help you later in the game. "" What is Island CX you say... I... I don't know. I been there before but now I am all burned selling souvenirs next to this giant statue... I advise you to not go to Island CX... ""Music 10/10 --> The biggest part of what made this game for me was the amazing music that Phil Vachey made. The Temple of Bû from Little Big Adventure 1 and Emerald Moon from Little Big Adventure 2 are amazing classic masterpieces. What is that you say? Voice acting? Yes ofcourse there is voice-acting! VOICE-ACTING IS SO 1994!Gameplay 10/10 --> Twinsen has different behavior he can adept to. Normal behavior is used to interact with people, to find hidden objects or to flip switches. Sporty behavior is used for jumping and running, while Aggressive mode is.. well, for beeing aggressive. Please don't beat up Zoë, she is pregnant with your child! On the other hand, you are ALLOWED to beat LITTLE BRATS on top of a ROOF that shoots at you with his SLINGSHOT ( Please, go punch him! )  Discreet mode is the opossite of aggressive, in certain cases you want to align yourself a little bit better, or you want to throw your magic ball higher in the air over a wall to kill an enemy, or if you want to sneak past enemies to avoid confrontation. Each behavior corresponds differently with each weapon, which makes killing enemies a lot more fun.Graphics 10/10 --> For that time, 1994/1997, the graphics were astounding and amazingly well. Comparable to what Half Life 1 and Unreal or Quake did amazingly well for their time, Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 did that for their time. We could almost say that Little Big Adventure is the start of the 3D adventures which we see today, like Wolfenstein was that for the future of shooters. I gave a 10/10 because your game will come supported with INGAME VIDEOS when something magical has happened.Overal 10/10 For new and younger players, don't expect to be blown away by the usual standard of a good game according to today, the graphics are not what you seem to be used to ( even for Minecraft standards ) but be prepared to see what we all find a masterpiece in it's full glory! I got this game on CD-rom and I'm just buying it again! It brings a tear to my eye everytime I play this game. I love you Adeline SoftwareSupport this game developer and let's all cross our fingers for Little Big Adventure 3!"

I played it before the first one (which you shouldn't get on Steam by the way, since it's a horrible port of a mobile version of the game with keyboard controls literally cut out), but I now find the first one way too hard and frustrating to play. It seems like LBA2 addressed the problems of the first one, adding a save-anytime system, variable camera, and enemies that don't constantly stunlock you. The music is great, the graphics are great, the animations adorable. Figuring out what you're supposed to do and where to go is needlessly difficult at times, but it doesn't bring the game down."

I played this back when it came in a CD and it suggested you to instell DirectX 3.a (!)With a great comic approach, but with well done puzzles and a (although crazy) interesting story, this game has a bit of everything: Action, Puzzles, Comedy, Exploration and it has its somewhat open world parts!tl;dr if you enjoy old style adventure games with lots of things to do and discover, you won't regret this. It never gets old.This game had a combination of 3d envirorment (normally outdoor) with 2d envirorment (indoor isometric) and it is really really old, so don't expect great graphics.But Twinsen's Odyssey has its magic for everything, the game is great, the soundtrack is excellent and has a lot of personality.And just SO many things happen in this game! The first part of the game is:-Your dino-fly pet is struck by lightning (no biggie) because of a heavy raining and fell then got injured (I mean lightning is nothing, right??)-You go to the pharmacy to find a medicine for the dino-fly but then they have nothing for it. A lady says she knows someone who can help you but.-Some random dude comes and steals the lady's umbrella you gotta take it back so that she will tell you what she knows (quests everyone?)-You give her the umbrella and she tells that in a nearby island (you also live in an island) there is a Wizard Doctor who can help you, but then.-It is raining so hard the ferries can't take you to the island. You discover that there is a Weather Wizard who can help you, but he needs to reach the highest place, that is a Lighthouse but.-The gatekeeper of the lighthouse is missing, and you find out that he was kidnapped by a monster.-So you gotta:Find the monster's den to save the lighthouse gatekeeper to open the lighthouse so that the Weather Wizard can stop the raining, so that you can take the ferry and go to the other island, to find a doctor who can help you with your dino-fly, then come back and finally heal the injure!!And that's just the BEGINNING of the game!It's amazing, really."

I used to play this a lot back in the day and still find it good now a day.BEFORE YOU READ ON: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS (MINOR) SPOILERS.The story starts out quite small with the lighthouse keeper missing, but it will see you travel over 3 planets in total by the end. Every character I spoke to in the game is fully voice acted. Although I would like some options when talking to someone it is also funny when Twinsen asks someone out loud if they are part of the underground movement planning to overthrow the current goverment.The game overal is light hearted, but does have some more serious undertones. For instance several alien races bickering with one another over a lot of things and instead of working together they expect a magical prophecy to solve everthing. The goverment has soldier/policemen everywhere to make sure nobody misbehaves.Locations you visit are nice and varied. At the start you are on an island with a small town and a cave system in the slightly more hilly part of the island. On one of the alien planets however there is a town with a castle, a store, 2 ferries, a casino, customs, a spa and some more. And even then I said nothing about the military island, or the elevator that takes you under the mists, or even the moon.Most of the puzzles are quite easy like using lightning to light all candles in a room. There are a few acceptions like getting a very important package out of the store house manually (though you can skip this one by paying money to an NPC).However that is not to say that I don't have any nitpicks, with the biggest being that this rerelease doesn't make use of any enhancements that are available now a days. For instance the resolution is still that of when it was originally released and controls can feel awkward at times (you can rebind them, but there are still times where they don't feel quite right)."

Compared to that era the game had such elements thatSome of the features of this game are now outdated but most became industry standard later, but back when this came out, it was something rarely seen.There a lot of games from the 90's that get a lot of attention nowadays from YouTube personalities and nostalgia reviews, however this game gets barely mentioned. It should be up there with some of themost discussed games from the era, and it should be getting a lot more attention. That is one reason I decided to write this little big review.

(for its time)- Improved on every aspect of its predecessor, as a good sequel should.- Simple but engaging story.- Imaginative, colorful and varied environments and designs.- One of the best soundtracks.- Unique (again, for its time) game mechanics with the ""mood"" system, having a state for Normal/Sporty/Aggressive and Discreet to use them in various situations.cons:- Linear story, therefore it has little replay value unless you're trying to speedrun it or trying to find glitches, and hidden suff/Easter eggs.- Clunky tank controls.- Weird, static camera controls.- Easily breakable using in game exploits."

I was shocked. I was stunned. I yelled through the whole house something like. ""GOD ♥♥♥♥ING YES!

So much little details and the outdoor areas were in real 3D. Well, kind of. Static 3D images which rotated accordingly to your movement.

It is a realy imersive world, know a litle about twinsun, the twinsen's friends and rivals, all intersting characters, with their own history.The extratwinsunians are also very incredible and story rich, this game is the second of the history and i have hope that one day we will see the next one of this game.Adeline developed this game!On LBA1 there is an enhanced edition that simply does not works...There is no enhanced edition yet on LBA2, but do not worry!The original version is much better!"
,Recommended,398000,31637718,Posted: 8 May,all,ADZE,"LBA 2 is one of the first games I remember owning as a kid, and from the moment I started playing, the nostalgia instantly came flooding back, from the way the characters spoke, to the music, to some of the little puzzles hidden here and there. I adored it then and I adore it now!Quite obviously the graphics and cutscenes haven't aged well, but for a game originally released in the late 90's this can be easily forgiven. One thing that brought it down for me is the quality of the voiceovers. Twinsen's VA in particular very clearly sounds like he's reading lines off a script. There was one very humorous cutscene where Twinsen discovers the moon base and his mouth drops open in shock. There's a half second of silence, followed by a tame ""wooo..."" Surprisingly there's a flubbed line that somehow made it into the final game. The French ferry man on Otringal noticably stumbles over his lines. This is all nit-picky though and I don't mean much by it. It certainly doesn't take much away from the game. But then again when it comes to dialogue, the standard wasn't the highest to begin with.Aside from this, the world is vibrant, and I love the characters to this day as much as I did as a kid, wooden VA's aside.I'd definitely recommend this game to my friends, although I feel that a lot of the nostalgia might be lost on them. For younger players that crave cutting edge graphics and instantly lose interest in anything less (GENERALISATION, HO!), this might not be the game for them, but I could definitely see myself mentioning it to someone my age or older who has a taste for these sorts of games.Money well spent and I'm still enjoying it! Planning on buying LBA 1 next because oddly enough I've never played that one!"

Change the fullscreen configuration to false aswell(fullscreen=false)Here's a small copy of the configurations I had the best results with:fullscreen=falsefulldouble=falsefullresolution=originalwindowresolution=1024x768output=overlayThis game is amazing btw."

Playing it now brought back great feelings of nostalgia and memories of playing through it at 9 years old with my brother. Everything about this game is quirky and wonderful; the characters, the voice acting, sounds, locations, the gameplay and combat system, you have 'moods' that you switch between. Controlling Twinsen feels clunky at first, but it's different and fun to get the hang of, I assigned Q and E to switch betwen Normal and Sporty modes more easily. I always looked forward to the videos which have a cool visual/animation style and the soundtrack is magnificent.So glad I revisited this and reminded myself of the ending which is a really satisfying conclusion and a great ending sequence. If you played this in the past then I highly recommend you get it here, it hasn't lost its magic."

This must've been the first or second game I've played and it is certainly still lots of fun so many years down the line. The whole world is just so well designed. The controls are a bit weird when compared to modern day games but it only takes me a few minutes to get used to it. It's a pity there will never be an LBA 3 or a version with higher resolution textures.

,Recommended,398000,33720473,Posted: 22 July,all,CynicMimic,"A humble but beautiful game, weathered considerably by the passage of time. Difficult to get into these days, as the gameplay has aged *very* poorly. In fact, it's aged badly enough that it's difficult even for me to get into now, and it was the first game I ever bought, which I played obsessively when I was 7.Despite any current feelings about it though, I can't help but still be in love with this game. At least give it a go! Maybe try hard to look past the awkward tank-like movement, lack of any targeting system, and constant infuriating knockback attacks - and instead try to enjoy the finer things in LBA 2. Like its weird and wonderful world, its charming lighthearted nature, and its absolutely incredible soundtrack.NOTE: I've been playing the GoG version which is why Steam shows ""0.1 hours on record."""
