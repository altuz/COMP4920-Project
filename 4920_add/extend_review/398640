This is a text based sports sim, and the best one out there on college football.  Basically you run a D1 football program.  You are in charge of recruiting, the budget, hiring and firing coordinators and you can call plays during the games if you would like to.  The game even gives you some latitude on scheduling and player training.  If you are looking for an arcade game this is not for you, but if you like deep text based sports sim, this would be a good one for you to check out."

While it currently still harbors some techinical problems, it is still a solid game.Pros+ In depth stats+ Ability to structure custom playbook+ Original BCS NC, 4 team, or 16 team playoff options+ Academic suspensions+ Shifting conferences+ Setting of depth chart and CPU in-game strategyNegatives- Basic coaching options- Occasional game crashes- Over-simplfied recruitingThe game can be as simple or in depth as you want. You can play an entire season in 20 minutes or several hours. The recruiting is good overall, however it feels a little bland at many times. But offseason activities are far better than any college dynasty game I have seen before. If you enjoyed OOTPB or Football Manager, this will feel a little more shallow as it isn't at that level yet. But it is a solid addition to manager sims and is worth playing if you are a college football fan"

As you can imagine, this is extremely frustrating.The UI isn't always particularly user-friendly either; I spend most of my time during the recruiting section of the game flicking back and forth between my (in-game) emails and the recruiting screen to follow advice which is in said emails, making an otherwise enjoyable aspect of the game tedious and grindy. Simply populating the player info screen with suggested recruit pitches after scouting, rather than slowly growing adding to them week on week, would be a quick fix here. Similarly, full information on player injuries isn't available in your depth chart, so you have to flick back and forth between emails and depth chart to update the position of players who are fit to play but haven't fully recovered. If you could get the medical staff report either in the player info screen or simply by hovering over their name in the depth chart I would save a fair bit of time. There's more on this but I won't drone on.Finally, calling the plays in a game can be very hollow and frustrating at times, not because this is a text-based sim, but because there is no kind of play-by-play feedback or general analysis to explain why a certain play is/isn't working, making play-calling fairly arbitary as long as you stay within the confines of common sense. A simple pop-up from the relevant co-ordinator explaining in more detail what happened on each play would help give a clearer picture of why a play succeeded/failed and help to make more informed decisions later on.There are things I do love about the game, like the subject matter and the fact that it even exists. I've had some really enjoyable moments when playing and there's a real sense of satisfaction from building your team's prestige and attracting better recruits as the seasons wear on. Unfortunately that just isn't enough to keep me coming back for more agonising crashes and motonous offfseason tabbing. While it would be foolish to expect the kind of polish you would expect from a game like Football Manager, given the difference in budget and price, I would have hoped for a slicker overall product. If the issues I mentioned above are fixed then I will come back to this game in a heartbeat, but until then I'll just content myself with watching CFB."

The only thing that currently holds it back is that the game was released right before the huge change over to all of the various spread option formations and philosophies that now exists in college football circa 2006. It is good that the developer is now beginning to provide updates to the game once again and hopefully this will be added in the near future.That being said I have heard some in the community for this game say that a new game is needed. The engine for the game is actually quite good and truthfully if they would provide an update that would make this game more comparable to current day college football I think really that would be all that would be needed to bring excitment back to this game. The current price tag for the game at $14.99 is definitely worth the price but just that one update would in my opinion bring about not only more sales but excitment back to the game once again.

To test the algorithm I put a superior team against an inferior team. On offense (as the superior team) I ran only hail mary passes and on defense only goal line set all out blitz. I was able to easily win in spite of the intentionally stupid play calling. This indicates to me that this game will not satisfy someone looking for a true coaching simulation.

,Not Recommended,398640,26638937,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Dewguru,"First - the 2015 release date on the Store page is when it was released on Steam. The game is actually much, much older. Sure, it had a small udpate where the developer added the college playoff framework, but the when they made that update, they didn't address a number of others, to include technical issues.Now, some folks may not have any issues. Others (you can see in their reviews, forum posts, online searches) experience a crash after playing it for a bit. I'm one of those who seems to get about 2-3 hours of play before it crashes. And by crash I mean freeze, unresponsive with it apparently sucking the life out of the computer so you have to kill it manually. Not the end of the world in some cases, however, some folks when this happens, finds that even after the game is closed, that their operating system begins acting strangely, with odd errors. I'm also one of those, adn the odd errors are things like Windows Explorer failing when I right click on an object, and somethings refusing to launch without a restart of the computer (to include the game itself).I first thought it was a simple memory leak, but my RAM tools tend to show nothing wrong. Even worse, I enjoyed it enough that I figured I'd just deal with restarting my computer every few hours. Now, after the last crash, restarting my computer isn't getting rid of the oddities at all. The only thing that has triggered this behavior is this game. My only guess is it's a game that the method in which it was written, doesn't run well on current computers, although it could have been like this for years, as I've found others, with no solid fixes, who have mentioned the same issue and who've sought and seem to not have found an adequate resolution.So, it's fun if you like simulators. It's not the most accurate, and parts of it are both vague and seemingly broken, but it was really scratching my itch for what I was looking for. I just can't recommend it though, as if you're really jonesing for it, you'll likely buy it anyway, but if you're semi-interested for a time killer - don't do it, as you could be making headaches for your computer.As it is, it has gotten bad enough for me that I've uninstalled it.

It constantly crashes at random times and in some cases doesn't even save correctly. I saved nearly every week in one of my last playthroughs, but then while in-game against an opponent in year 3 the game crashed. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at first but figured that since I saved it after week 1 of year 3 - it wasn't that big of a deal. Only to find out that when I loaded the save it brought me to week 7 of year 2. That has to be one of the most frustrating things to ever happen to me during a game.If you're not interested in playing the games in order to call the plays - then maybe it is worth it to you. In my opinion though, it just isn't worth twenty dollars to watch the game crash and lose all progress at least once or twice per season.

I will edit this once I have time to play the game. Leaving the initial problem at the bottom in case others run into this.Ok, got in nearly 2 seasons of playing. I think I will eventually figure the game out but it does not have a very friendly interface. Some things are just not available such as auto-depth setting without putting injured players in. So if I have a questionable running back, I can not tell the game to not play him and still do an auto set. Then there are the injuries themselves. One of my RB's pulled his groin and the report said something like ""he could play but we advise setting him out 1 week"". 2 weeks later he is in no different shape and still injured. When I quit in season 2, I think it was the 5th or 6th conference game, I had 12 players injured. That's a bit high, and I could live with it if the players recovered at a normal rate. I tried to check if the CPU teams had the same injury numbers, but couldn't figure out how to look.Getting past the minor annoyances, and actually tracking my players, it is nice to see them develop as the season progresses. At least twice a year, maybe three times, they have an update on abilities. I started a freshman QB that was not very good, but had good potential and he has had some great games as well as a few more not so great. We have not won but 2 games so far.If you want a challenge, love American Football, and have gotten your fill of the EA Monopoly (which begs the question why haven't they been sued like Microsoft was? lol) then this game should be on your list.

This game doesn't have nearly the bells and whistles of a AAA title like OOTP or FM series but it compares favorably in many ways and in some ways falls quite a bit short.The biggest annoyance by far is the frequent crashing and lack of hyperlink based navigation.  The game seems to have a memory leak and will freeze every other season or so.  This would be a huge deal if it had auto save feature and/or didn't require a entire system reboot in order to come back.   Luckily I have learned to frequently save and the game does always load after a reboot -- haven't lost a single save yet (knock on wood).The navigation is clunky at best and the game won't scale fullscreen as well.  These are two huge ""quality of life"" issues and I really hope with the increased scrutiny and money from Steam sales they fix this.  I would love to be able to play this game in 1440p and to have hyperlinks for players, conferences, etc.Those annoyances aside -- I pretty much lost last weekend to this game, it's that compelling.  Following recruiting is as addictive as real life (can I can get that 5 star???) and quite realistic as well.  If you don't spend the $$$, time and have a high enough prestige you'll often have to settle for 3 star prospects or offer few 4 stars at a few understocked positions while enticing them with immediate playing time, which the AI seems to do a good job recognizing from what I can tell;   I offered a 5 star RB with only middling prestige and when I offered him playing time (I had zero good back on the roster after graduating my two seniors) he ended up committing.But go after too many very hightly touted recruits as a middling school and you'll just end up with a handful of walk on levels players after everyone leaves you hanging.That said, if you recruit 3 stars into your team that excel at areas you want to play them (say  athlete QB on an option team) you can build a program -- more slowly, but you can.I don't personally get too deep into the game plan besides occasionly stepping in on a big down and guiding the way, but from what I've read you can spend hours just setting up the weekly strategy.  I don't prefer that level of micromanagent but if you do the option is there.But as far as gameplay and replay value this game is just as addictive as the FM Series or OOTP.  The simulation is usually solid (hey, these things are hard, you will occssionaly see the absurd like 7 fumbles in one game from one team) and the gameplay is solid all around from the simulation engine itself to the big picture stuff like choosing your coaches and gameplan and recruiting.I recommend this game but it is with some hesitation as for some on smaller monitors (I have a 27"" 1440p on my main gaming rig) the text is unreadable and the constant crashing is a pretty major annoyance as well.But given that this game is only, $15, if you have a large monitor and enjoy sports sims, pick it up now you'll consider it money well spent."

Where did this one fail? Boom right off the start a small windowed menu pops up, so am thinking okay I'll make my selections and it'll will expend when the game actually begins....ahhhah...ahah..I waited expecting to be able to read the fonts at any moment but it never openned..I struggled to read the poorly wriitten emails that were to instruct me on How to play or what to do bad mistake. Then I saw it a Help Button frantically I pushed it thinking now I can gets some quick help with game steps or at least How to change the screen size...ahhhah...ahahhh.instead I got taken to a website that reminded me of something a child could create, Sorry ! But Thats okay I thought I'll at least be able to find the Mods they said to make it more realiistic Helmets, player names yeah lets go...ahahhh.ahahh..Two people gave them mods really, really two whole people...OMG I right click to get the mods and on both sites it says the page does not exist.  So in my Honest opinion this one wasn't ready for market. Maybe if there were enough mods in the Steam workshop....ahahhh..ahah."

,Not Recommended,398640,34517710,Posted: 26 August,all,Cosmo,"I would not recommend this game.  I am a fan of all types of sports management/simulation games and this game is actually pretty decent.  My issue however is the game has constant crashing issues and other glitches.  6 weeks into my first year, the game decided to stop simulating my team's games.  The game was able to simulate each week but never actually simulated my games.Now if you do want to play this game, be prepared to save after you advance the game each time.  I have been the victim of many crashes which has set back tons of progress I've made in some of my saves.  I have tried multiples fixes including: uninstalling and re-installing, launching as Administrator from the Local Steam Folder, verifying the integrity of the game cache, etc.  Nothing has resolved the issue of constant crashes, generally in the offseason, which is when you will constantly be needing to save as there are many weeks in the offseason.The game itself is fun and has the a decent simulation engine that produces good stats and scores.  However, the technical issues have made this game unplayable for me and I cannot recommend anyone purchase this unless you like to take chances."
