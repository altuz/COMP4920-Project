,Recommended,398710,18089436,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,maplesyrupghost,"Timberman is on Steam!  I was not aware originally, that this is the legit product with 30 million downloads.  I was first introduced to this style of gameplay with an app that came to Steam called Tiki Man.  I thought Tiki Man was really great, but I was unaware that there was a much more complete offering coming to Steam.First of all, gameplay-wise, they are very similar, all you do is push left or right to chop the tree (or tiki) to advance, but there are branches to avoid, so you want to hit the right side of the tree.  You have to do this as fast as you can, and it takes a lot of practise to excel.The main difference is that this game is FAR more polished.  This wasn't just thrown together and listed on Steam.  What are the differences, in such a simple game?  They are vast.- Steam Cloud- widescreen graphics (tiki man is only 4:3 aspect)- controller support- local co-op side-by-side action!- online play!- achievements!- trading cards!- leaderboards!- half of the price!There are so many reasons to love this game.  My favorite is the Steam Leaderboards (+ Cloud), because what better way to encourage you to do better and better is to see how your ranking changes worldwide.  Also the couch co-op style of competitive multiplayer is a great, I can't wait to find someone to try it out with me.This is the real deal, folks.  Buy this game.  It is a very, very high quality tree cutting thing.  Super addictive, and it has everything you could ask for.The game is like $1, which is a very good value, but if you wanted you could try it in your web browser for free (with ads plastered everywhere).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3J2vmwwpSs"
,Recommended,398710,18955568,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,BlaXpirit,"This is nice. A game about rapidly pressing two buttons. All about skill, no distractions.Has some challenges, giving you characters for bragging rights in multiplayer.Multiplayer adds a surprising amount of depth, although really it's just multiple people independently doing their thing. Mind games are a thing, even.Matchmaking is kinda busted. Even though there is ranking, you just get random people. But that's fun in its own way (unless you're just bad without any chance of improvement), because everyone can mess up.★★★★★★★☆☆☆"

My problem with this title is simple really - the mechanic is just too basic. It was made to spam-tap on a phone.Controller support is nice, as are the leaderboards, but there is definately not enough here to keep me coming back."

Now, before the fan boys start bashing me for going against the wave, I'd rather you read the review first and see for yourself if I have a legitimate reason for not recommending this.The game is addictive..... or not?The top reviews you'll see on the store page will say the same thing. This game is very addicting. Maybe that's true.. maybe it's not it varies from person to person as for me, it's not addicting one bit. I was itchy to keep retrying and beat my previous score when I first bought the game but after closing it one time I never bothered playing the game again. (though I did relaunch few times for one of the achievements) The mechanics is simple and yet hard to be very good since there will always be people faster than you. This is not bad overall and I've seen worse games but, I could not find the reason to buy this on my next life regardless of price.Lack of ContentWhat you see in the screen is what you get. No upgrade, no other game modes. The only thing you can change is the appearance of your character which wouldn't really matter that much as most of the time you'll be focused on the tree and your score. There is a multiplayer which is pretty neat but in the end its exactly the same as singleplayer except your competing with actual humans.But, the price is cheap!The price of a game being cheap is not valid for it to suck, to be boring, or to lack content. You might be able to get this for less than a dollar or even free but, games like this should remain to where they originally belong. Mobile play-stores."

However, this simplicity may be the main argument making one addicted to the gameplay.We play as a bearded lumberjack trying to fell a tree, tapping it on the left of the screen and on the right.The difficulty in the whole thing is, that the time is limited, and it expires as fast as a lightning. Every strike on the tree adds a bit of time, so you need to have quite a nice tapping speed, not to lose. Slow fingers will not lead you to success. If you run into a branch, you lose, so you have to maneuver between them, showing miracles of dexterity. The challenge, honestly, is not easy at all.And you can even play multiplayer! Take a friend or a random opponent from the internet and chop as fast as you can!Once you reach a certain number of points, you will open a new character, there are quite much and even Steam exclusives. Besides the entertaining gameplay, Timberman will please fans of old school 8-bit graphics and groovy soundtracks.The game is quite entertaining and may well claim the title of the new time-killer number 1 for a couple of days. This game is definitely easy to play but hard to master!8/10 axesClick to get to my Curation Page"

They're not objective in the slightest.Yeah, it's pretty well made, but underneath the polish is just a typical cheap arcade game that you could easily find on even the most basic of gaming websites.The game has that ""just one more go"" thing, but it's not because I'm having fun, it's because I'm so infuriated with my failure that I'm driven to try again. That doesn't make a game good, it makes it manipulative.If you enjoy causal gaming like this, then spending money on a platform like Steam to indulge in it is a bad idea, you can easily get better games on mobile for free."

,Recommended,398710,18089690,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,saegon,"IntroductionHere’s the premise: a team of time-travelling lumberjacks have reached Gaia, the immortal tree mother and have to chop at her as fast as possible, lest she grow too tall and cover the sun itself. With meteorite axes fused in the heart of the sun, each swipe of Gaia removes another chunk from her life-force. They are more than lumberjacks, they’re the saviours of earth itself.Now, all of that was made up but it sounds about right. There is no story to Timberman, just the swing of an axe and the hope of a high score._________________________________GameplayIn Timberman, you tap either left or right on your arrow keys to chop at a presumably infinite tree trunk. Chop at either side, but do your best to avoid incoming branches. One hit of these, and it’s game over. Each chop lowers the tree, as well as a branch. There’s a greedy timer as well that runs on the top of the screen, and is refilled with each chop of the tree.To sum it up, if you’ve played Flappy Bird, Trip Runner or any one of the billions of infinite running games, you’ll love Timberman. It’s just newer, faster and has better controls. Also, the chop-chop-chopping rhythm of the axe is hypnotically soothing.There's also multiplayer in the form of either local splitscreen or a random online player you get matched up with.GraphicsTake heed. Timberman’s a retro game so at this point in the review, you either hate it instantly or love it dearly. The barrage of cutesy 8-bit games are fun, but have begun to wear thin. I’m no game developer, but isn’t it more satisfying to simply have clean, sharp graphics instead of a pixelated mess? I like the graphics, and the gameplay is undemanding enough to warrant Timberman’s pared-down aesthetic. I’ve just grown weary of these 8-bit style games.ConclusionTimberman carefully balances frustration with necessity thanks to an incredibly simple control-scheme of either left or right to chop. Chop well enough, and unlock a barrage of cutesy Timbermen which thankfully have no effect on the gameplay._________________________________VerdictChop trees, compete for the highest score, rinse and repeat. Great game, is it worth your dollar? Maybe."

Sounds like a solid concept to me, the promise of hours of fun! Gee, I can hardly contain myself! Can you?""Sixteen TonWhen I was a child, as the eldest son chopping and bringing in the firewood was a chore I was assigned during the winter months. So believe me when I say I know that chopping wood is fundamentally chore-like. There's a reason why my Dad insisted that I take on this responsibility as soon as I was old enough to swing an axe. It is a tedious and thankless task which nobody in their right mind would volunteer to do.So as you might understand playing this game is extremely chore like.I would be remiss if I did not mention that 8-player multiplayer is really quite fun when none of your opponents are cheating. This does not happen that often, but does happen as have I asked one guy how he was able to chop wood so fast and he said he used autofire on his controller :(And when played on a computer then it's nowhere near as good as when you play it on android.So take my advice and get the Android version instead.3.3/10 Extremely competitive 2-8 player online multiplayer saves this from being no fun at all. But not from complete and total mediocrity. Oh and the short music loop really gets on my pecs after about 4 repetitions. And if you can't think of something better to do with your hands than play this then you are seriously lacking in imagination.NEWSFLASH! VASTLY SUPERIOR ONE PLAYER FREEWARE VERSION!Get the freeware Amiga and/or Commodore Sixty Four single player remake Lumberjack for free download in ADF format instead.

It's like Stepmania, but with more beards and flannel - a simple concept that's deceptively addicting.There's a nice selection of skins to unlock for your lumberjack via various achievements which are mostly, but not all, chopping related and a speed chopping multiplayer challenge with global rankings. The audio clip that plays each time you chop sort of grates on your ears but there's a handy check box in the options menu to disable it. While you're in there I'd suggest muting the music as well - there's not a lot of variety, and if you're like me you're going to be spending an embarassing amount of time climbing up the ranked ladder.Pros -+Addicting. It's mobile app-crack come to Steam =p+Skill Numbers and Global Rank give you a sense of progression, despite repeating the same activaty a bajillion times.+Variety of skins let's you change it up. Slightly.Cons -+The Audio. All of it. I just mute the game and fire up Windows Media Player.+Addicting. There are so many better things you could be doing with your time, but you cannot escape the call of the Timberman.Basically, for $.99 you can't go wrong here. If there's a competitive bone in your body you can easily spend a few hours in the multiplayer, taking care of your wood with a stranger ;)"

Who would have thought that the simple premise of chopping wood as fast as you can while avoiding branches could make such a fantastic game?Reminiscent of the online Flash games we used to love,Timbermanlooks great, plays great, and provides hours of challenge through its multiplayer mode. Two-button gameplay makes it very easy to pick up but difficult to master. Excellent hand-eye coordination is required if you're going to get good at this. Lots of characters to unlock, and I like the fact that it rewards you both for getting a high score and for sticking with it even if you don't get a high score (characters are unlockable though both score and overall number of chops).The only con is that it sometimes takes a very long time to find anyone in multiplayer, and even if you set the game to search for multiplayer games while you play singleplayer, sometimes the games it notifies you about become unavailable before you can join. That said, multiplayer is still a great addition to this game, and provides a welcome alternative to always playing singleplayer.Overall, a very nice, very addictive little casual game."

Could use better sound assets the music is a little annoying. The ability to look for multiplayer duel while playing singleplayer is a great feature.Controls : Game works solid with left mouse buttons.The Xbox360 pad would not detect D pad inputs correctly and the stick is too slow for this game, but it worked great with the bumper buttons especially if you hold your pad on your chest.Conclusion : For this genre this is a pretty solid title. So if you like to collect the odd fast paced clicker this one is about as good as they get. Multiplayer is a lot more active than you'd imagine even after all this time and it makes it much more entertaining"

Although I was not familiar with its predecessor on iOS (apparently that's where it came out first) I couldn't resist the great price, well polished (or Polished? - game devs are from Poland) experience and the appealing sense of simplicity. Seeing the controls help/options page at first was a bit confusing since every button is just CHOP - soon after I realized that the game is really that simple and each CHOP button has a direction (left or right).Upon attempting to play with a keyboard, mouse and Xbox 360 controller I've settled on my mouse since it allows to click the fastest and it seemed I am already naturally used to LEFT and RIGHT click as two directions unlike keyboard buttons or controller buttons.The gameplay is fun and although not many people seem to be indulging in the multiplayer component of it, you can still get some solid chopping in in single player mode.Variety of unlockable skins/outfits/characters gives the game additional appeal and increases the desire to grind!Highly recommended!

,Recommended,398710,22767925,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Compassion Milkshake,"For the cost (especially if you get it on sale) this game is worth at least trying. Before playing for the first time, I didn't really have an opinion formed even though it's really obvious Timberman is a mobile game. The pixel graphics are nice (at least to me) and the combination of cross-platform online play with fast-playing arcade action made my decision an easy one.The gameplay itself is extremely simple. The character being controlled moves left and right avoiding branches as fast as possible while chopping logs from the tree. That's it. That's all there is to the gameplay. This description makes it all sound very boring but if you actually play it, Timberman is good for at least several hours of your time. The game offers both personal and online goals to play towards. In the single player mode, the objective is to chop as many logs as possible and improve your high score as your skill ramps. The multi-player mode has the same high scoring end but against other people online. This could be done one-on-one or against up to three other people. One of the more appealing side-goals as your high scores increase over time is that there are 37 playable characters to unlock. Although, one of the unlockable characters is bugged (Timber Hook) and will not unlock.Being good at Timberman is difficult and demands many simultaneous skills and abilities. In order to reach the 2,000 logs chopped Gabe Newell character unlock and for the player to be in the top 500 ranking (or better), this game is surprisingly challenging. A blend of patience, precision, speed, quick reflexes, dexterity, hand-eye coordination and stamina are mandatory to succeed. It's really fun to see your progress through the ranks over time and to beat higher ranking online opponents. With that said, there comes a time Timberman just starts being boring and the excitement and fun of competitive online ranked play stops driving you. The challenging and fast-paced gameplay stops being interesting and you'll feel like moving on to the next game on your list. The game is fun while it lasts. It just doesn't last very long.Timberman is okay."

I didn't think I would play it much, but here I am 90 minutes later.The basic premise of the game is simple- chop as many blocks off a tree and avoid getting hit by branches while going fast enough to maintain the game timer. If you get hit by a branch or go too slow, it's game over. You move back and forth on the tree by pressing left/right, or a/d or whatever you prefer.There are 40 characters to unlock through various game goals. Some of the ways to unlock characters revolves around hitting a certain number of tree blocks in one life, or reaching a certain lifetime number of chops. It gives the game some replay value.Moving on to multiplayer, it's just as simple as single player. You can play two people on one computer, or take it to the internet to battle anyone else looking for a match. I played a variety of matches, and it's basically a best out of 5 match. If you're evenly matched, one battle can take a good minute or more. Most are shorter than that. But if you're too slow (get behind by around 20 chops), you also lose that way too. It's fun, and I liked the competition aspect of multiplayer. You can see each player's rank and skill, which makes it more fun when you beat people ranked higher than you.Overall, I was surprised how much I was involved in the game. I will probably stick with it for awhile and it was worth it for the price."

So this game looks bland and probably not something you would be interested in. But it's actually really addictive for how simple it's the more you fail to beat your high score the more you will play. Also this game has multiplayer and those with friend split-screen.Not to mention it’s less than a dollar so if you don’t like the game it’s not a complete waste of money. Like that time you asked your mom/dad for a dollar to play the claw machine so you could try to win a stuffed Fluttershy so could take it back home and do whatever you would do to that stuffed Pegasus. But you loss so we will never know. But why take my advice, save your dollar and go buy a toothbrush or a lint roller it is truly up to you."
