,Recommended,398980,20326194,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,Twistor,"TL;DR: As a pleasant and casual visual novel, it's the cheapest trip to Melbourne you can get.I rarely review visual novels (abbr.VN) so bear with me. I likedthe first game(free-to-play at that) so I wanted to see what direction the second one would take. I'll be spoiler-free about this as far as possible.Let's start with the obvious, the visuals. The art style and music is clear and pleasant for both eyes and ears. Many scenes are animated to show off the life of the city. The English language (as I can't read Chinese) is excellent with virtually no mistakes or any reason for pet peeve.Story time!Continuing the story from the first game, Vinty the protagonist is a wannabe calligraphist. She's poor and absent-minded and gets into trouble because of that. Nice for her, she gets the fortune of visiting a fair of calligraphists in Melbourne.Funny enough, about half of the VN is about describing the trip, from plane rides to some small-time tourism. As a nice touch these are coupled (but not embedded) with YouTube videos (over 20 of them), specifically made for the game. This makesWithout Within 2effectively the cheapest trip to Melbourne one could buy up here in the northern hemisphere, or perhaps more fittingly a travel journal of more effort than usual. Consequently, it's also presented with a plot.Story time! ...part 2In addition to praising Melbourne there's Vinty awkwardly trying to appeal to her idol Excelia, the famous calligrapher. This time around the novel is totally linear with no choices for alternate story lines given: you can just relax and follow the story to its end. It's a simple and perhaps familiar storyline but it works.While awkward in action, Vinty stays a thoughtful personality throughout the game, shamelessly grumping about her problems and celebrating her little victories at everyday life to the reader. It's a neat way to bring her to life as a vibrant, living person and immerse yourself into the story. That's where this VN shines - it really feels like you were on the trip as well.ConclusionsI usually want to find something bad to say about everything for completeness, but there's little to complain aboutWithout Within 2. Perhaps it's a bit short with just some 2.5 hours of reading and video watching, give or take. The videos are not embedded so you got to have a browser and your connection ready for that additional immersion. Also, those 2.5 hours were not quite enough to get all the card drops.If I were mean I would remark there was quite a lot of filler with all travel and praise about how great Melbourne is (like I ever had the money to go there). However, it does serve as a pleasing way in building the atmosphere so I'll let it slide.Having liked Vinty's story inpart 1I would wager you liked this one as well, sale (like me) or even without."

To see this wonderful little visual novel continued from where it left off.Story Breakdown: We return to pick up where we left Vinty, our protagonist and set out on a journey to Melbourne, Australia, (Close to home, yay!), thanks to a grant, she's able to travel and afford a two night stay in the big city to show off her calligraphy among a whole heap of other aspiring artists and her idol, Elxcelia.When on her flight, a bathroom break makes her scuttle through first class and note a whole heap of people trying to fit under a seat to retrieve someone’s glasses.. Conveniently, Vinty is small enough to upstage all the bodyguards there, only to have the glasses snatched from her hand with no praise and given to what seems to be a pop-star and she realises just who it is.It is of course, Elxcelia.Vinty goes for her bathroom break with a huff and comes back out to her idol summoning her over to accompany her for a while, and shouts her a meal in thanks/apology for how her bodyguards treated her. They exchange a few words before, after and during there meal and our protagonist goes back to her seat, preparing herself for the rest of the trip, still rather gobsmacked about having met the famed individual. After all, she is only human, too.Graphics: Just like the first Without Within, the art holds the adorable quaintness of it. Introducing a few more moving images, and bishy sparkles everywhere. I'm already rather fond of art styles like this, so it's an extra little reward for me for this keeping it.Soundtrack: As with the first, it fits into the quaint feel of the novel and really ties it together nicely. It's worth getting to have it playing in the background as you work on something.Menu: Blocky and chunky but in a really nice and satisfying way. It's simple and quaint like the novel itself making it a pleasure to use.Final Conclusion: It's wonderful, it's adorable and much longer than the first Without Within which was free. The content you pay for in this one is by far worth it and following the story is also worth it. It's brought together really nicely, shows a lot of work and effort and just has really relatable or lovable characters.While Elxcelia's fall felt a tiny bit rushed, it honestly makes up for it with the development of our characters coming up to speed at a really nice pace."

It follows up on the short story experienced in the first Without Within and takes Vinty (the protagonist) on a journey to Melbourne.The story has lots of small fun moments and great drawings. Something I really love about this game in particular is something that a lot of other VNs miss, animated backgrounds!Thank you InvertMouse for making animated backgrounds!Also this game neatly features many small youtube clips of Melbourne town, all around 0.5 ~ 1 minute each.All in all the story is great and a fun read. Took me a little longer than most people but I also watched all the small videos :DWould recommend this game any day, but it is a little short for the price you might say. It took me around 2 hours to complete the game and I personally feel like it was worth the money (bought it on sale on the day of release, so it was only €4.) At the standard price of €5 this game is about €2.5 gameplay an hour. If you want more than that out of the game I would recommend buying it on sale."

This story felt more like a bonus episode rather than a sequel, never the less I still enjoyed reading through the novel.OVERALL RATING: 6/10This visual novel brings in a more realistic approach to an everyday life story which is unique compared to other visual novels, but lacked keeping me engrossed. It was also interesting to see the actual camera footage being taken in Melbourne and being integrated into the game. Vinty's personality was one of the main things that kept me going. Although it was a short visual novel, it's worth picking up if it's on sale."

76561198052362614,Recommended,398980,19016347,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Rorschach,"The story begins with Vinty going an a trip to Melbourne, in hope of learning new things from her favorite calligrapher Excelia that´s having an event there. On the plane Vinty even manages to meet her idol, but will she actually be more successfull by going after her idol?Apart from the story there´s to mention the great way Melbourne is pictured through several small videos the creator made by himself. Also there´s a ton of references and jokes about the first game that were really funny.Just like before Vinty has all the features that made me love the first game and especially the kind of character she is. She still has her sharp tongue when it comes to other people, although that parts is mostly covered with her thoughts it´s always really funny and a pleasure to read. Vinty is still easily depressed and quite cute and hilarious while being like this. And of course she still doesn´t open her eyes^^ In my opinion this is what builds her character and makes her this likeable.It bothered me, at first, that she was chasing after Excelia that much. There are a lot of moments when she is thinking about how her idol would have managed the situation from a momet ago and such. So I just thought: Why would she give up on the lovely character she is just for the sake of success?!But she isn´t. While thinking about how others would have handled the problems, she is encountering constantly, Vinty always manages to do things in her own way.While the story doesn´t seem THAT big, I think it´s more about the message that is delivered to us. You can always go after others and their ways of doing things, but what matters is just being yourself. And that´s the thing Vinty always does best. She has her ups and downs, good moments and bad moments, but regardless of what is happening she doesn´t change who she is and how she feels for anyone.As I already liked the first game a lot, Without Within 2 just leaves it behind in every aspect. The story is a lot bigger, has another really relateable and important message, funny and serious moments and more Vinty! All in all a great game/VN. If you think the price is too much for 2h of this awesome experience I would recommend getting it on sale, but get it^^"

But now, she is on her trip to Australia, where she will see her favorite, and the most famous, Calligrapher in action.This tackles all about people in general. About how they managed to get on top. But little do we know that most of these people dideverything, including dirty tactics just for them be rich and powerful. As another human who strives to live every day, this is unfair because these kind of people just got a ""free ticket"" to riches and such. But I know that most rich businessmen, and probably most of us right now, strived hard to earn money and buy what we want. This is what I like about this VN, as it teaches us (probably) to work hard despite hardships in real life. This is what being a human being is all about.Pros:- Cute artwork as always!- Decent music to accompany the transition of the VN.- Improved storyline that adds more humor and decent tension.- A new character that is gives a major plot to the story.- There is definitely something charming in this VN. There is a button that shows you a video (though it sends you to YouTube)! A plus point for me.- It lets you explore Australia a bit more, accompanied by the Video buttons. It gives you a certain feel about the area. What I liked is the Sky Deck. A really unique perk done by the creator. Kudos to them!-If it started underwhelmingly, it ended good. The ending shows clips of the videos used and it's great as a recap. I really like it!Cons:- How the Visual Novel starts is very underwhelming. They should have replaced it with something more humorous and excitement-enducing for the story to improve.- This is just me, but they should introduce more of Australia! I was fun seeing the Yarra River and all that. I wish they should add more to be honest.- This time, there are no more choices unlike the prequel. Choices are always good in a Visual Novel, as they add more content and diversity. They should have included it still and just improved it.Overall, the videos are really a unique part of this VN. I really like it. This VN also teaches us a lesson, that whatever happens to us, never drag other people down just for your own good. Selfishness is a bad trait of us humans. We human beings are generally helpful to others in need. But sometimes it becomes too much, but that doesn't give us a reason to avoid helping people. We still help them to enable them to perform on there own two feet.I recommend Without Within 2 to anyone."

This time, we will travel to Melbourne, Australia, in order to meet our idol and learn to be a professional artist. The plot in the end is a bit surprising, but I think the goal was achieved. Lets see it in detail.GAMEPLAY+ Classic visual novel+ Chapter timing and animations+ Real world footages- Sometimes videos were too oftenInvertmouse made a good progress and learnt from his mistakes, that occured in the first title of this series. Visual novel stylisation and chapter timing was great. Also, Vinty's comments were hilarious. I was really surprised, when I saw real Melbourne footages, it is something that draws a player into the game. But it has to be used cautiously, too often may disrupt the player's mood.CHARACTERS+ Vinty+ Excelia+ Graceo Other were just an episodic characterVinty's comments and jokes were mentioned in the previous section. I like ""the eyes joke"" and how she was a little bit under- or overestimating situation. Excelia started as a proud and cocky star, but both characters learnt something. Excelia, that the fame is fragile and Vinty, her biggest talent is hidden within her heart.I loved also Grace, she is the type of character, that may change the world, by pushing other persons in the right way. Brilliant. Other characters made just an episodic appearance, which was expected and not bad at all.VISUALS+ Same as Without Within 1I have to say, there were no glitches, drawing and anime style were cute and bright.SOUNDTRACK+ More lively songsCompared to the predecessor, this title has more song, that are fitting in the story perfectly. Good work!SUMMARYI am pleased, that even independent developers are able to create deep, funny and original game with surprising elements. The saying ""less is sometimes more"" pays here for one hundred percent. For the price is this game perfect and a must for every visual novel collector.Strongly recommended."

There are no choices this time around.  The game almost plays more like a travelogue, but it is one filled with Vinty's feelings.  Vinty managed to grow even more adorable and identifiable, and I hope we get to see many more of her adventures in the future.For such a short game, the music is really good.  Excellia's theme in particular sounds like a boss battle."

,Not Recommended,398980,22537002,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Lyonesse,"Without Within 2 is a really short Visual Novel about Vinty, a girl who dreams to be recognized as a great calligrapher one day. Vinty is has a lovely personality. She's........ real. Unperfect, full of failures, has a lot of bad luck and she's really sarcastic and funny. In this sequel of Without Within, she'll visit Melbourne to an calligrapher event, in hopes of meeting her calligraphy idol, Excelia, and learn with her.Even though the game didn't get me, I feel sad for giving Without Within 2 a negative review because I really think that the developer put a lot of effort and creativity in this, especially in making the YouTube videos to make our Melbourne experience more realistic.Sadly, aside to Vinty funny jokes and the gorgeous videos, this game lacks a deeper plot and can't be considered a must play Visual Novel. It's fun, a bit silly but nothing special after all."

Its all great.The problem is that this is too short, I played £3.19, some will pay £4 and i got 2 hours of readability from the 16000 odd words present here. I want to like it considering how much I have enjoyed the past content from InvertMouse but this just isnt enough for me. I felt as if it should have gone on for longer no matter the topic ultimately the length of this visual novel in my opinion isnt good enough and the ending isnt explosive enough for me to for example think about it for the next week or so.All of the content in this game is top quality you just need more of it. Ill certainly look forward to future titles."

,Recommended,398980,26307506,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Ailurus Fulgens,"A relaxed smile-inducing kinetic VN that you can get through in 90-120 minutes if you read faster than a snail; the main character Vinty is the big selling point here, mainly because she's more likable and sympathetic than 90% of protagonists in your average VN.The story is simple, but it moves briskly and never feels like it bogs down in introspection (another major pitfall in the wider genre). The setting is unique too; how many games are set in Melbourne? If you're planning a trip then you could do a lot worse than preparing by giving this a playtrough; it's cheaper than a guidebook, and it includes lots of good tips for how to get around the city and places you might want to visit. The youtube video links are a nice touch too; they're a really creative way to bring the story to life.If you're on the fence, I'd check out WIthout Within 1 which is free (apart from costing 15 minutes of your life to finish), see if you like the sense of humour- chances are you'll fall in love with Vinty and want to see what she gets up to next. I'm totally in line for the next installment- it'd be cool to have her take us on a tour of Hong Kong!"

Which is great, I love this short novel and the characters, they and the city of Melbourne are all so charming. The added feature a link to view video footage of the environment in real life is excellent. I highly recommend this for fans of the first one and people who like a nice story."

(A free to play, short, visual novel, much like this one).In Without Within 1 you were able to make a few choices that change the ending to the game. However, in Without Within 2, You have NO choices to make.This game is purely reading.Despite not being able to make choices and think for myself, I really enjoyed the story and would recommend you play. Its much longer then the first game with much more visuals.Only for those who really enjoyed the first game"
