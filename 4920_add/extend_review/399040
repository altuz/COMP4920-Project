This is very frustrating. You can replay the whole level but not individual hands. This is the only thing that irks me because I am a completionist. Otherwise its a great solitaire game, reminds me of The Chronicles of Emerland Solitaire a bit with the whole companion aspect."

That game was challenging, but a smooth experience to play.This plays in a similar manner/rules, but has a lot more muddling it. Random things like a dragons flame, or locks happening, either damning you to not get a perfect (unless you're very lucky with your card draws), or necessitating going into the shop to spend money on a consumable item. It breaks the flow and makes the game frustrating.It's not a bad game but it feels like a downgrade--like there was artificial difficulty put in, just for the sake of being hard, rather than more fun. If you're about to purchase this game based on how much you like Faerie Solitaire, you might be disappointed..."

But very long, and with over 300 levels of the exact same thing I was getting very bored by the end.  Still, hard to fault a game for having too much content for those that want to keep playing.6/10"

Don't waste your money on the weapons as you can get them for free during the gameplay. Achievements are really easy, I was expecting some tough ones, minus the one where you have to beat the game (400 levels). The music is very soothing."

And this one started out to be a good one like the others.  Until you get to level 20 where it requires 4 perfects.  It seems that they have designed the game so that there is no way to get these 4 perfects.  I know how to play these games and have completed every one so far - but not this one.  I have tryed now over 8 hours of playtime to complete level 20, playing it over and over way too many times.  If you want a solitaire game that you have a chance of completing this is NOT the one. It's a shame with so much left to unlock that on the first go-through they make an impossible level. I am uninstalling this game now to make room for something that you can actually finish.  Too bad."

That's a good thing.  They're consistent, and consistently good.  The Revills Games, in particular, is very good at these games.  Their games are my favourites, by far.  Legends of Solitaire is no exception.  Fun, and looks great.  Ran beautifully on my Windows 8.1 PC after I ran the compatibility troubleshooter.  A+"

Could use more depth in those mechanisms, some rpg progression, and more actual game types of solitaire, but overall still a good game. One hopes to see further entries in the series that are similarly fantastically themed, exploring this sort of creative casual adventure (!) design."
,Recommended,399040,20139308,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,wwpatterson,"Great game! You'll play at least 400 hands... 40 levels of 10 hands each... with each level having several objectives that must be satisfied in order to unlock the next level. You'll have to replay the level, not just one hand but ten, if you don't satisfy the level's objectives. The objectives do get somewhat more difficult at the higher levels, so you might want to play on ""easy"" the first time."

Absolutely not.We're all pretty familiar with the way that solitaire works.  The rules for this one -- you have to choose cards that are sequential, not necessarily alternating between red and black suits.  The sequence can move up or down -- for example, when you have a ""four"" exposed you can either play a three or a five on it.You get bonus points for the number of cards you can play in sequence.  You also achieve bonus points for various combinations and permutations.For me -- there are so many free versions of solitaire out there that this one isn't necessary.  Yes, there is an overarching plot -- you are a group of fantasy adventurers journeying through the dangerous countryside, fighting orcs and dragons as you go.  But truly the requirements from advancing one level to another are pretty arbitrary.  And anyone who plays solitaire knows that your ultimate success is largely based on luck.Games based on luck, for me, begin to feel tedious.  Grinding is an unpleasant label you might apply to it.  Listen, I've had my fill of grinding after playing WoW for seven years.  The title ""The Insane"" was enough to convience me that I was wasting my life on sh*t that didn't matter.So I get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at games that essentially become grinding episodes.  The graphics are cool, the sound is passable, and the game enjoyable enough.  It's just that I think that there are plenty of free versions out there that makes me conclude that this one isn't worth spending money on.As always, readers should view what I write seen through the lens of the casual gamer -- that is, someone who has limited time due to family, a career, and soul-crushing student loan debt.Save yourself $9.  Buy your kids some cookies at Target."

There is only so much you can do with a solitaire game but the producers has manged to make it into a really good game. You have lots of levels to play through, different kind of weapons and potions you can buy and you get companions that give more ways to get rid of the cards. I played through the game in 11 hours but you can always replay the levels. Well worth a buy!https://youtu.be/glUSt5dlFaM"

76561198031438335,Recommended,399040,29568440,Posted: 29 January,all,Jawaka,"Kind of torn on this.  Yeah, its fun and relaxing but IMO the game elements are somewhat lacking.So you play a hand of solitaite and either you win the hand or you don't.  If you win you get more points which allows you to move on to the next section quicker.  If you don't win the hand or if you do really really bad there's no negative.  You still get points, just not as many and you just advance slower.  It turns more into a game of repetition and endurance than anything else IMO.  I wish there was a neutral option for voting as this game really isn't great but it's not necessarily bad either.  Solitaire lovers will probably enjoy it."

,Not Recommended,399040,26076982,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Bob Spigot,"Itd get a neutral if that was an option, but unfortunately it leans more towards the negative than the positive.The game is solid, its a traditional card game with two or three abilities to make it a little more interesting, but at its heart its just a single limited type of solitaire. A lot of that single limited type of solitaire.The only variation you will see over the hundreds of levels is the addition of pretty basic powers that let you remove a card or some such from the board. It really isnt enough, and there isnt much else to it. The story is dull (Though entertainingly narrated.) the art is fine but amounts to a couple dozen pretty basic images. Its all about that core game and its got about as much to it as the different variation of solitaire that comes free with most OSs.If its cheap, and you just want something to keep your hands busy while your watching TV, or taking a break, go for it. Otherwise, there is much better out there for £6."
76561198191721405,Recommended,399040,22487675,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,aoifefirth,"Legends of Solitaire: Curse of the Dragons was a card game, mini-novel, and adventure game all rolled into one. The solitaire games themselves were challenging, and you could earn credits to spend towards tools to help with challenges that arose with the cards. Each level contained a chapter of the story...more than 20 in all. The story was good, but a bit long.Overall I give the game 8/10 for giving a good story and several levels of game play. It did get a bit repetetive at times, and seemed to go on too long. If you're a card game and fantasy tale lover, you should enjoy this game a lot."

Solid game play, story is interesting enough so far (starting chapter 2), and I like that the game is not guaranteed easy - I have hands that don't go well.
