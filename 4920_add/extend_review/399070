Heres my personal breakdown of the game.PROS:- The game does a fairly good job of creating a simple story with no real dialogue- The 2D sprites are rather nice, and everything looks pretty good- There is no filler to this game, no real padding. Everything that happens is there for a reason- Your actions can actually influence (albeit slightly) the outcome of the game- The fact that you grow as you gather powerups is a nice touchPRO/CON:- The flight mechinism takes a bit to get used to. If you try to 'flap' before you start the downward part of your arc in the air, you won't really get any height. I personally like this, because it makes you feel a bit more like you're actually controlling something thats flying rather then just a double-jump like most platformers. Still, some won't care for it, so I can't just list it as a 'pro'.- I will admit... the main reason I bought this is because I LOVE games where you can play as a dragon. Not only play as one, but play as one thats not EVIL.- While I admire the 2D sprites the hand drawn pictures are... meh. Certainly better then I can draw off hand but I feel that they could have been a bit more polished looking. They aren't poorly drawn or distracting but they're not fantastic either.CONS:- Although there are no fillers, the game is very short. It took me about an hour to beat from start to finish. This is honestly the only thing that I found disapointing.- It's not immeidatly obvious that you can effect the outcome of some situations. If it weren't for the fact there are achievments for it, I wouldn't have thought I could change anything.Its not a perfect game but I'm very satisfied with it. Its fun, charming, and I hope the developer makes more dragonic games in the future."

I finished the game in a single sitting and I imagine most people will do the same. I like to avoid bringing time and money into it and focus on the experience. If you were going into a café for the first time, you might be disappointed with how  the coffee tastes. I’d say you’re far more likely to enjoy Dragon’s Wake than you are a coffee from an unknown barista and you’re looking at the same price for the experience.From an original review atAnother-Castle"

This little guy is ever so hungry, so you must catch your prey and eat up.

I enjoyed the story and artwork from beginning to end.You understand what it's like to be foreign, as you understand a tribe of kobolds' basic gestures and grunts after quick thought. You adapt to their language and understand what a certain grunt means. You bond with them. And then you even get your own child to bond with.But whether you lose your new-found family or child... It's all you. No one has any power over what happens but you. You must act quickly and cleverly to keep those you love safe. Whether you all survive, or if one sacrifice is made, or even if you're the last one standing, you must put an end to the knight who slays the misunderstood dragons.Plus points because I'm a blue dragon and the main character you play is also blue.The developer mentioned a sequel. I'm hyped and my wallet is READY."

,Recommended,399070,31779471,Posted: 15 May,all,iZG | IridiuLugia,"I played through the game 3 times to this point and can say that Dragon's Wake is a very interesting platformer to say the least, both as a concept and as a game. There are many good points about the game, but sadly it isn't perfect.Positive aspects:-Dragons:Give me one argument that speaks against dragons, especially playing as one.-Original and good-looking artworks:The artworks which appear between map sections look unique and quite good.-Original Soundtrack:Soundtrack is good, nothing more to say.-Multiple endings / decisionmaking / secrets:I won't add anything here because everything to say beyond this is a spoiler.Neutral aspects:-relatively high difficulty:Somewhat hard controls, especially in flight, along with only few prey feast on for health and new kinds of foes gives this game a quite high difficulty. Though to be fair I personally didn't have too many problems with all of these things, though many other people did.Negative aspects:-Short game: To play through the game you just need around 1 hour. If you plan on playing all endings maybe 2-3 hours. It is justifiable due to the low price, though i would have liked a longer game for a higher price instead of the opposite.-Glitches:There is a potential for the game to get glitched: For me personally a certain drawbridge didnt close and got stuck,    although being outside""fighting"" against the knight. Due to this I needed to reload the section by quitting and reloading. So there is a chance for glitches to occur in the game.-Some further things happening in the last stages:(Spoilers!):->quite bad endboss fight: Fighting the knight is quite bland and practically it is hit and run with the ground slam ability which makes the fight long and boring. Also, due to the hit and run, you die, alot.->This fricking artwork of the bad ending that appears everytime you die and refight the knight. My first playthrough where i didnt exactly knew that there are multiple endings, i got confronted with this picture of the adopted dragon beheaded in such a grusome way. In my honest opinion: Just seeing the dragon being killed onscreen would have been far enough. Just avoid the bad ending!/////Overall, especially due to the high quality and interesting mechanics for a low price, I can recommend the game.I hope that there are similar platformers (with a dragon protagonist!) in the future."

I just, really, REALLY, need to say this up front first:   We need more games with dragons as the good guys, let alone the MAIN CHARACTER.While the story itself is wordless, it's touching, and you can have your say in parts of the story.  There is consequences for not being fast enough, and for other things, but those aren't that prominent and it's really a linear game expierience.  The main way of choice is the achievements say that you can rescue people, and if you don't then well, then you didn't.  I'm trying not to spoil stuff.Despite being so short, and very linear, this game is well worth the price, especially for me since I just sold all my trading cards I was never gonna badge to buy it.  But, all those pennies added up and this game, I'm buying it with my own money now, because you just don't see a good game about dragons, and this was one.This game is hard, first time through, and the controls need to be tweaked, but all in all the 2 hour story (3 if you die a lot like I did) and the other hours + invested in getting all the achievements are all this game itself needs.This game is a gem, and I really look forward to the sequel in description here, because there's just not any good dragon games out there.  (Besides Spyro, and we all know how shortlived that was.)  So, deffinately get this game if you love dragons.  If you don't love dragons, or immagination to figure out the story, then I'm sorry."

The story is more compelling than one might expect, and the game succeeds in making you actually consider some of your actions, and makes you emotionally invested in their outcome. Very well done all-round i would say, and i look forward to seeing what the one who made this game might produce in the future."

,Recommended,399070,19632419,"Posted: 11 December, 2015",all,Kobold Miners' Labor Union,"Dragon's Wake is a game about a dragon and his reptillian buddies - ostensibly kobolds - trying to survive. As someone who likes both dragons and kobolds, perhaps more than could be considered healthy, it was a snap buy at the price point, and it was well worth the money.Let me get this out of the way: The game is very short - I'd estimate somewhere between 2 and 2.5 hours for a first playthrough and subsequent ones could likely cut that in half. The game has a little replayability (finish it, then go look at the achievements you missed, realize there might be a better ending, and go play it again), but overall I wouldn't expect to get more than 5ish hours of playtime out of this title. That said, it's $3.59, at full price. You can't go wrong.The story is delivered through images on loading screens, which works well - there's no speech or text, and none is needed. There were a few weird inconsistencies between these images - the kobolds, for instance, seem to go back and forth between having tails and not a few times, which was a little off-putting, but it's a minor complaint.As a platformer, it does a pretty decent job. The controls feel tight, though it could have stood to be a bit longer, and it could use a bit more enemy variety. There are only a couple bosses, and the difficulty ramps up considerably for the final encounter. To give some perspective, I didn't even come close to dying until the final fight, then died ~10 times before winning. Difficulty isn't a bad thing by any means, but it didn't feel like a ramp so much as running into a wall.I encountered no bugs, which is always nice.All of that said, it's a game worth playing, especially if you like riding emotional roller coasters. If it was a $10+ game, I would have a difficult time recommending it, but at $3.59, I absolutely do."

Playing as the adorable dragon from hatchling, and as they grow, really makes this game take off! My only real complaint with this is that it ends so quickly - even after a good bit of getting lost, and simply goofing off as a baby/jouvenile dragon, what it offered came to a close much too quickly for this gamer. I would really like to see this expanded into a full-length game - expanding on choices you make throughout your journey, and even out into the surface world!All in all, though, this was a very heartwarming - if, at times, challenging! - game, and I enjoyed most every moment of it."

I know, it's biased.Either way, it was enjoyable, you get to watch as the dragon grows from a hatchling up to a much larger, heavier beast. Along the way, you get to upgrade your health, the amount of wing flaps you can have in midair, and your fire breath capacity.There's two different endings, too, so that's a nice touch.Recommended because dragons. 👍"

Just look it up here on steam... 3 pages, and most of them DLC for Skyrim or the D&D games? It's a jewel.It's also a platformer but I'm none to happy with the controls. Yes they are customizable but it's the way the character responds. ""No, I said go forward, notlook up and turn around you dopefish!"" There are few moments like that, but they do show up. Towards the end, the game becomes what really feels like a rage platformer. Hey, how about a metric ton of enemies, no health pick ups, and a 3 stage boss fight? hfff... There are few times where I've wanted to pull out the BFG 9k and this is one of them.Still, this rage moment doesn't ruin the game too much. At $3 to play as a dragon? Worth it."

I like the small details at how when you eat, there's a chance that there'd be blood on your mouth and you'd casually lick it off, as well as the fact that if you try to stand on the very edge of a cliff, it will automatically walk backwards/forwards to a safe distance as if there's a sense of caution within this dragon you control. Although pixelated and short, I do love how you can change the storyline a little bit and see what amazing work of art appears when you traverse between a section of the game, whether it be horrifying, sad, or happy.

The art was great, and the entire game looks adorableThe colors really help build the tone all the way through.  The music was great too, and it also added to the atmosphere.  The dragon controls really well, and I loved the upgrade system.  It was simple and effective, encouraging exploration to find each of the upgrades, and effectively putting the player in scenrios where they would have to upgrade a couple times so they can learn.  Most of this game is designed very, very well.  The visual storytelling in this game through both the loading screens and events depicted in the game iteself is very effective, far more than a game like FF13 where the writers felt the characters had to talk about everything rather than actually show it.  It was very well done, and it made the experience even better.HOWEVER,The final boss was aggravating.  It was a huge spike in difficulty that didn't match the rest of the game at all.  While most of the game emphasized movement, even in combat against normal enemies, the final boss gives so little options for moving and dodging.  The final boss moves far too quickly to dodge effectively, and it turned what should have been a triumphant and satisfying ending into a frustrating half-hour grind to memorize his patterns.  It was like taking someone who had only ever played Kirby's Epic Yarn and tossing them headfirst into Darksouls.Overall, the pros far outweigh the one con.  The ending was good, and after seeing the achievement for finishing, it gave me reason to play the game again.  You'll see what I mean when you beat it yourself ;)  I can easily recommend this game to friends, and the price tag perfectly matches the time taken to finish, especially considering the replayability and difficulty of the final boss.  Great game.There is excellent groundwork here.  I would love to see a larger action platforming game based on this one with the same control and concepts.  A longer game would be excellent, but I know how hard it is to develop a full game with so few people.  Fantastic job for what it is, and I would love to see more.PS: Very satisfying to play a game focused on a good dragon for once ;)  Sure, there are games like Drakengard where there are segments of playing as a dragon, but this is honestly the first game I have played where the dragon protagonist is a good-hearted character and is the focus of the gameplay as well.

From there I chased down (and ate) some mice and spiders.However, it's not all fun and games in this fun game.This is the game of slaying monsters from the perspectice of the monster. In the games simple story the antagonist felt more real and scary the the antagonsits of most tripple A games. 2016 has not gone on very long but this had my favorite final boss of anything this year.I am a beleiver that the final boss should be much harder than what would be resonable, as you have already experinced the game to its fullist. The final boss should be a culminaion of the journy leading up to it and not just running pushing switches or if it is Assasans Creed hold the block key until the boss dies in a movie clip.

I originally didn't expect different endings from a game like this, and the event triggers to unlock each ending feel intuitive and are very well executed. I give this game full points. The gameplay was unique and intuitive (although the control reminders did look a bit out of place after awhile), the sprite and music design are pleasant, and the final boss fight is challenging and is difficult regardless of your endings. The most notable thing in the game, however, is the game's art in the loading screens. The art is well made and you can tell it was hand drawn. This gives it a very unique feel, as the art is incredible and also charming. This game is a gem I reccomend all dragons give a nibble."

The graphics are good for this type of game, and the loading screen art fits the style. The story is a little short, but the gameplay fully makes up for it. The controls can be weird sometimes, mainly flying, but is overall easy to use (Just the Arrow Keys and three others). The difficulty curve turns exponential near the end of the game, going from challenging but not hard to nigh impossible until you figure out the 'puzzle'  (If you don't ragequit by that point). The overall best aspect of this game in my opinion (Besides Dragons) is the music. The music for every area fit so well with what was going on, especially the joyful, happy music of the grassy caves. Every game has it's flaws, but I still rate this a 10/10 (I've always been a sucker for dragons :P)."

I like that the story is shown, not told, as that makes it surprisingly effective. Unfortunately, because I had no indication that anything important was happening, I moved forward like normal, and so I failed every ""choice"". I put that in quotes because it's not really a choice. It's more of ""Pay attention here and intuitively do the right thing the first time or you're losing a party member."" Because I was given no indication of how to save people until it was too late, those moments lost their effectiveness. I didn't feel like I made the wrong choice, I felt like the game made me feel bad for not instinctively knowing what it wanted me to do.However, I did feel bad, and I was going to leave a positive review. That is, until I hit the final boss and remembered my major gripe with the game. This is a platforming game with shoddy controls. It's quite forgiving about that fact in every place except boss fights. To fight a boss, you need control and finesse. You need to be able to quickly maneuver your character. In this game, you cannot. I caught on pretty quickly to what I needed to do (unlike those ""choices"", you can redo boss fights if you die), but I couldn't do it because the dragon doesn't do well if you're doing anything other than flying in open spaces. It's a good thing you're given a lot of health over the course of the game, because boss fights burn through them ridiculously fast.I'm sure this review comes across as me complaining because I'm bad at the game, but I had little difficulty outside of the aforementioned problems. Just try and play this game and tell me the controls are intuitive and effective.I wouldn't exactly say that people shouldn't buy this game, but I'm not convinced that it's worth even $3.99. I would recommend getting it on sale if you can. I think I bought it for 25% off, which is probably about what I'd value it at. It's a shame. I wanted to wholeheartedly recommend it, but controls are crucial to a good platformer, and that is this game's greatest failing."

It doesn't help that the trailer sells it as a more open game than the linear ""you get like few choices that barely affect the end screen of the game"" type of game that it is. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. I experienced a fair number of glitches playing through this, which given the level of complexity of the game is... not great. Game has a mild difficulty spike half way through, then a massive one at the end boss. I was probably only able to beat it inside an hour on the good end run because of one of those glitches making the end boss not able to hit me. Several enemies have designs that on paper are pretty cool, but in the level design present are annoying as ****. Flying is admittedly cool in that it's not just a double jump thing, but its also a bit wonky to try and master, and the game expects you to pretty quickly with some of the platforming.I don't have a problem with short games if they are fun, but this game is a fairly lukewarm title at best, just above the quality of a flash game, and it costs $4 for an hour of that. Even if you replay for different endings it shouldn't take more than 2 hours, maybe a total of an hour and a half if you're good and not trying to get all the acheivements. To be blunt, for that price I could have rented a movie that I would have enjoyed more than this, and it could have even lasted longer with some. Even more bluntly, I could have played flash games from 2005-2010 era that would last as long and be much more entertaining for free. I don't have a problem paying for quality entertainment, nor short games, and I think that asking for this to be free would be cruel and unfair, but honestly after playing it, it felt like it was worth 2 dollars to me. So if it's on sale for that price and you want something dragony, you could do worse, but otherwise I'd probably avoid it."

,Not Recommended,399070,19745657,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,SuperNerdyNate,"This game had a lot of promise and it was overall a huge let down. The story as far as I know is there is a black knight who wipes our the dragons and it's your job to hatch, grow up and fight the black knight. Well, an hour into the game I was given what I assume it the boss fight. This is the second boss fight, I've only had one dragon friend in my brood(though the screenshots show having more) and he gets killed RIGHT before this fight happens. The fight itself is EXCRUCIATINGLY difficult. I'm talking a HUGE jump in difficulty compared to the rest of the game.The first part of the fight is so small and cramped that more often then not you'll get locked into a corner and get killed, and since the flight mechanics aren't great you often miss the rocks you have to smash or don't trigger the smash at all. The second part of the fight only offers you two goblins (worth two hearts each) for food, but you're going to lose easily two hearts if the enemy gets close and will often find stopping to eat these guys puts you in more danger. You can't melee fight this guy because his sword attacks hit ridiculously fast, he jumps around just as fast as you do, summons random ghosts (literally random spawning, I had one spawn IN me during the fight) that have a very far flight path that you have to dodge, he has an AOE that has a very large range and fires arrows at you. The only tactic I had to fight this guy was run at him and chomp away while he summoned ghosts.THEN, after taking him down to NO health, he turns to a ghost and flies around JUST AS FAST as you and non-stop melee's. I assume it's a 'survive long enough to espace' kind of deal, but it's a small arena with barely any room to stop and recharge your flight long enough to keep away from him.This could have been a really cute adorable game if it were longer, had at least one or two more companions and boss fights that let you bring those companions in to the fight. I mean, the trailer even said I'd need to protect my dragons but I didn't even get the chance to. Directly after he ran off to get his fire breathe, we went into the boss fight."

It's a really simple platformer and while the concept is cute, the execution leaves a lot to bedesired.Consider this: There is an achievement (mommy) that is literally achieved simply for getting to somewhere near the end of the first level (less than 5 minutes of gameplay).According to world wide stats, less than half the people who own the game have actually achieved this simple goal (of playing for a few minutes). The other achievements are completed by even less people (less than a third have begun the second level, which is about 1 minute past the first achievement, just for showing up there)What does that tell you? Most of the people who own the game don't bother getting past the first few minutes of gameplay without realizing how bad the controls are and giving up.Where does the 88% positive reviews come from? I don't know.If you like old school graphics, routine platformers and don't mind bad controls. This might be the game for you.On the positive side, you can get this on sale pretty frequently. I think it cost me about 25 cents with a coupon so I almost feel guilty for complaining. But what this game really reminds me of is some of the bad arcade games of the 1980's. The kind you put a quarter in once and never play again. (don't get me wrong, there's plenty of old school arcade games worth dumping lots of quarters into, this just isn't one of them)I paid 25 cents, I feel bad complaining about it. But I litterally just spent 5 mintues being frustrated by the bad controls and felt like complaining at someone over it, because there is little else to do in the game but jump and walk, and the game is bad at both.Had the controls been nice and tight, this would have been a cute game about jumping around as a baby dragon."

As others have stated, the controls are somewhat difficult, but I found upon a second playthrough that it was a lot easier after some practice. Playtime was just under 2 hours for me on the first run, but with the multiple routes, I was looking forward to trying out more. Short and sweet. I kind of wish there was something to do at the ending, or maybe a tiny bit more of an epilogue to make it feel more rewarding, but it's based on a set and linear storyline, so eh.My two complaints are similar to that of another review: food placement and the final boss. Potential spoilers from here on.It's mainly the skeleton dungeons that have food troubles. It's a quick rise in difficulty from the rest of the game, as everywhere else you're given loads of food to keep your health up, and the enemies here (mostly the ghost skeletons for me) are harder to evade. Even in the mass goblin/kobold/orange people battle, their bodies made it easy to survive the whole thing. Whereas, in the dungeons... yeah, let's just say I got stuck in a portion near the end that I had to do over a few times before I could proceed. Kind of frustrating. I'd suggest having food sources taper out towards the end, to train the player to get used to having less healing, though I don't know how difficult it would be to change.Speaking of healing... yeah, the final boss. It was hard. Disproportionately hard from the rest of the game. Maybe five times harder than the skeleton dungeons. Impossible, to many if not most players. I tried to get the game refunded because it was that hard, and I was convinced I would never see the ending, or any ending. Frustrating, and not in the good way. There has to be some way to ease the difficulty on this boss. Maybe more invincibility frames. Maybe less knockback from the sword. If nothing else, adding in some sort of... catchable, non-damaging source of healing would help. Please fix this.Overall, a nice game. I enjoyed it, and I'll try to get the other routes.

I am getting tired of games like that or a game where you can be a dragon to some extent for a part of the game and its locked behind an energy bar that is limited or only can be one in certain areas (Divinity II and Shyvana in League of Legends are examples).The struggle throughout Dragon's Wake could be felt, and going through the ""bad/dark"" ending sequence had my heart strings rather torn and I was sad to see many of the tragedies that did happen throughout. It made fighting the final boss rather epic as the only way to stop such destruction of innocent lives was to end that dark knight. Even after he was defeated, you could feel the emptiness each of the characters felt for losing their loved ones (each artwork depicted all that emotion rather well. Kudos to the artist!)The only two criticisms I can offer is the jumping in the game is rather ""clunky"". Not so much what it looks like or how it handles, but rather you have little to no control while mid air which makes precision rather difficult and frustrating. I spent a lot of this game trying to jump properly. If there was more control for mid-air gliding that would be fantastic.The other is please allow a manual save and allow disabling of auto-saving features.

The game itself is charmingly simple; I won't give any spoilers, but all the puzzles are simple to figure out and the success of discovery is a great feeling throughout gameplay. Without any words, the story is able to be told well, and I think that is a selling point in an of itself.The game does have a few technical cons. At some points when I was changing screens, I found my dragon getting stuck in rock walls! (haha I did manage to get an acheivement for flying for ten seconds because of that). Sometimes, especially with a controller, the button presses don't seem to compute properly and I had a hard time breathing fire because of it, or beating the final boss. But even with those issues, I managed relatively quickly, and there's nothing I saw that would cause progess to be lost. Once you reload, the dragon loads in his proper place again and all is well.I think the thing I was most impressed with was the flying, though. Not only does it seem far more real than any other game I play with similar mechanics, it has a puzzle solving charm to it all its own! Managing to fly for longer and longer periods of time seems like a key part of the dragon's growth as well, and I found myself jumping and flying around just for the pure fun of it a lot of times! It's very, VERY well worth it.The money was well spent. I look forward to more innovative ideas and cute stories."

A lot of details, and beautiful environment; those small figures running, interacting with you, and it's telling a story with those figures, without words.

Honestly I have not seen a wordless narrative done so well in a game in a long time it will give you quite a wide range of emotions on your way through as long as you let yourself get emerged in its world. Wjen i say silent i mean it to there aren't even any screen popups for tutorials or anything and charecters only interact with you through body language which comes of really natural.Contols are smooth and easy to handle moving along the ground is slow but jumping and gliding allow you to get around much faster. You can also find creatures around the world you can kill and eat for powerups like more jumps or fire breathing. The only issue i had was trying to activate the slam attack which did not seem to work to well and felt like it was eating my inputs, but that may have just been me.Graphics are clean and i never felt like i was confosued at what I was looking at. The entire thing looks between nes and snes in graphical quality which is fine for me. On the other hand the game features portraits during level transitions and to mark checkpoints while they are not the most beutiful works ive ever seen they have alot of detaila nd you can tell there was alot for love put into each one.The length may be the only real dealbreaker here for some as the game can be beaten in about 30 minutes and even getting the optional endings will only beef that up to about 2 hours max.

A full review to come once I get the other endings and achievements (as, after reading the reviews, I've come to believe that this game is relatively short - 100%'able in 2-3 hours).Dragon's Wakeis an adventure platformer, a genre I don't normally play. And it showed - I couldn't completely control the flying mechanic, even towards the end of the game. The dragon you play as likes to clip onto the edges of certain platforms (and will automatically walk towards the anchor point). Not sure what the point of that was. The final boss was particularly frustrating for me since the boss had 2 stages, and its second stage is relentless.I think the most redeeming quality of this game is the way it presents its story. You start as a newborn dragon (fresh out of the egg), and must learn about the world you've hatched in.Dragon's Wake's story is mainly a tale of a dragon's path to adulthood, with a rite of passage involving the slaying of the final boss - a threat to dragons and friends of dragons in this world.There's a certain charm to the pixel graphic sprites, the gestures and cues that the kobolds use (according to the top review on the page, the green guys that help you are kobolds), and the limited amount of text on the screen (in fact, I don't recall seeing ANY text throughout the game, barring loading screens - just button prompts and infographics).The music is pretty decent and helps to convey certain feelings, especially since there's no text to do so in this game. The art during the loading screens is, I would hazard to guess, drawn by a hobbyist instead of a professional. I have no real qualms about this, but I just thought I'd point that out.Overall, what would I give this? Meh...right now I'd say a 7/10. Recommended, but not an entirely GREAT game. I got it for 10% off ($3.59), but 10% off $3.99 isn't much of a difference.

76561198069828741,Recommended,399070,28085590,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Argent Rampancy,"I really hesitate to recommend this game for a single reason--the final boss. But before I go into that, here's my thoughts about the rest of the game.First off, it's got a cute art style that while pixelated is easy on the eyes and still manages to convey a lot of character detail. Starting off as a newly hatched dragon and learning the ropes through solid tutorials both obvious and subtle was nice as well (for example, the game has ""Press Z to jump"" printed on the wall but also has lighted crystals in certain parts to show you a glide and jump path). It feels natural to play, and the controls are decently responsive without being twitchy.There's a definite sense of progression too, as you upgrade your jumping/gliding, health, and fire breath via in-game creatures, many of which are hidden in areas you'd miss just sprinting through the game. Plus, as you progress, you'll grow larger in size, which seems to upgrade your jumping height by extension. While it was disappointing to not ever reach the size of an adult dragon, it didn't really take too much away overall.The enemies are fair and easy to figure out once you've run into them a few times. Most of the creatures in the game are passive, although later on you'll run into beasts that will aggressively approach you on sight rather than meandering around or only attacking when you're close enough. Discerning what will hurt you on contact (bats, for one) and what won't is trial-and-error, but it comes quickly and easily enough.Now for some complaints. I felt some aspects of the branching story (which really only branches into ""Lonely Ending"" and ""Hero Ending"") were not obvious the first time around, and felt a little too obtuse. The enemies could be frustrating at times, especially during the first 'boss' when a bunch of ranged and melee enemies would swarm you. Luckily it was never too overwhelming; but it never felt challenging in a good way, just annoying.Which brings me to the boss. Apparently, his difficulty was increased at some point in a quiet update. I only just got the game so I cannot confirm this, but from reading forum posts and guides it seems his attacks are much faster, more responsive, and therefore more difficult. However where it runs from ""challenging"" to ""rage-inducing"" is when this difficulty runs into a few before-this minor problems with the controls and gameplay.For one, the boss cannot be defeated with your fire breath and fireball attacks alone. You need to learn to effectively use the 'ground pound' attack, and dart in and out during certain attacks. The problem here is that the controls can be somewhat clumsy, especially with the jumping and ground pound, making the first phase of the boss a test in praying the controls respond and good ol' luck (hoping he'll stay on the lower level, letting you pound stone blocks onto his head without taking too many hits instead of jumping up to slash you or spamming his AOE attack). Where before the unresponsiveness would mean losing a heart to some skeleton or goblin, now it means forfeiting at least two or three hearts to a rapid-fire assault of sword slashes.The second phase isn't much better, but in hindsight it's more about taking the shots you can in between dodging around his hyper-fast and jumpy movements. It took me about 20 tries, quitting, taking a break, and then coming back in a single attempt to beat the boss. It's all about keeping yourself alive more than dealing damage.Then, after you've finally managed to beat his second stage, the boss comes back for one last go, where he chases you at lightning speed slashing away. Basically at that point it's all about jumping and mashing C, and just hoping you've got at least 8-10 hearts to work with as he cuts you to pieces as you attack.Then, you're done. And unfortunately as much fun as I had with the first 90% of this game, the ending battle really soured the experience for me. But you should pick the game up and experience it for yourself. It's a fun little game that won't take long to beat at a more than reasonable price point."
