Graphics aren't great, either.Pretty much the same as the XBOX Live indie game version, at least so far.Worth about $1 or less in my opinion. Buy it only if you're an achievement hunter or a masochist."

(Even on Sale) for that matter.It's overuse of QTE, and ""Zombie Filler"" is a joke. It just spawns waves of Zombieswhile you fight with the ""Awkward Controls"" (cannot change) while you wait for thetimer to run out to progress.The Story is supposed to be funny, but just ends up being Awkward/Cringe in the end.Nothing makes sense,  you're seeking BBQ Sauce in a ******* Zombie Apocalypse...I reached level 12/24, and could not force myself or viewers through anymore of it.As it was I had to Cut/Edit 30% of the footage because of UI bugs overlapping gameplay.And what does ""Massive Cleavage"" have to do with Zombies anyway?Just a cheap attempt to stir up controversy, to keep buyers attention from the lack of""Game"" & Repetitivefiller, & awful Controls.Game Score - Subject To ChangeArt Style8/10 (Unique, overall nice look)- The over use of cleavage, it's just over the top.Gameplay/Content3/10 - (Empty & Repetitive)Just kill Zombies, ""Rinse & Repeat. Nothing else to do.Controls1/10 - (Just no, just no.)Lacks Key Remap option, LMB-High, RMB-Low ""Attack"" would have been better.Story2/10 - (Tries to hard to be funny...)A serious story mixed with ""Humor"" would have gone a lot further.Bugs/Glitches6/10 (Ui Overflow Edge, Overlapping Gameplay, ""Not Closing"")This happened after I changed my resolution, and the main menu was cut off lol.In the end it really lacks the ""Awesome"" in Awesome EditionMaybe one day this will be ready/worth $5, but right now it has a lot of work/fixesto catch up to the price it's asking. I have nothing aginst the Dev, but it needs al ot of work.#THANKGODFORSTEAMREFUND"
76561198071884325,Not Recommended,399130,33525749,Posted: 13 July,all,Lord_Vengeance,"Ugh... where to begin?This is a 2d zombie chopper. You play in a static 2D scene as dozens of zombies pour in at you from both sides of the screen. You can move back and forth, have a high and low attack, and... well, that's about it. No jumping, no special moves, just chop high and chop low. There's about 6 or 7 enemies including crawling zombies, zombie children, and... flying frigging dogs (yes you heard that right). Later on in the game, it throws in a few top down 3D levels, which are the only tolerable levels in the game as far as gameplay. Unfortunately, they are very short.Graphics--------------------Great if you like comic book style cut scenes, 2D backdrops, and characters with very little animation. Don't expect anything grand. And don't expect any material to wank off too. If you can wank off to badly drawn girls with blood covered cleavage, then you are a ""special"" person indeed. No, even boobs couldn't save this game...Story--------------------Well... there really isn't any. You're looking for BBQ sauce in a zombie apocalypse, so... yeah...Gameplay--------------------Monotonous, repetetive, boring, you get the picture... The controls are godawful in 2D. There is an obvious lag between pressing a button and the character executing the action, and sometimes I would hit the button and nothing would happen. You also can do only one thing/button at a time; attack, move, turn. IE, you can't move and attack at the same time, which is really annoying when you have a dozen enemies flying at you from both directions. You can't remap the buttons, which is not a big deal because you only use about 4. Another REALLY annoying thing was that when a zombie gets right on top of you, they seem to become invulnerable, as you just can't seem to hit them, so they just sit there draining your health while you flail your cleaver at them hitting nothing. About 20 levels of 2D frustration...Redeeming Qualities---------------------------It's short... At the time of this review I had 2.7 hours into the game and 100%ed it. Normally, this would not be a redeeming quality, but in this case I was thankful it was over fast.3D levels. If these had been a lot longer and a bit more polished, and had there been more of them, it would have been great. I would have even preferred that the whole game been like this with none of the 2D levels. I'll not buy another 2D game from this developer, but if they came out with a top down 3D shooter or something, I would consider checking it out.The Final Word----------------------------------I wanted to quit this game early on, but I decided recently that I would try to 100% every game I played. So, at about level 16, I threw it into ""too easy"" mode, and slogged my way through to the end. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in awhile. I've been gaming for over 20 years, and I'm sorry to say this is one of the worst I've ever played. You remember Pong for the Atari 2600? I think I had more fun playing Pong by myself with both joysticks than I did playing this game...:smiles:"

You get no scores or rewards for killing endless hordes of zombies. There's no kill counters or timer countdown, so you don't know when  you're supposed to beat a stage.When you die, there's no death scene or sound effect. Only a game-over screen saying ""YOU FAIL."" For a horror game, that's really lame. Shows laziness on the game developers' part.I bought a copy of the game while it was on sale for $2.49. And it's still a waste of money!"

There isn't much to the game other than crude humor and gore and it's all done very poorly. I can't believe that $4.99 is the regular price for this garbage. I picked it up for $0.49 and it's not even worth that."
,Not Recommended,399130,26452236,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Suicidal Sheep,"It is as advertised.I do like the art style of the CS's. But thats about it. The gameplay is repentive and the controlling is not good enough for the amount of reaction you need.It starts very easy, but gets insanely difficult with a lot of button mashing after a while.I'd like it probably more with a cutscene after you fail instead of a simple ""You failed"".Not recommended due to its boring gameplay. Better check some Newgrounds Flash games for free."

It had the right amount of gore, the right amount of campy humor during the cut scenes, it had some profanity sprinkled in for good measure, and it wasn't too hard to 100%. If you take a tongue-in-cheek attitude and like to hack and slash mindlessly at zombies, I think you'll get a kick out of this game when it's on sale."

I guess that's why developer gave you 20-10 lives to pass such levels. If it would be normal game from sane dev you would need 1 life to pass such area.not recommended, especially if you're a female - the whole game is disgusting from female standpoint. tasteless, rude, sexist shovelware.0/10 - uninstalled and removed permanently from my library - I don't want to be ashamed of myself for keeping this trash in my library"
