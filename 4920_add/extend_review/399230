It's so glitchy, it's literally impossible to get any ""cooking"" done in this cooking simulator. Great concept, veeery terrible execution. At least make it free. Do not buy this game, oh my goodness, it's pitiful. Someone put it out of its misery."

You can't pick up food so you could put them into the grill, you need to use a spatula or some♥♥♥♥♥♥to juggle it around the room.Game made by russians and I can see it. (Not by quality, it's because there's vodka in the kitchen)"

The guns work real well, too. I never thought I could get enough potatoes or bread or whatever the hell the light brown turd is supposed to be. Speaking of♥♥♥♥♥♥ aside from the game itself, if you leave a carrot on the grill and forget about it whilst attempting to place a patty on the stove, it turns into quite the log. When I myself fall through the floor, I almost pee my pants out of excitement. The random speech bubbles contain a lot of meaning and add a whole lot to the game, my favorite being ""chicken"". I highly recommend this game if you want to blow out your brains and haven't found a good reason to do so yet.Once again, thank you greenlight users for voting for a game with great integrity and a jaw-dropping storyline."

,Recommended,399230,32946046,Posted: 28 June,all,Byronasaures Rex,"Wake up in random diner, spatula in hand. Flip off angry customer, find a gun, and shoot up everyone. But nobody cares. Attempt to make food and get angry, continue flipping off customers. Eventually power goes out and confusion sets in. Reset game and try again. 10/10 would play again. and again. and again."
,Not Recommended,399230,25720853,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,Verdantil,"Tags: Simulator - Clumsy/HumorAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Its trashAlthough this is marked as a finished game it feels like an EA title. The physics of items bouncing around the tables when you walk past them and other little things lead me to think this was meant to be some kind of surgeon simulator clone in a kitchen. The game had poor performance on my old computer, there was also a lot of clipping from my character around walls and whatnot, there seems to be a lot of ideas in here, I've read a news post by the dev saying you gotta keep the generator powered with a fuel can, and the menu opens up the character's cell phone with a bunch of intriguing looking options like ordering different spatulas or a calling in a cow tipper. However, when it comes down to it all you can do in this game is run around in circles for five minutes and stab at things with the end of your cooking utensil. I will try going through the tutorial and give this game a fair chance in a few more patches, if it receives any...In the meantime I do not recommend this game"
