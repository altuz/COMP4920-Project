The control scheme -- as many other reviewers have mentioned -- is just simply too clunky for the game to be much fun.What I mean is, mostly, it's hard to really classify this as a platformer (albeit a puzzle platformer, even) because everything is always interrupted a thousand times by clunkily shooting arrows.  As others have mentioned (again), you have to click on the KNIGHT in order to change between shot types as well.For now I'm going to give this a ""No"".. but I really do think there's something good here as far as the concept and level design.  If the controls were patched SOMEHOW I'd give the game another shot for sure."

Sure, it's clunky, but it just came out and the game mechanics work, it's fun, and it's only 65 cents as of August 31st 2015. A fun little game and it's definitely worth a buy. The audio is a little messed up as of now but still-- 65 cents people. And it will most likely be patched in the future."

For $1 this is a good amount of content for a puzzle game when you compare it to something like Portal honestly. It introduces new mechanics to make you re-think your stategy for the puzzles. Every level has 3 objects to collect if your a completionist.Rating: 8/10
,Not Recommended,399430,18921505,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,VeganMeatloaf,"Interesting concept, terrible execution.This falls victim to the same thing that made me not enjoy Portal 2 as much. You're given an ability, but you're incredibly limited by it. Imagine if the Flash could only run on sidewalks, or if Batman could only grapple onto white outcroppings. Sure, the game would be incredibly easy if everything could have an arrow in it, but the amount you're limited saps the game of any fun.The physics aren't all that great either. Everything feels very loose. Boxes are way lighter than they look, and if you're standing on an arrow you shot at an angle you'll slide down it. The visuals are awful as well. I'd expect this level of quality from a free flash game, but charging a dollar is ridiculous.Another major issue I have is the way you select arrows. In the level it tells you about it in, it says to click the Tinboy dude. This shows three bubbles, each representing a different arrow. The hitbox for triggering the menu is way off, resulting in you opening the menu for switching arrows when you try to shoot. What makes this worse is that you can also switch arrows by pressing 1, 2, and 3. There's no options menu to change any of this either.I honestly cannot reccomend this to anyone, not even for the 14 cents its been available for this week."

It's a decent puzzle game with much room for inventive scenarios. A level editor would have been nice. But once again ""Cheap Unity Game.""It's playable, its cheap, its fun at times, and it works. And as most Cheap Unity Games have it has Trading cards. Overall it seems like a game that would be in a Math Game site under the ""Physics Games"" disguise so they can have real games there also.It should bring you an unspecified amount of time of enjoyment. Depending on where you stand in the I like ""Puzzle Games scale."" I'd recommend if it goes cheap to grab it though. It's worth the money with 60 levels."

(and not the ones exclusively at the num pad)Hello!I decided to write this review to tell that you do not need to click on the knight to change arrow type. Yes, that's a way, but not the only one. I've seen this on 2 reviews just by doing a quick roll. So I'd like to defend this point because it would be some terrible design decision indeed. But I'm not criticizing the reviews too. Maybe controls were updated, I don't know!!! :DSo, about the game in general, yeah, there are some bugs, physics are sometimes strange and the song can be annoying, but the concept is good and the levels are not easy.

,Recommended,399430,17923062,"Posted: 6 September, 2015",all,Effgee,"Cheap game, so I bought it and did a video for it. Check out the video to get a sense of the gameplay or read my quick review below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBXKkQfxB0Tinboy is a puzzle-platform game in the 8bit style.  Players must make their way through various levels of an AI Testing Arena, starting at one door and navigating various platforms and obstacles to reach an exit.  They are aided in this by the use of a multi-purpose bow which can fire ordinary arrows, rope arrows or exploding arrows. Each arrow type enables the player to affect different game mechanics.Pros:+puzzles have a basic structure but could be solved a number of ways+mechanics are simple but allow for depth of level design+puzzles appear to be well thought out+challenging enough to maintain interest+difficulty scales in a reasonable wayCons:-some controls are not intuitive (double jump to release rope, finicky bow aiming method)-UI is a little unintuitive (surely an ESC menu for quitting isn't too much to ask)-No options menu (for turning down/off game audio, for example or rebinding keys)-Graphics get a bit fuzzy when upscaled.-Doesn't fully support a controller (it would play better with a controller, imho)It's a pretty fun, little puzzle-platformer and, for the price they're asking, it's worth it. So, I'll give it a thumbs up."

,Recommended,399430,18882690,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,Macanori,"It's actually a good game for what it is. If I where to pick one thing out, the controls are a bit unresponsive. People do tend to have trouble with the drawback mechanism, but its only problem is it's a bit unresponsive unless you pull back horizontally, which in most cases you need to shoot on an angle, and the clicking on the character to change weapon types isn't too bad either. One suggestion I would make is to change the overall layout, like making an HUD where you can press 1 to use standard arrows, 3 for explosives, and 2 for grappiling hook. It's a simple game and it is challenging, not because of the controls, but because it's a difficult game, and welcomingly so. Overall, it's a good way to waste time if you really have nothing else to do or if you enjoy a good challenge especially for the price. It costs as much as a crappy iPhone game but it has better quality, and not to mention the 200 FPS gameplay, and I don't even have a good graphics card."
