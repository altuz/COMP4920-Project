(The map looks boring as hell though.)-Buy menu is completely ♥♥♥♥ed, you shoot your gun when trying to click on the transparent buy menu.You also can't exit the menu, you have to walk out of spawn.-You can't exit the game normally, you have to alt-f4.-Guns have less recoil than Call of Duty.In conclusion this is another one of those Minecraft copy and pasted games with guns, except they managed to put in several thousand times less effort.A ton of Roblox games are higher quality than this.And this is supposed to cost a dollar.Another example of quality control on steam."

Since the game is a template, the graphics are just basic voxel graphics that make unturned's graphics look godly in comparison. This also means that the only sound you'll be hearing is basic gunshot noises and the music in the game will be nonexistant.But what about the controls, you say? The controls just feel a bit too clunky, and the game runs at a low FPS (15) despite the low graphical quality. The class selection screen makes it confusing on how to load the game, and exiting the game is broken, because there is no ""quit game"" option, you must do the alt+F4 trick instead! This game is the textbook definition of a template used as an attempt to earn some quick revenue from foolish buyers, whether they do it ironically or not."

,Recommended,399580,33366417,Posted: 8 July,all,Marshadow24,"Today's gamers are spoiled by the common practices of the modern gaming industry and its shady quirks that they'll call any incoming game that isn't already from a well known franchise with microtransactions the common muck of one's game library. Nuclear Shot is an unfortunate victim of the neglectful bangwagon upon it as always with new games attempting to do its own thing, minding its own business.People, as always, will glance at a game and make quick assumptions of it with no real thought. For Nuclear Shot, the common gamer will generically call it a Minecraft & CS:GO hybrid-ripoff without a second thought. This is all too common for this game and will just hurt the game and its already puny community even more, never letting them grow into something significant, even before it started growing in the first place.One may say; ""There's been an influx of games trying to replicate or capture the popularity of games like Minecraft and CS:GO to make a quick buck, pushing out horrible games. Nuclear Shot seems like the prime candidate for this kind of thing"". May I tell the person that those games in and of themselves have very generic concepts that can be warped into limitless forms, not even original themselves in those games, and that Nuclear Shot hasabsolutelynothing to do with Minecraft. Nuclear shot is like an interactive piece of art. Not all people appreciate art as much as the next guy, but it still undeniably is art.Nuclear Shot has a specific charm that won't touch everyone, but when it does touch, it makes one love the game forever. Some people just can't grasp the concept of this beautiful game, and it sickens me knowing these people will go on with their lives, leaving this masterpiece in the dust.Nuclear Shot could have been a greatly appreciated game. Though, due to negative (specific) circumstances and blind criticism from the mainstream gamers, Nuclear Shot even having a sliver of hope to rise up sounds like a fairy tale. I hope people can not be so harsh on a game that has little-to-no connections with other similar games of it in the modern gaming community. We had 2 world wars and slavery back then but eventually progressed through them. Why can't we with video games?"

Each one is massive--too big for any one person to explore fully in the span of a day--and if you’re the first to discover one, you not only get to name it, you also get first dibs on any discoveries contained within. This is a game about travel, survival, and commerce, backed by impressive tech that allows for near seamless transitions from ground to space. There are multiple layers to consider, and while some details will make your journey feel more genuine, there are flaws that occasionally derail your investment in the odyssey. However, there's an intriguing narrative that contextualizes your in-game actions, making for a fascinating experience that ultimately trumps issues that appear early on."
