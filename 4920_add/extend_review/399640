This game is NOT a MOBA.Why you should buy this game-You love roguelikes, like FTL and Binding of Isaac-You love ridiculous item/ability combinations. Yeah, that 2x damage from your dagger stacks with the 428% damage bonus from the backstab ability. What's that? You just completed your item set? Well now every stab you make with your (lightning quick) dagger has a chance to stun your enemy for 2 seconds. That's if they survive the 3 attacks you make for 2000 damage.-Seriously, it's so much fun how much everything in this game goes together. Stacking cooldown reduction on a human? Cover the entire map in turrets and squires. Your dwarf with a sword started with whirlwind? Upgrade your sword and you become a majestic dervish that clears the entire map of enemies within seconds.-You love quick, action packed gameplay that is very well refined.-You love engaging boss battles with unique abilities.This past week i've picked up the new DOOM and Overwatch, and I find myself spending most of my time playing *this* game of all things. Seriously, if you're still reading this and you like action-rpgs this game is a must."

You get random spawns including races and skills. You unlock more races and skills as your characater levels up and there's a ton of flavor and variety in how you can choose to play each run. Some-what like Rogue Legacy without the permanent progression of leveling up your castle or upgrading classes.The combat is top-down and feels very much like Binding of Isaac with its control pattern and movement style. You can choose what items to buy, what skills to upgrade, what armor sets to complete, what gods to gain favor with to get blessings all allowing every playthrough to feel unique in some way.A playthrough takes 20-40 minutes. The game also offers a hard-mode and a daily challenge which is the same configuration for all players to race each other against."

You also still have the reroll option that will reroll like normal. The blizzard animation was also changed is SOOO Much better!!THANK YOU DEVS!!!! I changed my recommendation from a no to a yes. These small changes literally make the game SO much better!!! I can now grind through with a guy and retry as many times as I want which gives ample time to learn the ability combos first run through. And then start learning the patterns the next few times.  I cannot express how critical this was for my enjoyment of this game.I still think the game could benefit from a new ""easiest/noob/learning difficulty"" that let you choose your abilities/ skills. This really would make the game very beatable. But that would be the point. You would then have normal, hard, and daily to go through which is a TON and I mean a TON of replay ability. If you do end up making a noob mode I might also recommend that you disable the favor / spirit rewards when playing this new suggested difficulty.I bought this game because I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE altitude and wanted to support the devs. It combines a lot of elements of other games. The best way I can describe it would be a blend of final fantasy and the old raiden space ship game.  A ton of varied and random enemies that shoot and attack many different ways. It keeps it fresh and a LOT of fun.Pros:The game is challengingHas a lot of replay abilityThe graphics and game play are quite smooth and interestingIt's well put together and thought out. Everything from the items, enemies, and the quality is very good.Cons.I've removed them since the update. My biggest complaints with the game have been totally fixed and I can't tell you how happy this makes me. The game is at least 80% more enjoyable while still maintaining the challenge of the game.  It's no longer as brutal.Possible improvements:Create a super noob difficulty where I can even pick the OP combos if I want. Let me learn how enemies move etc. Heavily handicap me so I can get a firm handle on the game before you throw me to the wolves. These mini bosses are quite tough. I mean I've died on the first map over 15 times. Got past that maybe 3 times. Never even to level 3. And there are like 15 or something levels! This is actually a good thing. I like the fact that it's so tough!! It's challenging but not impossible.There are a lot of people who like to play games competitively. I only play for casual but I can see these things really helping those who like to compete.1. time trials? Leader boards2. There has to be abilities that are more favorable to others. Assign each ability a value and let the user choose which abilities he wants. The more desirable abilities ""cost"" more and as such reduce the person's arbitrary points on the leaderboard.So if a guy chose all the best skills he would get less bonus points than someone who chose all of the least desirable skills.Maybe have a board that spawns a guy every X second of a certian type. You get X amount of points per second you're alive?Other ideas:More points for the following:How much life did you lose over the course of the run?How long did it take you?What bonus health % health did you give the enemies?What bonus damage % health did you give the enemies?how many flawless?I'm sure there are abilities that would make it super hard. Then you could also give bonus points for reduced health, higher hit point enemies. You could make a whole bunch of things that you could make it harder or easier for the top of the top players to gain points.You could reset the leader boards each time you tweak something. Or add different runs that are preset boards.Suggestions continued:I wish you would explain what fight power is or mastery. There are many stats you can get from items but it's not quite clear what they do or how they work. Same way with the gods favor.  They explain you can earn favor by destroying the other god's temples etc, but not really what they do for you. Of course it's a buff. There just isn't enough training.They have a training thing before you start the game where two guys spawn. They don't attack or anything. They are there to get used to how your guys works. I think this could be expanded on. Be able to select how many guys to spawn. What type of guys. Do they move? Do they attack? Do you want blizzards to spawn? So you want laser beams? This could be good training level. Are you immune to damage?"
76561198000942568,Recommended,399640,18681817,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,Noetherian,"This is, at its heart, an arena combat game, with an overworld map where you move between fights.On the overworld-map, your character picks which of several neighboring areas to explore. (Most areas, involve an arena battle, but sometime you will see an area on the overworld-map that has a town, or bazaar or other non-dangerous location to spend the coins you have accumulated.) Each area of the overworld has a boss on the Northern edge of the map. There is an inherent trade-off between exploring more to find/buy better items with which to face the boss, versus avoiding needless battles which may require you to consume precious health potions. (Health potions are a limited resource, use them with care.) Finally, there is a shadow that slowly advances Northward across the overworld-map, which puts some mild pressure on you to work your way Northward, and prevents you from fully exploring each area of the overworld.The place where this game shines is in the variety of fights you encounter on your journey. The game features a large number of enemies, each with its own unique attack patterns. Each fight consists of a small number of different types of enemies -- Enemy marksman are typically weak, but when they are protected by foes who lay mines, the fights gets a bit more exciting [at least for a melee character <grin>]. Additionally, many fights have environmental hazards -- like damaging hail-storms that move randomly around the map, or bullets being fired randomly from off-screen.To tackle these challenges, your character has access to a weapon and three different skills. Your race determines your starting stats and one of your skills. (For instance, Dwarves are slow, but have lots of hit points and deal bonus damage with weapon attacks -- and Dwarves can right-click to stun enemies around then. Alternatively, Faires are very fast and their skills cooldown more quickly, but they have few hit points and do less damage per attack -- and Faires can right-click to teleport instantly in battle.)  The starting weapons are well-designed and each plays very differently -- for instance, swords swing in an arc for strong AOE melee damage, crossbows cripple enemies they hit, slowing their movement. Finally, the game provides a wide variety of active skills, including utility and movement skills -- for those who want to kill foes with weapons -- to high damage spells.The variety of weapons, races, and skills provides the game with a ton of replayability. At the start of each run, the game randomly generates three possible heroes for you to choose from. This allows you to pick the style of hero you enjoy, but the exact combination of skills will be different each run. Experimenting to get the most out of your combination of skills is a ton of fun. For example, there is a backstab skill that teleports you behind a foe and deals a percentage of your weapon damage. If you have this skill on a burly dwarf with a sword and an AOE stun, then you can backstab into the middle of a group of enemies and stun them all. Alternatively, if you are playing human with a crossbow, you can get more use out of the backstab skill by targeting an isolated foe on the other side of the battle in order to escape a rush of melee attackers."

In the map, you have a turn limit before you have to kill the boss to move to the  next zone.

,Recommended,399640,20361063,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,Ryjeon,A splendid Action-Roguelike.This game is my favorite game of the new year. It really captures that plug-and-play procedural action I've been looking for after hundreds of hours of The Binding of Isaac. It offers an immaculate blend of challenge and strategic options that keeps me engaged at the edge of my seat for the whole ~22-40 minute play session. I'm just starting to have hard-mode win-streaks. And even during a -29 lose streak I was having fun discovering character combinations and honing my exploration and gold-spending techniques.My other favorite thing is the controls. I play mostly with a gamepad and the game offers seamless transition between playing with a controller and playing with keyboard and mouse. Simply move the mouse or joystick and the game snaps to the new control layout. Both options offer very different approaches and are both satisfying to play.**There are a few issues with balance and (**seemingly) underpowered combos. I couldn't for the life of me get a Human-Sword-Arcane Blast- Meteor character to victory on normal. But in most cases in combination with good item and deity choices you could find the path to victory.**EDIT** The Devs totally answered my implicit challenge and beat my run on HARDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVMBaLvjoXA&feature=youtu.beOverall this game is a real gem and absolutely should be in your roguelike library.

76561198084544660,Recommended,399640,33355613,Posted: 7 July,all,andrewb,"Criminally underrated or maybe just underplayed/unheard of by many people, surprisingly deep and well thought out top-down ARPG with heavy rogue-lite elements like permadeth and procedurally generated levels.The gameplay consists of 2 main parts, the ""Overworld"", where you decide which room your character will go to next and then the actual fighting. What's really nice about this is how well balanced and equally important these two parts are. Knowing where to go, what to spend your money on, what abilities to upgrade first and which of the 5 available gods you devote yourself to is equally as important as being able to land your abilities and dodge projectiles.I've seen people compare this game's combat to MOBAs and I can kinda see why. Your character has stats that are fairly standard for this genre like movement speed, attack speed/damage, ability power and cooldown reduction. You also have 4 abilities that are on a short cooldown and a weapon (that would correspond to your auto-attack although you do have to mash the attack key in order to keep attacking).You can either build the character yourself, picking the race, weapon and all the abilities if you wanna go for some fancy synergies or you can let the game give you a randomized character to play with. What kinda bothers me is that when you make a custom character, you only get half of ""Spirit"" which is the currency that unlocks new races, abilities and weapons so the custom runs kinda feel like a waste of your time in this regard.What I also love about the game is how ridiculously overpowered you can get and how this is not really dependent on your luck (well...at least not entirely). You see, there is no single overpowered item that will catapult your run to greatness like Brimstone or Polyphemus in Isaac. In Flamebreak, if you want to get powerful, you need to make good decisions consistently and plan ahead.Last but not least, the game also has 3 versions of daily runs with separate leaderboards, which I find kinda questionable because very few people play these in the first place but I play them all every day regardless.Overall I would totally recommend Flamebreak to anyone who's been itching for a new rogue-lite game since even though it does borrow some heavy inspiration from other titles, it is very well polished and executed."

The game also suffers from repetitiveness that I din't felt in Isaac or Gungeon.I've tried time and time again to come back to this game but the experience stopped only 2 hours after I started it. I'm only 20% done but there's no excitement when I unlock a new character or skill and the items you buy doesn't add much to your playstyle. 1/2 of the runs feels the same once you understand how each ennemy works. The combos are very basic and the bosses are just bigger minions besides the Phoenix and the Gods. Talking about the Phoenix, although it's always possible to beat him, if you're melee it will take ages and you'll die of boredom since his patterns never change.Overall the first runs were a good experience but the interest I had in the game went down too quickly."

It rewards skill, and the more you play it the more you learn the core patterns of both enemy movement and your own skill synergies.

Your character gets 1 weapon, 1 racial skill, and 2 random skills. There are 8 weapons, 11 races, and 22 skills. There are also active items that you can get in the course of a run to gain up to three more abilities. Most upgrades are passive stat boosts, but there are around 20 sets that grant unique passives that can completely alter your strategies. Lastly, there are five deities that provide great passives if you win their favor... and punishments if you earn their wrath.

This though.. find much to complain about this. I'll try, though: the soundtrack is really dull, the flash when a fight starts hurts my eyes, some skills are probably weaker/stronger than others, and the game *could* have more content.That's pretty much it. Otherwise, I love this. I like Binding of Isaac a lot, and this is just as good, though different. Obviously Isaac has more content at this point, after an expansion and Rebirth, but this game is so *solid*. The controls are good, the mechanics are good.. uhh, it's all good.My favourite thing though is how the items/skills are designed. They're all different, more than just numbers. There's relatively little overlap, every skill is mechanically different and feels different. There's very little overlap (like, say, fireball/frost ball/lightning ball in some games), and they're all useful (though I admit I hate getting a few of them. Screw Blizzard).Items come mostly in sets of three, get the full set and get a really strong effect (like +50% ability power multiplier, ignore a hit every 11 seconds, get a powerful summon..). The set effects are all different, and nearly every one is good for some build/skillset (I say nearly only because I'm not sold on Phoenix set's flight, yet).I just love when a game is actually well designed. Too many games slap a bunch of effects and call it a day, without actually thinking how things work together."

Similiar to the game Nuclear Throne, the combat is fast paced and while it involves dodging attacks, it is not a bullet hell like Enter the Gungeon or Binding of Isaac. Instead, you are encouraged to manipulate the terrain and enemy ai so that you are not put in a situation where too much dodging is involved.Each enemy type has vastly different attack patterns, from ranged marksman who run if you get close, to enemies that block off areas of the battlefield with a laser that track towards your position, to bullrush charging enemies that will eat the corpses of their fallen allies to heal and go into a frenzy. Sometimes there will be more powerful versions of basic enemies in an encounter.One of the games biggest strengths is that every time you are handed a procedurally generated encounter, the terrain and variety of enemies means that the encounter is a new challenge. This, combined with your character having a basic attack and three abilities all chosen randomly, is what makes the game so much fun to play again and again."

,Recommended,399640,19811913,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,Grayson,"An excellent arena shooter with plenty of variety in characters, skills, weapons, mob behaviors and upgrades.However, the balance for character/weapon is awful. The faerie's ability to move around the arena makes it dramatically superior to every other race, and the crossbow's range means that all other weapons are utterly useless, by comparison. Melee weapons need tremendous damage buffs and, if there are going to be races that can't avoid attacks? Then how about beefing them up so that they can withstand attacks. There needs to be at-least one other weapon on-par with the crossbow's range, because the other ranged weapons are all just ""oh look: I rolled something that is not as-good as the crossbow.""The random-rolling of race, weapon and skills being a core aspect of gameplay is nice. But there is a single, incontestably superior result for each, which makes it really frustrating to roll for a second-best. And the slowest races and least-ranged weapons are pure garbage, because they can neither avoid nor score attacks, and don't have boosts in health and damage to compensate for how often you get hit and rarely you deal hits. You want to try a mage? Too bad: you get killed too fast. A close range fighter? Sorry--everything ran away, you can't catch it, and you get killed too fast. A tricky, technical fighter that pulls enemies in? Sorry--you don't deal enough damage before your interrupts wear off and you die because you can't dodge anything. A summoner? Sorry--your summons all die in a single hit and you still get killed too fast. A quick, ranged character? Good thing you made the only viable choice; now hope that you rolled the quickest character and highest range because otherwise you're just playing a second-rate version of it.It desperately needs more weapons at highest-range and huge damage boosts to sword and dagger. Movement speeds also need a tweak, unless the slow characters get some damage resistance to make tanking viable. Right now? It's great fun, but a frustrating experience because of wonky weapon/race balance."

You can reroll the options, but if you've managed to beat the game the reroll will end your winning streak.To start you have an overworld. You move one space and then fight some mobs or go into a merchant to buy something. The mobs can be easy or have extremely tough. The merchants sell stuff like potions or gear. Healing potions can only be used in the over world view - not while fighting mobs. Making this game really tough.Each region in the overworld is basically a 'level'. The region ends with a boss. I've never made it past the fourth boss.This game is ridiculously difficult. And after dying you have to start over completely - no saving it before a boss and trying again. Nope, to get back to the same spot you're looking at another 15 to 20 minutes - reminiscent of the old Nintendo games like Super Mario Bros, but with only one chance to get to Bowzer.Anyway, it's okay. It's very arcade style. It's mostly just run around the screen avoiding flying things and clicking on different mobs to eventually kill them.

If the darkness takes you, you pretty much have to fight monsters for zero reward unitl you move up more.It is a fun game and worth it if you can get it for dirt cheap like I did.  The developer is working with me right now on the controller support.  If you own a steam controller, it doesn't detect the xbox 360 configuration the dev's have implemented for some reason.  So...what this means is the right trackpad only works as a mouse and makes playing FB with a steam controller a vigorous trial.  Here's hoping he fixes this issue.Edit: A pretty amazing dev.  5 hours after I posted my complaint about the controller, he released a small patch to fix it.

I have kept comming back to this game, even though it has been in shorter sessions. The game has a nice arcade feel and balances dungeon running with some light character development.

It has a very good progression system which is rewarding. The steam achievements, albeit a few, are challenging and actually feel like achievements. Every time you play you have the option to choose a randomly generated character or you can custom choose your character, so there is that flexibility and it keeps everything fresh and addictive. It does get hard and challenging at times to unlock new weapons and characters - but it doesnt feel impossible - this is what makes this game fun.For 7 quid, you cant go wrong with this game. It is a decent price for a very good game, which hardly takes any space on my SSD. I can see myself spending 40 hours minimum on this, and its been well worth it."

You play as a random hero, each playthrough the skills and weapons are rerolled so there is an infinite amount of possible characters you can play. You play that hero until he/she dies and then you get another go with a new hero. There's so many possible races, skills, and weapons and more unlock as you level up (which happens as you clear maps/final map bosses).The map is genius. You have to plot how you're going to make it to the final boss in a way that you hope you pass enough shops along the way but also have enough fights so that you can acquire gold for those shops. Sometimes there's a ton of fighting sections, but just when you think you're going to be tired of a fight..BAM, they throw in a minigame for good measure. The maps are a puzzle game in and of themselves and really so are the shops. Trying to make sure you have enough money and that you're buying the most important items that'll you'll need in the next go around.TL;DR: Truly a great game. Buy it. Give it as a gift.

Starting skill  combinations are easily the biggest factor in how easy or hard your run will be, since some combinations just don't stand up to the better combos. If you can last long enough to complete two item sets though you will begin to steamroll through enemies and minibosses.Aside from the randomness in starting loadouts which needs work imo, the actual random elements of enemies, map layout, and item distribution is just about perfect.Full price might be too much for some people unless you really like the gameplay, but on sale this is a pretty good deal."

,Recommended,399640,33545976,Posted: 14 July,all,ONLY 28% AUTISTIC,"I think this is the most accessible and we'll put together roguelite I have ever played. The game is like a mishmash of most of the popular roguelites of the past few years, it has an over world structured like FTLs, a skill system based on cooldowns like Risk of Rain, and a combat system similar to Binding of Issac. Runs of the game typically take twenty minutes to complete (faster if ur gud probably) and the game is very fair, every attack is projected and projectile speeds are slow so if you are good you shouldn't take much damage. There are also many ways to specialise and differentate your characters run to run as each character has a weapon, a race and racial ability, 2 spells, a god they can recieve blessing from, armor sets they can complete that give abilities, an active item, and any number of small stat items that can be acquired to power them up. There are a few builds that are IMO pretty broken (maxing attack speed with a ranged weapon with poison and stun Kreygasm) but if you play the game with random spell and race builds (as it is supposed to be played) it can be pretty challenging and wierd.Strengths of the game-Very easy to get the hang of and very fair-Strong item pool and many opportunities to buy items. You can go in with a build in mind and make it relatively easily not like in BOI where getting some specific item you want is rng most of the time.-Many ways to diversify and specialise characters thanks to god blessings, armor sets, and large number of items per shop-Good game feel, most items and abilities feel useful and viable in certain builds. Rooms can also be cleared relatively quicklyWeaknesses of the Game-Lack of post game content compared to other games. Took me 20 hours to learn enough, kill all the bosses, and unlock most items and characters. Compared to BOI or Enter the Gungeon it had less content. It has about the same amount of content and replayability of Risk of Rain I'd say.-3 of the gods blessings feel underpowered but are still ok.-Ranged weapons are strictly worse than melee weapons, there is no real tradeoff since there is no ammo in the game and I don't think melee weapons extra abilities are better than the kiting potential of ranged weapons. I could just be a scrub tho.-I don't like the art style :pAll of these are really minor gripes though. Overall this game feels really well put together. I never feel like I'm being cheated by it and have kept coming back to it over the last 6 months. PLS buy this game, cuz the devs deserve it, and maybe we can get more quality games like it."

Isaac has even more content but Flamebreak has a more satisfying gameplay in my opinion.It has procedural generation at it best: race + weapon + skills combo makes incredibly well balanced synergies, different on every playthrough. On top of it are different item sets, upgrades and gods blessings you can aquire during the game, which affect tactics (and fun!) even more.Meta-game is also great. Strategic decisions made on the world map are meaningful and depend on how powerful you feel at the moment.But the gameplay at it's core is the most important feature. It's hard but fair. It is definitely possible not to get hit during the whole game. However, it requires constant focus, a lot of skill and tactical thinking.If you like rogue-likes and didn't play it yet - you are in for a treat!If you don't - i still recommend it as a great game even outside it's genre."
