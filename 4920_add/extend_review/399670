,Not Recommended,399670,17919482,"Posted: 6 September, 2015",all,SmokingFlash,"Game Corp DXGame Corp DX is a interesting indie simulator where you create your own gaming company. I will add a TL;DR at the end.GameplayThis game seems to be a mix of Prison Architect and Game Dev Tycoon as you play through it. You start out by doing the obvious and naming your company, then you hire workers, start making crappy games, make slightly better games, make great games, and so on. You set your workers into 4 categories to work within for a game (Art, Sound, Code, and Writing) and each game requires more or less of each of these. The building capabilities seem to be limited and the options are decent. The game is fun but the objectives do not catch the eye (took me a while to notice them), no option to pause time so you can set up a game or look around, and the date is only seen if you mouse over the clock. I feel like there is a clear lack of customazation to your game studio. I also noticed that as I name a game, the CPU studios have longer names than I am even allowed for my games.Graphics/SoundThe Graphics are smooth and overall polished. The music was suprisingly good and I was able to enjoy it.SuggestionsThese are my suggestion for the game which I feel would improve the current state. Please remember these are my personal opinions.- More customization to the building- Ability to hold down mouse and multi-place (like with walls)- Date being shown in the top right and being visible- Objective being more highlighted- Ability to choose your aimed audience for the game (child, baby, adult, teenager, etc)Pros/ConsPros+ Cheap+ Music is nice+ Overall enjoyable with gameplay+ Triple-speed option+ Critics are funny+ Each game genre requires different amount of each skill+ Award ceremoniesCons- No building customization (from what I see so far)- Character limit for game naming is not that long- Date is not shown normally unless you mouse over clock- Objectives do not pop out- No real perk/ punishment depending on who you hire.- Can get repetitive- No pause option that allows you to take your time deciding on a game- No real depth- Game just stops selling after 1 yearFinal ThoughtsOverall I played this game and I didn't like it that much. There is no customization for your studio which I feel harms the game significantly. The music was nice and the concept is good but, it is really rought. I am sad to hear that it is 90% complete as it does not feel near that level of completion. There are a lot of things that just pick at you when playing (date only visible when you mouse over clock, no pause option while creating your game, objective is kinda annoying to see, etc.). The game simply feels unfinished to me.TL;DRGame Corp DX is a newly released indie simulator where you own a gaming studio. You create games, hire workers, and get hated on by critics. Overall this game is nice, but still lacks depth and customization along with other things. The game is still in the rough and I would encourage the dev to hold back on it's out of Early Acess release (october). It's got potential, but still has a ways to go. If you have the 3$ maybe you want to buy it, maybe you want a candy bar. So far the game seems far from complete and it saddens me to see that it is apparently 90% complete. In it's current state I can't say it is horrible, but I can't say it's good either."

Depends on your play style and goal. I'd say you can have a full run in about the play time I did.Is this game worth 2$ ? Yes.Why did I buy this game ? I really enjoyed playing it for free for a couple of times and when I saw it on Steam, I wanted to thank the developper by giving them a little something. I'm the first person to grump about free games that end up on Steam, but this one is no robbery like others can (10$ for a game that used to be free is a bit of a joke, if you ask me). If you can't afford paying 2 bucks for that (really? well... ok) play it for free, but if you tried and like it, I think it's an alright price."

If you don't want to fork up the money for this, then go play that - this isn't much different. The graphics are the EXACT same, several features have been locked until later, and the creators still have no idea how to spell ""ceremony"". There are only a few new genres, the employees now have ""personalities"" (i.e they need to eat more often, almost all of them are negative), and you can finally pause the game and speed up those agonizingly long award ceremonies.I was confused at first by the lack of a proper UI. I saw the buttons on the bottom but I had to manually count all my employees, I later noticed there was a centimeter-tall transparent bar at the top of the screen that had the information.Playing the game, I had a few issues. Mostly with the edge-scrolling - I'd alt+tab out of the game (because even in windowed mode, the game tries to keep its custom cursor outside of the game and prevents you from doing any OS things) and come back to find that the view was all the way in the corner. Apparently it edge-scrolls when the window isn't even maximized, so I just turned off edge scrolling. The music is a bit obnoxious and loops endlessly (just remembered the company's name is Endless Loop). Workshop integration sounds great until you realize that the only customizable parts of the game are the employee's faces and studio icons. Not that big of a deal but I was expecting custom genres or at least different items.Overall, the game - just like its original Flash game, is repetitive and lacking content. Absolutely nothing has changed in the way of graphics, it's a bit buggy, and feels unfinished, even for a game that just came out of Early Access. I don't like giving bad reviews, especially when it comes to simulation games, but this just isn't worth the price. Most of the positive reviews are sarcastic, but I wanted to provide some detail as to what exactly the game has in the way of content.Thank you."

You don't create games for any specific device, you just make games, and you can only assign staff to projects in even numbers and still yet the increments are; 2,4,10, and 20. You can't assign any more or any less staff to projects. It's still pretty enjoyable and the office building is fun, but there are only about 10 total objects to place. The concept is unique, even with other game dev sim-type games, but the execution is sub-par. I recommend the game on price alone, but any higher and it's just not worth it."

It just focuses on wrong things.It's nice to have 40+ workers after an hour or two, it's nice to rebuild your office every few minutes and enhance it with flowers and statues... But is this what game development is about? I don't think so...Do you want to know all your developers by name? Well, they just become numbers in few minutes.Do you want to create fantasy games? Sci-fi? History? Sorry, not here.Do you want to develop sequels, DLCs, expansions? MMO or MOBA maybe? Nothing like this here.After few attempts, game development shrinks to looking at numbers and bars - genre does not matter, people don't matter,  even game name does not matter, since the randomly generated one is fine and you wanna go for quantity anyway.Campaign is done for in 3 hours (and doesn't tell you it's over, just goes on without any endgame), and ""challenge"" game is just a sandbox game with more achievements.I guess it just makes a good EA GAMES simulator - horde of anonymous workers, developing games which are all the same, dubious work, big profits, but almost no fun.If you want to really play game developer, go buy Game Dev Tycoon instead, or buy this in sale, the dollar or two of price just may be ok for few hours of gameplay."

Your team will be good enough to constantly get top-rated games.Also some of the tools are clunky: While building walls there is no line-option, like dragging a wall over several tiles. Therefore you have to click everwhere to put a wall down. The same goes for the information dialogues, they sometimes overlay other parts of the view.Game Dev Tycoon offers much more details that you have to analyse and use properly, like finding and combining matching game genres.Without much effort (and by pushing the ""3"" button to accelerate the time) you will beat the game within 3 hours tops.But some things need a positive mention: the graphics are very nice and cute. The sound design is awesome and the overall feel of the game is good.All in all 3€ are too much for this game, it boils down to 1€/hour fun..."

It's a time management and adventure type game.You have to increase the skill of your workers in various specialties like Sound, Coding, Writing, etc.Your workers can get good enough at a specific skill to actually specialize in it and start learning new skills by learning new programs on training kiosks (that you build)  As their skills increase, so does the viability of your product.Picking genres that directly support your team's skill is definitely a cool part of the game.  Especially when you are in the midst if training to new skills and/or have new folks on your team.I really liked being given access to new training techniques and even the ability to ""enhance"" members of your team to get rid of bad habits like overeating or arriving late.

Unfortunately, releasing shallow and dull games seems to have become a trend recently. Unlike Game Dev Tycoon (which I really loved), Game Corp DX feels like it was designed without any effort to make it challenging or even interesting enough to play for too long. Everything feels easy and meaningless, as if it was just another step towards an achievement. I get no satisfaction at all from publishing a good game, as it hardly requires any effort. To get to the next stage (""Relocate"" to another city), all I need to do is hire all available workers in the current city, which is too easy on one hand, and unrealistic on the other.Kk, I'll stop ranting now.

Workers will go to random resources causing them to lose worktime, instead of the closest resource.You cannot rotate a single thing in the game. No autoplacement for walls or deleting, you have to click on every single square individually. Don't even bother trying to create rooms, the games AI will make workers wander around for days in the game until they actually work.All in all, it honestly was a fun 1.4 hours until it ended.This is a game that should still be in heavy alpha release, maybe beta, but definately is nowhere near finished."

,Not Recommended,399670,30955182,Posted: 4 April,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Game Corp DX is way too simplistic to give me any feeling of attachment to the ""games"" I am making or the workers working on it. I'll definitely admit that my expectation of a ""game development tycoon"" is tainted by Game Dev Tycoon - the low price and near child like art style of the game envokes a game simple enough for children and teens, but is overall uninteresting and unrewardng enough to keep them and myself playing.Hiring workers doesn't involve much decision making. Build a workstation and click it to hire somebody - you three choices, which are usually poor choices when you are starting. You can hire one of the three, or waste another day (which potentially wastes money) to reroll for workers again, which are also likely to suck. There's no way to influence the kind of workers you can get outside of pure luck and the previous success of your studio.Building a game requires choosing a project size, which determines the amount of people you can put on the project. Since none of your workers will have any stats at the beginning, your early games will almost certainly get bad reviews until you build up your team's experience. Thankfully, at least the game is forgiving with poorly reviewed games and you can still make some money to stay in business.I was hoping the build feature would be a nice component of this game - the ability to customize your building further to make your building stand out from others, or to give you more attachment to your building than in Game Dev Tycoon. Instead, building is just a roadblock to progress. Not enough workers? Build more stations. Untrained workers? Build training stations. Bad work environment? Buy some plants? Bulding too small to make additions? Delete some walls and add some more further down. The building is purely simplistic placing of tiled objects that only conflict if there isn't a space ""under it"" for somebody to get to the object/use it. You can upgrade your building to get even larger offices, but the button that is supposed to let me upgrade never appeared - you're supposed to hire max workers, but eventually the game said I couldn't hire anymore in my city - so I saw no way to progress. There was one button I saw about moving to San Francsico, but that required $100M and there was another requirement I didn't meet. I just barely made $1M and I'm certianly not spending the hour it took to get to $1m times 100 to get that much money.GCDX may be a decent little mobile game to not pay much attention to, but I wasn't entertained the entire time. I felt no attachment to my games since I couldn't make sequels to them or research why a game I made went well or bad or not being able to develop engines or work with publishers. After my third game, I let Game Corp auto-name all my games because there was no point to rename them. Game Corp DX is nothing but clicking boxes to select your game genre and which worker works on a game and hope the game does well."

The game just got me in the very first second with its charming graphics and easy mechanics. Basically, it is a tycoon game in which you hire/train developers, design your workplace in a simple way and create games. There are also 28 objectives that you need to complete in order to ""finish"" the game. Of course, you can continue playing, but after that point the game becomes repetitive and you will not find any reason to continue playing. To finish all those objectives and get the achievements, I spent about 5 hours, and I can definitely say that the game did not get boring or repetitive in this period. As developer claimed that the intention was to create a 4-5 hour game, it can be said that this intention is fulfilled.Long story short:If you are a fan of tycoon games, definitely get this game.

,Recommended,399670,17945638,"Posted: 8 September, 2015",all,Zaratoth,"I saw it from a friend and was intrigued by the fact that it allowed you to do multiple projects at the same time. The price was really low so I bought it. While playing it (no more than half an hour) I noticed the similarities with my favourite management game to date, The Movies. Especially the awards were a nice reference to that game.I only did up to a small scale game and have some thoughts about the gameplay (perhaps they are better later on, but I do not know it yet).I feel that the multiple project (especially micro) is a bit weird. I understand that we start small and go big, and the system micro = 2 people etc is intriguing, but I believe I had a slightly better time while playing Game Dev Tycoon, only for the fact that I never thought I was a mobile game dev, as I am thinking while micro-projecting in this game. Perhaps it is only the fact that GDT is set on the '80s? Well, not really a con this one, more like something to get off my chest.I liked the micromanagement in the fact that there are 4 different game options (sound, story, code, art) and the programs you use for each.I also liked the fact that you have competitors. You are not alone in there!I liked very much the addition of the positive and negative aspects of your employees. Nice touch!What I disliked and perhaps will never be solved due to being a major aspect to the game, is the quest for money system. I managed to fullfill an objective and got instant cash, while in GDT I had to pass the phase where I prayed for my project to earn back at least my investment money. It makes this game to feel unnaturally easy.One thing that I disliked is the fact that I didn't manage to find a key where I would say that a new project is a sequel to a previous one. This is a major point for me, as I love to have sequels upon sequels of games (and IRL I say I hate Ubisoft? Damn, I am Ubisoft.)Another thing I learned and thought it was missing was MMO games and expansions. It was my dream while playing GDT to have a team managing an ever growing MMO, while the rest did more diverse projects. And expansions to existing games plus the MMO.  And I find this game which has multiple project possibilities, without MMO and expansion capabilities.Another thing I think should be checked is in placement of items in the office. I wanted to have the training box towards the wall, facing left, but I could not find a rotation button. It would be good to have one.Also, I would like to not be able to continue with a random name and have an extra screen about it. Had to scrap a couple of projects because I forgot to name them as I wished.One more point is the fact that there is no actual market. As I learned the games only sell for a year and then die out, while there are no other factors, like ""people want RPGs"" or ""they crave for Adventures"", like in GDT or The Movies (in the latter certain events happened and changed the mood of the audience). That takes away from the realism of the game and the whole ""gamble"" aspect where a perfect developed game not always sell accordingly. (UPDATE 10/12/2015  While I still believe that there is no ""gamble"", I found the addition of the system ""most fans want this type of game"" quite good.)Another thing that I don't like is the fact that you need to have every possible employee from an area in order to advance to the next. Now, with the addition of positive and negative aspects on employees, you will have to sign all of them, even the ones with only negative aspects, in order to continue to a larger office. What I think as a better idea would be to have every possible employee have a single positive and a single negative each time, that means that you won't miss negatives either way. Furthermore, the total pool of possible employees should be, let's say, doubled. The number needed for going to the next level should remain the same. That way there will be greater diversity and the player would feel a bit more in charge, since he'll have to choose which to offer a job, taking into account the positive and negative stats as mentioned above. ***In this case, I was told that if you wait for months to pass, there will be available different employees with better stats the longer you wait, so there is a pool behind it. I leave the previous comment as possible ideas/feedback, but I'll delete the negative in the end since it does not exist.After playing half an hour more, I noticed that, contrary to my earlier belief, when a guy finishes his work on a project, he sits  and waits. He cannot train nor join a new project. I believe this is another thing that should change. If a sound designer finishes his work early on a project low on sound, why shouldn't he be able to join immediately a new project based on sound?All in all, after several updates, I think that the game is way more fun than when I first purchased it. It is still far from perfect, in my opinion, and it could use some of the ideas above in order to become even better. But, right at this point, I would recommend this game to everyone who wishes to play a fun little management game about a game development studio for a couple of hours.tl;dr+ Extremely low price+ Multiple simultaneous projects+ Competitors+ Positive and negative aspects of each employee+ Nice ""fan"" system, in both release of games and the new game creation (fans' desires)+ After several updates it became more fun to play, even if core elements remained the same+ Has a lot of potential+ Has micromanagement...-...though not deep as far as I could tell- Lack of ""sequel"" option- Lack of MMOs and expansions- Lack of rotation in build mode- Should have an accept screen to remind you whether you have customly named a project or not- The objectives' rewards make the game seem a bit easier than it should be- No external factors seem to challenge the success of a game- Finished designers cannot join new projects or train until the whole project is finished(Edit 1) Added the ""objectives' rewards negative in the end. Forgot to do so earlier. (30 minutes played)(Edit 2) Added the ""game sell"" and ""external factors (crowd preference)"" point. (30 minutes played)(Edit 3) Added the ""competitor"" point. Damn, I fail at thinking everything while writing the first draft. (30 minutes played)(Edit 4) Added the ""finished designers"" point after playing a little more of the game. (60 minutes played)(Edit 5) Added the ""employee positive and negative aspects"", ""fixed number of possible hires"" and the ""requirements for moving to a bigger office"" points. Furthermore, I added after the previous edits a rough estimate of my total playtime at each point, in order for new readers to understand my chain of thoughts compared to playtime. (94 minutes played)(Edit 6) Changed some things from edit 5 since I learned that they were not accurate. (94 minutes played)(Edit 7) Added the ""fan system"", ""updated edition"" and ""potential"" positives. Tweaked the ""external factors"" negative. Changed recommendation to ""Yes"".

I enjoyed it and I look forward to the whole game being polished, with new features implemented in it. However, I feel the game has no real replay value so after you're gone through the whole thing once (which can take a few hours), there's no real incentive to play again. The waiting is one of the biggest problems in the game in my opinion. Once you are in the game and a project is in progress, there's nothing to do other than watch the screen, especially with larger games which take a lot of time.I do however like the awards thing they do every single ""year"", and seeing your achievements compared to the other companies. I think the rewards should stack up. The moment you reach end game as well, you can't do anything with the money except watch it  increase.There are at the moment no achievements, so it is hard to keep playing as there isn't a sense of reward about the game that makes you keep going after the next hurdle. However, the achievements are being added soon so I'm looking forward to that.GraphicsGraphics wise it's really basic , but also cartoonish which helps make up for it. The movements look comical, especially at faster speeds. Maybe it will help to give more reactions to the workers such as triumph when a project is completed, frustration. Also the workers all appear to be only males, I also think it could be improved by having have both male and female workers, though the difference would really be more in the namesControlsThe controls are mouse based, you click for everything.  I would like to use the keyboard so I can be more lazy.SoundThe sound is really addictive and relaxing but it gets boring after a while because the tunes I can hear are alike. It does help to keep you awake which is cool. A bit more variety in this would make it a lot better, since you would eventually mute the sound and put on your own after hearing the same thing over and over.Overall VerdictThe game itself has a lot of potential if you consider that this is just an early access game, so a lot more can be done to make it more productive. If you enjoy looking at the progress in games in early access, I would recommend getting it. If you don't, I would wait until after it's fully updated and if there is more replay value added to it.8.5/10Want moar?Click here to join my steam groupandClick here to follow my curator page!"

However, once you get past the early game you find that you want to specialise all of your workers to get the best quality games. Then it just becomes a game of throwing as  close to the right number of each skill at each project and sitting there with time on the fastest setting until it's done. Some of the later game mechanics aren't covered in the tutorial though, and you can only find them by going into build mode and placing down items you don't know anything about to see what they do.You have to lay out your studio, but the space you have to build it in is so small, you pretty much end up with every square having something on it by the time you max out your team. This doesn't leave you with many options for being creative with your layouts.I've not played the challenge mode yet, the campaign mode that you play to unlock it is essentially a massive tutorial.

The only real challenge is knowing when to push through and when to borrow as the tutorial leads you, more or less, by the hand.

That, however, isn't a bad thing at all.Graphically it's very nice with a simple UI and approach, yet tools are provided for the more hardcore players of this type of game. The music creates a nice ambience without being irritable, unlike some games. The price is low compared to some of the other ""tycoon"" style games out there and, although I feel it's worth a little more, it's not too short a sell.I would like to see more in the way of features and options, particularly once you get to the end game and are making millions per ""day"".

Updates come rapidly and really add something to the game.It has been released now and is more finished than I could image, this is a great game and tends to steal your time away.At the time of writing I played about one hour and is in early access.This game is quite OK and was well worth the money. It tends to get a little repetitive after a while but quite challenging none the less. Sometimes the game feels a bit empty, and I hope the devs can work that out. For example, the amount of stuff you can place and the way information is revealed.When beginning a new project, the player has no clue about the number of available workers (and there skills!). So it is hard to pick a game that is more adaptive to the available skillset, I would like to see that changed.Every year there are awards and it isn't easy to get more than 2 or 3 of them. You really have to put effort (strategy) into each minute of playing to get the most awards and revenue out of your business.UPDATE: There have been some tweaks to the game and I like them very much. For example, you can now put the game on pause without showing the menu. When paused you can also publish games and create projects. The latter one can take quite some time, so I'll use the pause button a lot.@devs:- What I'm still waiting for is a list of employees who have nothing to do BEFORE creating a new project. It is just weird that you create a new project for 10 people, click on next to find out there are only 3 available. (This has been fixed!)- Also there is a minor bug where you post-produce a large project where it tells you there aren't any free Master-workplaces though I have 2 available (which are then used by that project). No breaker, but still quite annoying. (This has been fixed!)9.5/10"

Once you learn them it won't be long before you're pumping out top quality game after top quality game. Sending your studio to the very top. The gameplay itself is also simple and easy enough to understand (outside of a couple things). It also looks nice enough for what it is in terms of the graphics its gone for. Clearly taking some inspiration for other games such as Prison Architect.There really isn't too much ""negative"" with the game. More just tweaks I'd enjoy seeing. Such as having the date show at all times and not only when you however over the clock. It'd also be neat to have the ability to develop for certain platforms (i.e - PC, console, handheld, etc) to expand what development is like. Also more things to decorate your office with. Paintings, other snack machines, other forms of entertainment...maybe even the ability to add different floors.All in all I do highly suggest checking out this game, it hs a very small pricetag and you'll get your monies worth from it if you enjoy this type of game.https://youtu.be/Kqw2yQUmoUY"

Micromanaging your teams, placement of watercoolers and desks, idling employees, etc.  Can be entirely ignored, any game you make will replace the money it took to make it even if three quarters of the team were idling for most the production.

I also didn't understand why games needed an exact number of people working on them.The game has mechanics just to have them, hiring people may as well be random instead of a pop up menu.

Has a bit of difficulty but not much. Few thigns need improvment but not bad otherwise.1. Give a secondary trait: Ex; Coder/Artist, but can only get one to max. Would make the game that much deeper.2. Teams: Set teams within your company, maybe give them a synergy bonus for how long they work together. Then you can just assign teams to games instead of picking and choosing every time.3. Rotate objects.: I havent found any way to do this, and i cant believe its not in the game, maks no sense why not. please add.4. Better Customization: The building is just always a big block, no point having walls inside since its a waste of space.give the option to use the bottom part of the map. Maybe a feature to hire a band to record for your games, which gives you a little band room in the bottom part of the map. Can do the same with a room for the video effect of making the people in the game look like the person being filmed. make them part of the game making process , boom.5. Water and Food breaks are to common: I had one small game meeting take 2 months because this guy kept getting up every hour to grab a drink, and if he didnt, Paul did. Niether had the bad trait, plus i dont even have a bathroom, why are they drinking so much? tone down speed about 33% imo6. Game of the Year award: the critics mention it, but never gets handed out with the awards. Should add.7. Off setting Moral System: A moral system where if a game sells well / you win awards, your guys are happy and slack off, causing them to work slower for a bit. If you do poorly, they get frustrated and work extra hard, but if it doesnt pay off, they get really upset and work slower for a bit. (just an idea, this one is out there :P)Good game, I recommend!

It's also less than half the price of Game Dev Tycoon, so I guess this could be your fix if you can't fork over the $10 for that game.The graphics are positively hideous, as the characters look as though they were hastily designed in MS Paint or Photoshop.  The gameplay is functional, but is more complicated than Game Dev Tycoon which gave you simple mechanics that worked seemlessly to offer an experience more addictive than heroin.  Game Corp doesn't have that quality.  The tutorial is a complex induction course that, disappointingly, doesn't even offer much interactivity in the development of games like Game Dev Tycoon did.Personally I wasn't able to make the game full screen as it crashed when I tried.  This meant I had to make due with the low resolution window making it near impossible to see the itty bitty graphics and text going on in the game.Another problem was the music, in that it clashed cataclysmically with the tone of the game and was by default way too loud.  If you're wondering what music would fit for this type of experience, I'd point again to Game Dev Tycoon, which was backed with pleasant, relaxing, ambient elevator-like music that set the mood very well.  This game seems to switch rapidly between types of music that sound very over-produced for music that's just supposed to be a background soundtrack.For $3 I suppose it's okay.  It's certainly functional, but it pales in comparison to Game Dev Tycoon, which is actually being very generous.TL;DR: Alright for the price I guess but get Game Dev Tycoon instead."

I mean, this game wouldn't be worth the pain of looking at it even if it were free. I can appreciate this guy trying to make a game, but I mean... Game Dev Tycoon already exists... And it is FAR superior to this. You could just release this game for free on TIGsource or something and ask for help and feedback. Or better yet, find an artist. You have to have a single friend who can use Photoshop, right? Hell, I mean, I'll do new art for you for $500. If you did that, it might be worth $3.00 to buy this game.Some harshly worded feedback (because that is what we like to read):~The UI is atrociously ugly and unintuitive~The sprites are less artistically inspired than stick figures~The Antialiasing is so bad that you can barely see anything at all. It is similar to what I imagine Glaucoma to be like. I mean, do you know how to use adjust resolution settings in Unity? There are tutorials. You could just ask someone!~There is no grand scope to this game that warrants the excusing of such terrible graphics. You click some buttons, you speed up time, you get some revenue. Huzzah. There are literally thousands of better games available for free on every platform known to gaming kind.I'm sorry, but I am going for a refund on this game. The Images you display on the store page look like they at least have definitive edges! Crisp lines! I can't even LOOK at this. If anyone reads this, please, PLEASE just buy Game Dev Tycoon instead.

If you love ADventure Capitalist you'll want to marry this game and make little flash games with it. The only thing I found lacking in this area was the fact that after about 8 hours of gameplay It gets a little boaring after about 10 hours of gameplay unlike ADV Capitalist. I keep comparing it to ADventure Capitalist but I should tell you this: It isfarsuperior because you haveto use your mind, improve your workers, give them new traits, organize your office, polish and advertise your games according to the rating unlike a simple ""cookie-clicker"" copy.Gameplay Mechanics Rating: 95%VisualsI'm judging this as a casual indie game, not as a multi-million dollar game, in that regard the graphics are very good, relaxing, great anti-aliasing ensures no jagged edges. It only used up about 256 Mb of video RAM so even the worst PC's can run it at it's top.Visuals Rating: 80%AudioThe background music doesn't get in your way as long as it's not too loud, note that the default volume is a little high, but that's my own personal preference. The audio could easily be improved if the dev added a few extra tracks. Overall the music was good, not amazing.Audio Rating: 70%OtherThe achievments were fun and interesting, my only complaint being that I got 90% of them 4 hours into the game, but as a 3 USD game I have no problem with that, however if you're the sort of guy who aims for achievments you might want to think it over, however this is not usually a deciding factor. It doesn't have controller support and doesn't need it.Overall Rating: 82%TL;DR/pros & cons+ Fun and a great way to pass a few hours+ Relaxing visuals+ Addictive+ Not RAM intensive+ Great tutorial (I was actually very impressed by it)- A single game would last a maximum of 8 hoursEnd result, if you have a few dollars at hand and want a great casual game.

It feels like it's trying to be a clone of Game Dev Tycoon but it's not doing very well at that. It's also plagued with semi frequent crashes. Then theres the fact everything is locked away, the game teases you by showing you all this neat stuff, but then it goes ""Nuh-uh, you gotta be more important to have this."" Which is a huge jerk move.  In addiiton it seems to be the case that it doesn't know what it wants to do with itself, it has a lack of direction guiding it which makes it excedingly difficult, at the start of the game it's impossible to make money because you're constantly trying to throw money at problems to fix them and get nothing back for results. The tutorial is just plain bad, and everything is crudely implimented, you need a table to plan things, and I struggled for like 20 minutes to figure out you need to put tables next to each other to make a four seater table.

However, Game Corp DX serves a very different experience, as you are able to have your own unique office, whilst 'Game Dev Tycoon' is limited to 3 fixed levels, and is more reallyt about waiting, whilst Game Corp DX gives you the ability to work on multiple projects at once, and the 'Train' option seems to be more straightforwad, just as it is in many different aspects, but 'Game Dev Tycoon' will admittedly give you a better first experience, however Game Corp DX will always stay ontop, as the many more and better features it serves are unique and you will not find them in any other games.However i would like it more if it was frequently updated.Rated 10/10"

Meybe it was because that I'm an English as a second-language speaker.I suggest that make a Chinese language version is a good idea, it's not hard, not much text.这就是我想要的游戏！玩过很多同种类的游戏，都不是很令人满意。因为那些太过繁琐的操作其实降低了游戏性。当我第一次看到这款游戏的时候，本来以为只是个小制作，没怎么在意，因为也不是很贵就买了下来。但玩着玩着我被震撼了！节奏较为稳定，竞争对手大大增强了游戏性，而且制作游戏的流程很快不繁琐。如果说之前的模拟游戏制作的游戏都是以开罗公司的游戏发展国为蓝本制作的，那么这款游戏可以说是开创了一条新的道路。真的很不错。不过缺点也是有的，比如对可购买物品的说明不够详细，没有详细的进阶教程等等，还有就是后期的挑战性稍差一些。不过员工的升级设定真的很棒。我是直接英文版玩下来的，没什么难度。"

Apparently I'm limited to how many people can be on one project. I don't like how that limits me, the player. After all, since I'm the person who's running the studio, shouldn't I be able to decide who I want and don't want on my projects, with no limits?40 minutes into the game studios started popping up as competition and while me and my original rival studio had quality games of 200, this new studio had quality games of 2,000. No, you didn't read that wrong, two THOUSAND. Did I mention they had 10 workers to start with? Yep, totally not fair.Developer(s) of this game need to rethink the project aspect, as well as the random OP studios popping up.I really enjoyed the Studio Awards thing in the begining, but I found myself spam clicking ""Next"" after the 3rd time. It started to get annoying. It got annoying pretty fast.In conclusion I think the game lacks a lot of features other games of this type have to offer.

Make better games. Profit more. Hire more developers and do more training. Make bigger games. Profit more. Repeat until the game says you win.Just following the 'achievement' instructions each step of the way in the most obvious way possible will win the game without any real mental effort involved, and there are very few places where the decision of who to assign to which job isn't blazingly obvious.So yeah.

I own both and i have enjoyed both games. each one with flaws but they are both good to give you the fun and enjoyment that they're worth. so i give this a 7/10 because of the art style and that you can costomize your office and hire a ton of workers.

It doesn't seem to scale textsize up with bigger resolutions.- No ability to make a sequel of one of your earlier games or otherwise maintain a game series.- No ""sports"" game category.- Could use an ability to ""group"" certain devs. Like a team of four who cover all four development options so you can select Team A, Team B, and two individual devs to work on a Medium game. Saves clicking on all those tiny, tiny buttons.- Too many tiny, tiny buttons. UI should scale up some with larger resolutions."

The simuilation mechanics are lackluster at best and while you can see the love the devs put in the end result is just a progress bar simulator.Having a Team of 10 people working on a game means that if one aspect of the game isn't finished the two people working on it will block the other 8 from doing anything. The just snooze on their desks for month. Just to name one example of where the game falls flat in delivering the experience managing a real team. One could agrue that this is the intent and the the challenge is to build teams that finish everything at the same time but the game doesn't support that through it's shallow mechanics.It's neat but falls behind mobile games like Game Studio in fluditiy of plan. It's definitly more ambitious but sadly doesn' really deliver.For this low price it's not that it's ""not worth it"" from a money perspective so if you played other the other game management games this might be for you. Just not really worth it all in all."

It's a good game, but it's lacking in depth beyond the final expandable area, an area that takes only around 1 to 1 & 1/2 hours to get to. After this point, you'll find the game far too easy. It's not a bad game, it's just a really short simulation game, which is disappointing when you see other games like game dev tycoon with less actual customization options, and IMO much less immersive than this one, but they have a much longer campaign.Good game for two bucks, wouldn't pay beyond that."

I've only played through the game once and 100%'ed it immediately, taking less than 5 hours in total. I even trained every single staff member to maximum experience, maximized their positive traits, and removed all negative traits. Game Corp DX tries to be funny at times, but it never really is.The developer has recently added an entirely different (really bad) game as free DLC. Don't be fooled by this, this is a completely separate game that has nothing to do with Game Corp DX. I'm guessing the developer added this so  Steam would think that Game Corp DX itself has been updated, which pushes it back on to some people's front page. Pretty shady, if you ask me...I could only recommend this game if it's on sale (sub $2) and you want some distraction for a couple of hours without having to think too much.If you'd like to play an actual game dev simulation game, I would wholeheartedly recommend either Game Dev Tycoon (also pretty casual) or Mad Games Tycoon (more in depth, but more expensive) over this."

However, I can't recommend a game simply because it's cheap so I don't recommend either of them.Game Dev Story on Android is fun though! ^_^"

This game has a lot of charm, but the workers need more specialization, we need to be able to make bigger productions and have more control over the QA part. Fine control is key here. I'd give this game a 4 out of 6. The developer should create more content, or allow the community to do so, skins for workers and logo is far from enough. We need espionage, stock market, sound studios in other cities, localization branches, larger corporate parks. The fear of workers leaving us for better companies, salary control, ability to rotate office furniture, Project managers who can be instructed to make decisions like QA Polish, better building tools (dragging walls). To name a few.Still good fun for a few bucks."

I played it once for like 5 hours straight right after I got it, tried on and off to get the very last achievement (The achievements are super easy, you will get 95% of them from just playing the game normally and the last 5% are just special names you need to give games).The game rating system is rather... Well, unfortunate. In fact its the only thing that really let me down about the game. It relies almost 100% on how much money you put into the game. So what you will find at first is that you are coming up with noting but misses, and late game you can literally get nothing but 5 star ratings with little to no effort. Literally, literally no effort at all. Chose a topic and name, chose the people to work on it, and chose the programs you want to use to work on it. I had 2 seperate teams in game working on 2 projects at a time over, and over, and over again and it was nothing but 5 star ratings across the board. Ultamatly that was what stopped me from playing the game. Once you reach the final office it becomes far too repetive.Other then that, its just small little things that will bug you... Like how during the planning phase planning cannot continue unless everyone developing the game is at the table at once, WHICH WOULD BE FINE, but early game most of your workers will have the 'hungry quickly' or 'thirsty quickly' effect, which means simply getting started on the game may take 2 or 3 ingame monthes.Im guessing things like that will be worked out at some point... Overall, the time I spent on the game I found fun enough. So would I suggest it? Yes. For the price the game currently has great entertainment value."

There's much less 'chance' involved, as with Game Dev Tycoon.The campaign is fun and took me around 6 hours to complete. Bear in mind that I took my time with this, and didn't rush the campaign, to see it through. I suspect that if someone was truly devoted, they could complete the game in a fraction of the time. The Steam achievements are also easily attainable, and provide a little more playability for the title. Within ten hours, I'd completed the campaign and got 100% of the achievements.This game will never be a massive hit, on par with those huge releases by developers with deep pockets etc, but for the £1.49 I spent on it, it's provided me 10 hours of entertainment - and provided me a fix for my 'game cravings' whilst on holiday and using a very technologically limited laptop!"

Many game play features help make this game fun. The positive and negative worker traits add to the game play though late game there is a way to get rid of the negative and add good traits. The only bad thigs is at times it is not clear what you need to do, to get to the next city. Take moving to San Francisco. I had a heck of a time figuring out what I needed to do to move. I had over a Billion dollars and makes skills, and still could not move forward. The solution for that sort of leads me to my next minor negative, and that is the small space to build. You are give too small of a max space that you can build up the office. It would be nice if you could speand money to expand past the limit. You can do that once but after that no more.

Of course every game has an end but, it feels like you get there very fast. At least from my experience.

Ironically, there goes 6 hours I could have been doing developing a game. In short, it's a great game but it lacks the conflicts of development as seen in serious shows like Codemonkeys.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZtL_KVzaaoThis game reflects a “current trend” or a “historical prospective” of indie devs becoming AAA, and a happy story at that. In 6 hours or I think 7 years, I won every award, had more than $900,000,000, and went from making crappy games to games of various scales and deadlines. The real life strategies of looking at markets, hiring and training new talent, and scheduled a variety of games to pay monthly expenses helped me consider a real life business plan.However, I had no shareholders to deal with, no taxes or laws to cope with. ""Zynga"" being an example, it would be interesting to have to deal with outside pressure to make the company public, this causing tension between myself and the people I've employed who do not want me to sell out. The people themselves, should like to work with others and not like others for different reasons. It would have been nice to deal with ""sexism"" and ""race"" where play testers would give me tough moral dilemmas such as ""bigger boobs"" and ""can we have less black and gay people in the game"". The cause and effect would be, if I go with AAA standards, I would make more money, but would get more flack for certain groups. Also, what about distribution, is it online, or will have to deal with stores like Target or Walmart? Rating systems could also be in place and getting banned from countries which could effect press and sales over all like Rockstar?Imagine, EA is going to try and buy you out and you have to stop them from being a boss-- get it, a ""boss battle"".Gameplay Notes to Dev--Please add a back ""button"" in menus, and sadly the loss of skills due to specialization doesn't seem to make sense.Also, it would be nice to have some conflicts as mentioned before (*Cough, expansion pack)."

I have enjoyed 60+ hours so far, have enjoyed the recent update, and can't wait to see the final product.Long VersionI like the game mechanics. Office layout efficiency, developer improvement, game development, earn money, win fans, change cities. I think these have all been blended well.I've only come across two potentially serious issues and a few UI bugs. Very solid for an alpha early release!Potentially Serious IssuesThe first serious issue is when I have it open for several hours (common occurance :). By the time I get to SF and have a huge staff things start to slow down. I'm not sure if this is because I'm constantly switching between pausing and speed 3  or not. It shouldn't be my machine, as it is a solid gaming machine and this game shouldn't be taking up resources. I can repro this by just playing for a couple of hours.The second issue was that I have had all or most of my staff disappear in two separate games. It happened late game (SF) both times. I haven't been able to purposely reproduce this, but it's happened twice.UI BugsFan numbers display (unsigned int error?) - Start a new game, quit tutorial, open Project Manager (E) screen, click New Project, look at fan numbers (should be normal). Speed 3, wait until next month dialog, Continue, then open Project Manager again, click New Project, look at fan numbers. This time they're things like -2147483588. No big deal, as you develop games, each game fan number will reset and, once you've developed one of each game, it's never a problem again.Graph goes off dialog - I ran into this when I had a series of terrible developer options at the start of a game. Start a new game, do not make games, only spend money for a few months (build things, hire developers, etc.). After a two or three months, when you have negative cash, Open Studio Info (G) dialog, click Graph. Some of the graph lines and points go down below the graph area, even outside the dialog.Wishlist- I would love to be able to open the New Project dialog directly, instead of always having to open Project Manager and clicking on the New Project tab. It's one of the most common things I do, so it'd be nice to have it in Options.- I would love to have another major dialog for employee managment. Currently, if I want to look at my employees, their abilities and experience, I have to start a new project, select a game, and continue.- Remove Project Summary Dialog. I actually NEVER use the Project Summary Dialog, as all the info I need is available in the default tab of the Project Manager dialog.I have more feedback if you'd like, too :)Thanks so much for this game! I have really enjoyed it, have loved the (one) updates that have happened since I've gotten it, and look forward to watching it grow to completion!"

It's funny and I love them! I love how you get to train your employees and how you get to unlock softwares to use for game development.I found myself wanting to pick what console to release a game on SO BAD. I know this is just an Alpha build, but just a suggestion. Add in some consoles to out on. I've played a lot of different video game simulation games and this is one aspect of the game that I would really like to have.I'd like to have an actual save feature instead of having to wait till the end of every month for the auto-save. Just a simple ""save"" button on the menu screen would be nice.I saw a comment about how the music can get annoying but I for one loved it and found it very catchy (coming from a music artist)!The game honestly seems TOO easy. No matter how bad the ingame reviews are, I always seem to make money. I've made about 20 games on this and I've only lost money 1 time. Not sure if that means I'm just good at this game or if it's easy haha. Plus I'd like it if the reviews REALLY effected the sales of your game. I made money off of only getting 1 star from 1 out of 4 reviews. When I only get 1 star, I should be losing a ton of money. Now I get that you make crappy games in the beginning as a startup company, but I say a little further in, you should start losing money for bad games.This is a SUPER casual game and I honestly really really enjoyed it for how early on the build is. I could get lost in it for hours! I had to stop myself from playing! This could potentially take the title of my favorite game development simulation title (thats my favorite genre of games, very specific, I know). If you like casual games and to just sit back and relax for a bit, this is the game for you!Keep up the great work! Can't wait to see what you add in!"

I'll be honest the overlay system doesnt update which is upsetting, and its too dark, and the building system seems unfished because you can't move for example a work desk 1 block up or 1 block down, you have to move it 2 blocks down and then 3 up to get it where you want it. I played on easy mode, so I'm not sure about the other difficulties. But the characters you could get, and the ability to control the project even if in the end all the project really does is get you fans and money, the game really made you feel like you were the lead in the videogame company.

But the quality of this game is really lower comparing to these titles.Not to repeat some of other negative (or even positive reviewes), I will write some most valuable cons and some suggests how developers could improve the game (as i see them).Cons:- The game gives really no challenge - I can hardly imagine how to ruin your career, you may even have funds below zero and still play like it's OK (the only restriction - you are unable to purchase anything).- Lack of customazation to your game studio as well as lack of improvements.- Sounds are good as well as Music, but there are only 2 songs playing and they are switched really bad.- No depth.Suggestions:& More customization to the building.& Ability to hold down mouse and multi-place (like with walls).& Date being visible all the time.& Objective being more highlighted.& Ability to choose your aimed audience for the game (child, baby, adult, teenager, etc) and may be soe other features being used in game like Game Dev Tycoon or Game Dev Story (to choose platform as example).& Make different difficulty levels.& Not to break Pause when releasing a project.& Make staff perks do real impact on game process.To sum up, the game is significally unfinished yet, but it still could be really improved. I hope my suggests would be really useful and the project is going to be improved in many positions. But today it is really raw and boring, can't recommend in :C."

Build your office/feng shui your way to success, send your employees into the Enhancement station to make them better humans and train them up to be master coders, writers, artists and sound designers. The better you are, the more awards you win in the bizarre end-of-year awards, where companies are judged on how many games they've released and how big the team is.The first time I played this game I'd lost about seven hours in the blink of an eye and it was 3am, which is a good indication of how this game draws you in.

Game Dev Tycoon's system is more complex, with a focus on making sure you match the right genre and platform and feel of the game, creating a sort of matrix of what works and what doesn't. Game Corp DX instead asks you to focus on worker management and ensure the right people for the job are working on the right teams.The game feels a bit clunky in spots -- not being able to rotate items when building is a huge oversight. And there's not as much going on concurrently as there is in Game Dev Tycoon. This is still a solid way to spend a couple of hours. I blew through the campaign in about 2.5 hours, though I'd imagine it's possible to do it much quicker if you're not a perfectionist.In short: definitely a fun game, but lacks complexity and is over too soon"

,Recommended,399670,21596539,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Obsidian Age,"Game Corp DX is quite similar to Game Dev Tycoon, in that you get to create your own video-game industry. You start out small, and hire more developers as you progress. Developers all have individual needs and traits such as how productive they are, and need to be trained in various software to contribute to a project. There's also an aspect of the classic game The Movies by Lionhead Studios, with competitor studios and an awards ceremy that gives trophies to the best companies.Positives:- A very fun casual game that teaches you about the game development industry.- The gameplay is very easy to learn, though still incredibly enjoyable.- You unlock more skilled employees and new equipment as you progress. You also get larger studio space at each city you unlock.- The artwork is quaint and definitely adds to the appeal of the game.Negatives:- You're really pressed for space in your studio as you progress, as you must hire all 'local' potential employees before moving locaiton to expand your studio. This is exaccerabted by the fact that most objects take up multiple spaces, and you cannot move an object over any existing 'invalid' squares, even if doing so would be a valid move. For example, an object occupies two squares. You move it over one square, which the object itself is already occupying. The game won't let you do this, as you must move the object to a completely different location, *then* to the target location.- Adventure games seem to take a random hit. I can only assume this is to make the achievement related to earning more than $20m from an advetnure title harder. At the end of the game, no-one has basically *any* interest in adventure games, making this task very difficult.- The informtion boxes are ridicuously small. You can increase their size, but this blurs the text. Also, in many cases some text will float off the screen, making it unreadable. I set the text size to the highest setting, so this may not be as bad for smaller texts.Conclusion:Game Corp DX is a really fun game and a great way to kill a few hours. It's an enjoyable game that does a good job at what it is trying to do. For the price, you get many hours of enjoyable gameplay, so I can definitely recommend this as a game to pick up!"

It would help if there was some kind of menu dedicated to managing your personnel so you could see who all your idle workers are and what skills they have.  I just end up having to cycle through the new project menu twice, once to see who is available and then again to choose what kind of project I want to do with those workers.  It took me a really long time to figure out how you can fire someone.  Also, maybe it would make the game a little too easy, but I think it'd be reasonable for workers to be available to work on another project right away once their role on a project in development is complete.Lastly, I've noticed my Game Corp employs no women and only one black guy, so... 10/10 for realism and the somewhat disgusted feeling that accompanies it?

Worth the price, it's very cheap the same time very fun. I couldn't stop it after first lauching the game, and all the way to finishing it. This is that kind of thing, that, only us gamers in the industry could get the jokes, get it? Anyways, very funny, and I understand what indie devs do when they try to push a handmade game into the market competing with other great enterprizes, like Early Access/EA, Crapcom, things like that, and mostly getting a tiny portion of the market.This game also has some of replayability, where it has a challenge mode and difficulty to set up. And moreover, the devs offer a free dlc, I think it's another gaem? Didn't play it. For the customers. So I think it's very decent now.Still, there's still some sections of the game needed ""polish"", for instance, the building mechanics, moving objects around but you can't right click cancel it. And the floating text is too small, set it bigger but it'll get covered by the screen, so one thing need to be noticed.Fun game, low price, try it out."

,Recommended,399670,18337765,"Posted: 4 October, 2015",all,Leon,"I'm writing this review based on Normal mode in story, as I have yet to play the challenge mode (looking forward to it) or story hard mode. Though I have played a large number of these games, so I'm comparing to what I've experienced but don't take my word as fact as I am human and I am biased in some aspects.TL;DR at the bottom, because I'm long winded.The game itself is a simple game creation simulator where you hire people then specialise them into either Code, Art, Sound or Writing and get them to make games for you. The workers gain experience and get better at their jobs, to a point, and eventually this allows you to move into bigger studios and make bigger games. Until you complete everything there is to do and then you pretty much unlock free mode.My first opinion of the game was that it was simple, this is by no means a negative, a bit of a half and half at times though. It gives the game it's own place within a genre of games that is full of innovative ideas and different ways of doing things. I would, from what I've experienced, call this game an intro into Management Simulation games. I say this because It's not a hard game to learn or master (In my opinion) and I found myself breezing through the game in 3 hours without even a hitch in the money department. But people that are newer to this genre would find this game to have a very plesent learning curve.It doesn't have the thing a lot of other similar games have where genres are locked off until you research them or a job tree for workers to evolve within. Which was nice to me, I usually find those sorts of activities tend to bore me as they can take a long time to do or reduce the quality of your games until things get back on track. In Game Corp DX you'll have all the Genres unlocked for you instantly (I don't know why some games have you research them for months in the first place) and your workers will take the specialistation you give them and stick with it (unless you want to change them later).The music isn't bad, though it's repetiveness could get annoying to some though but I found it plesent. No sound errors or noises that were unecessarily loud too which is a plus.Only things i found that could be looked at in a very slightly negative way is the difficulity level, though I said above I played only on Normal and have yet to look at the challenge and hard modes to get a comparison. The achievements also weren't very hard to get but as I played on normal, that had a hand in it.For cons I found the bar at the top to be too small, I could read it, but at times it was difficult. The rooms are very small with not much room to do things, half the time you'll spend playing will be organising the furniture to fit everything in. Not a big variety in the objects to put in, decorations especially.----Bug/Glitch----Only Bug I found was a progress bug, and though annoying it's exploitable from what I could see. I finished all the storyline quests, closed the game and re-opened it to see if it saved it, it did but it reset all the story quests and their rewards. I'm not sure if this always happens or if it was just because I finished everything in one sitting but it happened.-------------------Overall, I'm glad to have played Game Corp DX, it is a good game for the price that's being asked and it's simple enough to just sit down and go for people who are experienced right down to people who are brand new to the genre.------TL;DR------Pros+- Easy to pick up and play- Simple for beginners- Not a bad price tag for what it deliversPros with a little Con, or Cons with a little Pro- Music was nice, though some people won't like the repetivness of it- Art was simple but some people have a problem with simple art- Progress bug but it's exploitable for the benefit of the player (money)- Not very long if you know what you're doingCons- Can be boring for those who ae used to all the things other, bigger games do- Small top HUD bar- Small rooms/Hard to fit everything at times- Not many decoration optionsOverview- Updates will improve this immensly- If you're on the fence about buying it, it's not much and it's a fun game to play, so buy it :P"

When I was polishing a large game, a message saying ""you need a free master workstation"" when I had one already placed. I did not know I needed one for the Master of Code, Art, Sound, and Writting.

Much simpler mechanics than its contemporaries (I'd compare it to Game Dev Story for Android and Game Dev Tycoon). It also seems to take some art influence from Prison Architect, although I could be wrong on that.One thing I liked about the simpler mechanics is that optimizing it did not require reference materials--if you wanted good results from Game Dev Story and Game Dev Tycoon, you really needed to consult external resources as you played to make sure you followed combos well. In Game Corp DX, you could quickly and visually see what your optimal games would be. The flip side of this is that it's really, really easy to optimize.Still, it was an enjoyable couple of hours, but doesn't really have much replay value.

The game is done well, there's no bugs, it's addictive. The problem is with the whole genre of economic simulators. At first you just explore the game's options, so it's genuinely pleasurable to try new item or ability. But at some point there's nothing to explore and try anymore, you know exactly what you are supposed to do, it just requires a 1 hour investment of tediously implementing your plan.By the time I started creating large games, the process felt like a painful slog, but the reptile brain still wanted to finish the game. Hijacking reward circuits is no joke. There ought to be a revolution in this genre of games, so that there's always something new to explore, and most of the time isn't taken by either waiting, the most painful of all gaming experiences, or micro-management.I commend the author on humor, I had an employee named Gabe N., having a competitor named Walve and reviewer Kotakoo was worth a chuckle. The game could have more humor, though, e.g. reviews themselves are too generic."

Its a fun great simple game that will last you a few hours, it can get boring at times but the hunger to beat the game and collect all the achievements is what kept me going. :)7.5/10PROS:-worth the money-simple and easy to play yet also fun-funny little easter eggs throughout-small upgrades that make everything worthwhile-easy to get 100% steam achievementsCONS:-Wish there was more content, eg awards, locations, items etc"

It´s very addictive when you start to get the star valoration, because you want more and more, so you start to play and play to improve your company skills and habilities. I think that the recolocations are a very good point too, it´s so nice start at London and finish at San Francisco. (Or I think so, because I am in (SPOILER ALERT) Monreal) I recommend 8.5/10 this game. BAD POINTS: The employees are always very lazy and often they are sleeping. Yes, they are working and sleeping too. But it´s alright, because in the large and medium scale games you have more members that are working.And the second and last bad point, (in my opinion this game have not too much bad points, is totally working for me) is that the game rhythm it´s too fast. I´m going to explain: With almost 4000-5000 or less quality points you have reached the five stars in all the mediums. I think that the rhythm could be slowly, so you need almost 8000-10000 points to reach the 5 stars in all mediums. But, I don´t know if this is a really bad point, because I´m playing my first time at this game and I have the difficulty at Casual, so I don´t know if in Hard difficulty you have to reach more quality points to win more stars in the press.So this is my analysis. In general it´s a very good game.8.5/1085/100three and a half stars/ 5 stars(*SORRY IF I HAVE MISTAKES IN THE GRAMMAR*)Thanks for reading this! :DLike if you are reading this :p"

The game centers around building a video game company, you can expand your company, make games, make/lose money. There are Game Awards each year and you fight with Rival Companies to make the best game and attempt to get the Game of the Year Award. To best show the Game I will show my first experiance with It.Game Company: EAWe started as a small company with a cast of about 6 people including Gabe Newell. We made some small games such as Sitar Hero and each time we would make a bit of profit, nothing amazing. Slowly we built are way up and with the release of are hit game Calf Life we were able to invest into a new factory location of vancover. We planed a slew of sequels for are titles and we became arrogant making 10 games a year. That year we won alot of awards! It also featured some of are best releases Calf Life 2 was a hit!. The next year we had 19 workers and attempted are biggest project yet, Calf Life 3. It took almost a year to make, but it finally came out and the reviews raved about it, VGN gaves us 4 star!We employed more and more, trained more and more. But little did we relise are workers were costing us more than are games were making. We went for one last push with Calf Life 4, we invested alot of money into it. It was a flop making less money then we expected. That years Game Awards we won very little. The company morale was low and not even a new water cooler was going to save us now. We releases some more micro games including Sitar 3, but all of them made little profit. By 2018 EA had sunken into huge debt. We found out the reason for are money loss was that most of are workers weren't doing anything, so we fired alot of them, we lost more and more, going further into dept, losing more and more workers, Until we had to fire Gabe Newell. We had one worker left, And almost 100,000 debt. On June 2019 EA filled Bankruptcy with are final game""Poo: Pls buy this sh*t""I feel this story demonstrates what happens in this game!
