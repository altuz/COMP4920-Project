,Recommended,399820,21034612,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Ult,"This is the product of what would happen if the fast-paced and thunderbolt world of Super Mario Strikers met the charming and intense world of Sensible Soccer. Sprinkle some unforgettable scenes from Shaolin Soccer and you have Kopanito All-Stars Soccer.Impressions+ I have never had so much fun slide tackling in to opponents. Traditional grassroot rules do not apply, so get out there and break those legs!+ Gameplay is solid and fully responsive between keyboard and gamepad. There is a learning curve involved, but once you discover the importance of team work, dribbling and tackling, everything feels a lot friendlier.+ Visually a very charming game. The cartoony art direction is certainly a good call and works well. Player animations are solid. Goal celebrations are... ahem... animated.+ Not a lot to offer in terms of sound effects and soundtrack, but the current offering delivers to a satisfactory standard.+ A large assortment of competitions to unlock and play through including custom tournaments, practice and friendly matches.+ Powers can be huge game changers and injects new life to the sport. There are four powers in total with individual strengths and weaknesses.+ Support for up to four additional local players. Grab your friend(s) and charge through various tournaments as a team.+ Full keyboard + mouse and gamepad support. Keys can be configured to your heart’s content.+ The greater the goal difference, the more resilient and alert the AI becomes to your tackles and dribbles. Something I have not seen before, but it's a mechanic which works extremely well in an attempt to avoid further catastrophes.+ Leaderboard and fame points work really well side by side. Adds a whole different layer of depth for players to continue playing and reach the Platinum League.+ 225 achievements and in-game trophies. That’s 225 individual pieces of effort and excruciating dedication to unlock.+ Match challenges offer objectives for players in search of small modifiers (ie. avoid using powers, score three goals in 30 seconds, and so on). You gain fame points in return for your efforts.+ Friendly user interface with all the standard options you would expect from a PC title.+ Online multiplayer is planned for release with the final version of the game.Early access consideration and dev feedback- A friendly warning: The AI will torture you during your first few sessions/hours until you figure out how everything works. You may even grow suspicious of cheating AI. I most certainly did. The important thing is to try and play as much as you can to get to grips with the gameplay.- Slight overkill with AI catch up speed compared to player catch up. I don't feel like the sprint button does anything when chasing the AI.- The need for more power ups or other methods of scoring (ie. volley or header) is great.- There is an audio balancing issue. Almost all audio during play comes through the right speaker/headphone. I have tried using two perfectly functional headsets and a speaker to cancel any malfunctions on my end.- Only international teams are playable. It would be great to be able to play in a league filled with fictional teams/players, just to shrug off the feeling of international play. Pro Evolution Soccer has done this for many years with great success (ie. North London: Arsenal; Hampshire Red: Southampton; Merseyside Blue: Everton).- It would be an even greater feature to allow players the freedom to create their own teams, team names, players and kits from pre-made designs, then to incorporate this team to a randomly generated and fictional league."

,Recommended,399820,28731270,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Nachlader,"Really good game, and they're not lying about it being skill based. See this gif of a goal I scored, partly by accident - its what made me realise this game allows for some serious skill to be developed:http://puu.sh/t13Ox/d066abd8b3.gifI've been trying to replicate that goal ever since. You can further develop skills as well - even the AI will tend to pass the ball into space and then sprint onto it, but I kept finding that when I tried doing that against professional (i.e. hard) AI they could still slide into where you put the ball, so I started turning around quickly soon after picking up the ball again after sprinting onto it and it often means I evade their slide tackle attempt and I'm gifted a glorious chance on goal. Speaking of which, scoring is an absolute delight in this game, as it should be in any football game, especially when you get just the right amount of curve on the ball that it beats the keeper. I wish airshots were a bit more complex - its nothing more than just holding down the shoot button, but then again it does require some skill with lobbing and corners before you get a prime opportunity to airshot the ball into the net.Gameplay is VERY fast on higher difficulty, the ball will travel a lot an utmost attention is required to keep up. The game certainly provides ample challenge for players and, as mentioned, the AI will start to show off their skill too (which I didn't expect, the hard AI in Rocket League is terrible, so I had lower standards for the AI in Kopanito).My only issues are: no custom-made teams, the online play doesn't seem to be working (although you can still play against people on your Steam friends list, which is enough for me), there's no in-game chat, the keyboard sometimes adds itself as another player, and your friend can't personally choose their own team. Also I wish the crowds were animated (it's like playing at the Emirates Stadium) and that there were people on the subs bench - minor details that would add some nice touches. Being able to choose what colour Player 1, 2, 3, etc, is would also be really helpful - I played locally with a friend on the same team and I had pink and he had red so it was a bit confusing.Overall I definitely recommend this game, I was already happy with my purchase only a few hours in."
,Recommended,399820,31117085,Posted: 13 April,all,Andy,"I really want to like this game, and, in a way I do. I paid 3 GBP for this and after spending less than an hour playing, I already have some strong opinions about how this game needs to be improved.Asthetically, everything holds up. The art style is consistent througout and sound effects are clean and punchy. The problem unfortunately comes from gameplay.My first and most prominent gripe is the dribbling system, or lack thereof. Slide tackling gets old pretty fast as you get pummled from every angle and with no penalty to the opposing team. It feels impossible to manouver anywhere in which an opposing player is standing due to the risk of getting tackled by a 10 yard slide. Getting rid of the ball ASAP seems to be the name of the game.In a previous match, a challenge encouraged me to tackle 10 players without sliding (blocking tackle). I managed to do so but immediately after completing the challenge, I went right back to using sliding as my sole means of performing a tackle. There's little argument to justify using a blocking tackle.Power ups are pretty cool but theres only 6 and they seem pretty unbalanced. A rather infuriating one is an electrocuting drone which lasts much longer than any other power up.The challenges add some needed variety to the game although they can go from being mildly challenging to feeling down right impossible. You can collect stars and coins but the menu options and guide don't provide any direction as to what they mean or if they can even be used.I've complained enough so let me reassure you that there are some good points to this game. Shooting feels robust and the abilitiy to switch between manual and auto passing on the fly is great. There's plenty to like about this game but the minor annoyances mentioned above are likely to put you off playing this one often.If you have a few controllers and like to play with friends, or maybe you're looking for a cheap and causal game to play, breaking your usual FPS routine, this might be the one for you. Just make sure you don't pay too much for it as you'll likely get bored rather quickly.Message to devs:This game is so close to being really well polished. Keep working on it!"

Overall I recommened this game to anyone that has that ""sports itch"" at the moment and is looking for something to play.  I also recommend to anyone that likes sports games in general too.From a singleplayer point of view:I was never into sports games or watched any sports in real life, but I do enjoy playing the games from time to time.  I am one of those that got the ""sports itch"", I looked around and saw this game.  The graphics are very welcoming and fun which pushed me to buy this.  When I started playing, I was amazed at how fun the game actually was, the overall mechanics are simple, but there is an underlying depth to it which makes it hard to master.Anyone can pick up this game and play it right away with no problem.  The fun factor was instant, I just wanted to play more and more.What also appealed to me is that, there aren't any rules, except when kicking the ball out of bounds, anything goes beyond that.  You can slide tackle all you want and watch your opponent eat grass all day if you want too.  This to me is awesome because sports games with all these rules turn me off, I just want to play for fun, if I want rules then I'll play the other fifa games or w/e.Overall I would recommend purchasing this game, especially if you play with friends, I can see lots of enjoyment coming out of it.  If not then definitely keep an eye out."

Today I found this gem and I'm so goddamn happy.First you are starting with an easy practice mode, controls are so easy and consistant if you ever played fifa or pes at least once. And then jumping in a tournament with AI. Difficulties are selectable. And I have to say AI is really good.You have to start at Oceania Cup.. So you cant just pick the most powerful european teams. They are locked. You have to win the tournament and unlock them. And this is really nice to me. We got stadiums, footballs, teams to unlock.We got tons of achivements.

,Recommended,399820,29536888,Posted: 28 January,all,[d0m] Giovanni,"The game itself is great and a lot of fun.  I think this is one of the most frustrating menu systems I've seen.  I wish you could permanently disable certain controllers in the settings.  As it is, since I have a keyboard / mouse, gamepad, and X52 flight stick I need to go to the main menu and disable the flight stick and keyboard otherwise every match I play it will create 3 players for me.  No problem, disable it in the game lobby you say?  No, if you forget to manually disable a controller you join your match with multiple players, have to quit out, disable controllers again, get another invite.. etc...  It's you're playing with 4+ people watch all of them have to do this once or twice.Were you in the game and hit Shift+Tab for Steam overlay?  Woops, now your keyboard is active again and you have to quit out, go back to the main menu, disable the controller, and get reinvited to your game.If they can fix this it's a must buy.  If they don't I still recommend the game as it's fun and skill-based, similar to rocket league."

Yeah, it's not FIFA or PES...but IMO it's actually better than both when it comes to the pure ""fun"" factor.Hopefully, it will attract more and more people to the online scene as well.

,Not Recommended,399820,21353853,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Duckhunt Doge,"To say the game isn't fun for an hour or two would be a lie. But at a price point of 10.99 (CDN) there just is zero meat on the bone to want to keep playing. It took about 4 hours to play all the tournements on the beginner level to unlock the other ones. Then you are to move up to the next difficulty to again, unlock the next tiers of tournements.In lies the rub, there is no variety in the games. Yes, it's soccer. But all it is as simply put is; slide tackle, run for 5 feet and then start spinning with the ball and hope the never missing AI might miss a tackle. Then use the sniper mode to aim for one of the corners..... Rinse repeat. That is the whole game. None of the teams have any 'differnce' other then the colours of their shirts/player faces. No team is better then the other and you can NEVER outrun a defender. If you have the ball you run at 75% speed any defenseman can run down forwards. It's just a little silly.If it's on sale, grab it for a few hours of something sports on Steam. Don't expect it to hold your attention for long once you are past the first few games and your doing the exact thing every game."
,Recommended,399820,24012610,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Dolphin Lundgren,"Game reviewed before online multiplayer is available.Some people may think that because a football game isn't ""serious"", it can be sloppy. These people are wrong, IMO. Games like Rocket League or Mario Strikers on Wii are perfect examples of well-oiled games of this genre. Kopanito fits within this category too. It looks a lot like World Cup on the NES for those who are young enough to have played it but with a serious update.PROS:- Good controls/dynamics- Lots of ways to approach this game. Many options to score goals- Surprisingly fair- Easy/fun to play but room for competitive games, I think (we'll see once the online multi is available)CONS:- It says ""soccer"" in the title. Guys: it's called football! (sarcasm) (or not!)- Could be tedious on the long run vs. computer. Guess online multi will solve the issue.Conclusion: funnier to play compared to ""realistic"" games like FIFA or PES. Worth the price tag but grab it while it's on sale a get 2-3 copies for your friends. Fun should ensue."

Additionally, if you really like the single player, there's like an infinite amount of tournaments in the game, with increasing difficulty.No matter what you do though, probably wait till the game is on sale. $14 is a bit steep for what amounts to a pretty decent arcade-y soccer (football) game with a nonfunctional online.7.5/10"

Well placed curlers, slide tackles to reach a pass that was a little off, and correctly timed interceptions is pretty much key in this game, aswell as obviously passing, crosses etc.There is pretty much no time to rest or think of a strategy since its extremely fast paced.Itll take quite some time befor unlocking every team/tournament, especially on harder difficulties.Oh and playing this game as a local co-op with friends is def. recommended.

The developers look closely to comments and involve and let participate the KAS community in selecting the next enhancements to where the game should be developed to.What I especially like about Kopanito is the simplicity of controls compared to other high class (AAA) football games like the FIFA (tm) series e.g.. In Kopanito, one does not need a long learning curve to become familiar with the controls and can start playing at an instant. Still one can do some really nice (trick-)shots, and especially playing local multiplayer gains a lot of Schadenfreude, e.g. when kicking the ball with an overhead kick into the opponent's goal (including their goalkeeper), or smashing the forward just before the shot with the goalie and a defender in synchronicity...Keeping away no-fun rules (like offsides, yellow and red cards) and plainly focusing on game flow, Kopanito reminds me on the goody old times when a friend of mine and I played Sensible Soccer on the Amiga for hours and hours (he won most of the time ;-) ).Taking into account the absolutely fair game price, I believe that no one will make a mistake in buying this game who likes casual sports games that suddenly evolve into a family affair... :-)I'd like to give two thumbs up to this game.

What a move, Ladies and Gentlemen. Exceptional talent displayed from this player but . . . Hold on, WHAT A CRASHIIIING TACKLE from the second defender, so hard that his boots are the only remains on the pitch! Did you see where he landed, guys?” I love commentating Kopanito All-Stars Soccer matches; we see great moves, great tackles and no dives! Plenty of boots here and there but definitely no dives.Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a fast paced arcade-ish sports game. As per the intro, this sports game is absolutely frantic, to say the least! Well, there are no referees on the pitch and we do not care about this silly offside rule. All we have is two teams of six players each who go in to battle fiercely to win the match.  You will be able to use super moves when you fill the energy bar (I call it that), every successful pass, tackle, shot and goal will help you to increase your charge bar. Then you might get the super shot and score; you might get the magnet to pull the ball back to you (this is what Germany used in the Semi-final against Brazil in the latest World cup, for sure); you might teleport a player up field, or even get a massive ventilator behind the net so the ball can’t cross the line! JUST FUN!16 tournaments and leagues to play either solo or with friends on local multiplayer which supports up to five players (four on gamepads and one at the keyboard) and four levels of difficulty. I would recommend that you start playing on the beginner level for a while and familiarise yourself with the gameplay. As soon as you move up to the amateur, the difficulty increases dramatically.During each match, you will be given a challenge - if you manage to succeed you will receive points and in-game achievements. 114 national teams to choose from but a large number of them need to be unlocked.I really like the cartoonish graphics; the game is very well balanced and the controls very responsive.Positives:~~~~~~~-	Really fun gameplay-	Great cartoon graphics-	100’s of national teams to play-	Great number of tournaments and leagues to play (including custom ones)-	Local multiplayer-	Trading cards-	Stacks of achievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	The levels of difficulty increase rather steeplyIt is fast, fun, competitive and even frustrating at times.

Playing Kopanito is entertaining and challenging even in single player mode. But I assume Kopanito was intended to be developed as a stunning multiplayer experience. And that's the problem, cause there are way too few players and therefore it's hard to make online-matches. Anyway, despite the stupid teammate-AI and some minor bugs, which occured while the game was in EA, you will become a well designed, well balanced and easy to learn, difficult to master experience. It's really worth a try and I wish the game would become the attention it deserves."

No penalties makes it feel a bit different than a standard soccer game.

It's a great achievment, because it's much more advanced than Sensible Software masterwork. As in SWOS you used one key to any action (passing, lobing striking, tackling) - here you have 5-6. But do not worry - difficulty levels will help you to advance (or you can still have lot of fun on the easiest difficulty setting).Creative and dynamic game, lot of fun (e.g. super powers) - the all you want."

It's a good game to play with people who maybe aren't into games like fifa which are more complex (as much as a football game can be).There are however clear problems with the game that need to be fixed before the game is something I would recommend.CONS:The AI man the AI. The AI really really needs to be fixed. On any difficulty the AI will always have perfect aim with its slide tackles, which you'll soon realize are the key meta to the game.This wouldn't really be a problem if slide tackling wasn't so difficult for human player. Sure you get better as you play but forget playing with your girlfriend when the AI never misses a slide (unless you juke, but thats a whole other thing). The AI also passes and shoots stupidly fast. It just looks like the developers added no margin of error for the AI. Its like fifa if all the sliders were at 100.The game can be fun and rewarding but its quiet annoying when the AI has pixle perfect slides and passes that will never ever miss. And of course the AI can gage the slide distance perfectly so be prepared to be tackled at the max distance you can be tackled from.I hope the game does well and gets the updates it needs but in its current state, you'll be left shaking your head. That said, none of that will really make you lose. Shooting is fun and quick to learn so youll soon be scoring from 40 yards. But the fun times are really limited when you have to dance around the perfect AI all game.TLDR: Just make it so the AI can miss sometimes."

Very fun.Sad thing is: this game has only singleplayer and local multiplayer.The problem is that playing in singleplayer made me notice many annoying faults this game has:- Controls [EDITED] -> after the change of passes and the aerial moves, now it's better and even the CPU has to deal with the no-auto passes, giving you room for intercepts.I still think the slides could be more accurate.- Gameplay is fun, but repetitive against CPU.- Difficulty not quite balanced.- The shooting mechanic is slow to react to inputs and can't be canceled by a pass, annoying.- Powers are fun but they charge too slow to really be enjoyed and they are random.- a bug stuck the GK and the match couldn't go on, I lost all the tournament because of that.. not cool.Another major issue is the lack of online multiplayer and who knows when this game will have it.Is it a problem to buy a game at 3,50€ and hope to play it online, one day?I think it's wiser to wait for this game to have more features and some mechanics rebalanced, before buying it.The singleplayer isn't very fun but the multiplayer may have some potential, in future.I hope to change my mind about this game."

However, after the most recent patch it has become frustrating.    Passing use to be direct, but now you have to chase after passes-typically by backtracking.  When you get to the ball you may have to circle back to it once or twice to even pick it up, but by then the AI will have picked it up in one swoop.Play as your favorite team?I have played 4 hours in and haven’t even unlocked any European teams, so I do not know how hard it is to unlock them.  However, if you want to play your home country and it happens to be Japan, Australia, Mexico, Canada, the US to name a few, then good luck.  You will have to win a specific tournament on Professional (hard).  For the US, you have to beat 5 tournaments to even unlock the specific tournament.  So if you can get good enough, by the time you do, you may be tired of the game.BugsMy keeper has gotten caught multiple times behind his own net during corner kicks, where I have to go in and out of menus to try to get him unstuck (then I often give up a goal because of it).  My keeper has run off the screen with the ball until the half ended.  My keeper has kicked balls backwards on goal kicks and passes, once scoring an own goal (since the last update), and that is not counting the time he leaps out of bounds with the ball…or leaps with the ball into his own net.  On low difficulties this is forgivable, but on higher difficulties it is infuriating.OverallThis game has potential, and I would consider changing my review if they fixed two big issues: allow players to unlock everything from easy modes and remove the new passing update.  However, I can’t recommend it in its current as I feel it has strayed too far from being an arcade-style soccer game."

Local co-op is definitely a plus as well! However, there are two major improvements that will convince me to give this a thumbs up:- Improved netcode: I have a fast internet connection and decent setup but the responsiveness in an online game is miserable. I noticed that my opponent was having the same problems. Everything from switching characters in the timely manner, tackling when actually pressing the button, and passing was affected- Information about how many players are in each online game mode: There is a count in the bottom-left of the mode select screen that says how many players are online and how many are waiting for a game. However, with so many game types (5 or 6, iirc) it would be a huge help to see what modes people are waiting to play. Its great to see that 2 people are in the game lobby waiting to play but it would save a lot of trial and error to just tell me what game I should select so I can play with them. Likewise, if I'd like to play 3v3 with randoms, it'll increase their chances of finding me in that lobby if that lobby notated that there is somebody waiting in it.This is a fun game but these are areas that need improvement to make it fun to play online."

However, thats not to say that its a bad game, quite the opposite; it runs smoothly, the controls are intuitive, and the art style and graphics are fine at the very least.But it is limited. If you get this game then dont really expect anything more than a time waster, a good time waster mind you, but thats about it. The simplicity of the game is also it downfall, making it very hard to play for advanced tactics, as you can LITERALLY run circles around the opponent and win.It may also dissapoint anyone whos a fan of the more serious football games e.g. FIFA, because some basic game mechanics that you would expect to see are nowhere to be found. For example I will constantly pass to my team mate and start running with him, only to find that HE LEFT THE STUPID BALL BEHIND!!! And that was from a pass directly to him! So, yeh, players wont always latch onto the ball if you pass to them, also your friendly AI can be so stupid and not auto-run onto the ball if its landed right near them.Dont be put off though, it still has some great mechanics which it utilises perfectly: for one, the slow-mo precision shots are great and pulling off a shot curved right around the keeper feels fantastic! Furthermore the power up system is a nice touch and all the power ups tend to balance out nicely, with some being more O.P than others but never to an unfair extent - yes im looking at you Blue Shell    >:(I picked this game up on sale so really I'm quite pleased, but looking at its current full release price it would be hard to make a case for buying it, especially as its currently single player and local co-op only, though the developers are quite active and have said that theyre working on an online multiplayer feature, which honestly it really needs as the AI can be laughable at times, and ridiculously skilled at others, basically seems a little unbalanced.If you do pick this up then I would strongly recommend playing with a controller, makes the game way more friendly for new players, however be aware that if you pause a match using the controller, you will have to press A/X (xbox/ps) to resume the match which, because of the button mapping, will make your player pass the ball unintentionally, or just change players all together - Very Annoying so try and remember to use the mouse to close the pause menu.In summary, yes definitely pick this game up on sale, but give it a little thought before purchasing at full price. However you can completely ignore me on that one if the devs have added in more features, because online multiplayer would definitely make the price tag more appealing."

76561197997045080,Recommended,399820,29478860,Posted: 25 January,all,agurczuk,"Kopanito is a fast paced arcade football game where standard football rules do not apply. On a match level the games are 5v5 with no referee, no offsides, no fouls and crazy mechanics. Tackles are brutal but harmless. There's next to no dribbling and occasional power-ups spice up the games. And above all it's simply fun to play.The controls feel simple but in fact provide quite a few possibilities. On a basic level you've got shoot and pass buttons. But holding them longer results in a long pass, or a more powerful shot. Additionally when near the opponents goal charging the shot slows time and you're able to bend the shot. The amount of power charged defines as well how high the ball goes. This can result in quite spectacular goals. If you combine this with the cross ins and spectacular kick flip goals - well enough to say that the goals are really satisfying and fun to watch.Addition of power ups adds another layer to the game strategy and the fact that they're not abundant and you get just 2 or 3 per game makes them a good addition.Graphics are cartoon like with a distinct style. Really nice looking and fitting the game perfectly.The only complaints I have with this one is that it gets boring playing by yourself. There's a lot to unlock - teams and arenas, but they don't add anything to the game really. The teams are always of same skill level - and same as arenas are only decoration. The multiplayer while being there at the time of me playing had around 10 players at the same time and all games I was able to play online were laggy to the point of not being fun.I can see this game being fun playing with your friends locally with a beer or during a party. But as a single player experience - I clocked in 8 hours in it and have no desire to play it any longer. Even the hardest difficulty while challenging at first can be mastered and there is little challenge after that.Still a fun game worth picking up."

I'm only on Amateur as I've just started, but games are close.The controls are pretty straight-forwards though you can get quite creative and skillful with only a few moves.  For example, passing the ball just ahead of yourself so you can sprint to it and slide off with it for a boost of speed.Default game setting of a 6 minute match (3 minute halves) makes for intense amounts of fast-paced chaos, with options to shorten/extend as desired.Super moves can make for some crazy and hilarious plays.Goals can be quickly converted into GIFs with built-in GIF creator.  It breaks up the fast-paced intensity because it takes a few moments, but I really love it.Got it on sale for $3.59.  Worth every penny and then some.Definitely reminiscent of those NES World Cup days where eliminating the other team is an option.Best part is everything is based on skill - no pre-determined animations.  Every shot, pass, slide, super-move and header is yours to control giving a high skill cap, making every goal that much more satisfying."

Online multiplayer versus/coop with friends has been fun.Only complaints are the super powers, I wish there was a option to turn them off. The freeze/shocking fan last way to long to be enjoyable"

76561198037536195,Recommended,399820,32749667,Posted: 24 June,all,DaBrusuru,"This game is pretty awesome. I view it is a modern day Nintendo World Cup, except more fluid and faster pace and with optional super powers. If your looking for an arcade soccer/football game that's easy to pick up and play, look no further. This game is worth every penny spent, especially if it is on sale :)Pros:- Fairly easy to customize through local files- Can add teams/stadiums/balls without replacing existing items- Controller support. It works well.- Character design makes me smile- Difficulty steps are consistent and fair- Local multiplayer supports up to 5 players (full team of field players)Cons:- No in-game team customizer- Not a big online community"

If you don't have time to play FIFA or Konami, this will be a good choice.A strange thing is: the Tesla always shock me, even I'm the releaser."

,Recommended,399820,35187134,Posted: 24 September,all,Pablo Diehl,"Football is one of my favourite sports, just behind motor racing, and of course I like to play ""e-football"".Games like FIFA, PES or many others are good games, however, often, when you're playing it, you get so much focused in winning the matches, that you forgot the main principle of video game: to have fun. And, fortunately, ""Kopanito"" is all about it, having fun.I mean, the gameplay is so easy to understand, but at the same time, so much precise that often, even when you lose the match you're with a silly smile on your face thinking ""what a great match!"".The multiplayer is a great sum! Nowadays, times where we're being pushed to individual gameplays, or at most online multiplayer, ""Kopanito"" has still having a good local multiplayer - cooperative and competitive. Alright, FIFA and PES are just like that in this point, however ""Kopanito"" is more fun."
,Not Recommended,399820,35467881,Posted: 4 October,all,Vikko2,"I had played it briefly after buying on sale a while back, but I just couldn't get into it.If I could give it a neutral review, I would. I think the best way to describe the game issolid, but lacking.It just felt really bland, like there was very little to it. The worst part about the game is the lack of exciting sound design, and in that area, the game is extremely weak. If I recall correctly, there's music in the menu and then there's barely anything to be heard during the game, and the crowd cheers feel unconvincing.Some other things about the game is that it really doesn't leave a lasting impression, and to me, has a stylized but pretty unattractive character design. It's hard to identify with any of the teams when you can't get into any of their designs. I don't think any of the players even have names, and it makes it even harder to identify with any of the characters or differentiate between them. Even in soccer games, there are specific players I gravitate towards because that specific person has good stats or has done a lot in a match, but I can't even identify them here.Gameplay on the other handpretty much plays like you would expect it to, but it's nothing to get excited over. It controls solid, it feels pretty responsive, there's not much else to say about it. Other than that though, it painfully lacks variety. If you've played it once, you've played the whole game. To some degree, the gameplay mechanics feel too simplistic, actually. I don't even think different teams have different statistics or player stats.A thing the game advertises is that there are crazy super powers but none of them feel meaty or anything. You'd think if there are super powers, they'd feel impactful and special with some flair, but instead they feel like they fall short of being spectacular and impressive and end up feeling lackluster and disappointing.This doesn't mean the superpowers are weak. Far from it, actually. The problem is that they don'tfeelspecial in any way, and the game doesn't even try to make a big deal about them at all.I think that describes the game's problems well, actually.There's just a lack of flair in every aspect of the game, and makes the whole game feel lackluster when it feels like it has potential for something really impressive. It's another one of those games that could use some variation, especially in the teams. An example of where balance doesn't mean it's fun. The game lacks identity and just feels really barren, to the point where I could say it completely lacks any atmosphere whatsoever. The lack of music and overall excitement each match makes it hard to play the game for very long sessions, and I tried to play it a lot, I swear- but it was just unenjoyable.The thing is, though, is that the game plays well. Especially mechanically, the game is very strong. The gameplay is solid.It's just everything else that really kills it for me.There's a lot of things that could help the game build a stronger identity or sense of replayability. More modes, a cutesy campaign tournament, more powerups, more music, more custom rules, player names, character customisation, individual character stats and specialties- there's a lot that could be (or could have been) done.The VerdictWhere 1/10 is utterly broken, 5/10 is so-so, and 10/10 is almost perfection.Gameplay: 7.5/10Audio and Music: 3.5/10Graphics/Visuals: 6.75/10Replayability: 5.5/10Fun Factor(the most important rating): 6.5/10It's good, it's solid, but it's really lacking. It's not worth the price, but if you're willing to take a dip into a really simplistic but mechanically strong game, you can try picking it up on sale.This won't satisfy a hardcore soccer fan, nor a ""fantasy soccer"" fan either, and sits in a dead zone between the two- which I feel is this game's biggest weakness.For an example of a game that runs an extremely similar approach on another sport, I suggest checking out Stikbold. Stikbold is an example of a game in a similar thread of arcadey sports that does the formula exceptionally well, and in its case, Dodgeball."
