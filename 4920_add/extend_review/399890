From a museum to a strange island and a village in the end of the XVIIth century, you're going to find a powerful artifact that will defeat that traitor.When Artifex Mundi publishes something that isn't their own work, you're often disappointed by the quality. While these games are still good and high quality, it's not what Artifex Mundi can deliver. And sometimes, you find a real gem, that could have been developed by them. Dark Heritages for example is one of these gems. Now, The Secret Order 2 is joining that club.The story is a good one, though you wish that you played the first game to understand more the story. I mean, Nathan Williams, the bad guy, seemed to be related to the previous game (though it could be a mistake from my part). But, knowing you can travel through time (even if it's not really like in Time Mysteries, where you're going to different eras), you can expect some nice backgrounds. And you have them!It's the Collector's Edition that is on Steam, so, the bonus chapter is already added in the middle of the story, when you're diving into a terrible atmosphere, with spirits, swamps and other cursed castles.What I really loved in this game is that it's not too hard but not to easy: puzzles are well-balanced, HO scenes are also easy for some items but harder for others because of a matter of perspective (you're not used to see binoculars behind a piece of wood, showing their profiles or another item being upside down for example).And the music.... it's really fitting to the game. Really fitting.Anyway, my only complaint is the HUD that I find too big but you're getting used to that anyway.If anything, buy that game. You'll enjoy it.Now, I'm waiting for eventually for the first game to show up on Steam :)"

The artwork is incredible and I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the cutscenes and I'm not usually a person to bother with cutscenes. I just like to get into a game straight away. Everything about this game reeks enjoyment, contentment, excitement and compassion. I say compassion because the game was created with the player in mind and everything was made simple and easy to understand. I like having a map included so I don't have to backtrack loads of screens and the puzzles were very easy to understand and it was very clear what was expected of me. The game is well put together with a mixture of art, music, sound effects, colour and mystery. I like the look and feel of a game and this game definitely delivered that for me. Colour, thought and organisation play a part in what I enjoy and this game has it all. If you are a huge HOG fan like me, I would definitely give this game a try. I promise you that it will be worth your money and you will be hooked, I'm sure!"

Absolutely not worth paying the full price (the game is too short), but if you really like HOGs, get this one on a good sale. Not the best game ever, but surely not the worst. The puzzles were somewhat easy too.4/10."

(Only one puzzle related to that) I like those but I got bored in a couple of areas due the repetitive puzzles. The story was not bad, though this is the second game of the series which means you won't understand everything if you start playing with this one, but the journal was a good aid, highlighting most of the story. The graphics a little outdated but I like those, my issue was the puzzles, especially this one which I spent almost half an hour trying to solve it, I even closed the game to cool off before giving it a go again.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=895357501Pros:+Average graphics.+Fast travel map, but there are two separate maps which doesn't let you switch between them, you wouldn't know if there are tasks in that area unless you stand in one of the rooms of the second map.+Good journal with a very useful entries, I liked the fact that they linked the objectives to the fact page, love those.+Easy hidden objects scenes.+Music fits the scenes.+OK Voice acting, although some of the characters sounded so dramatic.+Easy achievements.+Steam achievements.Cons:-Annoying repetitive puzzles.-Annoying hint button which keeps beeping to reminds you you can use it whenever you go from and area to another.I got this game in a bundle, I'd say buy it when its cheap and enjoy the whole series."

I finished it in 4.8 hours and I got all the achievements which is a first.The puzzles were ok, but the story was just blah. I was saving this one because of the good reviews, so I am disappointed. Unfortunately I bought the next one which I have to play now. Hopefully it is better. The one good thing about this game is you can jump from place to place."
,Not Recommended,399890,32970531,Posted: 28 June,all,Dead Weight,"Reading the reviews made me nervous to play this (I got it with a pack of other, higher-rated games) but I think going in with low expectations helped. The plot isn't /so/ bad considering it's a point-and-click, but the first act moves bizarrely fast. Rather than build plot and info you start off knowing pretty much everything and go from there. Once you get past that it's not /so/ bad; it's not the best, I rolled my eyes at times, but it's not terrible. The voice-acting, though, is absolutely godawful. Click to continue when you can, and if cinematics don't matter to you (they don't reveal anything at all this go) just go beyond them. The graphics are good, but that doesn't really make up for it all. The number of clicks is low, there isn't much to find or use or puzzle out. I would NOT reccomend buying this on its own, not even necessarily if it's on a good sale. if you end up with it, though, you won't want to slit your throat or anything. It's just not great. Artifex does good games on their own, but this was just of their production, not their creation. Replayability is basically null as well.tl;dnr - Eh. Even if you like point-and-clicks like me, just... eh. I love these things in general, but I won't be buying the prequels or the sequels."
,Recommended,399890,18928197,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,BlackWidow,"At first sight I was thinking that this game looks the same as an ordinary Facebook Hidden Object game. But I was wrong. First of all, the story is very catchy and interesting, kinda similar to the Dan Brown novels (if you read them). The puzzles are quite difficult to complete. However, you really need to pay attention to the dialogs and messages in order to resolve the puzzles.The hints are very useful, unlike other hidden objects games with erronate hints or incomplete.The soundtracks and music is quite well created and same goes for the graphics.It really worth it to buy this game and I can't wait for the next part!"
,Recommended,399890,29149473,Posted: 9 January,all,Quiet Siren,"Have you kissed your HOG today? Oh wait...not your Harley, but another well done casual game with Hidden Objects, good puzzles, and moments of some really beautiful artwork.The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent is a time traveling mariner's delight.  It is everything one would expect from Artifex Mundi, complete with Steam Achievements for the Achiev0philes.Pros:-o- Story moves along at a good pace.-o- Always great to have options on what level of difficulty to choose.-o- Some lovely artwork that at times is right up there with the Myst franchise.-o- Voice acting is in the average to good category.-o- Plenty of Hidden Objects, find and use objects, and fragmented objects.-o- The mind-bender puzzles are doable without hints for skilled players, but will tempt you to brute force a couple of them.-o- Great price (about a buck per hour if you relax and play at a very relaxed pace) for full price and super price if you pick it up on saleCons:-o- Ran into a couple of glitches, where needed objects would not show up when passing the curser over them during multiple, careful room /location searches and then would magically show up after a reboot of the game.-o- Wish the Hints and Skip menus were a bit smaller, so that they are less likely to get hit inadvertently during the action of searching or sussing out puzzles.Overall, got many hours of entertaining gameplay and am delighted that Artifex Mundi has re-ignited my love of casual gaming; a nice break from FPSs and more complex mind benders like Obduction, Riven, etc.Another plus on that note, I had already picked up the 4th in the series in a sale bundle. When I looked for the earlier games in the series, I saw a bundle with 2, 3, and 4 (1 is not yet on Steam).  Imagine my delight when the bundle order recognized that I already had 4 in my library, and so adjusted the bundle price accordingly and dropped the duplicate game. That rocked!Indulge your inner seeker and adventurer and pick this up!"

Didn't make much sense, for a start you are at home, then a museum and then cruising around in what seems to be a time travelling pirate ship... if you think that's odd, then it gets worse. Not much of a hidden object game as there are multiple puzzles just not hidden object related. Started skipping puzzles towards the end just to get through it and be done with it. Very short, only took about 4 hours to get through. Quite please that I did not pay full price for this and obviously will be staying clear of the other Secret Order games in the future."

The storyline is abtuse at best, and the cutscenes and graphics look like they're from 1999.  I'm a sucker for these kinds of games, but I may have to start rethinking purchasing games that Artifex Mundi only publishes and doesn't develop.  They need to start exercising some quality control.  Achievements on this one are minimal as well, with nothing beyond the story achievements and a few hidden objects ones like 3-in-a-row and completing a hidden object in under a minute.  4/10"

,Recommended,399890,24949442,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,DocCovington,"Sometimes, photo-realistic images are not desireable for a game. One of those cases are HO games. It makes it a bit painful to work through the puzzles when you can't get a clear ímage of the item due to shadows and certain lighting.Apart from that, this game has a tense atmosphere. The soundtrack tried to increase the tension but fails at times due to repetitiveness and annoyance.The clicking mechanics are so-so, if you want to have perfection to compare this to play Enigmatis 3 or Fairy Tale Mysteries 2.This game is nothing like its great successor TSO3: Ancient Times. Awful voice acting, truly terrible! Also, some of the sound effects (especially of the constantly recharging hourglass at each screen) are extremely annoying. The steps you need to take to get to a certain point make very little sense. Overall, this game seems to have been made for 10-year olds, intellectually (storyline etc.) and in regard of its level of difficulty.I can only recommend the game on a discount price."

,Recommended,399890,20621838,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,Thamior Silberdrache,"The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent is a Hidden Object game as many others. It has mostly beautiful graphics and some realy good animation (and some that are not so good).The game has three different difficulty settings, but if you are going for the steam achievment, it's irrelevant on which setting you play because it mainly influences the time between two hints and the steam achievments require you to do the game without hints at all. But it's not overly difficult. In fact, even without hints I would call it 'medium'.The story is ok for a fantasy and time travelling story. Without spoiling anything it is mainly your task to find a lost artifact.One positive point if you are no native english speaker and the game is available in your language is that they realy seemed to care for a good translation which is sadly not granted in many games. At least the german translation was nearly flawless. (There is no german voice output, however, only translated subtitles.) This is especially important on hidden object scenes. What times I have spent in bad translated games to look for an item only to find out the translation was spoiled.[Edit:] After I just played another hidden object game, I just realized that the map feature which does not only show you where you might be able to do something at a certain time, but also allows you to quick travel and therefore save you from spending much time just moving from location to location, is woth mentoining as an additional positive point. [/edit]A beautiful extra is that you can replay any hidden object screens and puzzles and rewatch all video sequences once you have finished the game.Well, most reviews I write are much longer, but there realy isn't much to say. So: If you are fan of hidden object games, this is a recommendation. If you just want to waste some hours with a decent time killer game, I'd wait for a discount."
