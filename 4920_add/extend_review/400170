So if you are like me and don’t like RPG’s with turn based combat then this is a game to get.I took me 43 hours to finish and I only played the single player portion of the game.+ good music and sound effects+ good voice acting characters+ good graphics+ 6 classes to choose from+ lots of loot, crafting and hidden content- Sometimes the difficulty from the game is unbalanced – I had two times I had to lower the difficulty because it became frustrating during some boss battles. => it’s a good thing that you can do that directly in the game when you’re playing.There is also a towerdefense-style portion of the game. If you don’t like that (like me) you can let your ‘resistance members' (= based on the challenge you select a member and the towerdefense game is played in the background. afterwards you can view the outcome) do this and you can continue to play the game."

Clearly the servers have glitches as any progress I make now is not retained.  Customer support/service is horrible and even after about a week I have not heard back.  In addition to this I have made a forum post with others experiencing this issue to which no moderators have responded.You can create an offline character and play on that (completely seperate from the neocore server side ones) however they are not able to play with others and suffer penalties associated with items, bonuses etc.If it wasn't for the fact that you can't progress in the game i'd definately recommend it, however with this glitch/issue and the non-existent customer service this game has a bug that makes it unplayable.  No other game i've ever played be4 in my life has ever encountered a failure to save which may show elude to future issues if they can't even get that right."

,Recommended,400170,30683659,Posted: 23 March,all,Slycanthrope,"I've been with this series since the beginning, and it has been a bumpy ride.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing was excellent. Despite the fact that multiplayer was bugged and unplayable at the beginning, Neocore resolved the issue quickly. The first game was an excellent example of what ARPGs could be.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 was extraordinary. Everything was improved upon and the added end game content was thrilling.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 3 was... Terrible. Necore tried something new, and good on them for putting themselves out there, but it was like watching a one legged pug trying to climb stairs.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut is all three games in one, including a massive skill redesign and the ability to play the same character through all 3 games. Most of the negative reviews here are about online character saves. As a programmer, let me tell you that dealing with anything serverside is a nightmare and expecting a small gaming company to get it right on the first go is arrogant and childish.Is this compilation perfect? No. But if you are a fan of Torchlight, TQ, and Diablo, then give this a try."
76561197961102572,Recommended,400170,24979112,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,TheTrueGentleman,"I had misgivings when I first tried this game: I've never cared for Diablo, or Titan Quest, or any other similar action RPG praised so highly by so many. And yet, Van Helsing works where they don't: perhaps that's because it's so single player friendly, or because it's so tongue and cheek, or because the game is so colorful, or because it allows players to respec their charecter at any time. Regardless, it really does work, pulling players in with a well paced story and plenty of gear to mix and match.That isn't to say it's perfect though: the enemies are recycled quite often, the game is amusing but not hilarious, tactics rarely feel necessary and the equipment doesn't dramatically change gameplay no matter what kind of build you use. In other words, it feels more like a budget title that works well rather than a suprise hit comparable to a game with much better funding.Still, it's a solid game for the price with value far above what I've gotten for other, more expensive games."

Sadly the combat, progression, looting, the best aspects of ARPG's aren't as good as they could be. Being locked to specific classes doesn't really help in that regard. However some abilities and upgrades do make combat better, but only for so long.While this game is definitely up there in the top ARPG's I'd say so because its different enough to not be weighed down by its negative qualities.Luckily the game doesn't take itself too seriously and has some throwbacks to previous titles in the series, so if you're into that you'll be entertained.Is it worth full price? Probably not.I'd say wait for a sale, anything below $20 or your equivilent is worth it."
,Not Recommended,400170,30735869,Posted: 25 March,all,drherbey,"The game is really good, entertaining, I put 30 hours on it, but there is nothing more frustrating than logging off just a few hours away from the end of the game, going to sleep and then opening the game again next day, just to see that your character was rolled back more than 10 hours back to the carnival area (for the second time).Since this roll-back issue has happened to me with the same character before, I decided to go to the Lair area (it's supposed to guarantee that your game is saved), then I logged off, then logged back in 5 minutes later to see if my progress was there, and everything was normal, nothing wrong. But then I opened the game again today (I knew that just around 6 to 8 hours of gameplay were left before the ending), and realized that my char was rolled back again to the same carnival area.I do really want to recommend the game, support the developers, but I just can't.I'm afraid that if I put another 8+ hours into the game, I will just get back and see everything is lost again. A big waste of time.I'm not playing the game again until I notice the developers are fixing this major issue and I'm sure my progress is untouched.by the way, I'm not playing online.

,Recommended,400170,28830873,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Azar,The final cut bundles all three games into a single game. You can play all games with the character you created in the first game. This leads to some issues with balancing as I had to decrease the difficulty in the third game because your character is significantly weaker than the enemies you encounter. The reason for this is probably the crappy loot you find.Keep all legendary items you find (even if you do not use them) and put them in your stash.You can later combine them to create new legendary items (the items will be the same level as your character's).I will recommend this game just because the first game is really good and the boss fight in the second game is the best fight in the series.TL ;DRThe first game is amazing.The second game is alright. Best final boss fight in the series.The third game is not bad but it it suffers from weak storytelling and balancing issues.

The game is well written and the graphics are very satisfying, with lots of content...    Good deal on sale, but I buy most of my crap on sale.  All told, I have enjoyed the original and this one seems pretty solid too."
,Recommended,400170,22120723,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,Vyxeri,"I should probably start by saying that I never played the individual games so I have no idea if the Final Cut is better, worse or basically the same. I'm not sure if it even matters, but I cannot be of any use to 'veteran' players who are wondering if it's worth playing this version. Although, as I understood it, the game was free to people who already own the 3 seperate games? In that case it won't matter much.I remember liking Torchlight a lot and I read some reviews of this game before buying it (at 66% off it was a steal!) and it is indeed very similar to Torchlight, so if you enjoyed those games, this is surely something for you. It also has some similarities to Path of Exile, although it's not as grim and morbid (no Pieties piling up milions of corpses for example).The story is very good. I must admit I didn't expect much of it, but they did a great job. The dialogue between Katarina and Van Helsing is amazing, very funny at times and it never gets old. What really made me laugh quite a few times are the many, many references to pop culture they wove into the game without making it feel forced. Lord of the Rings, the Hunger Games, Titanic (I kid you not, it made me laugh so hard when I heard the little music and saw them go through the ""I'm the king of the world""-routine), and many many more references that most people, and in some cases maybe only the ""nerds"" will recognize. It doesn't affect the game at all, but they wove it into the story and the background without effort. I was very positively surprised by this.By now I have only played the storyline once and did a few missions of the adventure map, and I doubt it will increase much in the near future because I have my eyes on another game which will probably take up my time. So my opinion is a little limited since I only played it on one character, an elementalist.Having Katarina with you makes it easier, I doubt I would have survived certain things if it weren't for her tanking the monsters. The system is really nice since you can adjust her behavior to your character. For squishy characters you can make her a tank, but for others you could make her ranged, or stop her from attacking altogether and in return get some of her stats for yourself. She has 3 skilltrees, basically one for each 'behavioral mode' but you are perfectly welcome to mix and match what you want for her. One small con I found with Katarina is that her level is capped at 60, which for example makes it impossible to get her better items after that point. I mean, you can always make her better items, but anything you might find that is better than what she is currently using will be unavailable to her because of the level cap.I haven't gotten to the part where I have a high enough level to start getting my epics, creating new items, using my essences, etc, but I figured it would be pretty much the same as in Path of Exile where you save your items until you are not basically wasting them for the few levels in which you might use your items.All in all, even if you don't plan on replaying it, maxing out your characters or even do the online/co-op thing, the story mode alone is worth getting it. Just wait until it's on sale and get it then. As you can see, I went 50 hours for one playthrough and a few extra adventure missions, so you would definitely get your money's worth. There is a lot of hidden content and after each chapter it will show you how many quests you have finished and the amount of hidden content you have actually discovered and in some of those chapters I missed almost half of it. So a replay is definitely warranted at some point.Highly recommended, it gave me a lot of fun playing."
,Recommended,400170,31164491,Posted: 15 April,all,The Reign,"You are a fan of Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile, and want to see if this game is worthy of your time or not?! Very well then, let's get to the point and see what it's going to offer.- The very best thing about this game is the Story and dialogues. well the story isn't anything special at all, but it's far better than any Isometric action Rpg that I played so far. There are so many cute dialogue lines that are performed wonderfully by the voice actors.- Another great thing about this game is the music. it's very good and is atmospheric.- The graphic is good, but what is great about visual of the game is the details and the variaty of the locations. Plus the game's locations are level designed and they're not random generated so it has its cons and pros.- As for the gameplay I must admit it doesn't have the Wonderful Skilltree of Path of Exile nor the Challenge of Diablo in terms of Difficulty (I had absolutely no challenge for completing the game with bounty hunter class and Hard Difficulty). The game tries to add something new to the genre's RPG aspects and tries to be fresh, it's OK but I can't say it's anything special like Path of Exile!- There aren't lots of active players to play online.- There are some optional features like Tower Defence levels in campaign and Daily Challenges that can be interesting for some players.Overall It's OK for the fan of genre and I recommend it on sales."

The whole thing feels so underpowered... at least in Torchlight or Grim Dawn you feel like you're improving and laying waste to enemies... here I feel like I'm cycling through treacle and attacking the bad guys with a letter opener.It's beautiful, well-presented, well-scripted and none of that makes it any more fun. It just highlights what's missing - something that the original Gauntlet managed back in the 80s... a satisfying slaughter-fest which is why I play ARPGs. I may return to this but I don't think I'll be any kind of hurry to do so.If I could neutral rate - I probably would but as I can't, it's a thumbs down for a game that promises so much and delivers so very little."

While I can appreciate the effort, I am extremely disappointed in the fact that the game crashes almost every time the wife and I try to join in multiplayer. Not to mention that the game will only allow us to join a local lan game if we go fully online, and have another player join us.We have no other coop/multiplayer game that has effected us like this, where we have tested all local troubleshooting including disabling the Firewall, flushing DNS, resetting the router and modem, but it has made no difference. I am really regretting my decision on purchasing this, and will be seeking a refund if this is not addressed soon. If you are looking for a ARPG with a focus on story, then this may cater to you. If you expect a functional multiplayer/coop, then I don't know what to say. Really hoping they address this in the near future."

76561198168346778,Not Recommended,400170,23145291,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,Atrushan,"Since it's safe to assume that not everyone has the time to read through all points in detail, I'll start with a quick summary.Bad:Pathfinding, zoom function, video sequences, game size, continuity issues, dialogue interruptionGood:Story, Minigames, musicDownsides:1. Pathfinding. Maybe the worst I saw in a game so far. Your character will get stuck often. If the pathfinding doesn't stop you, the environment will. Try to find an alternative route to the chest, because there's a single tree root between you and the treasure.1a. A wisp, which is part of an optional, hidden sidequest, suffers from the same pathfinding issues and is most likely to get stuck in the forest and therefore won't reach its destination to trigger the event it is supposed to.2. Graphics and zoom problems. The graphics and effects are average for most parts. They get the job done, but nothing special. You have to be real close to enjoy the details. The problem is that most of the time you will need to zoom out at maximum in order to see enemies that attack you from the other side of the screen. Or you just want to leave an elevator. Because for some reason, even if your mouse is several meters away from it, the elevator will still be selected and you will enter it again. Great.Also you'll miss quite a few hidden areas if you don't fully zoom out. On close-up it's easy to overlook the entrance, especially in such a fast paced game.3. Video Sequences. Be ready to listen to them. Did I say ""listen""? Yes, because the camera will make it really hard to ""see"" what is actually happening. First off, it shakes around as if you were on a boat. Why is that a thing? Secondly, it will slowly make it's way to your companion, the ghost Katarina. And stay there for a short while. In the same time the conversation between the characters continues, as it's indicated by voices you hear and the subtitles that try their best to stay inside the screen even though their characters aren't shown anymore.4. Size. Granted, the game has some content. But 50 GBs (including the optional HD textures) are simply overkill. Most games offer much more with only a fraction of that size.5. Continuity. You can often make desicions during the story. But even if you picked one, the game will occasionally treat you like you picked the other. You threat a scientist and attacked him instead of convincing him with words. Yet in the next encounter he refers to a conversation that never took place. Another example: You are supposed to deactivate certain devices (which is optional). You don't. But in the next scene everyone talks about how great you deactivated them.6. Dialogue Interruption. One of the rarest and most annoying issues. Sometimes the characters start telling plot-related stuff in the middle of a fight. Since the game doesn't always pause when they do that, you can accidently click on something. The floor or an enemy for example. Either will interrupt the dialogue and continue with the next one. So you miss plot parts and there's no way to hear them again - unless you start a new game with a new character and play all the way back to where it happened.Pros:1. Story. It's full of jokes and funny references (e.g. Terminator, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones etc.). That makes it a bit hard to get immersed in the story. Especially considering the flaws of the game. But just like Katarina and Van Helsing, the player will be rewarded for patience and endurance with a growing and increasingly interesting story - which starts out quite weak but gets better (after some time).2. Minigames. So far I have discovered 3 of them and they are quite entertaining. It takes some time and progression in the story to unlock.2a. Tower Defence. Protect your sanctuary with traps and see the invading monsters getting frozen or burned to death, impaled or thrown into the depths to die. If they somehow make it past the traps you have set you can always attack them directly and finish them off.2b. Missions. You get 3-4 captains in your base and from time to time there will be a mission available for them. Then you can chose the one you see fit, give him soldiers and items and send him to finish the well-written mission. Nothing generic. Each and every one is unique and part of the story.2c. How to train your pet. You get a ""Chimera"", which you can send to hunt for bounty. Not much of a story or mission there. But the Chimera looks so happy when you feed it and so sad when it gets wounded and lies on the ground, trying to regain strength.3. Music. Sounds really nice (especially the piano parts).To sum it up: Is Van Helsing - Final Cut a bad game? Not necessarily. Are there better, cheaper games out there? Definitely. Some of them are even free to play.So, as far as that goes, there's not much reason to buy it."

The game is not bad, but right away you notice the indie feeling the game has, specially if you played Diablo and PoE for a long time. Don't expect something similar to those 2 games, I would say that is not bad because it gives the game its own identity, but again don't expect the same quality level too. Compared to Diablo and PoE I found the game more clunky, so the experience is not as smooth and satisfactory (specially when compared to Diablo), but you get used to it after some time."

There are serious issues with it that will block progress.The game itself is fun, mechanically works great and looks pretty decent on its max settings. It has great humour in it and decent basic backstory. If you want to play single-player, go ahead and enjoy it.The issue----------In multiplayer mode with friends, this game is fine up to about the ending of Chapter 6 and start of Chapter 7 but completely broken beyond this point for us. This is around the ending of the 2nd game and start of the 3rd game we think. There is an issue with simulation freeze that introduces major connection issues and game engine problems as your damage numbers increase with your level and abilities.It seems the game stuggles to handle all of the combat data and it becomes bottlenecked. Occassionally, if you're attacking a small group and only put in a few attacks to kill them, you can see the game finally catch up with the numbers, kill all the mobs and then resume like normal. But against any decent sized mob (which is practically every combat situation), the game just freezes and becomes unplayable for anyone but the host - if you hover over their portraits the pings increase by thousands.As a multiplayer group with 3 people with a GTX 1080, GTX 980 Ti, and GTX 750, we should be able to handle the game. We have tried changing hosts, changing graphical settings to low, putting FPS limits to 30, changing CPU Sync to GPU, changing to DX9, etc. Nothing fixes this issue at Chapter 7. We have done test over the last 3 weeks with the same recurring issue. The game is now broken and unplayable for us and we cannot progress.However, if we make new characters and do a test in Chapter 1, the issue doesn't exist - which eliminates the possibility of any of us currently having local connection issues. Not to mention we play other online games just fine."

I was looking for the next best ARPG, but the search still continues at least for me. My main issue with this game are sound effects, they are so plain, dull and boring. It feels like straight out of a 90s game. None of the attacks or magic spells/skills have any pleasing to ears sound effects, they are barely audible even when the boss attacks like the drill boss at the end of chapter 1 doesn't make any sound.-Now lets talk about the skill tree, and I have to say that Grim Dawn did a far better job at this. Everything in this game is limited to 3 from passive equips to rage upgrades till skill's upgrades which really frustrates me, and to top on that there are hardly any passive skills or active skills. I can count them on one hand, as a guy who prefers active skills over the spamming skills, this game turned out to be quite a disappointment.-The inventory system is one of the most basic and tedious thing that you will only see in the starting days of ARPG genre.-The loot system doesn't feel rewarding at all and it is quite broken. There's barely any different between the rare items and the epic items and it is just so easy to get them all when you play on Heroic or above difficulties unlike in Torchlight or Grim Dawn where it is actually quite a feet to get legendary loots that makes a hell lot a difference, and the worst of all there isn't any set equips or items which gives you huge bonus stats when you equip them as a set.:-Doesn't have any replay value for me. There's nothing else in this game that provides something fun to break monotony! Hopefully, the creators next time will learn something from Grim Dawn, Torchlight or titan quests like games from next time!"

Phlogistineer. Every specialization plays differently and they are all ""good.""My only sadness is that they removed all of the movement skills. Every skill is basically an attack of some kind.With that said, there are some issues, not with the game itself, but with information about the game.There is no comprehensive manual, wiki, or corporate site that explains how the game works, what the specializations are, what skills are, what auras are, how you use essences, how you forge new items, how to manage your army and your captains, etc. You have to figure it all out in-game. There are pop-up hints that help a bit, but no true tutorial.It's actually the main reason I held off on buying the game for so long. I waited until it was on a really good sale to buy it becuase I knew next to nothing about how it played or what it kept or discarded from the previous games.I still love this game.

I am a sucker for top down isometric RPG/Hack and Slash.When I saw the style of this game I was immediately drawn to it. However every attempt to start playing and finishing was somewhow hindered or abandoned before Act 1.This time I made it a matter of dedication and I told myself regardless of how boring or hard it gets I am going to finish it. Picked Normal difficulty to make sure I go through all the way.Despite it's delicious steampunk/gothic looks and well written witty dialogues between Lady Katharina and V. Helsing, this game has very little to offer.I had a level 40+ Philistogoner (sorry can't be arsed to spellcheck it) in Hard already that I had abandoned. This time I rolled a Bounty Hunter, heavy on Poison and Katharina replicas. A good measure of snare thrown in. Needless to say game was a breeze. Killed stuff off the screen before they could get to me. There was absolutely near no challenge gameplay wise. Finishing levels became a chore. Towards to end of Act 5 I just made sure I would just do bare minimum necessary to advance to next stage/chapter.Sadly this also applied to loot. I upgraded to a better gear (with no significant boosts) probably a total of 15-20 times. This is including Katharina's upgrades. In normal mode with over 100% Magic Item find rate I did not see a single set item or legendary. A ton of worthless epics and even more useless epics made by combining worthless epics.I was really bugged and went online to do a little reserach. I saw people talking things like ""better chances of set/legendary drops in FEARLESS mode with a magic item drop rate of 400%"" ...Folks this is not 2006 and this is not World of Warcraft! The whole loot design does not serve or help the already weak level design and gameplay. Simply asking; What is the point?Surely for Min-Maxers (if this is still a thing) theremust be a replay value. But for me as a simple, 9  to 5, casual gamer there is nothing this game offered in terms of entertainment.Such a shame that such brilliant conversation and visual feast was not supported by decent game play and level design.I also did not get the whole Chimera Hunt aspect. This feature in the game almost felt like developers threw this in because they could not say NO to company CEO's  cousin who was doing internship in the office during the development. (Disclosure this is not a fact ! I just say it to emphasize that the whole aspect was added to game last minute as a filler!)Some weird design choices like sending rsistance soldiers to missions etc was a nice touch but everything was half baked. A reputation system is there and serves you some perks. But in this gme ""100%"" does not mean much and stats can go as high as up to 300-400%  acording to forums. I am not just into whole excel sheeting. I am not payed to play the game or ""crack the best combination"".Overall I will still recommend the game but exercise caution that there are better options out there. Namely speaking Grim Dawn is a much better composed game or Victor Vran.I am not going to even bother with Adevture Map thing. I am not into grinding but if it is your thing, you are gona love this game.Cheerio !"

What the ♥♥♥♥? Connecting and resolving for over 2 years. Right. Then there is the crashing and when you crash, you can't join the adventure quest where you friends are, that is if you managed to find the hosted game in the first place. I had graphic bugs but I guess newest nvidia drivers aren't that good and that was irrelevant, most of the time the game crashed while loading to a quest.Anyway there are some other things anyone should know. Umbralist teleport can't go past any objects, apart from monsters. That's right. The TP can't go over small stones, trees or standing trees but can go over big monsters (which look cool though). The teleport needs to have clear line of sight and can only go where you can run. No teleporting up the cliff near stairs.Click targeting sucks. Monsters have highest priority over picking up items and reviving allies, unit collision is really annoying too.Bugs and silly ""features"" like these are unacceptable. There has been so many arpg games to show things like these and this game looks so polished and feels okey so why things like what I listed exist? Non-fuctioning multiplayer killed this game for me, luckily it was -66% otherwise I would be upset.If you enjoy playing alone, this is fine. If you seek for nice arpg/dungen crawler, look elsewhere.

I ABSOLUTELY recommend it for this factor alongside the story of the campaign being quite enthralling in my opinion. If you liked the Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman and thought ""Man... that movie universe is cool..."" and you like RPG games? I recommend you get it - preferably when it is on sale (or if you're unopposed to the price) as I do believe $45.00 is relatively steep.It's got the gothic steampunk fantasy nailed down like the coffins you'll likely put your enemies in - or see the dead rise from. The multiple play styles and skill effects are quite interesting. The vanilla game is quite enjoyable, but the modding community for this game has made some solid advances and tweaks that I wished were in the original game.Regardless this game definitely is one I'd recommend."

The banter between Van Helsing and his ghost companion is enjoyable and so are the numerous pop culture references.There are still some bugs left unfortunately. One mini-boss monster that needed to be killed in order to progress the story got stuck in terrain, but managed to kill it with some careful positioning. Apart from that potentially game-breaking issue the main story was mostly fine. The adventure map quests have crashed the game a few times though."

No matter what u do, your char is invalid and u cant actually play  multyplayer. There are a lot of crushes, and devs simply dont  fix anything . WHich is strange, coz game has potention to be incredibly good. Adventure mod is  boring. Maybe first few times it is ok, but, the game is ment to be  item chasing/grinding, which in this game is NOT THE  case. Most of items u get are acctually very very bad. It is , at least, stupid, to use itms lvl 60  when u r lvl 100+   just becouse all items u get ( including set items)  are simply not good enf and ur lvl 60 items are better. End game items must be much better. The game and item hunt should begin at lvl 100, not end at it .If devs decide to acctuall talk, debug, solve problems, and add some extra content, it would be great.

The constant loot and beautifully designed world make it addictive, but combat gets very repetitive and the sheer number of enemies on screen can sometimes make it feel spammy.If something like this were released in first or third person and there were more scenarios where you fought 1-5 enemies at a time instead of 15 (so parrying was a thing) I'd probably be on this game 24/7. As it stands, I appreciate it as a well done Van Helsing game and don't regret buying it, but probably will get bored and uninstall before I finish the story.Also, in the Final Cut, I couldnt find the class that uses both pistols and 1h swords.

Then right out of a blue, you start getting owned. Which leads to several ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations:-> Lower the difficulty(which leads to you falling asleep because now you oneshot everything without any danger at all)-> Raise the difficulty(you are still pretty much owning everything around you, provided you don't get hit. But now it's too precarious to play anything but niche builds)-> Grind while playing the story(ok, this is wrong)This situation also leads to scenarios where every character has like 2(if you play at Fearless or higher even less >.>) builds and after 50, the game is simply crazy.The story is funny, the gfx is nice and the game is FUN to play!

The game as it is today is a solid ARPG with massive amounts of depth and really lets you tailor the character to your liking and avoids cookie cutter builds that MOST games are notorious for. If you are looking for a title to really sink your teeth into and get some serious hours out of, than this game is for you.I picked this one up on sale for about 15 dollars American and would have glady payed the full 45 knowing what I know now about this title. While I will admit there are a few minor glitches here and their, It is nothing that takes away from the overall experience. Overall I would give this title a 9/10. If you are like I was and on the fence about this one, I think you will be surprised at the depth of choices and builds you have for every class."

After finished game i did miss her really. It was just like separete from your one of best friend or crush.+DIALOGUES BETWEEN VAN HELLSING & LADY KATARINA, Lady Katarina's comments and chitchating with you feels you are playing game with your friend.+STEAM PUNK, ALTERNATE HISTORY & GOTHIC-NOIR ATHMOSPHERE, if you are fan one of these this game is a gem+SLAVIC MYTHOLOGY, this is a pro because you can see Roman, Greek or Nordic mythologies everywhere and its become getting boring. But Neocore team did try diffrent thing and i see slavic mythology first time on games beside Witcher.+MUSICS & ARTWORKS+HUMOR & POPCULTURE REFERENCES+HIDDEN CONTENTS, yes Hidden Contents maybe not look important but most of game i forgeting main quests and serching hidden contentCons-This game is compilation of 3 games and DLCs. But if you search littlebit you can see 3rd game is weakest one as game mechanics and story. 3rd game's infuence is corrupting whole game mechanics. Also game start to boring you when play 3rd game's story arc. Only interesting part was Lady Katarina's back.-Start of 3rd game's story arc we found a new room in our hidden lair. Its preety large and EMPTY. Till last boss i did wait for new NPC's who fill it but it didnt happen.-Because of changed game mechanics from first games many quest items are useless. They are been in game but no one want them or use them. But you'll find and carry them.-Why Adventure map have no tower defence quest i didnt understand.-Story is very lineer. You have no influence on story.-Yes as a story 3rd game was weakest part but as a nemesis 3rd game's arcvillain was best one. First two archvillains were weak as nemesises. We have no dialoge or touch with them until final fight."

It's a great game that will surprise you when you least expect. Storyline, setting, atmosphere, characters are great. Gameplay was a bit laggy altho i played offline, which was strange. But that was the only flaw i found in this game.Considering i played only this version, i can say that you get a REALLY long campaign and storyline. I don't know where they split, but the the storyline seems fluid and without breaks. As i found out that this version is been put together with three games, and i like it this way. I haven't tried separate versions, because i like the way it's put together.You can explore, you can grind, you can read the lore.. Lore is not like in Mass Effect, but there is some. The atmosphere was great. City of Borgovia, the druids, street and wilderness fights between technology and nature... if it just wasn't so laggy.Since i always play on medium difficulty, i died maybe 3 or 4 times: mostly from lag. Have in mind that you have to be verry accurate with issuing commands. If you don't press the key enough times, ability won't activate. But if you spam it too much, it will deplete your hard earned resource - depending on the resource abilty uses.No technical issues other than strange lag. Game is a bit heavy on resources. If you have an older computer, play with settings, but try to put as much eyecandies as possible, as the world design is really detailed.As this is rpg, after you select your character (hunter, warrior, mechanichal palladin,...), you will see a huge skill tree. I had to zoom out to see the whole picture, and i had full HD rresolution o.O Skill tree is huge and considering verry long campaign, you will have space to put your skill points.Considering characters, they are verry well done, and they are alive. Your sidekick, Lady Katarina will make sure you are protected and amused troughout the whole campagn. Other characters are verry well done and i can say that this game has one of the best characters i played so far.Final verdict: if you don't mind the lag, buy and play this wonderfull experience. Characters will make sure you are entertained :)"

I liked that there was set gear to collect and that it was possible to load one's character from the first game into the second game.  This game, like the third in the series, does not allow a player to load in an existing character.  In addition, the set gear is no longer in the game until the very end and only if your character reaches the highest level possible (100).The game as published currently is not well-balanced.  My first new character was a Bounty Hunter and I was able to chew my way through to the third game with no problem.  At that point I started to get bored so I made a constructor.  I had fun with that character up until the bits in the second game when there are bombardments that fall on Borgova.  The constructor relies on having a multitude of bot and turret constructs that do damage and protect him, and I found it next to impossible to avoid having my various constructs blown up by one to two bombardment hits.  At this point I just decided it was pointless to continue as there are multiple times when your character is hit by bombardments in game and also in the adventure maps.  I went looking for and found a new game to play.If you have not played the first two Van Helsing games, then I recommend playing those as I found them to be more entertaining and the classes better constructed. If you played those already then I suggest waiting for a balance and/or update to this game (or using a mod if you really want to play it).I really wanted to like this game more as I enjoy the setting, story, and steam punk atmosphere and critters.  Oh well... so many other games to enjoy and so little time."

While nothing here is completely earth shattering or new, it's fun to play. If you like ARPGs you'll like this one, a little like diablo 2, a decent skill tree with six different classes.

In the video options, stick with OpenGL instead of DirectX, which apparently caused all the crashes I was having.  Still can be a little rough around the edges in some quests, but enjoyable all around.Very enjoyable, why the bad review?  This is just too unstable for a ""Final Cut"" release.  I REALLY like the game; voice acting is great, mechanics are good, visuals are very nice.  It just becomes so very frustrating when you look forward to playing only to have to deal with the bugs and crashes.  Loading screens are sometimes black, you end up having to restart the game or even your machine multiple times to get it to play.  The tower defense mini-game crashes every time, and there's no way out of it other than NOT to fight and fail the quest.The price is right and hopefully it'll be patched at some point, after which I'd come back and give it a big thumbs up."
