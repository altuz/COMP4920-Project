TL;DR - this title has a shiny wrapper, but the contents are fairly bare bones.But seriously,Okhlosis a fairly straight forward beat'em up with a mildly interesting mob mechanic.Okhlosis a beat'em up because it is mostly spam clicking, rinse-and-repeat. You drag your mob around the map to kill all the enemies and move on to the next level. This is where the game falls short, IMO. On the other hand the mob mechanic is cool, and works well, but I would have liked to have seen more done with it. Some people complain about the controls but I think they are responsive enough. I used a controller and it was good.Keep in mind, that after my first hour-and-fifteen minutes, I have unlocked 44% of the game (from statistics screen), and only died once at the end of that period (got to level 6-6).I felt it to be fairly easy - almost too easy, in fact. The bosses required no strategy through my whole run. I never ran low on people, either.Oh, also, I hear some people on the forums talking about this being a roguelike/lite - c'mon guys this is hardly rogue-ish. Yeah, I mean you do have one life - that much is true - but that is where any comparison at all ends. There are mild metagame unlocks, but nothing like I would have hoped for. I just wanted to put that out there for those in the know, who may be disapointed if that is what they are looking for. I kind of was, to be honest.As the game progresses, in order to increase difficulty the game forces you to manuever your mob through traps and such. I get why this is how it is, but I don't particularly enjoy that stuff.As I mentioned before, I just wish they would have added more depth.More layers of complexity. There are only a handful of items, and they all feel fairly meh. The end-of-level 'upgrade' options are ok, but they could expand greatly on them.I think this game rides off of its excellent graphics and novel idea, but needs more of a 'game' proper to be anything notable.Pros:+Obviously the artstyle is cool.+The mob control ability is novel, and is implemented well here.+The frantic nature of the game is a double-edged sword; on one hand its really cool to watch and be a part of the fury, but on the other hand it can be difficult to tell what is going on a lot of the times.+I like the unlockable characters, although there are not near enough of them.Cons:-Not enough complexity or depth to the game play. This is the deal breaker for me; it plays like a standard old-school beat'em up.-While the music is high quality, the actual music choice is questionable. It doesn't all fit in the 'Greek' theme or even 'mythology' theme, or really any single theme. Sometimes that can work, and sometimes it doesn't, like maybe here. Like, what is that music being played at the upgrade table?-Really, I don't think there is much replay value after you finish the game, which I won't likely do. I will probably get bored and move on before then. The devs posted somewhere that they expect people to get 8-10 hours out of a full game.Great artwork and premise, but the core game needs more work in terms of complexity and depth.I'm not saying you won't have fun for the measly eleven bucks, but I think you can likely do better. I also don't think a majority of owners will see 10 hours out if it, if that means anything to you."
,Recommended,400180,25006648,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,VG Purist,This is indeed a pretty fun game when it comes down to its core gameplay.  I'm not sure about the price tag associated with this but will gladly gives this an enthusiastic thumbs up if can pick this game up for 10 bucks or less.The best thing about this game is that it's very east to pick up and play.  There really isn't much to it other than running around and picking up citizens along the way to add to your mob and wreck every thing and every one that stands in your way.It isn't all about just running around though.  There are times in which you have to defend against certain types of attacks an enemy makes and when to rally the mob together to avoid a trap or hazard.The replay value comes when finishing a playthrough.  Unlocking more heroes and player characters makes things a bit more easier the next time around.Each playthrough offers something a bit more different and unique than the last.  You will sometimes happen upon a dungeon where you will fight a new mini boss.  Or there will be a trapped hero to break out of jail and have him or her join your mob.The composition of your mob matters.  Get more warriors for more attack. Get more slaves to pick more items up to use. This in addition to the heroes that may give bonuses to attack or add to the maximum mob number.The greatest downfall of this game though is the lack of depth.  Most of the time you just run around and direct your mob wherever the enemies are and that's about it.The composition of your mob is hard to see until you stop and either trade your guys or pause the game and look.It's extremely hard to keep track of your guys and your heroes could die without your knowledge and thus whatever bonuses they had provided such as mob number or attack power is gone.https://youtu.be/UKqTuR81_0YOverall this is a pretty fun game that will provide at least a few hours of gameplay.

You control a mob, point them at what needs to die/demolished and they do it. The randomized heroes are effectively the random items of Isaac and makes for some varied runs.What sets this game apart from other Rogue-likes is the difficulty curve. It actually eases the player into the game with harder enemies thrown in after certain milestones. As opposed to many games of this genre where the player is thrown into the grinder difficulty and it gets easier as the player inches their way towards a completetion due to 'legacy' items, the game has both unlockable things that carry over on top of introduction of harder enemies and a few extra levels slowly easing the player into the grinder.Some problems I've ran into during my playtime:If you run a multimonitor setup, the mouse is not locked to the screen, this made for quite a few frustrating minmizing of the game.There seems to be some weird bugs with leaving the game paused for a duration and resuming, I've had two instances where it would not let me advance or access menus resulting on Alt+F4. Luckily, the savepoint system is very reasonable and not a lot of progress was lost.In short, it's a nice 8-10 hours before the novelty wears thin, but it's somethihng that's great to jump in once in a while.Would jump into the grinder again."

Enemies have decent attack design so you know when to block. And when not needing to block, running around attacking everything in sight is silly and smile-inducing.Okhlos feels like I'm playing a necromancer, but instead of summoning undead, you're running around finding new folk to join your army. There's lots of obstacles on the ground you don't want your mob running through, so some caution is needed to navigate the grounds to avoid unnecessary damage; adds a nice touch against all the combat.The pathfinding could use some improvement - some levels it feels like I'm fighting corners more than the enemies, having to go back to help navigate my units around a building when I notice some of them have gotten stuck.But overall, very enjoyable."

Luckily, most of the unavoidable damage will just hit your units.The pixel aesthetic does absolutely nothing but make the game more charming, it has nothing to do with what's going on and just kind of exists.I'm glad I got it on sale, and despite the negative tone of my review, I didn't hate it.

Beyond that, anyone who was ever a child has a lingering affection for Greek myths, and this game trades on that nostalgia, both with a bit-centric art style that's a joy to look at, and in its under-utilized subject matter. There's little time to savor the Greek pantheon, as much of the lore exists only as encyclopedia entries. In terms of gameplay, almost nothing changes on the heroes' side, and the pace of encounters is such that enemy distinctions also don't change much. Ultimately pretty to look at, and novel in its core mechanic, Okhlos' gameplay is just not there to sustain repeated play. I'm already bored at an hour plus in and have no desire to go back. Worth a quick look at a low price. Nothing more."

Cannot imagine it handling much better with just mouse and  keyboard, since you have to control your philosopher and your  angry horde separately. Then again, it worked nicely in Overlord, which is a  Pikmin-like.Interesting and funny, will hve to get farther next time. Who doesn't like some fun deicide?"

It's a simple and effective concept.An irreverent take on historical figures in the description adds to the fun. Assuming, of course, that you know your Greco-Roman history and mythology well enough to know about the heroes in the game. The tone is completely non-serious, and tongue-in-cheek fun is always lurking around every description in the game.The graphics are pseudo 8-bit 2.5D, which may or may not appeal to everyone, but in my opinion is well-suited for the game's style.Sound work is fairly spot-on, with the music changing its tone to match how well you are progressing in the game. It becomes low and somewhat depressing when you aren't doing so well, and it becomes frantic and manic when you are rolling over everything. Demolishing 8-bit buildings has never been so satisfying until you've paired it with the sound of rolling thunder-- I mean, your horde of minions punching the crap out of olympians. Or giant bronze men. Or centaurs.Despite all the positives, there are of course some things that are somewhat lacking in the game. With a hard limitation on how many minions you can take with you, one would think that dismissing unwanted minions would be a necessary thing to implement. Unfortunately, no such thing exists, and thus your only recourse is to try and kill off a chunk of your minions and hope that you get rid of only those that you don't want.Verdict:Graphics: 4/5+ Appropriate style for a roguelike irreverent game that parodies almost all of classical history+ Smooth; no lag even under the heaviest load of hundreds of minions all punching the crap out of the enemies- 8-bit may not appeal to everyoneAudio: 3/5+ Dynamic music reflects well on how your game is going, and helps to keep you pumped- May get repetitive over timeGameplay: 3/5+ Simple to get into+ Fun when you don't feel like doing something complicated- May lack replay value. Levels are procedurally generated, but many of the enemies are simple recolours with stronger attacks or additional abilities.Overall: 3.3/5 ** GOOD **Simple fun, easy to get into - but possibly could be fleshed out a bit more. Lack of replayability a concern, but is inexpensive for what you get."

New enemies and levels are barely distinguishable from one another, and the mob control mechanics are clunky and imprecise (which is especially annoying with traps).

,Recommended,400180,25102265,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,Maeda,"Okhlos is a roguelike from Devolver Digital, the same guys who published Enter the Gungeon. The game's main selling point is its chaotic gameplay - you rampage through 8 linear stages with your mob, looking to strike down the gods of Greece. A lot of the environment is destructible, making the game enjoyable on a weird, primal level. Your mob consists of various characters - citizens, warriors, defenders, slaves, and philosophers. The philosophers lead in this revolution against the gods - if your philosophers die, it's all over. You control a philosopher and the mob separately, but the mob can only walk within a certain range of the philosopher. You can command the mob to come together, spread out, attack, and defend. There are power-ups to collect and carry (via slaves), and traps to avoid. It's an innovative idea for a roguelike and absolutely worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre. The only major flaw is the repetition: 8 stages means you'll become very familiar with these environments very quickly. If you're not hooked on the core gameplay, the chaos and the Greek setting won't make up for it.Okhlos is a gem, but it's a gem that might get dull if you stare at it for too long. Strongly reccomend to any roguelike fan; cautiously reccomend to anyone who isn't instantly excited by gameplay footage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaEW633eWK4"

I'll use this review to inform you of one of my favorite little details:When reviewing the performance statistics of each unit in the Encyclopaedia, those statistics are *separated based on the sprite used for that unit.* This is fun for people who like to invent statistics like me! You can uncover, for example, which animal species in your army has the best KDA (hint: none of them); if the weirdos with the perpetual 'awesome face' eyes are actually pulling their weight; or even which ethnicity makes up the majority of your slave population. I like to think that the slaves in my rabble are implicitly freed - rather than working as slaves within the mob -, but I'm not sure if that's yet been addressed in the game insofar as I've played. I suppose everyone's a slave under the oppressive heel of Olympus."

Music is great, every level (so far) feels different, and the devs really went full bore into using everything they could from Greek history and mythology. Combat has great energy, had me yelling at my screen and laughing while I was doing it. And customizing your mob with unlockables breaks it up nicely and gives you time to think, ""What's most important? What do I not have to worry about right now?

I really can't get enough of micromanaging those tiny different classes of creatures all at the same time, that's why I was so excited two days ago when I was caught by surprise by this game.I couldn't believe someone was smart enough to apply a similar mob mechanic to a ""roguelite"" sort of game. That's the dream I've always had and did not know about.Does it deliver though? Maybe I'm writing this too prematurely, but Steam won't allow me to play the game much more while still qualifying for a refund. But short answer: I don't think so.While the setting, different characters, general artstyle and theme choice all work pretty well, it pains me to admit that the game hasn't made a good job on showing diversity on gameplay.Having basically four commands for leading your mob, those being attack, defend, run and stay together, it seems diverse enough on paper. However, the level design doesn't exactly put the player on situations in which those commands are used in interesting ways, the biggest offender being the ""stay together"" command. I'd think there would be situations in which controlling the chaos was necessary, but in reality most enemies are just going to die by holding the attack button, sometimes needing to identify the attack animation, but that's just a matter of quickly pressing the defense and proceed to spam the attack again.Another big issue is that controlling each type of unit that goes in the mob seems to play a big roll into the strategy, the player soon figures out that it's almost impossible to control which type of unit is dying and being recruited during the huge chaos installed. At the end of each big square area full of the same enemies, the player is given an opportunity to exchange types of units to other types and even to unique heroes that promotes special abilities to the horde. That's easily the most enjoyable part of managing the mob, but you'll soon realize it's a big gamble, being very common for no/few exchanges being made possible simply out of luck.Boss fights tend to be what I enjoy the most in every game, they are the opportunity to push a different gameplay idea and take it to the max in a matter of minutes. In Okhlos unfortunately the bosses while seeming very different from each other at first sight, I felt like most of what changed from one to another was the amount of HP and consequent time to beat it. Although in a lower level, they mostly suffer the same fate as regular enemies: same-ish strategy over and over.Okhlos is definitely a game I want to love, but can't. I very much appreciate that it exists because what's there is very promising but unfortunately is not taken to the maximum. I feel like it became a half baked idea and caught myself thinking maybe it was in Early Access.I definitely can understand if someone absolutely loves it because it is indeed very unique, but for now it's a refund for me."

There are tons of easter eggs and unlockables to keep it interesting and the extra modes are fun to try for variety. Not very deep and not much of a story but a good game to play after a long day of work. Recommended!
,Not Recommended,400180,34103152,Posted: 8 August,all,democles_pl,"Kinda Rogue Like but not.Basica mechanic of the game is Telegraph attack countering.Trouble is there are often tons of enemies, with different patterns, that are constantly blocking your view making it imposible to see half the attacks coming.Plus the units just ♥♥♥♥ around everywhere and get stabbed or exploded by barrels or don't actually attack the spot you're telling them to attack.You unlock starting heroes and people and things and I guess it could get more interesting if you kept going.... ??CBF.Concept is neat but doesn't really work.

76561198041553585,Recommended,400180,25032030,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,roslolian,"Okhlos is one of the better roguelite games out there, it isn't on the level of Binding of Isaac, Gungeon, Nuclear Throne or even Spelunky when it comes to depth of game play and presentation (everything is pixelated so it's actually a bit ugly/messy) BUT it comes through via the unique game play and humor. Unlike 99% of roguelites which are platformers, arena shooters or roguelikes, this is a pikmin style roguelite wherein you control a mob and wage war against the Gods and cause anarchy. The game play isn't really that deep in that you you only a couple of moves (attack, defend, use items), but it's fun to run around and mob people. Speaking of mobs there are differnet types of mobs you can collect including heroes which will give you a buff like setting enemies on fire or increasing mob size, so unlike say Gungeon wherein you have a limit on the powerups you have, in this case if you're good enough you can actually collect all the heroes and a super powered mob running around which makes for fun times.As for the negatives, as I mentioned the I'm not really a fan of the art style I mean compare it to beautiful games like Gungeon, League of Explorers or Darkest Dungeon it looks really messy and pixelated, I can understand in some games why that happens but in this case there is no need for it, especially when you have big♥♥♥♥♥bosses that could easily have a lot of detail. Because the depth isn't really there you won't be able to sink hundreds or even dozens of hour into this game like you do with other roguelikes so IMHO the value for money isn't really there, I'm guessing you can already unlock everything and get the full experience after around 10-12 hours which is kinda low when you compare it to the gold standard of roguelikes/lites like FTL, Darkest Dungeon, Isaac, Gungeon etc. Finally, the biggest negative for me is that the hardest things in the game aren't the bosses or opponents, it's the environmental hazards like spikes, fires and poisoned meat. A lot of roguelikes/lite emphasize brutal but FAIR game play, essentially if you die you only have yourself to blame. This game is the opposite of that, most of the time what kills me are things I can't control like the whole arena being covered with spikes or a pathway blocked by poisoned meat. I'm controlling a mob of 40+ people how am I supposed to prevent them from getting burned, poisoned or pierced when I'm fighting? On the other hand, the opponents are immune to traps so they can just chill in the middle of the spike trap while I have to go to them and get pierced just to clear the level. I think that'extremely unfair gameplay and IMHO the devs should make the opponents affected by traps so they can see how dumb and how prevalent the traps are. I don't like dying to traps and hazards and I think it takes away from the experience, I'd rather have more difficult enemies that you can interact with than bear traps or spears you have to cross over.With that said, I think this game is something you can come back to time and time again if you want to blow off some steam with some mindless fun and I really hope the devs add more content and tighten the mechanics a bit more. Overall, in the sea of roguelikes/lite games on Steam I think this shines due to its unique gameplay and crazy humor so I think it deserves a spot in your collection."
,Recommended,400180,26022905,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Tim Chaos the Bus Driver,"This game was a fun change of pace.Basically, it's Pikmin + Binding of Isaac + Greek mythology. If you like any of those things, you'll have fun with this one.The gameplay is quick and frantic but never feels out of your control. You'll get the rhythm of attacking and defending before it becomes necessary in the later levels. The soundtrack emphasizes the crazy action and will get stuck in your head. The humor is charming and makes reading the unit descriptions worth it.As with many of these Rogue-likes, the campaign doesn't take long to complete but the delightful unlockables will keep me coming back for a few more runs."

The game is fully, 100% chaotic - you rampage through eight linear stages with your mob, looking to strike down the Gods of GreeceA majority of the environment is destructible and your mob consists of various characters such as citizens, warriors, defenders, slaves, and philosophers. The philosophers lead in this revolution against the Gods and if your philosophers die, the game endsYou control a philosopher and the mob separately, but the mob can only walk within a certain range of the philosopher. You can command the mob to come together, spread out, attack, and defend. It's a very clever idea for a rogue-like game and is definitely worth picking up!However, the game suffers with tons of repetition, with eight stages means you'll become very familiar with these environments very quickly. If you're not hooked on the gameplay, the chaos and the Greek setting or history won't make up for it, sadlyOkhlos is a very fun, hectic game however it won't last long if you play it in long bursts or don't like rogue-like games such as this...RECOMMENDED :)"
