76561198048974498,Recommended,400240,20422077,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Warning:  Thoroughly predictable joke imminent.  So let's just get that out of the way first, shall we?  Here goes:Deerie deerie me.  Oh, deerie deerie DEERIE me.There.  Done.  Unlike numerous other reviews on this Store page, though, I'm now going to do my best to be somewhat impartial and objective about the product that you see before you.Hmmm...let's see now.  Firstly, I do appreciate that this isn't for old ♥♥♥♥ers like me...it's for kids.  Really YOUNG kids, apparently.  Though, granted, really young kids who can still read words like ""Pleistocene Epoch"", but only with the added encouragement of getting to move a cute little digital deer about with the A and D keys.  So I'm going to do my best to be non-judgemental about that.Though let's be honest here...ninety-nine cents ain't a lot of money, but it's a tad steep for a game/""interactive experience"" which takes significantly less than ten minutes for an adult like myself to ""play"" through.  And that's INCLUDING the ""extras"", which provide just an inkling more insight into the whole Pleistocene Epoch thing.  Even the slowest, stupidest ten year-old will get perhaps thirty minutes out of this, tops, and that probably includes REPLAYING the darn thing at least once, and maybe sitting a short exam afterwards prepared by a parent or adult guardian.I'm not questioning that this is probably a nice little educational ""tool"" for kids (apart from the bits where deers can apparently breathe underwater, and prehistoric creatures all wear Santa hats).  But as someone who doesn't generally buy or use such things - I have no kids myself, but could hardly resist this on sale for fifty cents or whatever it is I paid - I'm still inclined to assume that there's similarly-intended product out there which represents far, far better value for money.So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm not only going to give this a thumbs-up - 'cause it's perfectly ""fine"" for what it is - I'm even gonna go as far as to give it a six out of ten, at least initially...then I'm going to dock it a point for having the gall to mention the word ""Megalodon"", before swiftly refusing to ACTUALLY SHOW ONE.  I'm sorry, but in my book, as well as that of my former ten year-old self, THIS JUST ISN'T ON.  Giant sharks were, and still are, all but the be-all and end-all of my world.  ♥♥♥♥ ""show me the money""...SHOW ME THE MEGALODON, YOU ♥♥♥♥ERS!Now listen here, ""Chubby Pixel"".  I'm gonna let this one pass, if only just.  But for your next project, I not only want a ""game"" which goes for AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES, I furthermore demand that it be ALL ABOUT GIANT SHARKS.  Charge me a dollar for that, and I promise that I WILL BUY IT.  I won't even wait on a sale.  And since it'll be set entirely in the water, and it won't be a frickin' DEER who's under the water, I fully expect the controls to include W and S, in addition to A and D.I'm glad we had this little chat, Chubby Pixel.  Remember: Sharks, same low price, WASD.  This time you get a pass - a C-minus, granted, but still a pass - but next time, young lad and young missy, I'll expect you to work a little bit harder, or you'll be facing EXPULSION.Class dismissed.  Now get out of my sight, before I call your parents!Verdict: 5/10."

The art is pretty nice, very storybook.  The minigames are very simple and lack much feedback, on the par with a free phone game to entertain your kid.  But very few things aren't worth a nickle, and poking at the art and reading a bit about ancient big deer surely is."

Language is a bit too complicated for smaller children, but too simple and short for older ones, I'd also say that the font isn't really that reader friendly for children. Really wish it was a bit longer since it has the potential, and the art is sweet and good. I do still however recommend this game since I actually learned a bit my self - so it fulfilled its purpose. Should probably actually be played by the target audience lol."

Teach kids about Ice Age...The graphics are cute, although I had some problems with resolution...The texts are fine... I liked reading through...... but... This game is so lazy made, that it made me cry... You walk around with A/D keys... but for me whichever you press it will go, first to the left to the end, and then to the right... It's probably the problem that only I got, since I don't see anyone complaining... So, let's go to the second problem;There are 3 mini games... Only 3, that have no replay value... I know that attention span of kids is low, but 3 very, very mini games... Every game is just played and finished without ANY feedback... When you finish it (or you think you did), you need to press BACK button to return...After all; Idea is great... I really like it and support these kind of games  for kids... It would be nice to have some mod for languages (not everyone are English, and it's important to have these kind of games in native language)... But it should be done with more care, and not just rushed through... But then, again, for this price you can't argue too much... But I really wished for it to be better and longer made... And a little bit pricier, for that matter...So, message to developers; Please, continue to make similar games, with similar graphics (I really liked it) but make it longer and with higher quality..."

The art style and design is excellent, it has Steam trading cards, and the facts are quite interesting.

I think the art and music are charming, and the puzzles, though brief, are easy for children to use, and the educational aspect of the game is nice. You can see what the creators were aiming for and I think it has care in it.I think it would greatly benefit from expansion, getting into more history and adding more puzzles, perhaps increasing in difficulty over time - maybe even adding a quiz to see if kids are paying attention, and learning?Overall it really, really needs to be made much longer, there's too little content to keep someone involved. There's so much history and information to use that could really pad this out, and I think that's the only real problem here. I would recommend this game if/when more was added to it, I think it has good potential."

You can tell that the creators really made the most of engine they used.The story was a lacking 9/10. It felt good and enthralling at points. The one flaw was that I didn't feel as connected emotionally to the protagonist (The deer) after he threw himself into the lake near the end of the campaign.The soundtrack is legitimately amazing.

The Deer is an educational game for children that aspires to teach players about the Ice Age. The focus is on the deer and its immediate surroundings. Like the mouse. And an oak tree. The game can be completed in less than 5 minutes. Using an abysmal control scheme, you guide the deer from the left to the right. There’s the aforementioned mouse, oak tree, a squirrel and a rhino. After about 5 meters, you come to a lake. Not a problem because deer don’t swim, they simply walk along the bottom of the lake. After about 4 meters of underwater walking, there’s nowhere else to go. Along those 9 meters of gameplay, you can click on three points of interest to play three mini-games. One is a memory game, the other is about recognizing deer food (deer don’t eat fries from McDonald’s – shock!), and I don’t even know what the hell was the third one about anymore.I didn’t learn crap from this game. But the worst offending thing is the horrible grammar, especially considering that this is supposed to be an educational game. “Between the companions of The Deer, there were even the lazy dormouses.” “Did you know that the majestic oaks can live even 1000 years?” “Near the lake, lived even many frogs and toads.” Unless you want your kids to learn broken English, stay away. Absolute bullcrap. Apart from the illustrations, which are nice and which drew me to the game along with the premise, the only good thing was that I bought the game during launch for 11 cents (the developer has since increased the price to 99 cents). It has trading cards, so I actually made a profit.1 OUT OF 10 (TERRIBLE)"

It's not worth the buck (pun intended).PROS :- cute graphics- soothing music- (not quite useful) informations about the pleistocene epoch- Steam trading card (the only reason I bought this game on discount)CONS :- too short- only 3 mini games- only several minutes play time (I played several hours just to receive the trading card drops)- poorly executed============================================================FULL REVIEW ::Did you know that majestic oaks can live even 1000 years?I don't.And this game tells me that stuff along with other things about the pleistocene epoch.The concept is quite good; making children learn something using interactive media like this. Cute graphics, soothing music, and simple gameplay. That's perfect, right?NOPE.It's poorly executed. You can only go right, left, and find ""hidden"" informations about the pleistocene epoch in the background. There are 3 mini games that you can play once and you won't play it again.1. Memory : Match similar images from a set of images. Once you've completed it there's no message or anything. You just press back button and that's it. Try replay it and you'll find the same images position from previous game. They didn't even bother randomizing it. :(2. Snack and Lunches : Choose 5 foods that deers ate. If you choose wrong it will display X on the image, otherwise it will display a checkmark. You can choose all the foods. There's no message on completing the game, just like the previous game. Well, at least you get to know what deers ate.3. Paleopuzzle : There are scattered bones and a silhouette of a deer. Place the correct bones into the deer. If you place it correctly the bones will auto-snap into the right position. And just like the other games, it has no message when you've completed the puzzle.Yes, that's the whole game. I'm not trying to undermine the developer's effort in developing this game, but I've made a better ""game"" for my history subject in high school within only several days. At least make the deer's journey longer, add more minigames, and make it more interesting.I bought it on 90% discount at around $0.1 so I won't complain too much. But this game doesn't deserve its full price."

The game IS super short, there is not much of a game really, but my 2 years old daughter loves it. It is cute, being short is a plus and there are few minigames. So all in all, it was what I paid for, no?But the fact that I liked it is not the question here, is it? The question is whether I would recommend it for other.. and I wouldn't. Little kids like it, but they don't read recommendation on Steam and I seriusly can't think of anyone to recommend this game (or animation) to. Sorry."

The 3 minigames are really stupid, and not even random if you were to replay them.  Because it is so simple, people will say it is for kids.  But the memory game relies only on you picking the 2 same ones fast enough, which sometimes was taxing on my hand for one of the pair, let alone a less coordinated child.  This looks like a little project someone threw together on a few weekends.  There is probably far better & more interesting free stuff on the internet.  I barely got 6 minutes through this before I couldn't stand it anymore.  I doubt a child would really find this interesting, and I sure didn't find anything amusing.However, I got it for trading cards.  It succeeds at that.  Yay!"

You walk across the screen reading a few things, then there's nothing else to do besides a simple memory game and a pick the food game.Also, the English in this game is bad. The information is worded in such a way it would most likely confuse and children playing it.""Between the deer's friends were the dormouse"" (the dormouse is not in between anything, I believe they meant to say: ""among"") and they use has and have interchangeably. I believe the game was in another language originally and no one bothered with an actual translation.On the good side, the art is cute and the game has nothing scary for kids..though my heart did skip when the game dropped me into water and then casually mentioned Megaladon...don't get excited, nothing happens and you don't see Megaladon, the game just ends in the water."

To be honest thought the video listed here shows most of the game (like almost all of the game except for the extra writen into) so I would not have bought it unless it was half or more off (which it was when I got it). So, as a gamer I would not recomend this game like at all. As a parent or older sibling, in my case, it is a good SMALL CHILD educational walk through. If you homeschool or would like a little extra something for you kid it could be worth buying."

You'd be free to roam around wherever your little deer heart desires!That'd be pretty cool....This game is really nothing like that, but for a game I managed to get for $0.23, it was pretty good... Although the gameplay is definitely not suited for most people my age, it was pretty interesting to play nonetheless. I'll try to sum it up without spoiling the <5 minutes of gameplay... Basically you are a deer in a christmas hat (depending on the season) that has wound up exploring the past, during the last part of the ice age. You can play mini-games like a matching game and a ""lunch game"" as you journey through a 2D plain. While it doesn't have the most compelling gameplay, it does have a charming little art style, and if you are doing a research project on the ""Pleistocene Epoch"" or on the ""Cervus Elaphus Acorontus"" this is definitely can help you out. If you want to spice it up just a bit, here is the""Cowsy Way""of playing the game...Step 1. Start the gameStep 2. Invite all your Steam friends to watch youStep 3. Set up some form of voicechat with them (Skype, Discord, etc.)Step 4. Remove all seriousness from your body and read every sign you encounterStep 5. Make your friends both confused and concerned for your mental healthOhdeer! This review is very long!
