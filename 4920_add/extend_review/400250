Mouse sens is totally messed, if you dont have a VR headset, DONT buy this game... and at the current time of this review's first writing, there aren't really alot of VR headset's available.2. Very barebones. I honestly can see the potential for a really good narrative, and it's sort of a test for the future of VR MMO's but even for 54 cents its pretty lackluster, there's not really any gameplay element other than finding things and picking them up into infinite inventory space that you cant even view, and looking at books that are written randomly on the island.3. Glitchy, there are many spots you can get stuck in that just exist probably because of Dev overlook, causing you to resart the game and look around again at this game's minimal replayablility.4. So, unless this game gets some serious updating, which i think it will in due time. (It better) my review is staying not recommend. I will stay up to date with this game, and it's updates and update my review for it constantly.Thanks for reading!

,Not Recommended,400250,20595755,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,EdenStarGazer,"This game is not much. I say that because I am trying to be positive lol. (It is instead of it's not.) Ok, let me explain by telling you what it is not. Remember ""Playstation Home?"" It's not that. Or, Second Life? It's not that either. Paradise Island has taken one tiny element of those games and brought it into the VR age; exploration of a virtual ""unreal"" estate. It works from a technical standpoint, despite the few errors I see in technical glitches.Remember those shoebox theatres we made as kids, (if you were born in another milenia) where you made a long scrolled storyboard filmstrip of crayon art on butcher paper and inserted it into the shoebox on dowels like a tv? Then you could wind the bottom dowel, scrolling the scene past the hole in the box so you were watching your own moving pictures. Then you could wind the top dowel to rewind the movie. Paradise Island is like that. The gamer, and I use that word loosely here, does not seem to actually interact with the environment. The scenes seem to scroll past you while you are standing still, rather. The only exception to this is that you see apples laying along the ground with these strange green auras, and seashells along the beach with the same auras. When you see those, click the ""E"" key and there you have a game. You, my friend, are collecting objects. And, if you collect 70 of each you will have a 100% game. That may be the only sane reason to spend more than 10 minutes in this game.Now, Let me tell you what I would like this game to be. It would be more engaging if you interacted with the scenes, without walking through objects. It would be even better if the people there were visible, instead of auras. And, what's with the aura thing? Why does everything have to have an aura? I thought someone was following me, because everytime I turned around an aura was in my face. Soon, I realized the aura was my own. Yes, I have an aura as well, and it moves more slowly than I do, so I see it when I circle around quickly.  So, you get the idea of how inane this game really is. Also, it would be great if you could talk, or chat with people you meet there... like a VR chat room. An MMO experience means interaction among gamers.The only engaging thing I found was under the sea. There were a few fish and turtles. (It didn't seem to matter that I was underwater, since I apparantly didn't need to breathe.) Then, I walked around the island, and suddenly a cabin appeared before me, and then suddenly a pagoda. I walked through a fence. I closed the game, and realized I had a couple of achievements for picking up the apples. That's when I understood the whole point of the game. So, now when you see me playing this game again, you will know... Eden wants to 100% that game... all 70 seashells... all 70 apples. Poor Eden.Am I being harsh? Remember Second Life? I loved that. I should go play that again soon and may. Remember Playstation Home? I played that too much, and sadly spent too much money on virtual property on that game. I don't recommend you play that either, as it can be addictive and expensive. Now, if Paradise Island were either of those games, I'd probably have found another guilty pleasure. Lucky for me, this is not that."

No. Its meant to be an escape, a relaxing world you can only really ""inhabit"" with VR, really this is more of an art piece than a game.

,Recommended,400250,26175193,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Deemo,"- PLEASE READ -Keep in mind this game is not for everyone.Not everygame is for every player.This game is a WALKING SIMULATOR.With that said..I very much enjoy ""Heaven Island"". I strongly recommend this to others who ENJOY Walking Simulators. As well as anything that is relaxing. There is not alot to do which is normal due to it being a Walking Simulator. The movement on the game is great, you can walk or sprint, plus bonus if you're like me and you looove to jump, there's jumping! While wandering around the island you're able to collect seashells or apples, not sure why but it's a cute little feature, (Press E). As far as closing the game, typical with the engine it's created with; Esc will close your game. You are NOT crashing.I'm rather dissapointed with alot of these; scratch that, 90% of these bad reviews. Mostly because NONE of them have read what the game is about and still write a bad reviews. I'm sorry this is not a survival game. This is not Gmod, nor COD. This is ""Heaven Island"" an Adventurous, Walking Simulator that is made by an Indie Dev. Who has also made it to work with VR. It has beautiful graphics; yes they're not HIGH DEF DETAIL but they are still BEAUTIFUL. There is music every now and then, but not all the time. The ambience is very calming and once again it is very relaxing to play or even just to leave it open for the sound while you do things in your room/house. There are also little open books everywhere with cute and meaningful messages, yes some of them are hard to understand but I believe the Dev's native tongue is not English; the point gets across though and they're very nice messages. I look forward to the next Walking Simulator I see of his in Green Light. It would be very awesome to see a game from this Dev that had this open world style but with more to do; such as a survival game."

,Recommended,400250,29431081,Posted: 22 January,all,Croatian Identitarian,"Ok, first off, I want to say that I am biased (positively) towards walking simulators because I am trying to find temporary replacements for actually enjoying nature in real life. I am currently living in a place where I am not able to get this, plus it's winter (and no snow). So that's that.When it comes to this game, people shouldn't be so critical of it. I mean, you can tell what kind of game it is by the price and the trailer. Nobody ""tricked"" you. Use your brain BEFORE you buy the game ffs.I got the game for half a euro, can't even buy a soda with that. It's very good that it has achievements, because that forces you to explore a bit and keeps you entertained for longer. I honestly think there's more potential to this game. If they could add a little more soundtrack or at least increase the radius of where the songs play, make the fish a little smaller and try making the environment a little more realistic in general, they could improve a lot. Also making some houses accessible would be great.Then again, I am pretty sure most people only have a problem with the graphics and game mechanics. There's not much that can be done about that, it's a VR game. I haven't tried anything that has to do with multiplayer, but I have seen other players shown as that light wave (or whatever it is). I haven't used the VR either, I'm pretty sure it would be more fun with the VR included.After a while you can also see how the creators worked. You start seeing the textures and if you've ever worked with textures, seeing all of this stuff makes it kind of cute. I don't know, that's the reaction I had.But actually, the game can be relaxing. If you are able to immerse into the game, you can enjoy it for a bit. The soundtrack isn't all that bad, it's pretty good, and the sound generally plays an important role in a game like this.All in all, for half a euro, I don't regret this. I only wish some studio releases an amazing nature simulator in the future that I could fully enjoy and fulfill the emptiness that I feel.Aaaaand I would still recommend this (for its current price)."

Seriously that's your idea of heaven Mr Developer? Personally I tried everything to free myself from the monotony of this walking simulator. I looked around everywhere for sharp corners I could impale my wisp on. I tried drowning myself. I tried climbing the tallest mountain and free falling to make a sand angel. Alas a soulless body can't seem to die.There isn’t really anything to do in this game other than pick up mundane objects that continually respawn for zero purpose and to walk around being preached to about Buddhism quotes which are found on various pedestals. Every quote you read will eventually change the colour of your soul as you become more enlightened in the ways of Zen which serves also zero purpose as it just randomly changes colour with no ultimate goal.This is a MMO which means it’s supposed to be massive multiplayer, which again serves zero purpose as there is NO interaction you can do with anyone other than watch their wisp float around the island looking just as lost as you are.This game started out with a LOT of controversy where the developer tried to bribe someone to change their negative review by handing out free game keys, when this was publicly advertised with proof, that's when a tsunami of negative reviews hit the steam store. Most of it has been covered up by the developer deleting various attacks in discussion and flagging reviews, which only strengthened everyone's opinion that the developer couldn't handle constructive criticism. There is still proof in the back of the discussion board of this happening, but a LOT has been deleted.Since the developer likes to preach advice in game, here is some preaching in return. When people criticise you or product, raising your hands, voice, going into a tantrum is NEVER going to stop the criticism from coming towards you. Since none of us are perfect, we ALL will at some point be criticised in our life. So, would it not be more wise to examine any criticism to see what points are VALID? All a critic wants is to have their voice listened too. Personally I feel you have let your emotions get the better of you in the past and you ignored MUCH of the constructive criticism.People have frequently complained about there being no END goal. Changing your souls colour does not serve any purpose, maybe change that so that once your soul is enlightened enough you can move on. Secondly people have complained frequently about not enough interaction. There are many objects that appeal to someone like a piano, or a playground, but there is NO interaction to be done with such things, which make them boring and turns a person’s experience with the game into a disdainful one. You constantly preach about sharing and caring and that small things are a 'function' to the overall worlds function, but can you create meaningful tasks in game that actually demonstrate this? Certainly it would make each statement stand out that whole lot more.People have constantly complained about the controls, and I myself found the looking around to be very, very awkward. Game pad was practically unplayable. Can you also introduce a crouch feature? Hundreds have literally informed you that the game glitches or breaks forcing a person to restart. This is still the case there were MANY, MANY places I was able to glitch my soul on. For instance jumping into the playground from entering it, will break the game.I understand that you may be just trying to share a relaxing atmosphere along with some inspirational quotes, but in all honesty I saw nothing here that a genuine walk in a park or along the beach in real life would not equally, or serve as a more productive task. Likewise a trip to the local library and reading some books, would be more inspirationally productive than what this product offers on a whim. Because of a lack of 'end goal' and no 'example of statements' any nobility here is as transitory and forgotten as a glance of a morning mist. The message therefore soon becomes vanity itself.In final, a beautiful map and a lot of earnest hard work wasted on a vain attempt to inspire self-preservation, but because of an overly sensitive developer, the product has failed to become a successful and meaningful MMO. Hopefully that will change down the track, I really do hope the developer will start to look into the criticism to see what maybe is VALID.https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-ferrara-92bb0832"

There are much worse games out there for a similar price, but also much better games as well. Paradise Island follows the story of the ghost of someone trapped on the island. In order to escape they must collect 70 apples and 70 shells, like some tedious Easter egg hunt. To be honest the being a ghost part is probably not true. It's just the fact that you can pass through most of the terrain, including trees, some walls and most ladders. Not to mention all of the wildlife seems to ignore you.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically the game is fairly beautiful. Golden sandy beaches, clear turquoise seas and lush green trees and plants. There are several landmarks dotted around the island too. Including a large Buddha statue, a small lighthouse and a few other places to note. Travelling from landmark to landmark can be fairly exciting and gives the game something of interest to aim for. But after a while you lose interest. The island, for the most part, looks very samey in places. The same rock formations dot opposite ends of the coast, along with several small boats washed up on the shore. Pointless books sit scattered around the island on pedestals talking about some pointless nonsense that, to be quite honest, no one really cares about.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the most part Paradise is an interesting, if not short lived, walking sim. While collecting the shells and apples dotted around can be fairly exciting, it does get boring very quickly. To be honest, if you want a decent walking sim with a generous amount of freedom, then I'd go for something else. The vanishing of Ethan Carter is a fairly good example, or if you want a game set on island as well, then Salt is a better option.With a cheap price tag, Paradise Island is worth a go, even for a few minutes, but if you want something that lasts longer, and is more enjoyable I suggest looking elsewhere.

I suggest you satisfy your ""walking around beautiful virtual places"" in titles like Far Cry and Joint Ops. In addition, you can create your own worlds in Joint Ops and can use large range of transports like helis, boats and vehicles to move around. And in Far Cry you even get a chance to paraglide around in one mission, enjoying beautiful views.I do like the idea of this title, however the overall experience is just not satisfying for me (don't have a VR so can't talk about that).Here is a list of Cons I have in mind after playing for 5-10 mins:- there is almost no collision detection, even with the water, you just ""go through"" things, which is a poor experience.- the world is very small, go out of island towards another visible island and you will face the wall at some point under the water (after walking for a while btw)- I guess developer didn't do any optimization at all, the framerate drops when camera is pointing towards ""heavy objects"" that should NOT be rendered just yet as they are on the other side of the island, however it seems like they are rendered because the framerate is high when looking towards the sea for exampleSorry can't recommend even at low price."

Now, if this game advances massively, and we all get a price break, that's one thing, but this I don't see that happening. The lack of a menu is another thing. You press escape, like usual, and it just closes the game instead of giving you a GUI like you'd expect. If the developer of this game sees this review, I would encourage you to implement a GUI and sensitivity settings, as that seems to be the main source of most people's irritation with the game. Maybe some ore acheivements for reading books, and allowing for sspiritr customization, like saving the colors you unlock from reading.

You'll just fall through the floor and sink endlessly under the island.- The achievements are hardly doable. Not that it's hard to get them. Well, it is.

Sometimes you hear  nothing, while walking along the shore. When you go under water, the sound should change too. It doesn't.- It should be bigger. And have a save function.

This isn't a ""game"" in the traditional sense nor is it what is commonly called a walking simulator as there is no storyline. It is more of a Zen/meditation experience to use to relax along with some wisdom quotes on books (Buddhist I assume) and is (in my opinion) well worth the 50 cents I paid for it on sale. I think it'll look really good on the Oculus Rift whenever I get one of those.But it is definitely unfinished:You can get stuck in certain areas and can't get out since you can't jumpYou can collect shells and apples, but there is nothing to do with them afterwards (that I've found)You get disconnected from the server every few minutes, which puts you back in the beginning. It seems like there should be some sort of save that remembers the last place you where at and put you back there when you restart the gameYou can't interact with items. I.e. you can't ""sit"" in a chair (of couse you are some kind of energy ball so maybe that wouldn't make much sense anyways, but you get the idea)This looks like it would be a great crowd project and I encourage the developers to open it up to people for development. To maintain the Zen experience, you can't just make it ""real-time"" open design though since people would ruin it (a la Second Life), but maybe have a way for people to design and submit additional pieces of island to you and then you can review them and integrate the worthy ones. Maybe also add the ability of users to play their own music while ""playing"".And while I'm normally not a fan of idiot checks, PLEASE add a ""are you sure you want to exit"" dialog if you keep the Escape key as the way to quit since in a lot of games, that button acts as a pause button and it's really annoying when I try to pause the game with Escape and it exits (and then of course when I start it back up, I'm back at the beginning).  ;-)"

While the game is in alpha, and very early alpha at that, it still shows promise in it's relaxation potential, as well as multiplayer.

Secondly, this game (or should I say experience?) is quite nice. If you can get over the texture pop-ups, bad optimization or the fact that this game is far from finished.I can understand where the designer got his idea from, he wanted to emulate the experience you will have with indie darling Dear Esther, which is a worthwhile goal but thus far badly conceived.A few feedback points for the creator of this game:1. If you do not feel that this game is ready, set it into alpha mode.2. The Steam community can be a fickle flame, but they are also willing to give you tons of feedback and make your product better.3. If this all was just a ruse to get use shelf out 99 cents, then I congratulate you on your well played scheme. But I'm guessing to the extent of your design you just wanted to create something very beautiful.So, I'm going to recommend this game but there is a lot to be learned for the developers (and the Steam client base) for future games or sequels or updates. So do not buy it if you want a badly optimised game, do buy it if you can look past that.I hope the people behind this experience will take it to heart and go with it."

The game is pretty, and nice to walk around. However, it is very buggy. Multiple times I have gotten stuck on the environment, unable to dislodge myself. I've also had bugs where I am no longer able to move my house, therefore making it impossible to look around. Also, the mouse makes the movement really floaty. All in all, it's cheap, so whatever."

The place is nice, but only living things are fish in the sea and some butterflies. The only purpose is to relax, collect shells and apples - I was prepared for that. But without animals, without movement, it is a bit depressing. I'd like to experience this in VR, but I think this is the worst game of the series."
