I am an old grognard who loves games varying in compexity from Gary Grigsby, through the Scourge of War series to Total War and some of the great mods that have been made.  The point is if there is a new grand stategy game that comes out I will buy it.  No refunds, I will gradually work hard to understand the game and if it isn't quite a diamond in the rough to start with I'll be patient and revisit from time to time.There is a huge amount of promise in this game.  The mechanics make sense and I do love the passion that has gone into making this game.  I will say straight away that it gets a recommend from me simply because of the ambition and effort of the one man who put it together.The game lacks finish at the moment, the graphics are poor although you can easily see through this with a bit of imagination.  There are moments where glitches occur to make the game look a little untidy such as words overlapping.  There is also the frustration of not being able to use certain links whereas others take you straight to where you need to go.  All of these are mild problems - as an old grognard I'm used to chasing little boxes around screen and imagining these litte sprites and boxes represent an army or a village.  This is a game where your imagination must get involved.But it does have a huge learning cureve and this really needs some support.  The tutorials are not good enough but like many others I am already hooked an determinded to learn in stages.  I can see a few big couck ups along the way but I believe there is real hope in this game not least from the positive way that the developer has responded to questions and support.  Wortst case scenario I may have lost £14,99 but maybe just maybe I have found something that will develop into my diamond.  I'm willing to support it because there is defintely something there.  Good luck to the developer."

There's no justice.This is the kind of game I've been wanting to play for years...a historical strategy game with an excellent campaign system that beats anything I've played by the big developers.As a total package, that melds all of it's disparate elements together in an engaging and innovative way, it can't be beaten.  No tedious single sprite fights, numbers, stats and sound FX to represent battles (Paradox and Ageod), no Benny Hill arcade battles and uninspiring strategic layer (Total War), no strung together bunches of battles with some occasional core units promoted masquerading as a campaign (Panzer Corps and 100s of others). Pike & Shot (and Sengoku Jidai) impressed me with great battles but the campaigns were bare bones.This game nails what a historical campaign should be, perfectly.  A fascinating strategic layer that creates a meaningful context for the realistically paced battles.The game is not perfect, the graphics are dated but functional, the learning curve is steep (especially for the economic simulation) and the English localisation has quite a few errors, but the developer of this game has shown some real ambition and talent to put this together.Fantastic."

The map and the historiacal major powers are well balanced aswell, but without hurting replayability.Most important is the constant patching and bugfixing that the developer is providing, combined with a forum where you can find answers, ask questions and catch good advice for game strategy.This game will get you hooked!"

The developer has clearly invested a lot of passion into this game, but I found it unplayable in its current state. That said, I'm going to follow this game's development closely.Pros:- Game seems to model to detailed economic and development systems.- Basic supply seems to be modeled.- Theres a command-and-control delay implemented in battles.- Graphics are adequate and reasonable for a indie strategy game.- Tons of passion and historical knowledge invested into this game.I use the term 'seems' several times above, as there is a lack of feedback in the UI, and a lot of information is presented in opaque and difficult to understand ways.Cons:- This game desperately needs a detailed manual. The video tutorials are a basic introduction, but are insufficient to understand the game.- UI exposes information in opaque ways. It seems like important informaiton is not presented. For example, in several scenarios, I watched the morale of my armies drop quickly to zero, but there was nothing I could see in the UI that would cause this. Bug? Feature? Can't tell.- Actions in the UI often work in strange ways, and not always consistent ways.- Bugs -- many, many bugs. For example, I was sometimes not able to set a policy at the beginning of a scenario (despite having no policy set). Restarting the scenario, I would then be able to set a policy.- If you have Nvidia NSync, the game crashes on launch. It has to be turned off globably for the game to launch."

76561198014375819,Recommended,400470,30969215,Posted: 5 April,all,DVX,"The Seven Years War is a gem, but make no mistake: this is a game meant for enthusiasts. The economic system is dense and takes several hours of getting used to, even after reading the 60 page manual and playing through the tutorial. If you're looking for a game that you dive right into and will hold your hand, this isn't it. However, if you're either an avid wargamer or fan of the period (or both!) and don't mind graphics from circa 2002 and a spotty UI, than I can't recommend strongly enough that you buy the entire bundle. There's simply no other game on the market that covers the dometic, political, and military (both strategic and tactical) aspects of the Seven Years War as well as this game. The attention to detail is truly impressive and it really shows that this is a labour of love. Yes, there are still some warts, but the developer is actively engaged in this product and puts out regular updates. If anything, the game's faults only highlight the fact that is isn't yet another homogenized, big studio release using a paint-by-numbers approach to grand strategy. Watching a Highlander regiment emerge from an autumn forest and charge across the field into enemy fire while striking up ""Scotland the Brave"" on the bagpipes evokes a kind of gaming joy that few modern titles can match."

I like how sieges are handled, the division/brigade groupings, the historical events, unit types etc.Nevertheless, even though this game achieves way more of its ambition than for instance Empire:Total War and the early AGEOD titles did it still has room to grow. But with this active and responsive developer I am confident it will.If CA ever tries an Empire:Total War2 they should hire this developer as their creative director."

The game was a must-buy for me and I really wanted to like this game.After several tries, hoping that updates will make this game playable, I have to say no-go.In short:- terrible UI- ugly graphics even for indie game (I am not expecting eye-candy, but I would like to recognize forests or swamps from plains)- historical mistakes (a lot of them)- absolutely no feel of 18th century warfareLonger explanation:The two last points are rather for 18th century enthusiasits; readers of Duffy, contributors to Kronoskaf. I had to mention it, because a lot of positive reviews are praising the ""historical accuracy"", which is definitely not true. I cannot recall all mistakes, but just a few of them:1) Dragoons can (and do) fire from hroseback > this was prohibited under punishment in Prussian army. All regular cavalry in all armies used cold steel (shock) tactics (yes, dragoons had carabines, but hussars and curassiers had them as well and they cannot fire from horseback ingame). Here, you can have 2 standing lines of cavalry shooting at each other...2) Unit portraits are full of mistakes, just a few of them:- hussars have picture of dragoon- Prussian Guard Grenadiers have picture of obsolete (1700 era) grenadier uniform- some regular infantry have picture of fusiliers3) Regiments are represented as bigger battalions, brigades are made of 4 such ""regiments"" (so there is roughly half the number of brigades)4) Historical battles = inacurately represented troops (according to OOBs from Kronoskaf) of both sides are just put to ugly and inacurate map without names of villages and towns (names like town 1, town 2...) in line formation (should be column) at the very beginning of the battle5) Commanders are not represented; units (brigades and divisions) just have to stick together to work properly6) When I tried the campaign mode just after the release date, the initial troops of 1756 scenario were not according to history. I am not sure now, since I have not tried the campaign after I recognized the battles are still wrong.I tried Kolin as Prussian > I was not able to recognize the map of actual Kolin, the troops in line formation were not according to OOB and they were somewhere in the fields, not on the Kaiser road where they should be at 5:30. All Austrians were far away in one bulk, no grenzers or hussar squadrons as forward recon.I tried Leuthen as well and it was better, the map looked like the Leuthen battlefield a little and the troops were more accurately positioned (troops were still not according OOB), but still in line and some troops (line formation) in woods(!!)I wrote points 1) and 2) on game forum (in more detail), but the author just ignored them (he replied something, but left the game as is with mistakes)The approach to enemy is really slow, clumsy and without any complex command-and-control rules (you have simple delay of orders). The engagement itself just feels strange and is no fun."

I bought it the other day . I was blessed that it was also 15% off may not sound like much. I live on limited income since a mugging causing perment head tramua in 2004 . I been saving for 6 months to get a new computer and spent 400.00 on the desktop to play this game and few others like it . I came across this game oh 6 months back been following the boards since.The most impressive items are this is a one person project . I viewd videos of battles said this was impressive one person could design all this . some reveiws  say graphics are bad . I say for one person design are great. I been playing this style before internet with Gary Gigsby's civil war games and  battles of napolian .  was not untill I played a 1/2  battle till I realized oh my the detail this game has in the battles . Name a Big name company this game has the same if not more detail realism into the battle and you can dial it out or in pretty much as much as you want.Now when doing the 30 turn tutorial I felt like was the King of England ,there once more is so much detail it blows major other games out of the water .I read the manual before and still after and will most likely print it out or get another screen to pull it up durring game play .The developer thought of just about everything and what he did not others did , for whitch he was quick to respond to with his feed back on a patch or disscussion on it.   for example  I was marching a army at REAL TIME was like this game going get old fast . all of sudden the tutorial says go speed up the game once you do this this and that . !!! bam few seconds later was at the place . set speed to normal . another plus orders comands and other tasks can be done while you pause the game . A real big plus . Ever play a space game go modify a ship only to find out the capital was just blown up and you never knew it ...So the game off sale is arround 20.00 bucks it is worth every penny of it . this is not a game to sit play casual or I don't think it is . There is a learning curve but the game is friendly about it with the pause button till you know what your doing . the default is auto save one week time i set mine every day  until I can figure out how to manully same several stages of the games progress.All I can say is with only 9 hours so far into the game I have a feeling this game will be in my top 5 all time best games to play for enjoyability and historicaly ..please excuse my grammer, spelling the head tramua was a mugging in 2004 that killed me, revived me.I woke up after 3 days in a coma ,18 in ICU  Mike Tyson could not done a better job it ended my nursing carreer as well .Bob c owner Crazy bear Flutes"

I did not play the game for long yet, but the game surely has some big potential and the dev is listening and interacting with the community and regularly publishing patches. There are only very few hardcore strategic games in the RTS branch. Knights of Honor or the Hegemony series are a few. This one lets you develop your economy, build buildings, research, build armies and has an XP and promotion system for commanders and armies as well as moral and supplies.You can fight tactical land battles and influence sieges in a mini game. Fleet combat is automatically resolved.The UI can be improved and there are typing errors and some smaller bugs still present. But I do not have any doubt, that the developer will take care of it. I´d like to see this developer ( and he is really only one person ;-) to keep on improving this game - so I do recommend it to be bought - it is fun already and there are very few games touching this genre at all - and has even bigger potential if given enough success and time.If you enjoy Paradox game, AGEOD games, Matrix/Slitherine games and other Grognard strategy games, with pausible gamesplay, then you should enjoy this one too.It is like a TW game with more focus on depths and difficulty, than on UI, graphics and arcade mainstream ;-D"

The developer is highly responsive to feedback.- Somewhat outdated graphics, but in a quaint and engaging way, rather than just being a pixellated mess. Building graphics have a level of detail that draws the player in.- Ambitious scope (real time, player-controlled battles, trade, economy, diplomacy, research) with a time period that has been very much neglected by other companies- Complex and detailed systems that provide a great deal of replayability and ensure mastery will take time- Detailed strategy map that segues well and accurately into battle maps- Prussia!- ChallengingMinuses:- There are still a number of bugs that are being worked out (but the developer has acknowledged them, fixed some, and seems determined to tackle remainer)- At times certain systems can seem somewhat obscure (this is a plus and a minus - draws you in and is more satisfying, but sometimes frustrating)- Still a great deal of work required for battle AI and campaign map AI- A number of the systems still require some considerable polish. This game could have benefited from a round of beta testing, but understand likely not within means of developerOverall, this is an ambitious project that has the potential to be very interesting, and has some unique or new takes on systems that bring some innovation to a genre that has been lacking such innovation for some time. This is not yet a complete game - I wouldn't necessarily advise buying it today, but you should add it to your wishlist, follow the forums and definitely buy it at some point. The value will be there."

Let's face it they're a bit of a mess. I'm not sure what is going on most of the time. Battles last a certain length of time and frustratingly  just simply end suddenly without you really knowing which side won!But the biggest complaint I have about the battles in this game is that they don't 'feel' like European SYW battles. Two things in particularly get me:1. Square formation - absolutley unheard of in major battles of the SYW. It just wasn't doctrine. Read Duffy, Nosworthy et al if you don't believe me. Lines of infantry simply turned their rear rank. Cavalry rarely took on formed infantry head on - again just not doctrine. There should be no capability to form square in this game.2. March column - again only used to get to the battle - not a fighting formation in any shape or form. Tactics were linear. Troops formed up in line well before they got close to the enemy.And what's this thing about forming lines into skirmishers!! Ridiculous. Again more like a Napoleonic battle than a SYW one!"

Ive not played all the game like the grand strategy or economy yet, so great thing ahead.I cant praise this game enough, its got the right pace in battle, the battle creater is great,One last thing the unit animations are nice, I almost didnt realise as it seemed like it just should be like this, pike and shot dosnt have this."

I initially went in without reference to the manual, and eschewed the tutorial scenario, so my learning curve was longer than you`ll likely experience. That being said, there`s still enough to keep track of to keep you occupied. The limited resources you begin with in the full campaign makes for a slow start while you prioritize things, but once your economy is up and running (i.e. you`re not losing money hand over fist) there`s lots to do. Make no mistake though; you`ll never be able to satisfy all you wants.Battles are fun, although I harbour the suspicion that cavalry by this time was a little less reckless than the AI allows. I do enjoy the restraints put on the player by the command and control features, which puts a premium on fighting your brigades as brigades, which gives things a more realistic feel. It`s also nice to see a game that doesn`t ignore the supply issues that dogged every single army (and navy) of the period.The only thing I would like to see going forward is some form of player-controlled naval combat, but this shouldn`t dissuade anyone from purchasing an otherwise excellent product."

If you are a Total War Empire or Napoleon fan, this is definitely worth experiencing, although leave any preconceptions and expectations at the interface.With highly detailed economic infrastructure, trade and diplomacy, there is an awful lot of shaping that has to take place before you even bring your military force to bear. This is ideal for those who play a historical campaign and have deep knowledge of the era and resultant hostilities. The AI is sufficiently aggressive to take you by surprise, whilst comprehensive strategies require co-ordination not present in Total War games where you can basically fund your entire campaign through conquest; here you have to develop your civil infrastructure."

The Grand Campaign allows for greater nation planning, while trying to conquer enemy land to expand your great Empire. Army management is necesary to win the war. The campaigns are also very historical as you try to complete the historical nations goals and try to come out as one of the victorious nations in the Seven Years War. There are fun historical battles to recreate, or you can attempt to win as the historical loser of the battle. The economic mechanics seem like an afterthought to the player, but they can still be enjoyable to play around with. The variaty of playable nations is one of the best parts of the game, because of the historical roleplay and the changing objectives that freshen the game up when you are bored with one nation"
,Recommended,400470,25700986,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,PK SPACE JAM,"Note: I need to spend more time playing the game but here is my inital impression.I mostly play wargames nowadays, on a board. There just usually arent that many historical simulations that are so immersive as the Grigsby games, John Tiller series, AGEOD, and so on. Most of these included on cover popular more modern wars as well.This game is a welcome masterpiece on a little studied conflict that had major consequences for the remainder of European history. I admit I suck at the battles, I have always been bad at real time strategy games preffering turn based, but the battles themselves are portrayed accurately and with the historical options on units can only use the formations that were around at the time (not sure why the other way around is automatic?)To me where the game really shines though is through its campaign system. Most people that arent either interested in history, logistics or economics will have a hard time with this side of the game. The crux of the system is focused on trade and logistics, which at first seems counter intuitive for a wargame except in that so much of the war depended on trade and supply lines. You can pause the game to plan out your strategic operations, build plans, and then most importantly (as ive just found out) managing your trading cities' priorities so you can actually accomplish the things you plan out.One con I have with the game is that I think Diplomacy is broken in some ways. I'm currently playing as France, England has never declared war, and the rest of europe is my ally or paying me a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money. Not exactly sure how the diplomatic points work but I would have prefered some kind of chance or random element given this particular abstraction. I think the game could have used an in game tutorial on battles as well, as someone who doesn't play other real time strategy games I could use the help.So yeah, if you are a grognard and know what that means go ahead and buy this game, its great, otherwise maybe read a few wikipedia entries on the war to see if you are interested before you spend money."

It takes Total War and actually adds a proper economic system, working diplomacy and a far better battle and campaign AI. Add to this it plays out in real time (as opposed to CA's turn based system) and you have in my opinion an all round superior game. The graphics for some perhaps are lacking (but again single developer), but personally i really enjoy them and find them perfectly suitable for such a game.Its an incredibly fun game, and i'm very much looking forward to the release of the first DLC. If your any kind of real strategy player- this is a must have buy."
76561198006575341,Recommended,400470,29644604,Posted: 2 February,all,Ironduke,"Number one its a Grand strategy game that works. Armies are raised the battles are table top and look like they adhere to a strict set of wargame rules authentic formations and OB's, there is clearly a command chain, a fairly detailed economic model. Its what Total War EU Paradox/Creative Artists don't have all the elements and in the case of CA they have none of them except state of the art Graphics.Cons I have had two CTD's so far on the Grand Campaign. The game needs polish sharpen the graphics the UI and text needs to be clearer. A manual just to explain how some crucial parts of the game work like how does trade work.Just to add the following con Ships require textiles for their production textiles require cotton and only cotton. As we all know sails were made from canvas, canvas was made from hemp a plant available in Europe since the dark ages, some english kings and queens had promoted the growing of hemp just for the purpose of fitting out their navy, so countries that do not have acess eroneously to cotton can not build ships, not a major problem we need hemp as a raw material to be grown on farms. And cotton just for clothing."

Just like Austerlitz: Napoleon's Greatest Victory, Waterloo: Napoleon's Last battle and Sid Meir's Civil War games....All of which are still frickin great to this day, I just have trouble playing them on a new computer.  I can play them on my old laptop just fine though.  And this game falls perfectly as next in line.  Yes the graphics aren't equal to today's games but so what?  The gameplay is superb, it needs some work but that will come in time I mean good lord, it's a one man team here putting this together.  I do wish I could use the WADS keys to move around the battlefield, a big issue in movement around the battlefield.  Developer should look to the Napoleon series and mimic how they had customizable random battles where you could choose where to fight on the map, how big of an engagement, what branches of the military and how heavy you wanted those units.  Options for a meeting engagement, defensive, offensive.  Soooo much potential here, just needs the time and work and of course patience.  Very excited."

The campaign can feel very tedious, even boring at times, with a lot of the colour and fun of the period lost in clunky micro management. The campaign management screen is overly complex and difficult to use. I was really looking for a wargame but instead I got a kind of economic simulator. On top of this the game crashes constantly, and having checked the steam forum there is no way for me to fix this right now. I'm afraid I regret spending my money on this one"

Gotta love the effort, but I cannot recommend this game.Its goal is admirable: to be a Total War/Scourge of War hybrid that provides more tactical depth than the former and includes a strategic/operational layer that the latter doesn't.  And it does so with a period of history that has not been the subject of many PC games- The Seven Years War.However, the execution is not good.  It's currently unstable.  I had crashes in both the battle and strategic maps.  And the stratAI came across as a comatose.  My biggest problem, though, was the game's incredibly complex and unintuitve economic engine.  It seems geared towards economics graduates or MBA students rather than players interested in an 18th grand strategy/tactical wargame.   Why would I want to bother with setting ""selling points"" and ""profit margins"" in a wargame?  I don't.Also, the game doesn't really assist with its steep learning curve.  The manual is rather useless.  The tool tip aids are incomplete with lots of misspellings and awkward grammar due to the developer speaking English as a 2nd language.  And even the ""Let's Play"" youtube clips are not helpful.  The one player who is regularly posting them seems absolutely clueless as to many of the game's facets.I fiddled around with it for two hours before deleting it.  Maybe there is a good game hidden there somewhere, but I don't have the patience to dig through the unintuitive interface, poor documentation, and CTDs to find it.  AGEOD's Wars in America or Rise of Prussia do much better with the subject material at the operational level.  And Scourge of War tactical battles are infinitely superior.  It'd be great if someone could combine the two, but The Seven Years War isn't that game."
