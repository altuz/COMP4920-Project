While this ""genre"" of found footage horror has been done plenty of times in the movie world, there is not a strong candidate for it in the video game world, so couldThe Final Takebe the breakthrough game to give birth to this horror sub-genre for games? Short answer: No.The Final Takesuffers from the""Slender Problem""and if you have played a quantity of indie horror games, you'll know exactly what that means. The""Slender Problem""is game-play consisting of running around a semi-opened area gathering collectibles (this time photographs) all while a monster is attempting to catch you. This could seem very tense the first couple times playing through a game like that, but after awhile it gets very old and monotonous which is the problem here. Sure, the game is arounda half-hour in length, but even during my short play-though it became tedious. I really liked the aesthetic of the found footage idea and I feel they implemented it well, but throwing in the Slender-like game-play ruined it for me.The story is relatively bland having the main character start a job at a suspicious hospital whilst unordinary events start unfolding around her. She eventually finds a old television and watches a tape of someone else have similar things happening to him. This gentleman in the tape is our ""Second Character"" and, from what I can tell, is very extraneous and does not seem to add to the story at all. Overall, the story is not one to give you the scares and you should not be expecting as so.Overall, for a $2 horror game on Steam, you can find worse. I don't feel as if the $2 is worth the half-hour I received from this game. Although, if this was a demo or a work in progress, I would say if the developers can remove the""Slender Problem""and make it longer and the story more in depth, I would say that this is one to look forward to. Overall I really enjoyed the found footage idea, but unfortunately the idea was not executed to the potential it could have been.ProsGreat ideaCreepy atmosphereHas room for improvementConsHalf an hour longSlender-like gameplayBland story"

,Not Recommended,400510,32171203,Posted: 4 June,all,CorvusCorax,"Final Take is a cheap Slenderman copy with only 4 chapters that can easily be completed under an hour. The entire gameplay, even the main menu, employs a VHS effect along with a sepia colour scheme that actually make the game look pretty ugly instead of giving it the ""realistic '80s feel"" as the creators claim.I was referring to Slenderman as throughout the game your main task will be to collect photos and notes as well as audio logs. While the creators say these shed more light on the background story we are barely given any information - what we have is the collection of elements borrowed from classic horrors such as the Ring.Everything under the ""features"" section is an exaggeration: the ""multiple character stories"" mainly means 2 people but in most chapters you play the girl. The ""re-wire locked doors"" aspect only presents itself on the first level where you do some puzzlesolving 2 times only to open a door. This is not even mandatory as behind them you only find an audio log. The ""different AI behaviour"" is something I cannot understand - enemies just walk towards you and once you are captured a crazy spinning affect will take place. Interestingly, this does not necessarily mean an instant gameover if you can get out of the spin.Later chapters are all about collecting photos - chapter 3 is extremely short. We can turn on our flashlight (sometimes only the camera is used as a means of light source) but the areas are lit enough for us to see. It is either because of the colour scheme or the increased gamma. There is one particularly cool thing in chapter 2, though: the enemy only emits a sound as it approaches us as it is invisible. We have a flashlight and a camera that can both be used to light our surrounding area. The camera, however, allows us to see the approaching ghost. As a downside the device takes up a greater part of the screen so following a successful escape your best bet is to use the torch once more.I expected much, much more from HUSH regardless of their latest title being an indie game only. The game has a great trailer and it is off to a great start (lots of monologue in the 1st chapter) but it ultimately boils down to a second-hand horror title that is best to avoid."

,Recommended,400510,24362710,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewThe Final Takeis a budget priced atmospheric horror game which sees you playing as two characters over four short chapters.You begin in a hospital (shocking for a horror game), as you have an interview, only to find the place pretty dark and seemingly abandoned. And in good horror fashion, instead of taking off, you decide to explore further to find the doctor who is supposed to give you the interview.To begin, the game is very dark. Not in terms of visuals or humor, but in brightness. I’m all for dark games, especially horror, as there’s really no other way to play them, but this one is exceptionally dark. Your phone’s flashlight is not all that bright, and neither is the heavy duty flashlight you carry in a different chapter. That, combined with the game’s blurry VHS-style visuals, makes it fairly difficult to see, especially in the second chapter. Luckily, when you need to find photos to progress the story, they are bright and hard to miss.Graphically, the game is okay. The hospital is pretty much as you’d expect, but there’s not much variation to it. They are very passable, and will not tax your system at all.Sound effects are also passable. Aside from the typical footprints, you’ll hear an odd noise that gets louder or quieter (I don’t want to spoil anything). The voice acting is surprisingly decent. The female character does a good job, but I was oddly impressed with the male character.The game appears to be played through the perspective of a camera attached to the player, that’s recording onto a VHS. Yes, a VHS. Now, not only are you recording onto a tape (for those born in the early 2000s and later, these were the precursors to DVDs), but your character is carrying a smartphone. Not a flip phone, but a smartphone. If the combination of these items from two distinct eras is intended, I’ve yet to figure out why. Not that this detracts from the game itself, but it’s curious.As I said at the beginning, it’s a budget priced game, and as you can beat it in thirty minutes (the third chapter was, quite literally, over almost immediately after it started), that’s a good thing.ProsSpooky environmentTypical horror fare with slightly better actingTrading cards and achivementsConsVery shortExceptionally darkNot much of a challenge at allSummaryI’m in that middle ground forThe Final Take. It’s a decent horror game, but there’s not much substance or length to it, and you’d probably finish it before your pizza gets cold. Games like this make me wishful for a neutral sort of rating on Steam. I don’t dislike it, but I don’t necessarily like it either. It’sjust creepy enoughthat I vote yes, buy it. If it were priced any higher for its thirty minutes, I’d have to vote no. I do look forward to seeing any future horror projects this developer might put out, and thatThe Final Takewas a good learning experience for him/her/them."

It's a pretty short one though, I probably go through it in about less than an hour, even with finding the optional stuff. The look of the game is pretty cool since it's trying to mimic a VHS feel. At some points though it feels like the filter may be a bit much and it definently makes it hard to see anything on the screen at times which can be frustrating, but not overly so.As far as jump scares go, there really aren't too many of them: I think there was maybe only 2? during the whole game. Most of the horror comes from the atmosphere, the lack of lighting, and the fact that you can't fight back any of the enemies you come across. There are some cool game play mechanics in there with one level where you have to choose between your two items constantly but nothing we haven't seen before.Story was bleh. There were notes throughout the levels to fill you in on what is going on but nothing too deep. I also could have missed a few things myself when I played.Overall, not a bad game. Definently felt way too short, with one level I think literally taking me 2 minutes. Is it a worth a play though? I would think so. If it ever becomes a full game I would most likely play it as well."
76561198048974498,Recommended,400510,23612951,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Well, well. HUSH Interactive have certainly bounced back from the crushing failure of having their earlier game, ""Five Nights at Frederick's"" - sorry, I meant to say ""The Dolls"" - yanked from Steam for blatant copyright infringement. In my review for that game, I expressed my hope that these devs ""find at least one original idea in their teeny, tiny minds between now and their next game""...so given that it's a full fortnight or so later, let's see how The Final Take stacks up to expectations, eh?Um...yeah.Now, while the gameplay is certainly nothing like the Freddy's games, I'm not sure that a ""found footage"" first-person exploration of a spooky hospital/asylum setting qualifies for a ""Most Original Premise of the Year"" nomination. The initial set-up, on the other hand, is about as Freddy's as it gets, and deserves plaudits for skyrocketing the stupidity of such plot devices to new heights.To wit: you're a young girl who's recently completed her nursing degree, who is finding it so hard to get work that she's agreed to show up for a job interview at a hospital she's never heard of and which, to all perceptions, doesn't even seem to ""exist"". So like Freddy's, The Dolls, Sophie's Curse, et al, we're already dealing with some pretty confronting real-life issues, like the extremes people will go to to get a job in this desperate day and age. (""Hell, you want someone to work for peanuts in a tiny security office with low electricity and electronic doors which need to be kept running in order to stop homicidal animatronic rabbits and chickens from murdering me? WHERE DO I SIGN UP?!"")Anyway, it isn't long after our protagonist arrives at the mysterious hospital in question that we work out WHY she's having such trouble securing a job. Apparently this delusional young lady's idea of how to impress employers is to walk around her prospective place of work, filming everything with her smart-phone while chattering endlessly to herself and shouting: ""Hello? Is anyone there? I've come for the job interview?!"" And even when she finds the place completely and utterly bereft of all human life, she continues to explore floor after floor in the desperate hopes of finding someone (who isn't a vicious, screaming ghost) who might grant her that all-elusive interview.I dread to think how this girl would conduct herself if she was looking for a job in, say, the army? Would she charge into the compound with an M-16, show off her shooting skills, then say: ""So what about it? I killed twenty-three guys in under five minutes, do I get the job?"" Some people, let's face it, are just a bit TOO keen.But wait! Just before you start going, ""Oh, this smart-arsed♥♥♥♥♥♥is just being PEDANTIC"", you should perhaps know that IT GETS WORSE. The next Chapter we have a ""flashback"" to another character, a dude with a video camera which he can't really see without - deja vu, anyone? - who is forced to play a murky-as-all-♥♥♥♥ variation of a ""Slender""-style game of find-the-notes, all while he is being closely chased by a ghost who sounds like an army of pistons working in unison.Then, once he finds the eighth note - I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not - we go to a cut-scene where he acts as if he's seeing a ghost for the first time ever, and recites a whole ""What? What's that? Oh my God...WHAT ARE YOU?!"" speech, as if he hasn't just spent the last ten ♥♥♥♥ing minutes running around in circles narrowly avoiding death from a wrathful wraith snapping at his heels! Sheesh, talk about your short-term Amnesia (no pun intended, of course)...The next Chapter is...well, it's about a minute long, and basically nothing happens. I mean, I'm all for dynamics in a horror game, but going from dying a few times in the last Chapter to such a short and uneventful cakewalk was, er...anti-climactic, to say the least.And so we come to our FINAL Chapter. Or should I say...FINAL TAKE? Ah-ha...ah-ha-ha...ahem...anyway. I'm sure you'll be less than gobsmacked, in any case, to hear that this is just another Slender/find-the-notes game, in much the same style as Chapter Two. And then - prepare to be genuinely amazed this time - we have a plot revelation which is actually sorta, kinda GOOD. Whether it's actually worth PLAYING THE GAME in order to reach this plot resolution is another matter entirely. But hey, it's a free world - at least last time I checked MSN - so the choice is yours. You could always read a good book or watch a competent movie instead.There's other bones I could obviously pick with this game - the fact that it takes low-res-as-a-deliberate-aesthetic to new heights; the fact that it can't even seem to decide if it's called The Final Take or just Final Take...but there's certainly no arguing with the price. One cent higher, and they'd certainly be taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥ As it is, you kind of get what you pay for, i.e. very ♥♥♥♥ing little. If you want Outlast or Slender: The Arrival, they're both still twenty and ten bucks, respectively. Do the math.Only buy if hard-up for your horror fix, or hard-up for cash.Verdict: 5.5/10."

I am never a fan of found footage and note finding survival horror games to begin with, the reason simply because I feel so powerless and useless.  However, this game proves to me that it is FUN to be powerless....at times. I know some of the players feel the game is too Slenderman-like aka generic and not scary, and thus give it a bad review.  But as a 1st timer in this genre, I disagree. It is scary enough for newcomers like me and also just the perfect length.  Anything scarier and anything longer would make me discontinue playing.  And the price, it justifies the game being short, I cant even buy a breakfast with that money.  So, in short, for newcomers, this game is excellent to give you a feel of how this genre is ( sort of a warmup) before you indulge in scarier games like Outlast.  For veterans, this game will not be anything new or mindblowing to you, but it does give some decent jumpscares and a nice tension....and for the price, it wouldnt hurt to give this game a shot."

It would be cooler if they really record their experience and you see that a camera is in their hands. First I thought so. But in chapter 2 I've seen that it is not like that. After a while the location is annoying, too, because you are not able to see anything even with your mobile light. It's damn dark. The ""monster"", which haunts you, is dumb created.

Furthermore hospitals are always in horror games and of course they are scary when it's empty and creepy things happened there, but it is always the same.

With grain and static scrolling through your screen, it's all very rough on the eyes and at times disorienting. I personally own hundreds of VHS tapes, and none look this bad.

Sarah's too stupid to realize the hospital is obviously abandoned and bullsh*t is afoot, but she keeps trekking on trying to find someone. Instead you quickly find the place to be haunted (no surprise here) and it's your job to avoid the ghost trying to approach you.The game sounds pretty simple so far, right? Well it is, because that's the whole game. With 4 ""chapters"" each containing a small map and not much variation of what to do you'll be able to breeze through this in 20 minutes. The game has a really good atmosphere to it and it definitely borrows heavily from Outlast. The difference here is the presentation.The presentation is where the game gets a recommendation from me, everything has a really old school, worn out VHS look that is done PERFECTLY. IF you look at the sides of your monitor you'll see the image is bowing in the corners to emulate the curved nature of CRT televisions of yore. There's a vignette effect, tracking lines all over, and the colors are appropriately washed out. It's utterly perfect.The gameplay itself is a bit lacking, you travel from room to room trying to find any notes/tapes (optional) to pick up or the objects you need to interact with to continue forward with the game. Nothing really special except for the second chapter which was really creepy: you have to find several notes in a worn building while a specter chases you, breathing heavily. It doesn't sound that special on paper but it works, in that chapter you have a camcorder (much like Outlast) that gives you your only way to actually see the ghost. The problem is holding the camcorder severly limits how much you can see. It's just done so well, top marks here.The game is affordable and short enough for any horror fan to enjoy it.

Playtime is only extended by you leaving the game on to get all the trading cards.Storywise it started of kinda neat in the first chapter and continued OK'ish but without a real finish to the story.But apart from the first chapter, it was not told in a good way and also ended up in nothing...Graphics were... hard to tell if it were good or bad with all the 'film grain' with it's even more distortedness 'film grain' going on all over the screen all the time.Didn't see any real differance from highest to lowest settings apart from the framerate going down.Again on the framerate... it went to zero when being beside a bed with a wooden manekin (independant of room).Otherwise the game went on pretty much fluidly.Sound effects were not that good.Screamy jumpscares, clunky and scratchy walking sounds from monster (not necessarily a bad thing, butnot implemented in a good way here).Why does everyone have to run with the flashlight slowly swinging down or put it away entirely?I mean, characters don't really run that fast in most games anyway, so why? When all you're doing is 'slightly jogging' for you life?(yes I know... it's to make you have to stop once in a while to shine a light on your path to see where you're going)Planning, is told in the first chapter, to be a thing to keep in mind and avoid 'something' and 'everything.And yes, this is true. Because this is all you have to do for the rest of the game... although it didn't feel like planning but more like a chore... ok, I'll run here and wait for the clunking noise (monster) to get close and then do a slow jog drive-by and check if i see something in these rooms up ahead. Ah, I found a clue! (baby picture without any text attached to it) Hope I can get it before the clunking sound (monster) gets close.2 scenarios might occur:Oh wait yea it's so slow no problem... Grab and move on to the next room, then repeat.Or, darn... I saw a picture but the clunking sound (monster) is getting so close... have to run to other side of the map and wait for it to get there and then run back and grab the 'clue' and then repeat.This is...THE ENTIRE GAMEapart from the promising first chapter.Monster, could have been but, was absolutely not scary apart from the first creepy crawler and also I jumped a bit on the first jumpscare even though it was a really expected one.Also, *spoiler*you don't really have to be that scared of the 'monster', just run trough it and you're fine.*end spoiler*As for replayability. No... just no... If you get the four recordings in chapter one on the first try, there's absolutely NO REPLAY VALUE, because then you'll have all the achievements pinned down.(and thank whatever deity you pray to for that because it would be a hassle to have to do more to achieve 100% in this game.)Conclusion:Despite it starting off rather good in the first chapter by setting the mood, giving you a beginning to the story and throwing a couple of puzzles you're way mixed in with 'something' haunting this place and seemingly trying to hunt you down......it falls flat after this first promising chapter.Then it's just:Collect 'clue' for... no apparent reason...No text, no dialogue, no......nothing...I had a recording of the first chapter but mistakenly deleted along with other stuff and thought I wouldn't mind replaying the first chapter, but when I sat down the next time I just fired the second chapter up and finished the entire game without recording and now I don't have any wish at all to go back and redo it."

,Recommended,400510,24028327,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Yaridovich,"6/10I'll talk about the game's cons first. It's an incredibly short game. There are four chapters, one of which has no challenge at all, and I think the game as a whole could be finished in less than an hour, possibly less than half an hour. That's the game's biggest flaw. Many of the features mentioned in the game's description are barely used for that reason - there's just not enough gameplay time to make proper use of the mentioned features. As an example, the ""rewire locked doors"" feature is only used twice in the whole game.Another flaw it has is that sometimes movement can be weird when going up or down stairs, sometimes the character gets stuck in place, which can be a problem when you're trying to run away from something. Additionally, the first menace you'll find in the game also seems to have trouble with its movement, sometimes getting suck in place and making it so you have to move close to them in order for them to resume their proper movement.The story doesn't make much sense - it feels incomplete. The game's description mentions ""multiple characters"", but there are actually only two, one of which is only played in one chapter and even when you finish that chapter, you still have no idea who he is or what's his role in the story.Apart from these flaws, however, it's a decent horror game. It's well done, graphics look good and the game has a creepy atmosphere. It's also a very cheap game, so I think it's worth the price for a one-time experience. And for the people who enjoy collecting Steam Cards, this game has them, too, so it's an added bonus."

I don't see why people should walk around with a camera for this. And the format was also bugging me, made visuals unclearCONCLUSION: Might contact developer for future publishing and co-op"
,Not Recommended,400510,28190328,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Uncle Sparticus,"The Final Take is a short horror game in which you wander around a dark, spooky hospital, sometimes collecting photos of babies, while a partially-visible enemy stalks you. To explain why I don't recommend it even though I like spooky games, let's analyze a few of the selling points from the store page:-Multiple character stories (switched up gameplay): well, technically, there are two playable characters. One of them has exactly one chapter. The switched up gameplay part, though, is false. The only difference is that the character with one chapter holds a camera, and for that chapter only, the enemy is only visible through the viewfinder for some reason.-Xbox controller support: true. However, it still takes away from the game because there's no way to tell the game if you're using a keyboard or a controller, so every button prompt is displayed for both systems, taking up an inordinate amount of your screen.-Different AI behavior (every level plays different): patently false. It follows you and takes away health if it touches you in every level. Which brings me to a more salient point about the AI and level design. Because there's no way to ""break line of sight"" with the AI, if you make the mistake of entering a confined area or a dead-end hallway, you are going to take damage. If the enemy skims you, she'll take away 40-60% of your health, and if you run right into her it's game over. But because many areas are narrow and linear, there is often no way to avoid taking damage, which is more annoying than scary. The prison level has a ring-shaped design and multiple stairways between floors, and that makes it easier, but that's about the only instance of the level design being conducive to playing the game.-Gather collectibles to dive deeper into the story: not really. In a few levels, you have to collect samey baby photos. Buut they don't reveal anything. Really nothing about the game is revealed. The main character/narrator makes some vague conjectures about the reasons behind the spookiness, but the only evidence of a story that can be gleaned from the environment is a few notes that are all right by each other.-Hidden objects only ""visible"" by a few held items: I can only guess this is talking about the level where you see the enemy through the camera. No idea what else that could refer to. But that's the only level where you have an item you can see through.-Play the story in any order you choose: wrong again. You have to start with the first level and proceed from there.-Re-Wire Locked doors, and lock pick to gain access to rooms: You do this once, and it's the dopiest puzzle I've seen since I played a Winnie the Pooh game. Don't get me wrong, I like the Winnie the Pooh games, but the puzzles are a little amateur-tier. This one's worse.Oh, and add to all that the fact that the game takes less than an hour to beat (and I died a lot), it makes zero sense, it has zero scary moments, and it's just another walking simulator.1/10 because the menus were cooler than the game."
