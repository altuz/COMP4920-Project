,Recommended,400630,32232896,Posted: 6 June,all,MisterDude1337,"""You know a game's good when it's been almost a year since it's been released and it still has a 100% review rating.""That was pretty much what I said to myself when I just randomly found this game on my discovery queue. It just caught my interest and I thought it'd be a fun explorative endeavor to try this game out. But oh boy howdy, I totally didn't expect what was coming next. To sum it up, I guess I found out why the game has a 100% rating.Everything in this game is just so captivating and weird, it makes you want to explore more and more and learn all about it. The world of Wuppo is colorful and happy, perfectly crafted to keep a smile in your face for the entire duration of the ride. It reminds me of the times I first played videogames, seeing big worlds and exploring everything they had to offer with a deep child-like interest. I didn't think that any games of this generation would be capable of recreating this sensation, but I can safely say that Wuppo does that with utmost grace.But enough with vague statements, let's go straight to the precise details about the game:Gameplay-wise, it's a metroidvania/shoot-em-up/adventure mash-up. It has a big emphasis on exploration and interaction. The game doesn't have much combat in it, which would make it rather easy... That is, until you meet the bosses. They might be a bit tough at first, but all are a fair challenge. Most of the actual challenge of the game is in solving puzzles, going through some simple obstacles and fighting bosses. But while you're not actually doing any of that, you'll be mostly looking for interactions or items to collect. The game doesn't really guide you much, so exploring all you can is the best method of progressing.In terms of aesthetics, it is extremely colorful and happy, and pretty much everything is criminally adorable. But even with the seemingly simplistic looks, the world feels filled to the brim with life all around. Wherever you go, you will find other creatures just minding their business, moving back and forth while sometimes carrying something. All the movement makes the world feel incredibly lively and believable.Now about the story... It starts quite small, with you just simply trying to find a new home, but it then somehow manages to go all around. The complexity of the story grows surprisingly fast. There is plenty of lore and backstory to uncover, all only limited to how much of the game you explore. Also, you better keep track of all the new words you'll be learning from the game, there's gonna be quite a lot of them.And about the content. As of writing this, I got 17 hours of play time for the game. And 17 hours is exactly what I needed to finish it with a meticulous search for collectibles. But after reading through the guides, there seems to still be a bunch I've missed. There is plenty of stuff to uncover like new items, more maximum health by doing things that make you happy (yes, you gain more health by merely searching for happiness), the collectible filmstrips to reveal more lore, and the boss fights that are sometimes rather well hidden. And even after finishing the game, you can still try and show off your skills on the boss rush mode you'll unlock then. Exploring the world is extremely rewarding, giving you quite a bunch of surprises.Overall, I REALLY liked this game, and I am absolutely certain that you will like it too. There is pretty much nothing to hate on it."

Good challenge (played on insane), interesting universe, fun jokes, cute art, great variaty, unique places to be - each with it's own story and charisma. Best waiting in lines and public transport exprience in videogames. Final boss kicked my♥♥♥♥♥- and that what a good videogame ending should do.For some time now i seem to be searching indie market for this kind of games, games that not just good, but actually so strong that it leaves me to annoy my friends for years about them. La-Mulana, Environmental Station Alpha, Rabi-Ribi, Grimmrock 2, Hollow Knight and now Wuppo is a welcome addition."

I know there's a lot of INDIE METROID VANIA these days so you'll be like man, another INDIE METROID VANIA and ignore it. But you shouldn't! This one is good!It reminds me of, like, early 2000s indie games, you know, Cave Story, Untitled Story, that kind of thing. When you'd have really good pixelly art not because RETRO but because it's cute, and you are a good artist and you can make good art. There's a weird world to explore, lots of people to meet who are all cool and interesting, there's puzzles to solve and hats to find and wear. The music is real good, the animation is real good, everything is really goddamn good and rad. It's also funny!I think there's a lot of people now who try to make THE DARK SOULS OF ______. The DARK SOULS of zelda fangames! The DARK SOULS of chess! This isn't the DARK SOULS of anything. It's not a NES THROWBACK RETRO CHALLENGE. It is just what it is, it's a game with good art that is fun. That's what I mean when I say it feels like an old indie game -- it's not trying to copy anything, it's got 2d art because it's made by some animators and that's what they're good at, and it's funny because it is good for writing to be funny and for people to have fun. I guess I am rambling but bottom line this game is good and you should buy it and you will have a smile on your face like 90% of the time. That's guaranteed!"

The gameplay is fun and there are many diferent items you can toy around with and use on your adventure. The music is cute and spunky just like the game itself. After you beat the story you can keep exploring the world or play the boss run, which is extremely fun as well. The bosses are all unique and fight differently! I enjoyed Wuppo so much that I bought the DLC :)"

76561198062301493,Recommended,400630,29626138,Posted: 1 February,all,76561198062301493,"Wuppo is a hard game to pin down in a review, but I'll try to be descriptive and add some practical details to help make up the minds of anyone that tries to decide if this game is right for them.First off, what immediately will catch your eye, is that the game looks very ""cute"". This cuteness is not is not just added for its own sake, but its aesthetic and style really serves the purpose to complement and add to the feel of the world. What I mean by this, is that the world is very friendly and open to exploration and has generally a very laid back atmosphere. Most of the world's inhabitants that you encounter are friendly and can be interacted with for some possible rewards or information. Some can be triggered into attacking you, but if this happens when you have the bird equipped for example, I can't really blame them.At the start of the adventure you are kicked out of the room you live in and become forced to explore the world and find a new place to live. You traverse the world through platforming and this doesn't mean going from left to right; you are free to choose where to go, but you'll quickly find obstacles that you have to overcome in order to reach the newer parts of the map. The platforming itself is very satisfying with good reactive controls and almost no frustration due to there being almost no enemies or hazardous pitfalls. Should you die, or miss a jump and fall all the way down, there are plenty of potential save points that you can quick load to. This may sound that this makes the game too easy, but I feel this was just done to not hinder you in exploring the world. The real challenge lies in the bosses and ""puzzles"".Should you encounter an enemy, then you can take fire at them with the weapon you have equipped -- this will mostly only be necessary for the boss encounters.The controls itself were straightforward enough, but they did require me to get used to them. I use a controller and when you fire your weapon you control where the attack goes with the right analog stick (360 degrees). I normally use the ""A"" button -- XBOX controller -- for jumping, but this makes attacking while jumping hard to pull off. The game therefore starts with the jump button being assigned to the left bumper (LB), but after some experimenting I decided to switch this to the right bumper (RB) instead. The game lets you re-assign any button you want. It does seem that because of the way you control your attack, this is a platformer that is easy to be played with a mouse and keyboard.Most of the weapons you use will fire an continues stream of particles at the location you are pointing to. This means that the bosses have plenty of hit points and you usually have to hit them a lot of times to whittle them down. The bosses can be quite challenging, but they often are also a highlight of the game. I can think of 7/8 off the top of my head that had some really creative and memorable designs in both their looks as well as in their way of fighting -- usually with multiple stages -- that can easily match up with the ones from various classic 2D platformers in terms of the quality of gameplay. They didn't add the boss run as a feature for nothing.To make the boss encounters easier, you can up your health from 100 to a maximum of 200. You can get these bonus ""feel good"" health points in a variety of ways, like simply just talking to certain NPC's, or participating in events. I once got a point by just passing a painting I had made that had been hung up in the hall. The most straightforward way is to find and collect the various ""filmstrips"" hidden throughout the world. When watching them some of these will give you a point, but by collecting all of them in an area, this automatically gives you 5 life points. It doesn't sound like much, but the bosses can hit hard and most boss encounters have parts where you can get back lost health. So, any way to survive an onslaught, raises your chance to be victorious.One part of the game that can be off-putting to some, is that it features situations where you have to come up with a solution in order to proceed further into the game -- it has adventure game elements after all. I'm hesitant to use the word ""puzzles"" even if it is what it boils down to, because this can be associated with the minigame-like scenarios you can find in point and click adventure games; Wuppo is more action oriented. Most of the time you are required to search for certain items, which you then use to open a new path. Talking to the NPC's can give you info to what items you need and what use they have. Also, equipping certain items can trigger events. Personally I would say that I encountered only a couple of situations where I was stumped for a bit, but I can understand that some people don't like this element. However, there are some good guides available now, so you can look up a solution for if you get stuck.What I consider to be the best part of Wuppo is its fantastic world and the amount of world-building that goes on in it. A lot of  people are raving about the ""charm"" of this game and indeed, it oozes it. This is of course highly subjective on my part, but my experience with Wuppo, I can best describe as Nintendo-esque. Honestly, while playing Wuppo, I immediately started comparing it to the Zelda and Paper Mario games. Of course, Wuppo is not as polished as what Nintendo produces, but we can't hold an indie game to those standards. Anyway, the background of the world; all the interactions with its characters; the situations you find yourself in; and how the characters behave in all of the different areas in relation to each other, it all fits and comes together wonderfully. You really get the felling that you are walking around in a fleshed out world where all of the characters have their own lives and way of thinking. As an example, in one part of the game you have to use a train, this train has an in-game schedule, so it can be that you have to wait in line during which time you get to observe Wums going all over the place. Then, when the train arrives, you have to wait a bit for the departing passengers and after that the cleaning crew. The wait isn't very long -- less than a minute --  but these little details add so much to the world and they can be found everywhere; clearly a lot of love went into this game.The soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds so much to its charm. Looking back, there really are quite a lot of terrific tunes that build up the atmosphere.All in all, it's hard to give Wuppo an objective numerical rating. I could say it deserves an 8 out of 10, because it does have some rough edges, but when the game works, I felt like playing a 10 out of 10 game. It has such a uniquely genuine feel to it, which is too abstract to really factor into the sum of its parts; the people that are attuned to its vibe, will enjoy it immensely for this reason alone, but this will not necessarily apply to everyone. Neverthelessl, the world-building; the interactions with the varied colorful charactars; the boss encounters (most of them); the art style; the terrific soundtrack; the sense of humor and whimsical nature; the fun platforming; and the writing of the story and various dialogues, all contribute to an amazing game, that will put a smile on almost anyone's face and deserves to be labeled as a ""gem"".Wow, this review went on longer than I thought it would, but I had some free time on my hands. For people who don't like ramblings like this, just skip it."

I remember 6 years back, 12 year old me saw the game pop up in my sub box, and I was amazed. I couldn't wait for it to come out.Imagine my surprise, 6 years later, when the channel I thought was dead started posting videos about the game again. Part of me picked it up for nostalgia, but I stayed because the game was just so freakin' good!  You can honestly tell that this game is a labor of love. It's a solid game with heaps of charm and polish, and lots of tiny details in the world for you to stop and notice. I'm astounded and amazed by the amount of work that's clearly been put into this, especially so since it's a team of two that's been doing it all. The amount of support and response that the devs have been maintaining post-release is also incredible. I honestly wish that more people knew about this game; it's so incredibly well crafted that I feel like so many more people would enjoy playing it. 10/10, would recommend 10 times out of 10."

I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every minute of the game that I played, and will certainly revisit it in the future. The storyline and dialogue can be a bit abstract at times, but I found the humor in the game spot on, and amidst much laughter I came down with several lingering cases of permagrin! Certain cutscenes along the storyline are very visually intense, and I found myself very immersed in what was occurring. The ending of the game becomes a bit... confusing (as the lore gets dramatically expanded andyou're given ""fast travel"" access throughout the world, to tie up loose ends or keep exploring), but I felt very satisfied after beating the game and pleased with my accomplishment.Some of the bosses are quite challenging, and the inventive/creative design of the world and its inhabitants always kept me smiling and impressed. The music was also quite catchy! At some point I will certainly buy the soundtrack, as I'm finding certain songs stuck in my head throughout my recent days. Wuppo's music will continue to play in my head as serve as a mnemonic draw to the unadulterated fun I had while playing this game.Overall, I sincerely enjoyed my time with Wuppo, and believe it deserves a lot more recognition that it currently has. I wholeheartedly recommend it! Thank you, Knuist & Perzik, for creating such a pleasant world to explore!"

I had nothing but her word to go off of, and boy am I glad I gave this game a shot.  Going in, the first thing you'll notice is that this game is hilariously cute.  But the deeper you fall down the rabbit hole, the more you realize how much this game has to offer. It has a lot of charm and a lot of heart, especially seeing how it mostly comes from only two indie developers, and the soundtrack is very engrossing (I'd recommend getting the ultimate edition if you've got the money for it).  The puzzles can be very tricky at times, but they're never too overwhelming--especially since you have an in-game guide that can toss you hints if you're stuck.The game has quite a few bugs here and there, but there are save spots all over the place and it literally takes a second to save, so as long you don't forget to pop into one, you should never lose more than a couple minutes' progress from a crash.  The devs have been VERY involved with taking feedback from players and are actively seeking out bugs to fix for their next update, and it just goes to show how much they care about the game and their fans.All in all the game will take up about 13 hours on your first playthrough, many more if you're a completionist or want to give one of the higher difficulties a shot.  Between the cute characters, beautiful scenery, enchanting soundtrack, and fascinating story, I'd say this is definitely worth a buy."

I may replay the game and update my review in the near future.CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATIONIn short, the game is fun but falls short and kind of disappointing.I am impressed with Wuppo. The world building is fantastic and the developers went at length to make the world as organic as possible. Exploration and problem solving are enjoyable despite being frustrating at times. Some of the bosses are very fun, too, and the soundtrack is memorable and a joy to listen to. Wuppo is also very charming, with many funny moments and easter eggs.But there are many problems with the game that keep it from its full potential. Some boss designs are questionable and started to drop the ball close to the end of the game, there is an entire portion of the game that is a literal grind and has very questionable navigation structure, the game forces you to wait at times (the developer has stated this was intentional because he found waiting to be half the fun at amusement parks, meanwhile my family always tries to get fast passes in order to skip lines), and some mechanics felt entirely pointless and added tedium (there is a tiny area in the game that you spend only a few minutes in but for some reason it has its own currency). Also the game is very short and you are at the end of the game before you know it.After I killed the final boss, I recollected my experience through the game only to realize that I didn't do much at all. It feels like that the game does not have much content in the end because a large portion of the game is padding. The game took 7 years, but Wuppo does not feel like a 7 year effort.So with these in mind, I give Wuppo a cautious recommendation. You will enjoy exploring the game world and its secrets, solving problems to progress, but be mindful that it will make you do tedious things and the game does not last very long. Also you will sometimes get stuck."

To go to Popocity (one of the areas in the game) you have to wait for the train to arrive. The train sometimes is late just like in real life. And there are escalators. Real escalators that work.There's an amusement park, but to ride the attractions you need to wait in line, again just like real life.There's such attention to details that is only possible when a game is made with love and passion."

A lot of effort has gone into this project and it sure shows in all aspects of the game.There's a lot of humor involved which hides just the surface of a complex story.The music is on point and adds to most of the games' atmosphere.The artstyle is also quite cute, odd and very playful compared to most games and that's also a great reason why you should give Wuppo a try."

The best way I can describe this for prospective buyers is that it's a a Yoshi's Island tier platformer with the humor of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. It's a very endearing game filled with charm in every nook and cranny.

It reminded me a lot of Yoshi's Island and other great SNES games. It's story-heavy and character-heavy, with a super-cute art style and I really just loved it. It's genuinely one of the most heartfelt games of its type I've encountered in these sales -- when so many games feel like exersizes in bland, emotionless mediocrity, Wuppo clearly was made with a lot of love, and it shows. I also thought it hit that sweet spot of being challenging and requiring quick thinking, but never getting frustrating. It also (also) feels finished, while a lot of these games feel like they rush to wrap up because the dev ran out of time/resources, Wuppo is very much finished and feels finished, and even has an extra area that's totally optional but has some lore. Spill the ice cream, save the world!"
,Recommended,400630,26806280,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Tardivex,"Wuppo is a side scroller shooter with some tiny elements of metroidvania and platforming thrown in there for good measure, the art style isn't the most high fidelity but I think it's really charming on it's own right, sorta like a cartoon or one of those short animations from the 2000s, I'm not sure if everybody digs it but I find it really nice and kinda cute personally and the game has a really good soundtrack too that fits in very well with this aesthetic and can also really surprise you at how flexible it can be in terms of the mood or tone it can set for a given area or scene, but I don't wanna get too deep into that because it's spoilers territoryThe core gameplay consists of exploration, talking to all sorts of NPCs and fighting things with your paint gun or Gumgumgun as the game calls it, although you also get extra weapons and can upgrade a few as the game progresses. The game's technically structured into levels or I guess the more fitting description would be regions, as you keep unlocking the next one as you progress but the world is still open and explorable if you want to backtrack for instance, and you even do unlock fast travel very very late game, each area will have a different objective to progress to the following one which will usually be about solving a puzzle, obtaining a certain item or fighting a boss of which there are 17 of themI think most of the bosses are generally well designed and fun to fight against but they do get a little bit bad near the end of the game, where you'll fight what feels like just a bunch of regular enemies, but they're considered a boss for some reason as if it was inflating the total boss count and I don't want to spoil too much here but I don't really like the final boss all that much either, sure it's hard but I think that fight is more of a cluster♥♥♥♥ of projectiles than anything else, also your weapons aren't really all that great at shooting directly upwards but that guy tends to float around anyways often times just barely out of range for your weapons, but then there's the Giant Dust Monster or the Rock Statue which are some of my favorites which were challenging but also really enjoyable to fight, they all have their own unique patterns which you have to learn to tackle them efficiently, sure you may die a few times finding out those patterns, but that's part of the fun of fighting these bosses to me, difficulty varies between normal, hard and insane, which changes how much damage enemies do to you, I personally went with hard for a decent challenge but nothing too far out thereThe puzzles on the other hand even if there are few of them, they are all well put together in my opinion, they're not overly complex or anything but they play on the game's lore quite nicely, there's a big temple near the end and I think that's the best example of it in the game, it really is something quite good and there are definetly some crazy surprises there, part of which is some of what I mentioned about the sountrack too but I really don't want to ruin it for youAlso about the objectives I mentioned earlier they're usually good too but there is one big exception around the mid game where you go to this city and it has this ""credit"" system, where you can contribute to increase an overall score of sorts of the town and you can do it through a couple different minigames which are fun don't get me wrong here, but the overall score that you need seems to be way more than it should've because you have to repeat these minigames a looot to get there, to the point where it gets really repetitive and almost feels like it was done to pad out the game a little bit, I'm not a fan of waiting mechanics in general but I do think they have their time and place, like in the Splenkhakker park for instance where you have to wait around for the rides and stuff, I mean it's just a fun optional thing and I think it adds some charm to the region overallAnd that's one thing I think that this game's honestly full of, charm, I mean Splenkhakker park? The names of these races are kinda wacky, I don't know if it means anything, I mean the developers are Norwegean so there is a language barrier there I suppose, but there's also the humour in the dialogue and it's all upbeat and lighthearted, it's definetly a really nice experience when you meet a new character and get to talk to them which will usually make you smile just reading what they have to say, the story is rather simple in the grand scheme of things, but it's things like these that carry the game and elevate it to something really unique and special and that ties in to the collectables that this game has which are Filmstrips which show you a little bit more about this game's world and lore, or just some funny situations and then there's Happyness, which you can get by doing all sorts of stuff around the levels or on conversations with NPCs where you choose a specific dialogue option or do something for them, not your typical quests or anything by the way, the game's more clever than that, there are also a few fun secrets and easter eggs out there so I'd definetly recommend you keep your eyes peeled while exploring and also return to some older areas once you're late into the gameSo overall this game's gonna take you around 12 to 15 hours to beat depending on how much you want to explore and all that, but personally I really think this game's worth it, it's a really nice fun experience that doesn't really take itself all that seriously and I think we need more platformers like this, it kinda reminds me of Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit, which was a similar game in spirit in my eyes, like the way I felt playing it, it's hard to explain and I'm probably sounding kinda pretentious here so I'll just say this, I'd definetly recommend Wuppo for pretty much almost anybody and it's gonna make you really happy while playing it and for just $15 dollars or your regional equivalent I think it's a nice purchase"

There's clearly a lot of work and effort put into this and the result is pretty good! It slightly distracts you on how the map is actually pretty small but it still holds a felt like a big adventure in a giant map in the beginning.

,Recommended,400630,25906184,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Yokuyin,"Welcome to the strange world of Wuppo. A world filled with Wums, Blussers, Splenkhakkers, Fnakkers and a handful of other races. You are a Wum living in the Wumhouse, a house where every Wum can live in leisure, but seeing more and more Wums leaving to the new underground city of technical development Popocity. After you've made a mess of the hallways in the Wumhouse, AGAIN, you've been thrown out of the house. Now homeless, your adventure begins where you meet other characters, fight strange bosses, solve enviromental puzzles, help communities, save the world, and find a new home.Strong Points:+ The world - Building a world ain't easy, especially one with races and technologies so different from ours. But the developer managed to not only create a consistent world, but one that feels very alive and full of things to explore. A great achievement.+ NPCs and their interactions - The world is filled with small little creatures with small little lives. They don't feel like static objects that speak the same sentence their whole lives, but as real and alive creatures. Big plus for writing and coding all these dialogues for all the little interactions, even when they are insignificant to the plot, just to keep the immersion.+ Music - The soundtrack is gorgeous and fits to every situation our little Wum is thrown into. A great achievement by the composer.+ Animations - Very fluid. Love how the expression of our little Wum changes at different dialogue options.+ Difficulty - The bosses and environmental puzzles are sometimes hard and challenging, but never unfair. Great job.Average Points:T Gameplay - You don't play Wuppo for it's inventive gameplay: it's your average Indie Metroidvania. But that isn't needed for a game like Wuppo, the gameplay is the medium you use to explore and interact with the world, and it does that just fine.Weak Points:- Art style - Sorry Lars, but most of it looks like it was made in MSPaint. Sometimes it looks nice, and sometimes it's just plain ugly. However, the art style is consistent throughout the game, so it doesn't break the immersion.Conclusion:Wuppo is a charming game with a great world to explore that feels very alive. Recommended!"

Its world and characters bear a charm that evokes memories of old LucasArts point & click games.Majority of my playtime was spent exploring, platforming, talking to characters and solving small puzzles. The occasional bouts of combat seemed to be tuned for those more familiar with action games, though there's also an Easy difficulty if you're less interested in combat.Some puzzles might leave you perplexed as you wonder what items you might need, but paying attention to item descriptions and dialogue should help you through eventually. I felt that the game didn't suffer from point & click ""moon logic"".The game helps you immerse yourself into the world by having no loading screens and by filling populated areas with characters which constantly go about their business interacting with the on-screen environment. Public transports also move in real time, reinforcing the illusion that the world doesn't always just wait for you to show up.In the end, I was just pleasantly surprised to have found a game world that was easy to get invested in, and to have found a game that just made me feel happy."

I love the characters, I love the world design, I love the humour (although I might be a bit biased because I'm Dutch, and a few jokes you'll only notice if you speak Dutch). I even like the combat system in contrast to what some people say. I definitely do not regret buying the game.The reason I wanted to emphasize that it is a good game is because of one thing that I can't let go. The final bossfight. I'll try to elaborate by not giving any spoilers.Summed up: it's really difficult, but not for the right reasons.Difficulty in itself is not something that's bad. Just look at games like Dark Souls. The reason that it's not done correctly in this case, in my opinion anyway, is because there are elements to it that make it incredibly annoying. Firstly, there is an attack that is unavoidable. I've read somewhere that it has a pattern and that you can dodge it, but after more than two hours (yes, it actually took me two hours on the highest difficulty) I haven't been able to dodge it more than once, and that was pure luck.Secondly, there was a lot of downtime in the fight. I had no choise but to use an exploit in the game to gain enough health to survive. If you know the game, I'm talking aboutusing the coffee hat to slowly regain health while standing in a spot where you don't get hit much. To my knowledge there isn't another way to gain enough health than to buy loads and loads of food, which requires loads and loads of money, which requires a lot of grinding (= also a lot of downtime).Maybe it's just me. I don't know. I do not have these complaints about any of the other bossfights.Anyway, just know that if you're a completionist and you're going to complete Wuppo on higher difficulties, I wish you good luck."

,Recommended,400630,33206345,Posted: 3 July,all,pixels/that/breathe,"So originally, this was the first genuine negative review of Wuppo. Before I tell you why you should BUY THIS GAME AND LEAVE A REVIEW, I'll explain why I had the change of heart.First, it was the Steam summer sale, I had a budget. I wanted adventure games. And Wuppo initially frustrated me. I knew the game would not hold my hand. But I didn't expect by how much. In the beginning of the game, I got lost. Queue frustration, I requested a refund and spent my money on another game.I wrote my negative review originally criticizing the lack of a world map which I felt was a detriment to the game. I soon learned that really, I was just spoiled by other games because Wuppo really doesn't need a world map.Soon after the review, I'd received a friend request by someone by the name of Knuist. :) I originally thought... ""Uh oh, it's one of the developers of Wuppo. Am I in trouble? Are they mad because of my negative review?"" Well, that certainly wasn't the case.Knuist wanted to have a conversation about what I found frustrating or difficult about the game. He was very nice, extremely courteous and understanding. He let me know the process behind the game design decisions and encouraged me to give it another shot through the demo.Well, I gave it another shot. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE END. :)----Game Review Starts Here----Wuppo is an EXTREMELY unique looking game with a fully realized and living world that has an entertainingly cute story and terrific music to boot. Now some of that might seem like buzzwords to you. But let me tell you how ""living"" these worlds are.- There are multiple societies with different lore and cultures.- Traversing through these worlds, you'll witness hundreds of npc's just carrying on about their day living their lives.- The world has a day/night cycle with weather effects.- There are trains, elevators and trams that run independently of the player. They operate with or without you.These elements really make the game feel like a big world that you're just lost inside. It's really well done.The gameplay is much of what you'd expect from a metroidvania, shooter format. But it's unconventional and that's what sets Wuppo apart. Your weapon is a gumgumgun that shoots multicolored gumballs at an arc, not straight. And the design of the worlds is EXTREMELY organic. Rolling hills and inclines abound, you won't be exploring boxes and hallways as you might in most metroidvanias.The story is also unique. Seriously, there's not much about Wuppo that borrows staples from other games. The story is reminiscent of a saturday morning cartoon mixed with a fever dream. I know that sounds odd, but damn it, it's enjoyable.The boss fights range from small skirmishes to TREMENDOUS bullet hells and they're all varying from one another. Some take strategy, some take brainpower.As I said in my original negative review, there's no world map. This game doesn't hold your hand. Were you looking for an adventure? WUPPO IS AN ADVENTURE YOU WON'T FORGET. Were you looking for an easy adventure? Wuppo can provide that as well. It's not an impossibly difficult game for those who have the patience to enter it's world and actually expect something different.Don't make the mistake I did by playing Wuppo and expecting a game like any other. You'll be better served by opening your mind and accepting that, this excellent game is being given to you in a totally unconventional albeit highly entertaining way. :)After having beaten the game, I can thoroughly recommend this title. And if you decide to buy it, please leave it a review. This is Knuist & Perzik's FIRST game. And for a first, it definitely goes beyond the call of what many other indie developers start out with. We need more adventures like Wuppo and I say we definitely need to encourage developers like Knuist & Perzik.Thanks for giving us something we've never seen before guys. Well done!"

Easy and intuitive controls, a beautifully crafted word, made up words, adorable everything, a whimsical and intriguing story, and fun gameplay. The only issue with this game is the lack of a community, and sometimes being unclear on where to go or how to activate alters. (Finally found a guide about halfway through to consult about some not so clear puzzles) But even these were just small grievances, often times being lost in the world was part of what made it so fun. Exploring this game and its world was well worth not knowing what to do often times."

,Recommended,400630,33451059,Posted: 11 July,all,Fauxy,"Wuppois a feel-good game. It's the kind of game kids should grow up with, look back at, and feel nostalgia for. It's a metroidvania-esque 2D shooter with adventure and bullet hell elements in a mostly civilized world inhabited by charming creatures with a surprisingly well thought-out lore. For the detail oriented: a playthrough was 13 hours for me, the game is about 50/50 story to boss fights, and there's really nothing similar to RPG elements (other than the strong story) despite what people say. Honestly if you like the look of it, it's worth buying. If you're not convinced, try the demo.I feel like, the best things aboutWuppo(of which there are many) are best experienced rather than summarized, so I've glossed over those and I'm going to go straight to my gripes. I have a big criticism that has to deal with the game's story, and a minor one that frustrated me endlessly.Story spoilers:I feel like the game missed a real chance to talk in-depth about race problems. I mean it's there, the discussion about ""superior races"" and the subtle ways the wums oppress the other races, the way you're lead to believe the wums basically committed genocide against the fnakkers and that they're proud of it. I'm sure people will say it doesn't fit the tone of the game, that the game did it just fine, or that it doesn't matter but clearly the developers were making some kind of attempt to have the game comment on this. There's so much in the game that's about the races and their differences and the unreliability of one race's narrative over the others (e.g. You never hear what the blussers' characters are like, only that they were the wums gardeners and that they were happy with it. It's only after meeting one and also watching the blusser filmstrips do you understand how wums reduced them to that when their actual ideas and feelings about being gardeners were much more complicated, leading to the reasons they left the garden). I think the devs tried, but there was a real disconnect for me when I saw the fnakkers for the first time and not only were they portrayed as primitive (with African-styled instruments of all things) but their dialogue made them only slightly less violent and cartoonishly evil than what the wums paint them as (not to mention cannibalistic). So ultimately what, the racists who rule the world were right? The people in power should just throw those who oppose them down an endless hole and hope they all die? If anything doesn't fit the tone of the game, I would say it was that likely unintentional conclusion.But what's done is done, and I enjoyed the game irregardless. There's enough breathing room for a potential Wuppo 2, and I hope that if the devs are devoted to the ideas they committed into this game that they'll refine them for another.What I can't forgive was that gotdamn Simon Says music segment right near the end. DO NOT BIND THE NOTE YOU NEED ME TO PLAY TO THE JUMP BUTTON. That's all."

The hand-painted art style is appealing and easy on the eyes, and also does a great job of making whatever needs to stand out from the background do just that. The humor is spot on, and the story is incredible - although most of it doesn't get laid out until the last third of the game. Wuppo is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. One complaint, though: There's a lot of potentially seizure-inducing visuals near the end of the game. An option to switch them off would be nice."

Unfortunately, it's not enough to make it a compelling game. I really wanted to like it. It was clearly made with a lot of heart, but in the end it just fell flat and couldn't hold my interest.One thing that comes up in other reviews is mention of Metroidvania game play. I think this is doing this game a huge disservice because it lacks any of the hallmarks of a Metroidvania game and it's clearly not trying to be one. If these reviews caught your interest, you will be disappointed.I honestly wouldn't recommend Wuppo to anyone I know, so it gets a ""no"" from me. However, I wouldn't outright dismiss the game. It has a strong following, so others must be finding something rewarding that just wasn't doing it for me. Proceed with caution.Pros:Cute art styleGreat soundtrackSome charming interactions with NPCsCons:Pacing. The game is mostly running around empty areas doing small errands with little story, mystery or reward to compel you to move forward. When you do finally reach something interesting, like a boss fight or puzzle, it is easy and short lived, making it ultimately unfulfilling.There are several annoying mechanics, most of which involve waiting. Waiting for the subway in real life can be rewarding. You get to relax, think about things, people watch, etc. Waiting for the subway in a game is just boring.The world is large, but exploration is neither compelling nor rewarding. Moving around the map feels more like a chore than an adventure.The combat is clunky, largely unchallenging and simplistic. I feel like combat could have been left out and the game would have been better for it.The currency used in the game is extremely scarce. I found myself entering survival horror levels of paranoia about spending so I wouldn't miss out on the big upgrade/item. I think this really sucked some of the fun out of the game."

The game also contains a good amount of humor, which will definitely make you laugh. Wuppo contains many different gameplay-elements, so it certainly won't bore you. I'd recommend purchasing it."

,Recommended,400630,31024359,Posted: 8 April,all,syril,"Really great game, I love the little features (this game has a lot) and all the different settings to explore and items to find. Lots of optional dialogue with pretty much all NPCs, found myself speaking to all of them to see what they'd say (maybe because the dialogues are bite-sized and not huge blocks of text). Fun characters and fun and unique story. If you like exploring and also like this games graphics you will probably love this game."
,Recommended,400630,32830491,Posted: 26 June,all,Gitaxian,"Wuppo is a fantastic game. It's an adventure platformer (it plays a lot like metroidvania games, but I wouldn't call it one since you don't need later abilities to get collectibles in earlier areas) with writing on par with games like Paper Mario : The Thousand Year Door."

Knuist & Perzik have created a world full of various creatures and their cities for you to explore:  lots of things to discover, challenging platforming levels, inventive boss fights, and many secrets.At one point, my save game would not load.  I contacted the company, and they quickly responded with a fixed version of my save file.  Top-notch support!"

Characters are great, especially the main character. I was sad when it was over because I wanted more - though the ending was very satisfying. Highly recommend!"

You'll get to know the whole world through your journey, not just the characters and cities but also a unique and charming history of species.  Dialogue is always fun, combat and puzzles are simple but satisfying, and even just waiting around in the game feels fun.  Everything is filled with childlike wonder the whole way through.(Also, this is just my opinion, but try playing with the graphics on their lowest setting.  I feel like that style looks even nicer than the default.)"

In exchange for those frustrations, I got a real sense of adventure and genuine fun just exploring the world. Combat is simple, but the game is challenging without feeling like it is too unfair, if you look at what options you have for your weapons."

The menu is not very intuitive at first but matches the game design so you'll probably get used to it. If you like to discover a very cute universe and find your way around multiple levels, jumping around platform and colect stuff, you'll love this game. Not my type but perhaps i'll try it another time."

I love the boss fights and the gameplay, at first I thought the main story was just to get back to your house, but I was supprised at how it had a whole world you could explore. This games not just a linear platformer, its way more then that and I have to rate this one of my favorite game of all time."
