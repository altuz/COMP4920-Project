,Recommended,400660,18207310,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Terran,"I've always been a fan of Nerdook and his games, so consider me a little bias. Reverse Crawl isn't exactly what it looks like on the surface; The game is more about controlling a group of ""Evil"" minions that grow in strength through your decisions during multiple turn-based battles. After every battle, you get a choice to upgrade a specific area of your strengths; This could be making your Skeleton Minions deal more damage, or one of your more powerful creatures to gain a new ability. The Campaign is about three solid hours, give or take, and there are no real penalties for losing a ""Mission"". Every step gives you a choice of up to 3 different pathways, save for explicit encounters, and you can grow in strength depending on what you choose.Missions vary from taking down a Hero to gain more XP, to ambushing Merchants for loot and special upgrades, or enslaving/saving evil guys from the good guys. There's a LOT of variety and strategy, with every upgrade providing a unique and interesting ability that you can play around with. The difficulty is so-so; I didn't have any real troubles during the campaign, but I'm used to Nerdook's style of gameplay. After beating the campaign, you unlock New Game+ mode as well as Endless Mode, which becomes more or less a dungeon crawl.If you enjoy turn-based RPGs that let you continuously grow more powerful, as well as enjoying cute (if amateur) art, then you can't go wrong with Reverse Crawl. I suggest that you go to a flash site (e.g Kongregate) to play some of his older games, like Dungeons of Kong, Cat God vs Sun King, Deadly Neighbours and more. They're all free and can give you a good example of his abilities. Still, for $5 Reverse Crawl is a steal. I can see myself playing over and over again in the future, and making new, fun decisions.I don't review often, but this game was a day-one buy for me, so I give it my all-star 10/10 rating. I hope that you enjoy the game, Nerdook is a great guy."

It's a turn based combat game which although cute, is little more than a process of clicking on the enemy and watching it's health bar drop.

It's basic strategy elements have been done before, but the replayability does get boosted with the ability to grab skills based on the missions you take on. There's an element of strategy that's present here in the way that you grab minions and their specific strategies and weaknesses they have against each other. It's not going to stick around long, while there is some replayability, it's too simple at the surface, and the game isn't too complicated in the end. But it's solid for a cheap price, and has a couple of cheesy moments to help make the game a little bit more out there in the end. There will be a bug here and there, and it's not the most visually appealing game out there, but it does the job where it needs to in its gameplay.Gameplay Footage and Video Review:https://youtu.be/w_N_4mjAexgLists:+:Core tactics are reasonable for the price, especially considering the idea of replayability and the different traits that you can take.Good introduction to basis strategy mechanics. Not too complicated, but complicated enough to cause you to actual attempt toStory moments have groan inducing humor, but honestly that is a plus in my book as it did get a laugh or two out of me.Do like the randomization elements in there, even if they may be imbalanced over time.Seems reasonable for the price that it's going for.Visuals do have a certain charm to them in the end.-:Veterans of the tactics genre won't find enough here to keep them entertained over a long period of time.The music does get repetitive after a while, even if I wasn't necessarily expecting that much out of it.Main campaign is short despite replayability.A bug here and there. In particular, certain character specific events can cause unmovable states due to not being able to select any more minions."

Enemies, oh i'm sorry, ""good guys"" come in waves and we as the ""badguys"" must deploy our waves to kill them.Unfortunately It gets really repetitive really fast and I know why.The game uses a hex grid system like Heroes of Might & Magic games so while fights should be tactical and played smartly, the AI doesn't offer a great challenge so often you are just clickling through waves.Its a shame really as its a nice twist on the usual wave fighter game since you must pick a unit type, such as archers and fend of various waves until you win or that group dies and then you select your next unit type. I feel the system would be very good in a PvP game but I don't know if there would be enough public interest to warrant a PvP mode/standalone game which is a bit of a shame.I also feel the game wouldn't be so bad if the game as a whole didn't feel so uninspired, it isn't bad but it feels bland and devoid of charm. It doesn't offend you but doesn't entice you either.The concept itself is original in that when your party/squad/wave gets wiped out, you have reserves. Thats the only original idea though, everything else is a forgettable reprint RPG Grindfest.I liked Vertical Drop Heroes (By the same developer) but that also suffered from a lack of life and charm too although the co-op was fun so I find myself going back to play it every now and again.http://store.steampowered.com/app/311480/I'm not sure what could save this game really, but I know this game will divide opinions.If you've never played any of the Heroes of Might & Magic games then I imagine you will really enjoy this game, or Braveland.http://store.steampowered.com/app/285800/Also on the plus side its not another ""free to play"" game, so there is that.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

The description makes it sound like you are the bad guys and are killing the heroes... this is not accurate. Yes, your closest companion is undead but you were the ones attacked by some not-so-nice people with less than benelovent goals.I guess developers are scared to make you play an evil role, despite some success with things like dungeon seige and overlord. I came into this game hoping for some evil role play, but got none of it. There are a couple of choices that are ""bad"" but nowhere near as much as I wished.Well it's got some stategy to it, and some lighthearted humor - if I had kids I'd say I would let them play this though it might be difficult for really young ones to understand the strategy elements but there really is no losing in the game as far as I know - you just restart the battle and they are pretty quick so no stressing about dying as much. I prefer casual games myself so I liked it, though I know some people will whine about it being not permadeath or something.Anyway the pictures showcase the game pretty well in this case."

Actually it just means you control the ˜bad guys ˜ or the minions of the dungeon that was invaded. You do not control any enviromental features.I would resume this game as progressing through stages of good and fun turn based strategy battles. With RPG elements: during and after every battle you get XP which you can use to unlock new units , buy new spells, etc.Main Pros:- Simple yet nice graphics that work fine;- Almost casual in the meaning that mechanics are easy and fast to learn and you dont need to go through a lot of stuff , set up or story in order to get the actual battles started;- Yet strategic enough that you have a kind of rock , paper and scissors that makes sense and does a lot of difference in the outcome of the battles. Choice and a little thinking , planing and experiment does matter.Main Cons:- Highlighted ˜you are the dungeon˜ feature will not translate well for most ( if not all people ) , so make sure you are aware of what this is before getting the game- A little bit short , with limited yet present replayability"

Highly recommended for fans of turn-based strategy.Long version: I bought this game on sale for under $4, hoping to have some fun with it.   I got every achievement quite some time ago, and I still play this, a lot.  It is far more fun than I expected for that price.   You can get all of the achievements in just a few plays, but there is no need to rush.Pluses: addictive turn-based strategy fun, multiple effective strategies available, many cool units to choose from, great buffing options, endless mode, very replayable.   Also, the princess reminds me of my daughter, because she is so adorable.Negatives: One runthrough is a bit short.    Also, there is one fight in the middle of the campaign that cannot be beaten.This is for story purposes, but it is still annoying, especially since you are forced to take a choice of three penalties for losing.  The fact that I keep coming back and playing through the game despite knowing that this is in it is a testament to just how addictive the gameplay is."

It claims you are the dungeon, spawning minions to prevent pesky heroes from exploring it. That's not the case at all. You are in control of a mage that can spawn the typical dungeon enemies (skeletons, zombies, giant rats, etc), but you aren't controlling a dungeon. You fight in various locations against enemies that are just called heroes. I was very disappointed by the game once I started playing.You might manage 3 hours of playtime on your first run. It took me about 7.5 hours to get all of the achievements which required 2.5 runs through the game due to certain choices you make through the campaign.I bought the game on sale and still feel like it's not worth your time."

You now must use various undead and other minions/monsters in battle to get new powers, new allioes, andgain stength to defeat her and reclaim your kingdom. The story does nothing that will really surprise you, but I liked it. It got me from point A to B and gave motivation to what I was doing.Battle is performed in waves, both of your enemies and allies. They have X number of waves, usually around 3 (but it goes 1-5) and you have a few waves yourself. Your team will consist of premade groups of certain monsters that have their own strengths and weaknesses. Each type of unit has their own set of powers, but you also have a bar of spells that may be used on any units turn in addition to their normal actions. These can be direct damage, summons, heals, stunning, and so on. So while I say the battles are ""simple"" there is a good range of various actions you can take every time given the resources. The battles are pretty well balanced, though I hate the Alchemists.I beat the main campaign in 4 hours, which to me is fine for the asking price.There's an Endless Wave mode, and a New Game+ mode I can choose now. When going through the campaign you pick from 3 different power-ups to gain new ally groups, buff existing groups, or gain new powers, and there's an upgrade screen as well for various buffs to your team, so I imagine going through the campaign again will allow me to focus on different areas, and use other groups I didn't use much in my first play through.I don't quite get the tag ""You are the dungeon"" since I never got my own dungeon, didn't get to set traps for heros by luring them with treasure or evil deeds etc..

76561198011604006,Recommended,400660,23445629,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Saboth,"Reverse Crawl is a bit difficult to explain. You choose a level that will reward you with something like more abilities or different troops. You then fight several battles attempting to reach your goal (such as defeat the Spider Queen). You'll be given a selection of troops (randomly chosen, but you can reroll several times for better options). So in a battle, the enemy might start off with 3 troops that have heavy armor. So you'll want to choose some troops that stack up well against those, perhaps that do magic damage. If your troops wins against those 3 enemies, another batch of enemies appear. You'll try and defeat as many of these (your troops are still weary and worn down from the first fight), before dying. If your troops are defeated, you can bring in a set of fresh troops that you'll want to counter these new enemies. So it's small strategy battles.  You get exp after each battle to level up your skills, so you can choose to make your melee stronger, or range stronger, etc. It's a fun little game that is a few hours long, but it does have replay value, because you can choose to select different spells, troops and level ups the next time you play. It's a good game to pop into, play 1-2 battles for 10-15 minutes then come back later to play again. The graphics are simple but adequate. The music and sound effects are good (wish there was a volume control though, as they seem very loud).  All-in-all, a pretty good simple but fun and addictive strategy game."

I'm always so excited to start playing it and have to pry myself away each time in order to stop playing it. It's so much fun. I really didn't think I'd like it near as much as I actually do. I'm so glad I bought it now. It's so worth the money. They make the game simple to understand and pick up, challenging enough to make you keep coming back, and engaging enough to encourage you to to keep playing and trying if you don't win a certain quest the first time around. It's everything I typically want within a turn based strategy and I have a good grasp on what I want since I grew up playing these kind of games. The only two minor critiques I can give on this game is that on the ""Endless"" option it gives at the end, I wish it allowed you to send out one of each group you've picked up along the way to make it even more endless versus the 3 or 4 waves (can't remember which one it is right now) they give you. The other critique is I wish that they allowed more power options after each quest. That would be especially helpful when going for a certain theme as I'm currently trying to go with a Necromancy theme as much as possible on my current run through of the game. I feel like they should allow one option for each catagory of powers (Necromancy, Saboteur, etc.) each time. Other than that, it's a fantastic game. This is definitely a game I will be encouraging and even begging my friends to play (I've already started begging one of my friends to do so). As far as everyone else is concerned, if you love to play turned based strategies but don't want to lose your life over a game, don't buy this game.

A lot of games have mechanics like this, and a lot of them play the same. This one is full of strategy and meanful and sometimes tough choices. The Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanic with units in games like this is a common trope -- but in this game it shines because there are plenty of different options, certain things trump others for obvious reasons and others for not so obvious, the choice of powers and upgrades over the course of a campaign is meaningful... I always wanted to fight one more battle. A single playthrough won't reveal every power, or even every unit -- there is depth and replayability here. I'll also say, that subjectively -- the anime art style is not my favorite... and that was NOT an obstacle to me enjoying the game a whole lot. If you actually LIKE the chibi/anime/whatever japanime style that comes with the narrative it could only be a better buy. The story is also very interesting and compelling -- for what it is, the characters are fun and relatable and you'll start to have favorites. Almost every battle can introduce new allies or enemies, which was constantly satisfying. I have seen games like this that fall flat on their faces... this one does a friggin' HEADSTAND.

However, let me say that the game is not what I expected, this is not a bad thing. I was expecting a game where I would have a dungeon with levels and I was trying to prevent heroes from getting my treasure, this is not the type of game this is. Rather, it is a story that follows you and your necromancer daughter as you attempt to overthrow a kingdom. The game allows you to make decisions that affect how the game works, there are decisions that affect the ending and there are ""skills"" that buff your minions, maybe give them extra health, or give you a sword that increases crit chance. Very short game, can be beat in about 2 hours. If you're looking for a game you can easily 100% it's this one. It requires 3 playthroughs to to get it, so about 6 hours for the 100%. None of the achievements are really missable, they just can only be accomplished once per playthrough. One of them is kind of misleading due to the name, so I had to put an additional 2 playthroughs in to get it, however the game is very enjoyable, each playthrough yields a new experience so I didn't mind.TLDR: Great game, I reccomend it, easy to 100% for all you achievement hunters out there.

Maybe a ""Wicked"" like view from the evil overlord of a story centered around a hero and their band, an ""off-center"" story if you will. I got the general concept of ""pcik your wave's specialty"" and honestly expected a wave/dungeon builder with a similar feel to Hand of Fate.So in short this game wasn't much of what I expected.That said it was fun. I don't really know why or what interested me so much, but the waves of tile-based combat held my attention. I enjoyed improving my waves of minions even though it felt like there were a few I never or almost never used, and while the story was light I paid attention enough to get through the end.

The way the quests, rewards, and battle setup is arranged feels tight and rewarding. All the way down to the mobs and even the skill system.Lots of room to make your own decisions on what main combatants to focus on (e.g. undead, beasts) and also which to unlock via the quest system. Often I wouldn't know exactly what units I would be getting from quests (like obtaining the book of flesh unlocks a flesh golem unit), so I wish that was more explicitly stated, but I had enough of an idea when choosing the quest to guess what I may get out of it.Music is whimsical and funny enough reminds me of Plants vs Zombies.Sound effects are gratifying and appropriate.Lots of things to do post game with endless mode and NG+ if you want to flesh out your creature list and skill upgrades.NEUTRALEaryl game clerics made me wary to ever build up undead units or skills so I ended up putting a lot of points into beasts. Never got to use the main character's unit much in the game which was a shame.Art is one of the weaker points, but is still fine overall. This and the UI are the two areas I'd recommend polishing if a sequel was planned.SUMMARYTrue to its name you do build up an evil army to overtake the heroes and reclaim your name.

This game is purely a simple casual turn based combat game.That being said I actually enjoyed the crap out of this game, it has a simple kind of charm to it.Technicals: The graphics are nothing special, 720p stretched out and locked at 30fps but it isn't too big of a deal considering the kind of game it is. Options are also limited, only toggles for fullscreen, sfx, and music.Gameplay: The combat mechanics of this game are nice and simple but do the job very well, the idea is you select a dungeon and then you get entered into a combat hex-grid. You and your enemy each deploy a squad of units to battle each other, your squads are premade and can only be used once per dungeon. Each squad is designed to counter certain units and is weak to other units. I.e. Skeleton Archers are very effective vs. armored units or units with the dodge ability but are weak to regular melee units that simply have a lot of hp or units with holy attacks. These squads also get randomised debuffs and buffs and you can reroll your choices 3x per dungeon (once you unlock enough groups they won't fit on your 8 choices and you can also reroll to get the group you want to). You each have a limited number of lives (times you can choose a group) and once someone has exhausted it they lose. When you lose you can simply start over, when you win you get a choice between 3 rewards which will sometimes affect the plot or open up other dungeons.There is also a spellcasting mechanic that uses threat, essentially mana in a bar that fills up to 25. As you kill enemies you get threat, some units/buffs also generate threat. The spells will increase in cost when you use them during a single matchup, once one of the two groups has died all the values reset again for the next matchup (there is also a quest reward you can choose in the course of the game that lets you cast without cost increase and I full recommend taking it).Zone control is also present which is the only real way of blocking units from passing through directly to your range units (there is no collision so if the enemy has a large enough movement range they can go right on through), at the beginning of a turn if a unit is standing next to an enemy it's movement is limited. For a melee unit that means only being able to move one tile that turn, for a range unit it means they can't move at all that turn and can only shoot at an adjacent enemy (or guard of course).  That is pretty much all you need to know about combat.Plot: It's a nice and simple plot, without spoiling too much: You are the ruler of a land, baddies come in and slaughter everyone, you are reanimated alongside your army and you try to take the kingdom back. It's not a plot heavy thing, very light with a kind of straight-man thing going on sometimes and there are some fun little bits.The game's length runs 25 dungeons with little bits of plot, some of these dungeons are your choice while others are required at set points. There are a total of 3 final battles/endings which change depending on a choice you make in the previous dungeon.A playthrough lasts about 2 hours and I had a lot of fun with it. It's probably got 3 playthroughs in it if you want to try all the endings and middle choices. That being said that's about all the gameplay you will get out of it. There's no multiplayer and the game gets really easy once you develope a solid strategy. The lack of any real punishment for losing also means you can hammer away until you win which is a bit of a disappointment for me, if choices meant more and losing could eventually damage my army to the point where doing a full playthrough isn't possible every time then it'd certainly make things a lot more interesting.Definitely recommend this game to anybody who likes turn-based combat. Do not recommend to those who want a dungeon management game or a dungeon crawler. The only ""reverse"" parts of this game are that you are using units that are traditionally bad guys and that you start on the right instead of the left."

I'm not even sure if there is an actual dungeon. Nor are you reverse crawling in any sense of the word. It's just regular crawling. Defeat enemies, acquire upgrades, rinse, repeat. I assume the name and box blurb are artifacts from an earlier development phase. They meant to make a reverse crawl but it slowly became a regular RPG, without the developer noticing.It's not a very innovative game at any rate. I'm here because Extra Credits was fawning over the game and I honestly don't see what they were on about. Only the quirks of design and art style do anything to set it apart from similar entries in the genre. While I'm busy nitpicking, the game is also short. That's partially the point, you're supposed to play multiple times. But it's missing a DLC or something. I wouldn't mind a bunch more quests, a few dozen more traits and rewards, maybe some new lategame mechanics to play with.There is still much to like about the game, as other reviewers point out. There's plenty of monster/enemy variety and numerous gameplay mechanics to master, enough to last you at least 2-3 playthroughs. If a DLC comes out I'll definitely buy it. For 3 euros this was an absolute steal, one of my best price/value purchases in recent years."

It's quite similar to the Braveland games if you've played them, except with much more branching and variability to the campaign, and more strategy involved for each encounter.Story is simple enough fare.  You're a King, slain by an invading army from the North, headed by a less than pleasant Queen.  Resurrected by your necromancy-practising daughter, you set out to expand your army and take back your throne.You start out with a limited amount of undead minions to choose from, and over time, and depending on which quests you undertake, your evil henchmen army can grow and become quite varied.  Everything from Giant rats and bats, to zombies, goblins, frost elementals, dark elves, and then some!  Each unit has their own skills and specialties, combined with a random trait that is assigned every encounter (and can be varied further by ""rerolling"" your squad to vary the available units and traits, though this is limited to 3x per encounter).  All in all this means a fair bit of thought must be applied to the later battles.One issue for me though was once I obtained a Spider Queen I pretty much steamrolled the middle couple of hours of the game before the challenge came back at the end.The art style also deserves a special note, that alone was most of the motivation for getting this on a whim.To sum up, if you're looking for something simple in a fantasy setting that has a fast-paced flow and enjoy the juxtaposition of cute visuals with the dark and demonic, you simply must snap this up."

It does have New Game +, which is very good, since it gives it some replay value.Since you have some choice in what missions and upgrades to take, and which ones not to, there is some replayability, but you'll end up doing a lot of the same missions, New Game + is a bit lackluster.

The interesting decision making on how you will choose to build up your army and what you'll specialize in is still there however, as you have a number of missions to choose one from between each mission and each gives you a choice of multiple relevant (and meaty) rewards.It took me about 4 hours to clear the game for the first time, but I consider that a pro rather than a con as in that time I probably had 20 or so fun and satisfying battles with enough interesting choices to keep me thoroughly engaged.  The fact that you don't have time to try all the missions (or what they unlock) the first time around also gives a lot of replayability to the experience if that's your cup of tea with the usual new game+ and endless modes available after you complete the game.The humorous style and fairly light-hearted plot fits this time window nicely as well, and it's a nice game to finish in a single sitting on a day off.Overall, it’s definitely worth a purchase and playthrough.

I only have 2 complaints.  1) very short, beat it in an afternoon.  2) Some of the units you pick up later are very over powered and make the game very easy.Other than that, this game is very fun and totally worth it if you can get it on sale."

Not a lot here that's new, but the art style works for me, the interface was polished, and the music surprisingly good for this style of game.Short and linear, but amusing. Worth picking up on a sale."

Funny characters, charming artwork, and decent replayability. Took me 3 hours to play through. Totally worth the money the creator is asking for it."
76561198141830708,Recommended,400660,29025610,Posted: 4 January,all,Jake Badlands,"Fun game. Witty writing and great dialog. A short (4-6 hours) turn based stategy well worth the time you put in. Grid click and move, with a lot of combinations of monster groups/traits/abilities at your disposal. Worth the full price but I'd say wishlist it since it seems to go on sale often. Def play if you've and itch for a light, fun, tactics game."
76561198012708817,Recommended,400660,29149793,Posted: 9 January,all,SubText,Recommended if you like fantasy and turn based strategy.  Game plays in about 4 to 5 hours and is well priced considering the length - if you get it on sale so much the better.Overall two thumbs up.

Just finished my second play through of the campaign. The randomization of the skills and weaknesses makes it fun.Pick it up. If it goes on sale.. pick it up."
76561197979379723,Recommended,400660,28911566,Posted: 1 January,all,wolff,"I picked this up as an impulse buy on sale, and I was delighted.  Fun turn-based brawler where you'll spend most of your time in hex-based fighting without much terrain.  Story is cute, art is totally fun, and it was just the right length for the complexity (which is admittedly on the short side).  As these sorts of games go, it's not too hard, and has a lot of variety of powers and units."

This is a GREAT game that is very absorbing even as it can be picked up and put down.  The graphics are adorable, the interface is fluid, intuitive, and clear, and the gameplay has a good amount of depth although it's true that there are some minor balance issues between different minion groups.  (I usually end up playing revenant, wolves, rats, violet's, or greybeard, or maaybe bonehead, unless I'm just futzing around.)  Most of all the game is FAIR.  The enemies run on the exact same rules that you do.  I do not understand the ""RNG"" criticisms; my experience has been that all mechanics are even.  Overall:  a perfect game if you have a trip or just want something distracting and more casual.  Worth more than its price."

76561197979299941,Recommended,400660,29751448,Posted: 6 February,all,OneOhm,"This is a lot more fun than I expected it to be.  I love the turn based combat, and the way that you can level up the characters you bring into combat with you.  But where the real fun comes in is that each mission has different enemies that you need to plan who you fight with in that level.Add to that a great story line that (while cheesy) engages you in the quest.  The storyline is worth the price of admission here, I would like to see other games in this same universe as well."
