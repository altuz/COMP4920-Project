76561198048974498,Not Recommended,400740,18291776,"Posted: 2 October, 2015",all,rjmacready,"This brand-spanking-new horror game was apparently made on some program called GameGuru (""the easy game maker"").  It proudly tells me this on the menu screen.  And I have to say, on the strength of this product, should I ever decide to join the glut of people currently making cheap-arsed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horror product in their bedrooms...I might make it a point to avoid GameGuru like the plague.  I also might not opt to make and release a game, especially for money, until I confirm that I:  a. Have some actual talent making games, and b. Have some remotely worthwhile ideas to fill said game with.  Luckily for all of us, Mamedov Yuriy has no such hesitations.  He/she/they have made a game, and while it starts promisingly enough in the first few minutes - in which you run down a dirt track through some admittedly lovely scenery - it's all pretty much downhill once you actually reach a large, spooky, asylum-like building and step inside.In VERGE:Lost chapter - that's precisely how it's written, so for reasons of aesthetic purity, I shall keep it that way - you play a small, kangaroo-like creature (a wallaby, perhaps?) who hops along the corridors of said spooky building, goes through lots of doors, and triggers an excruciatingly long load screen approximately once every thirty-seven seconds.  That's when you are not enduring excruciatingly long text screens which, in addition to scrolling by at the speed of darkness, CANNOT BE SKIPPED, at least as best as I can tell.  Oh, and did I mention that you CANNOT SAVE at any point of the game, be it manually or by way of predetermined checkpoints...in spite of the fact that you'll basically be requiring a ""primal scream break"" every ten minutes or so, lest you put a FIST THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN?!Now, none of this is to say that there's absolutely NO redeeming features to this game.  Some of the sound is actually rather effective - emphasis on the word SOME - and some - again, SOME - of the graphics aren't too bad (well, some of the outdoor graphics anyway; the interiors are pretty much uniformly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Other than that, the painfully slow and vertigo-inducing movement basically led me to pack this one in before I'd even so much as laid eyes on a monster, though a quick glance at the trailer on the Store page assures me that I didn't miss out on much.Y'know, when I was a young'un, I wasted an awful lot of my time and money watching almost every ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-budget horror movie I could lay my hands on.  Nowadays, I'm relieved to report that I only waste similar amounts of time and money playing every ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-budget horror GAME I can lay my hands on.  Hey...waitaminute...th-that's not any kind of PROGRESS, is it?  God preserve me...WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!Verdict: 2.5/10."

It's slow and clunky; ugly graphics with awful loading times and not to mention dialogue riddled with grammar problems and typos. There's nothing scary about this. It's just slowly meandering down one bland 'scary' set piece to the next with no goal or focus. I couldn't even finish the game since the door I was supposed to go through at one point ended up being an invisible wall. There wasn't even a way to save.

Having said this I wanted to voice my opinion to aid anyone interested in this title. I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it. ""VERGE"" is incredibly short just as the previous game ""My Bones"" I played from this developer. I completed it with both alternate conclusions in maybe fifteen minutes. Although there are not as many bugs and grammatical errors. The ""Demon"" does actually work in this game.Again from an artistic stand point I can appreciate what the developer was trying to achieve, but this alone doesn't justify a price tag of any kind. This should be offered as a free experience for the casual and curious. I paid ninety nine cents for this download, and while this amount is inconsequential, it is unmerited. A basic ""Copy & Paste"" review for this dev's second game. Though I do wish them luck with future projects as they continue to learn.-A short review, for a short title-"
,Not Recommended,400740,24131944,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,peremptor,Features:-Multiple endings (best ending is idling to get your card drops)-High quality graphics (A sight to see)-Tense atmosphere of fear (If you fear boredom then yes... this game will be quite frightening)-No cheap jump scares (Not anything really)-High quality audio support. (Deaf people rejoice)-Simple but enjoyable gameplay. (No gameplay that's enjoyable)One of those games that even if they paid you to play would be considered a horrible waste of time.
,Not Recommended,400740,29811854,Posted: 9 February,all,Snort Cannon,"VERGE: Lost chapter is yet another horror masterpiece by GDNomad and this is probably his worst game yet. Why is Valve allowing this garbage on steam is something I will never know.The Story:VERGE at least has a somewhat understandable story. You are playing as a man who's car breaks down and you go on foot to look for help, but you stumble across an abandoned asylum and you venture inside (Not the brightest bulb in the shed if you ask me).Sadly however even though the story is somewhat easier to follow than the other games by mister Nomad, this game has every cliche from his other games, making it the same as every other game he has made which at this point is an absolute joke.Gameplay:If you played any other games by GDNomad guess what ? IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME. It's a walking simulator where you look for keys and read notes and wow it's absolutely horrendous. This game is probably the worst looking game, which doesn't help with the style of Nomads games. The textures all blend in together to make a massive blob which is hard to look for something when you need it in a dire situation.The game also has something that really annoyed the living hell out of me and that's how buggy the entire gameplay is. When you pass through a door there's a massive chance it will not let you pass. Instead what you have to do is go to the menu and lower the settings and then you can pass the door, great huh ?Graphics and Audio:Graphically the game looks absolutely disgusting even on the high settings, not to mention the texture problems and the lighting makes some of the segments nearly impossible. In one of the segments you enter a maze and the problems with the textures blended everything together making it next to impossible to understand where you're going.Audio is also really bad. The mixing is horrendous and it hurts your ears once you enter the penultimate part of the game, not to mention the stock sounds of the wind are absolutely horrendous.The Good:Again there's absolutely nothing good about this game. It's horrendous and just shows that GDNomad is just pumping these games out to make a quick buck and nothing more. Everything is present from his previous games. Bugs, Horrible english, short.Length:The game is no longer than 30 minutes. Every game by mister Nomad is around 30 minutes long, but this game however has two endings. Both of them absolutely terrible and if you know what you're doing and if you really care enough to finish it twice to get both of the endings it will take you around 40 minutes as nothing changes.Closing Remarks:VERGE: Lost chapter is so far the worst game by GDNomad. It's buggy, it's boring, not even remotely scary, it's just a waste of the hard earned money you go and bust your♥♥♥♥♥off making. If I hadn't made it clear you should stay away from this dev as every game he makes is pure trash and is not worth a single penny.Final Rating:1/10Pros:N/ACons:- Even buggier than his other games- Broken English- If you read my previous reviews of Nomads games every point applies here as every game is pretty much the same"

Only additions are found in 'quotation marks'.GD Nomad is known as a One Hit Wonder and though he has currently 7 games on offer, not one of them has ever developed an overall thumbs up impression. This is because if you have played one of his games, then you have pretty much played them all. This game is pretty much exactly the same as 'white mirror', just change the title and change the chasing 'mud monster' to 'scary spice' and you have exactly the same game.Each game requires you to enter an establishment, usually a 'building', go down 'somewhere dark' where you will be treated to comical un-scary whisperings, a npc will often appear somewhere and chase you for '30' seconds, you then have to solve a puzzle using 'E' keys because that's all his skill in programming allows. A poorly translated supernatural story about an 'asylum' which produces what I can only describe as a 'scary floating girl demanding love'?This is probably his 'better' work which is really not saying much as the 'only improvement is that it doesn't crash after every chapter'.Like the developer instead of putting in any real work in future, I'll just copy and paste my review and change its title...Tips for developer: Retire!!!

There are no redeeming factors here whatsoever, let alone any horror.I should have known after playing My Bones that this would be terrible but I seem to be a glutton for punishment.  I thought maybe, just maybe the developer would have built on the initial game which showed some promise under the layers of terrible design choices.At least this time round, whilst still terrible, the text in the notes lying around is at least on a par with a 12 year old text messages, as opposed to the gobbledegook of My Bones.  Good luck trying to find all of it.  For some reason the developer thought it would be a good idea to put the writing literally on the walls, only the walls were white and the text was a slightly brighter shade of white.  But no matter as it's not worth hunting down, the story makes absolutely no sense.  Something about an asylum and an experiment involving children and how one of them becomes superpowered and then rages out of control  Then there are clowns for some reason.Technical flaws are abundant.  The game lags so hard and is so badly optimised, yet still looks like absolute crap for this day and age.Then there's the door issue, which is seemingly the only thing you can interact with in this game.  You open the door, it swings wide open, but you can't cross the threshold until the door has completed its opening animation which takes several seconds too long.  Absolutely ridiculous, and the developer thought the best way to draw attention to this was to throw a few doors in during the game's only chase sequence.  It's beyond laughable.Then there's an odd ""choose your ending"" thing at the very end for some bizarre reason, which was basically about making a choice between a cozy bed or an electric chair watched over by an ominous looking clown.None of this game made any sense whatsoever.  And at the end, spoiler alert, and this seemed like the developer was actually just trying to insult your intelligence, as if playing the game wasn't enough of a torture, but in the ending epilgoue text, it talks about how after you escape from the asylum you run to your car and drive away as fast as possible.  The only reason you wandered into the asylum in the first place was because your car broke down!!!Avoid like the plague."

Unfortunately, the Steam audience is brutal and hard to please. For the price of an apple (while the game is on sale), I had some quick fun in between the more expensive games.Here are a few tips on what could have been improved:- the text that is supposed to be written on the walls is a bit in front of the walls (in the hospital room at least)- on highest settings, the text on the walls shines- please let us either speed up the scrollable text or skip it, by holding a key- no shadows from the flashlight, it breaks the atmosphere a bit- if the player started to move while opening the door, he cannot pass the door after they open, only after a few seconds- the player can pass through the doors after they are open - I suppose they are not a solid object, just a textured model- walled in windows in a corridor, that would have lead to a room?Don't get discouraged and keep making new games, it's fun."

That engine does not have the same power as more popular engines like Unity or Unreal. So going into this game I knew the capabilities of the engine and what it had to offer. I also have some experience with Game Guru and its previous versions when it was called FPS Creator. Now with that said and out of the way I really enjoyed this experience. The first thing that struck me was the graphics. Yes, Game Guru does not feature the best graphics on the market but I was surprised at how good this looked at Game Guru standards. It created a great atmosphere and got me sucked into the game. The second thing was the sound design. The placement of sound effects and music were placed at perfect times to give the jump scares an authentic feel rather than cheap. Overall I really enjoyed this coming from a fellow Game Guru user and for $2 I would say give it a try."
