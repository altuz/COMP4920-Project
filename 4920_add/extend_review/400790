Sure, that may sound over-the-top or superfluous in praise, but it's TRUE. The game itself is fun, the controls are surprisingly accurate, the difficulty is appropriate to which one you select...but it's more than just that. Bad day? Shoot some veggies. Great day? Celebrate by shooting some veggies. Bored? Shoot some veggies. Each level is different enough to keep you interested. BEST OF ALL...is the developers. Yes, for just a Dollar, I have found through personal experience that this game's developers give service above-and-beyond, and better than ANY developers whose game's prices cost you your first-born and ignore or take personally any complaint you have. I had troubles, at first, getting the game to work, and these developers took personal interest EVERY DAY until they helped solve my issue, and were polite, and shared in both my worry AND my joy once the issue was fixed...and ALL THIS happiness, fun and personal joy for one dollar. I cannot think of ANY other time IN MY LIFE I had this much value for such a reasonable price. So yes, I recommend this game on several levels, and offer the highest praise possible for value inestably higher than the price offered. By all means, GET THIS GAME!! Enjoy life as a result! :)"

It was a stressfull way to spend over 2 hours of my life but it was fun. I never thought i would ever scream ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥there are too many pears"" and meant it. It is 100% worth it if you can get it for less than $1. I found this game to be more fun than a lot of shooters. So basically, buy it, its pretty great."

Store has weapon, fence (shield), grenade upgrades bought from the money you earn clearing the levels.Controls are simple; left mouse button to shoot, right to throw grenades, and middle button to switch to different gun types, or can use keyboard counterparts. Personally I use mouse buttons to shoot and throw grenades and space bar to switch weapons.So really, the controls are kept clean and simple. Lots of things to shoot at. Sensible upgrades, level achievements, leaderboard, story mode between levels. It's a complete package for a casual shooter, and at this price, as casual to buy as it is to play."

You feel immersed in the game play for the entire game with stunning cutscene and animation. The graphics are the best you could ask for, Battlefront's graphics are inferior to these graphics.

For this, he goes to a lab and get a potion, he uses the potion on the fruits and it works, but they became killing fruits.Each chapter is a series of shooting galleries where you blast your misguided produce to earn coins, power-ups, and juice (as the title itself indicates). Each stage ends when you fill up your juice vial. When you finish a level you will get a medal that give you money. After that, you will be sent to a shop where you can upgrade your gun, buy grenades and your fence (wich it works as a shield).The gameplay is just pressing on your mouse button. I can't recommend this game because it's nothing special, quickly becomes boring, and there are really better shooters out there. You can play it, you can have some fun but nothing more than that."
