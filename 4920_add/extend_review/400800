Once you get used to it, you will find the MXGP physics are actually better IMO.It's not stupidly expensive so yeah, its worth the money and its a straight racing game."

How do you feel?THE ENGINE SOUND!!Why cant they get it right? The bike sound needs to be more realistic to run along side the Amazing job they have done with the feel of the riding experience? The game feels great. The reason it dose my head in is that I ride 2 STROKE!! Why do they sound like a 4 stroke? I can live with the 4 stroke engine JUST! & think this could be improved too. I cant play any game without sound? Dont know about you? Please please please go and record some engines then add them to the game?? How can in 2016 this not be possible? just get on a bike, record the sound as it goes around the track and cut the sounds you want. We all know how great motocross bikes sound so add it in the game please. You dont get this with say F1 games do you? How would F1 fanatics feel if the cars sounded like tractors going around the track? The feel is taken away from realisticness.Sorry for the rant guys but it just dose my head in:( Any one else with me? & How do we get them to look at this?"
,Recommended,400800,23742964,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Xtrem,Well after playing the game over 70 hours I can say this is one of the best MX games out there.   If your looking for high flying unrealistic jumping and stunts.... go play MVA Encore.   This is a Motocross game at its core with every control possible that you use in MX Simulator with the reflex control of MVA.   The tracks are pretty good and the A.I. is actually fun to race untill they collide into you taking you out in the dumbest crashes.   I will say the indoor races have no place in this game due to the physics.   The physics are ment for high speed and rough tracks....   So the indoor tracks seem a bit tight and one lined.    Play MX vs ATV Supercross/Encore if your looking for stadium racing.This game is hands down better than the first one.

,Recommended,400800,29049634,Posted: 5 January,all,Hiten,"Alright, so I've played nearly every Milestone motorcycle game since SBK 2001.MXGP2 is at the top of the charts for their development history IMO, right up there with SBK 2001 and 2011.Pros:- Good graphics.- Spot-on physics, better than Reflex.- Great handling, after some practice - and you will need practice...- Excellent ""cockpit"" camera view, very well done.- Third person camera is also good, with adjustable distance (but not angle)- Good career mode, if a bit bare bones. Choose Full Race Weekends, Qual + Double Race, or simply Double Race.- Extra modes like MXoN (Moto-X of Nations), Real Events, etc. are nice.- Bike and rider customization is excellent for the most part.- Lots of settings for assists, but it's better and faster not to use them. Full sim with Pro physics all the way and don't look back.- Rewind and Quick Restart features, both of which can be handy (pro tip: keep rewinds on for AI races, they WILL crash into you on occasion). Definitely handy for the holeshot against a pack of AI.- Lots of tracks, all of them real-world, save the four or so imaginary stadiums which have you doing quasi-Supercross (which is cool).- Fantastic replay system, but unfortunately you cannot save them to view later.- You will spend hours in photo mode getting those photo-realistic screenshots (check mine out for examples). Or not, but it's there if you want to.Cons:- Typical Milestone ""it's barely passable"" bike sounds. There's hope for the future though because RIDE 2 just came out and has the best sounds I've heard so far from a Milestone game so maybe MXGP3 will sound better? Pray with me now to the God of MX...- After whipping or scrubbing you lose air control and have to pray to the aforementioned God of MX that your initial trajectory wasn't garbage.- When making contact with AI riders, there's a 90% chance to dismount you while they drive on. This can be mitigated somewhat by avoiding extra lean (right stick) while turning if other riders are elbow-to-elbow. Since discovering this I can now make light contact without being thrown off.- No triple buffered v-sync. Must use Adaptive V-Sync on Nvidia for a tear-free image without terrible frame drops. Not sure what you could do on an AMD card, except suffer. Direct3D Overrider does NOT work as the game is 64-bit. :(- A few bugs with the Test Track recording lap times, somehow one of my 450s has set a balls-on-fire 9.2 second time on the long track. Seems legit.- Not many, if any at the time, people playing online. Pretty common with bike games unfortunately, but does support private lobbies for you and buddies.- Can save and apply custom bike setups, but in typical Milestone fashion, will not apply them for you automatically come race time. Not a deal-breaker at all, but a constant small annoyance (another issue in all Milestone games).Highly recommended for any and all MX fans. General bike fans will most likely dig it, and other racing fans may as well depending on their taste for realism and motocross. Basically, don't expect to jump on your bike and be fast in this game. Hell, don't expect to make it around your first turn fast and intact until you've got some practice time in. Even then you will get dismounted and ran over by a half dozen or so riders every other holeshot. ;)"

I was expecting a lot more like a game than the game promises and offers. The game also does not offer much the reforms or improvements that usually a new video game might expect.I was expecting also that, the game would have been a multi-profile support which I had hoped the forum of the game for many weeks before the game's release but, it did not come and the game's customization options are pretty non-existent.Changes largely is more visual, which is used for a few 3d model of which is available then only a few color option.If the video game would not have the possibility of customization, so the game would be almost identical at the same video game than an old MXGP game release.The game is the gameplay is completely identical and as a game pretty much the same game as the the old MXGP game release but, just a little updated, as well as the driver list.Sure, this video game developed and reached forward & game is not entirely bad at all but, the game did not offer myself enough new and significant improvement, which is an older game release contain.So, if you happen to own an older release of the game, so I do not recommend necessarily to buy this game but, if you buy a motocross game for the first time, so this is a good choice.I gonna refund this a game, sadly...FIN:Pienen testailun jälkeen peli oli itselleni melkoisen suuri pettymys. Peli tuntui lähes pelkästään vuosi päivitykseltä. Odotin peliltä paljon enemmän kuin mitä lupaukse ja pelin kuva antoi pelistä mutta, peli ei juurikaan tarjonnut niitä mahdollisuuksia joita olisin odottanut peliltä.Peli ei tue moniprofiili tukea jota toivoin foorumissa jo monta viikkoa ennen pelin julkaisua ja pelin kustomointi mahdollisuudet on melkoisen olemattomat.Pääosin muutokset on enemmän visuaalisuutta, joissa käytetään vaan muutamaa 3d mallia josta on tarjolla sitten vain muutama värivaihtoehto.Jos tätä pieniä kustomointi mahdollisuutta ei olisi niin, peli olisi lähes tai suorastaan ihan täysin sama peli kuin aikasempi julkaistu MXGP 1 -peli.Peli on pelattavuus on täysin identtinen ja pelinä aikapitkälti sama peli kuin aikasempi julkaisu mutta, vain vähän päivitetty sekä kuljettaja lista.Toki pelissä on jotakin hyvääkin ja kehittynyt myönteiseen suuntaan mutta, peli ei vaan yksinkertaisesti tarjoa itselleni riittävästi uudistuksia ja erilaisuutta mitä, aikasempi osa jo valmiiksi tarjosi.Jos satut siis omistamaan vanhemman peli julkaisun niin, en suosittele välttämättä ostaa tätä peliä mutta, jos ostat motocross peliä ekaa kertaa niin, tämä on hyvä vaihtoehto.Joudun siis palauttamaan pelin valitettavasti."

And I've played pretty much every MX game going back to excite bike on the NES to having 277 hours in Reflex on the Steam/PC version alone (double that counting time spent on the Xbox 360 version). They really nailed it with physics, gameplay, graphics, and detail. There's so much detail you can even see the welds in the swingarm! I came in expecting just a MXGP1 re-hash with some added tracks but it feels and looks totally overhauled with the exception of sounds which the rest is so good I can almost completely forgive the the sound which falls behind the quality of the rest of the game.But just to be warned, there's a learning curve with the updated physics. Like I said, I was expecting just a re-hash of MXGP and thought my same techniques would all carry over but it turned out to be quite different! And it's all for the better! Now to powerslide corners, or rail the inside line and blast out of the corners ripping you have to utilise the clutch and leaning where as in the first game I almost never had to use the lean much and never used the clutch. The bike has a much softer feel now as well. Gone are the days when it looked and sounded so stiff almost to where you had no suspension when landing or blasting whoops. The suspension has a real plush feel to it now.The replay system is also much improved. You can fast forward and rewind at varying speeds using the RT and LT on a xbox controller. You can really get some sick screenshots with the replay! I can really go on and on about all the improvements and how good the game is, but just take it from someone who used to race in real life and has played nearly every MX game to date going back to the 80's, this is the best one by a long shot! I'm glad to see so many developers of racing games steering more towards realism these days instead of arcade physics and Milestone won't dissapoint you if you're looking for realism! Real tracks, real riders, realistic graphics and handling, what else could you possibly want? Plus for us older guys that used to race for real, this satisfies the MX racing crave but is so much safer, i.e. no broken bones to deal with, lol. Of yea, the MX of Nations mode is another nice added bonus!"

Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays.

The graphics are touched up, the physics were redone, very weird at first but after awhile they are fine. The customization from the career rider stand point was well needed. The stadium series is a major let done as the tracks are far smaller then any mx game that has ""supercross"". The much needed addition of 22 riders was a big thing for me. The only REAL downside for me is that the game appears to have some serious frame rate lag. 20-30 fps while in races and 100fps while in the menus has me a bit concerned but then again that could very well be on my end. I say if you are hoping for a better MXGP then go ahead and purchase. Yeah the price of $50 is a bit concerning but then again the demand for Motocross games is very high. All in all I give it a 7.5/10"

The customization is really good though, only thing I'd of liked to of seen is the ability to pick a custom team photo from your computer. The first person view sucks though which is quite sad since i like playing in first person.Bottom line is it's a good game."

That being said about the physics, there are still some changes to how you drive the bike, like scrubs, weight transfer etc. The new rewind feature is very useful, helps alot when you make a mistake that could cost you the race (I just wish there was a points bonus for not using the rewinds but no biggie). The customization in this game is very detailed, whether it be the riders equipment or the everything about the bike. I love how they setup the career mode, how you can create your own team and make everything look the way you want, or you can join a real team. Presentaion has been improved, all those stupid generic presentations at the end of the race are gone. Graphics look very good, you can definatley see the difference between this years and last years game. This game posts a bigger challenge in the difficulty, which is very good cause i was running circles around the competition in last years game even on the hard and realistic difficulties.

,Recommended,400800,22326634,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Niggi Lauda,"A good step in the right direction! I know that mx games have to be incredibely hard to develop, since there are so many aspects.Here are some things the guys at Milestone can work on for the MXGP 3:- The physics: you can feel that the base of this was taken from MotoGP, and I believe that is a big  mistake since dirt bikes handle completely different than street bikes. There are some very frustrating scenarios where you crash because of no reason. For example, when you try to give someone a blockpass, you'll just always tip over. However, once you get the hang of it (for me this was at like 8 hours in) you can have a lot of fun with it. Not realistic at all, but fun.- The sound: It's horrible. Nothing more to add. The engine sound sounds more like some random noise. No real rev limiter. Just completely in the wrong direction in this department, I can't even find words for it.- Tracks are not rough enough: They are always like the first lap of practice, completely perfectly shaped and pretty boring at times. Lommel is the best example, it's 100% smooth and therefore not Lommel. However I can imagine that rough tracks would be quite hard to ride as well with the poor physics.- No qualification race: Come on Milestone, you could have at least given us the option of having a real weekend with different practices and a qualification race.- Boot models: please make them a little more detailed and add ""height"" to them. They look like painted rubber boots.Buuuuut there are also many good points, like great customisation, good graphics and all the licenses. All in all it's a real fun game and I just listed all negative points that deserve to be worked on for the next game.I actually recommend the game, even if you're not 100% happy with it. But if you don't buy it, they'll stop making mx games as well and soon we won't have any games besides MX SIM which would be a shame, so support the sport!"

,Recommended,400800,29154515,Posted: 9 January,all,Blackout STi,"I am one of the MX vs ATV fans that has been waiting a decade for an upgraded Reflex. MVA Supercross was released, and it was garbage. So, I continued to wait. Then, a friend recommended this game. I checked it out on here, and it looked alright, but I held off on buying this game for awhile (admittedly because it is based on european MX). I didn't think that I would enjoy it, so I waited until the game was on sale.Holy crap, was I suprised! This game is definitely not like the MVA franchise, but it turns out that that may not be a bad thing. Initially, you feel like you are ""on rails"" (can't turn easily). This was annoying, but I persevered. Also, the AI seemed to be ""on rails"" also, and they always seemed to win bar-banging incidents. Yet, I continued to give the game a chance...Ultimately, I discovered the necessity of changing the settings to ""Pro"" and learning how to setup the bike. It just takes practice. Ultimately, I learned how to throw the bike around, scrub and whip, etc. I am happy I gave the game a chance, as I no longer have to play Reflex (thousands of laps on a dozen tracks gets old).If you crank up the settings and difficulty, and learn how to control the bike, this game can be very fun! It is the most realistic MX game out there IMO. That being said, it isn't perfect!Pros:- Realistic physics- Realistic career mode- Real tracks, bikes and riders- Sponsorships in career mode are a cool, immersive feature- 250s are under-powered- Rider customization is greatCons:- Number plate font is GOD AWFUL!!! 'Copperplate Gothic' or some crap like that... It's dated and ugly- worse than 'Impact'- AI take the same EXACT line every lap of every race- always.- You are easily taken out by AI from the outside during cornering (if you don't rewind and go straight during contact)- Ruts do not develop anywhere except AI lines- When riding for a team, you have to wear whatever brand/style of gear their real star rider wears (For example: Red Bull KTM, you have to wear Cairoli's AXO gear in Black/Orange ONLY)- No american tracks (except Glen Helen), which is not a huge deal, but I am not a huge fan of European tracks and the style of riding they require- Scrubbing results in you not being able to lean just before landing (which can force you off the course if you were not pointing straight towards your desired direction during take-off)- Once mastered, the AI are no longer challenging enough (you just win every race, which is no fun)Overall, this game is awsome! You will not regret buying it. Going back, I would've paid the full $50 USD (or whatever) for this when it first came out. If the developers would improve the AI to make them behave as realistically as the rest of the game, this would be the best MX game to date!"

I'm not a motocross person so I can't comment on certain aspects, but I am a lifelong racing game fan, and this gets my thumbs up.No bugs or issues in the time I've played.The only thing I'm not a fan of is the reset tollerence when going off-track. It's pretty variable - some areas you have a fair bit of freedom - and it actually provides for some interesting variation in racing lines, whereas some corners if you're in inch past the post you get insta-reset. I prefer the approach taken in Dirt Rally, personally, it's less jarring."

Harder than it's predecessor.A controller is HIGHLY recommended and you will probably spend the first couple of hours by learning how to ride.But the learning curve is really rewarding. After like 10 races you earn expereince and you'll have enough money to upgrade your ride. In the middle of the season you'll become an average rider and you'll realize that this game does nearly everything right! It's not an arcade chickenshit like (Nail'd, Fuel or Mx Nitro), you should practice, tinker with your bike, find the perfect setups, learn the tracks, the hills, the jumps, and race smart! And if you keep in that way the game will reward you with nice upgrades, new outfits, new bikes, sponsors or even factory team proposals and the great feeling of satisfaction that your hard work was not in vain.No doubt this is one of the best game from Milestone! I'm a speedway fan and don't know much about motocross but I guess it's time to pick up MXGP too after SGP. If a game could make you appreciate and make you a fan of a real motorsport is alone a huge success for the developers and a great marketing value for the sport. MXGP 2 became one of my favourite motorsport sim after Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo and Raceroom."

,Recommended,400800,31738643,Posted: 13 May,all,Tim The Tool Man,"I would like to start, that MXGP2 is the best motorcross game available today. I've logged around 15hours (Some offline) and have no intention of stopping yet. Here's a list of what I think.Pros;-Bike PhysicsThe bikes react almost identical to how they do in real life, and although you cant physically, they feel as if they're weighted correctly-Tracks. All the tracks in game are also almost identical to the real thing.-RacingI love the fact you must practice & qualify for the event, I do however wish there was a hint at the start saying you can skip the 30minutes if you have already made a decent lap time.- Controller support. I can't play this game on KB&M for some reason (my fault not the games) but playing on controller has been seamless so far.-In game creditsSo far one of the best games for making money. At no point have I had to purchase new gear to race faster and not had enough money to do so. Unlike most games which then become pay to play.-Sponsor optionsFantastic if youre say a KTM fanboy and want to race official bikes all day, or if you're like me and want to race your own with a single sponsor you also can.-Suspension Customisation. So far I can really tell when adjusting the suspension based on bike performance. While it's hard to tell if its totally accurate, it seems to have a significant impact somewhat.-CustomisationWOW.I must say this game has an insane amount of customisation both rider and bikes. All official gear as well! probably one of the best aspects of this game in my opinion.-In game tutorialsWhile these aren't perfect, they certainly did help me figure out how to race properly.-GraphicsGiven the fact MXvsATV Supercross Encore came out not long before MXGP2, yet MXGP2 looks about 30 years ahead of it's rival, it is visually beautiful.Cons;-Bike SoundsWTF?definitely the biggest let down of this game. Everything is so accurate and so real, until you hear a bike in game. It honestly sounds like they recoreded someone blowing on the edge of a sheet of paper for the bike sounds.-Bike PhysicsWhile these are in my pro's list for being accurate, when colliding with riders in single player, this certainly isn't the case. So far, I haven't had a single collision with another rider in career where it's caused the other rider to fall off. Instead, I am always falling off. Which has driven me insane. As most of the time it's a gentle tap when cornering and i fall straight off.-RewindWhile this is a great feature, if you rewind slowly, it causes the camera to glitch out and go up to 1km in game away from the rider and has caused my system to crash many a times.-MusicThere is none. just a single ""song"" for the menu and that's it. Makes for a very dull game. While I know this is a professional/realistic game, a soundtrack of sorts would have topped it off.-MultiplayerI know I'm a little late into buying this game, I didn't think I was that late that there would be literally nobody online...-450cc SeatsWhat is up with them? While I understand the use for that style of seats in real life, it would be nice to not have them in game as an option. On the YZ450F they are absolutely hideous and ruins the bikes appeal for me.All in all, I'd have to say this game is atleast8/10. It has been very fun, whilst expencive, still a decent game which I enjoy a lot."

Several swear words and a broken controller later, I have some conclusions.It is great. It's better than the first. The handling is different and at times can seem a touch too sensitive, but once you get used to it, it really is nice. The whips and scrubs are slightly improved. The new layout is a bit add at first, but again, once you get used to it, it's fine.The game runs pretty smoothly, with only a slight hiccup here and there. It is nowhere near as bad as MX vs ATV Encore was (that game did get a decent patch to fix most problems).There are new tracks and some from the previous game have been removed.  Of course, most Americans (like myself) will probably wish there were more US tracks, but this is MXGP after all and not Lucas Oil Nationals. Thankfully Glen Helen is now on the schedule and most of the removed tracks are ones I didn't care much for anyway. The addition of the MXON is nice, although I'm a little disappointed that I cannot use my custom team in it. Oh well, at least I can represent USA and create the ending I would have preferred for last year's race. The indoor races are more Arenacross than Supercross. They are very tight and by the end of it you will probably hate Nagl, Febvre, and Gajser. Maybe it's a good thing they don't have the license for the US series.The AI is improved and takes much better lines. I still have yet to bump it back up to the highest setting, but they are definitely more aggresive. Again, you'll probably end up hating quite a few guys. The only problem is a lot of times inside passes result in tipovers from the AI, although this seems to be true in most MX games.Overall, I wish there were a few things different, such as first-person starts and the clutch assignment not locking up the game, but this series is well on it's way and with any luck, maybe, just maybe, one day there will be an installment for the US series."

Maybe this will appeal to fans of the sport more.Comments:This feels like a simpler original Wip3out or RC Stunt Copter, and I feel that is high praise. The solid inertia feel and the gameplay are really solid and worthy of recommendation alone. Perhaps the AI is a little easy to beat (I haven't and probably won't play multiplayer) but the satisfaction that can be gained by learning lines and getting them right make this well worth the money if you're a fan of solid no-nonsense racers.

If you didn't like the first one I suggest you go into it with an open mind. It's similar but it isn't just an update, it has it's own character.Things that could be improved on:AI - Collisions are not fantastic, it's forgivable but it does take away a bit from the experience. Also the AI is just slow. They're programmed to take slower lines which in turn makes the ""realistic"" difficulty not very realistic.Multiplayer - Unreliable. Because it doesn't use dedicated servers your experience is effected by your internet connection. It also loses connection 70% of the time.That being said the game is fantastic. The graphics are beautiful and the customization is really what the 1st title was missing. The career mode is everything I had hoped for after the improvements they made in their MotoGP series that I loved so much. It improves on the base set in 2014 and worth the pickup for any moto fan."

The computer is more challenging so i feel like there will be a lot of time in the game to achieve being really good, from changing the AI difficulty to the rider reflex options. The choice in brands from bikes to gear is really cool, the tracks look better. Still a few glitches from engine cut out and the AI just runs you over like its nothing. The career is fun so far and SX tracks are challenging, the game tends to be twitchy at times IMO. I will put plenty of hours in the game trying to get better and unlock everything. Rating: 7.5/10"

,Recommended,400800,22311699,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Mythu,"After watching the Announcement trailer and waiting for this game to come out, i can finally say that i am not dissapointed.First of all, I must say that the game mechanics are great! They feel like the closest to actual racing than any other motocross game I have played. You really do have to plan your lines ahead and make sure you are applying the right braking style around certain corners. I haven't played the first MXGP, but i have played games like MX vs. ATV: Reflex and the movements feel much more realistic and passing people actually feels like an accomplishment. I also find it pretty cool that when you lean, you reallly have to be careful because lean to much and you are in the dirt.The customization options are an awesome factor as well. I was almost able to perfectly recreate my own Yamaha with American flag graphics! There are so many brands to choose from includ Fox, FMF, and Renthal. The only problem i ran into while customizing my bike was a constant flickering that would appear on the bike, but the developers are already aware through discussions and are probably already fixing it.My favorite mode so far is the Career mode, where you get to race with the MXGP 2015 Roster. Although i don't really follow those races as I like to watch AMA Supercross in America, I am having a blast making my own character and bringing him up in the ranks.Graphics-wise the game looks and runs great with my fps staying between 50-60fps on the max settings.  Here are my specs:i7 4790kAMD Radeon R9290x 4gb16gb RamThe most common complaint that i do find relevent is the sounds of the game. The engine noises are not up to par and can be made more realistic as well as maybe the crashes. However, this problem does not take my enjoyment away from the game and shouldn't be the deciding factor in purchasing the game or not in my opinion.Overall, the gameplay is stellar but that is not to say that there are things that could be worked on. I definitely recommend this game to fans of the sport or anyone that enjoys realistic racing games.Cheers!"

I once had a dvd player that sounded more like a bike than this.-Speed of the bikes and gearing seem well off... 1st gear is like running pace, no sensation of acceleration through the range what so ever.-Ridged as a bread stick while jumping... Scubbing is okay I guess, nothing amazing. Cannot control pitch in a way that feels true to jumping a real bike.-Block passing or merely just riding on the inside of AI will force you to crash.

The game will not assign/map our buttons with my Logitech controller properly.....If I try to assign button 1 for the gas, the game randomly assigns a different button on screen....then in gameplay, it is an entirely button. This also happened in MXGP1 and I was really hoping this game would be different. It also wont let you assign a new button for the clutch......it just locks the game and you have to do a force shutdown to back out. I did this 4 times before giving up. The bike also turns very sensitive and zig zags all over the track uncontrollably. I have a high end gaming PC and this game is choppy and laggy. I can run Fallout 4, Call of Duty, Far Cry all on max settings with zero lag but this game lags badly. For this release, you guys should have knocked it out of the park but instead you gave us MXGP1 with better tracks.  The bike physics(turning wise) was 100% better on the first game.

And I was expecting so so much more from this game... Don't waste your money.Best link to use after you paid for this game :https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966

Better in every aspect, and most importantly, i have not seen a single bug!, Milestone have really dont a great job on this. Personally I think its the best MX game ever made. I have Reflex and Encore but this feels much more realistic handling. Theres a lot of people out there giving Milestone a bad name even on this game, however this game does not deserve bad press at all. And if you dont buy it because of past Milestone aftersales behaviour regarding bugfixing etc on previous titles... then your missing out on a gem.Edit: Multiplayer is currently not good with AI, very glitchy, warping etc.... The singleplayer experience though is very good."

Glen Helen was super accurate, as are most tracks. The stock bikes do make stock bikes look pretty bad but give this game a chance in head cam, and play through the career until you get better bikes. It's worth it."

,Not Recommended,400800,32611249,Posted: 20 June,all,Sammy Sprinklar,"Game wouldn't let me change the difficulty, menu is hard to navigate, using a controller and the deadzones or sensitivity feels off and can't seem to find anywhere I can change that, might have been the physics style but again I couldn't change it (can see the option but it is locked), never lock basic gameplay options... also the constant being reset when I have hardly left the track after a mistake makes the game feel very clunky and impossible to win as respawned with zero speed. I'm sure there is a way to fix some of these things but game made me frustrated very quickly, won't be playing again"
,Recommended,400800,29305395,Posted: 16 January,all,Wolfykins,Simply the dopest MX game I've ever played. The manual leaning mechanics combined with the controllable chaos you can do with your bike is just nuts to the point of actually having a riding style of your own when you've got it down.

,Recommended,400800,28955022,Posted: 2 January,all,三ドル（Sandoru）,"One-hour-after-playing-kind-of-review.============================This game is my first experience of playing a Motocross game after playing ""Championship Motocross (ft. Ricky Carmichael)"" on PS1. Since then, I've barely touched any MX game.Right from the rider creation screen to my first race in Championship mode where I've completed one race, the game felt smooth, it felt polished and fun to ride. When I jumped into my first race I've already practiced for 15 minutes with Basic physics and manual weight-distribution settings. The Championship setting was on easy. All in all it was very fun. On my first attempt I crashed and came last. On my second attempt I've managed to come 14th. A lot of fun, guys.The only issue I've encountered is after I watched a tutorial video. My game froze and I had to ctrl+alt+del. But it didn't stop me. I learned the basics in free practice.Don't know how the veterans of MX PC games feel about this game, but for me as a newcomer, it sure felt great!Recommend to all newbs like me!9/10"

If want an easy game this is not for you. took me about 4hrs of riding before i was able to place mid pack on easy. Now at 8hrs have a 2nd place. But loads of fun and challanging.
,Recommended,400800,32331021,Posted: 10 June,all,Mama Lancia,"A more solid and evolved version than the first MXGP, but still have big problems.It is clear the improvements, better graphics, better illumination, now the mud and the tracks are more realistic and natural,  the handling, controls and physics  are a little bit better, sound quality is OK. New games modes, Stadium Series and Real Events are a good additionsThe sense of velocity in the game is horrible for both MX2 and MXGP, The bikes seem very slow in the corners and also in the straights, Air physics feels bad and slow, these problems make the gameplay getting tired/bored  really fast.7/10"
