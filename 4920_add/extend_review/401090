Whole features that don't work such asmirroring a set of bones over. or in the case that you did get symmetry to work it only works during creation. When you have to change the bones later symmetry no longer works.Bascially Bone creation becomes a very 'Eye-balled' process where you can't even guarantee that the bones are symmetrical.When you start weighting all this, Half the menu's that are in the documentation dont even match what you are seeing. You are left trying to figure out why you can't see a menu, or get access to something that is supposed to be there.It becomes a very 'Eye-balled' process once again.For a payed program there seems to be less documentation than that of Blender.I can't realistically see using this to create any game for production. Too many core features that were 'Put' into the app as 'Working' and effectively don't work at all.If your on a tight budget, just start learning Blender since its free.If money is not an issue, 3ds Max would be my recommendation.If you're somewhere in between Maya LT is a very good option for indies.I believe all those options are far better than Modo indie 901.I've already sunk money into the original Modo indie and the expansion 901. At this point I'm giving up on this software"

More often than not, this is a far cry from the truth, with users simply being picky and spoiled. This is not the case with MODO Indie 10.Oh my god, the bugs. From ""You have no undos left"", despite my prefs being set to 100 undos, and not having used a single one of them, to broken symmetry, double polys, and the like. It is broken on PC. It is broken on OSX. More time is spent correcting the program than actually modelling in it.It crashes, it hangs, it freezes. It UNINSTALLS ITSELF. ""Save early, save often"" is not enough here. You're left having to choose to save after every move, knowing full well that if you save, there is a very real chance that it may just crash and corrupt the file during the process.""Contact support!"" I hear you say! As other users have pointed out, MODO does not see Steam users as actual customers. You'll get a generic email back telling you to check the forums. If you find anything in the forums related to your problem, more often than not, it's just other users saying ""Same problem here, please fix.""As a student at KCAD, our entire class is required to use this program, as the local Underbite Games insists that it is the industry standard. Again, this is absolutely not the case. If you're a student, get Maya for free. If you're anybody else, get Blender for free. There are so many superior options to this broken, rudimentary program.UPDATE: After saving after every major move, the program glitched out, undo stopped working, so I tried reloading to my last major change. I loaded it to find out that the program had not, in fact, actually saved since my initial project save. Hours of work, lost. The save dialog would open, and the overwrite dialog would pop up, but it has not saved since I had barely started on the project."

I have been using the other version - the plain MODO indie on Windows 8, and it NEVER crashes - I don't even know what a MODO crash looks like. So hold your horses and don't panic - the choppa is on the way.This is the most amazing modeling software I have ever seen - even for a newbie / anti-talent like me - normally, I can barely draw a circle (I'm a games programmer). After a few hours, seeing some very good tutorials available on the official and third party sites, I am confident I can do anything - from models and mechanical structures to environments.My first day in MODO - my first 2 hours actually - following a tutorial I messed something up, and I had to redo everything all over again, and I was able to retrace my steps in a few minutes !!! It goes so fast that it never crosses your mind to give up, because everything you do is a huge waste of time, and the results are riddled with errors and asymmetries anyway – useless for any decent commercial project. How many times did you get that feeling, trying to use a new software, and seeing the modest results of your best efforts?How many times have you seen presentations about how great and easy to use a program is, only to hit a brick wall after you got it, and realize that you will have to pour weeks and months of hard work into it before you get some half decent result that, as a first attempt, will have to be remade anyway from scratch, while you are wondering if you have what it takes - a perfect memory, some rare talent that only some goblins have, and an impossibly steady hand that allows you to move and place everything with the accuracy of an industrial robot?Well, MODO is nothing like that - the interface is simple, intuitive, everything is automated, processed directly with numeric values, and with a few simple commands you can create things that are incredibly detailed. So far I have been building the inner workings of a car – steering, transmission, suspension, things that are rather industrial-design oriented – isn't details and devices that appear to work what everybody wants? Now that I think of it, some degree of realism must exist - many components really need to work since game engines are physics simulations, and if you just attach 4 wheels to a tin barrel, instead of a car you will end up with a shopping cart moving really fast – good luck trying to stay on the road and steer it properly.MODO proved to be everything I hoped it would be. The Foundry has all the best movies you have seen in recent years in their portfolio, and if their software is not enough for you to succeed, then nothing is. We are lucky that they gave us, the little guys, the slightest chance to even touch their software.So non, je ne regrette rien, and neither should you."

,Recommended,401090,23771395,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,BlueAizu21,"I needed something to replace 3DS Max since I only had the student edition (which cannot be used commercially), I cannot afford a subscription, and it was unstable and prone to crashing my computer, so I looked for alternatives; which is where MODO came in.Modeling in MODO Indie is very easy, once you know how to work your way around in the program. You also have the ability to texture, UV unwrap (which I found quite easy to do compared to other programs I've used, by the way), render, animate, and even paint on the mesh directly.You also have the option of remapping the keys in order to make using the program a customizable experience, and even has a number of preset options which mimic other programs; an option for 3DS Max was a godsend for me, but there's also options for MAYA, Cinema 4D, and more, which makes learning the program quite a bit less intimidating.There are a few shortcomings and limitations for MODO Indie, however. The biggest ones are that it uses its own file type (called .lxf) for saved meshes, so it's impossible to open meshes made with MODO Indie in other programs without exporting it to another file type. This is where its second biggest limitation lies: meshes with more than 100,000 polygons cannot be exported at all. It may sound like a large number, but trust me, it really isn't. This is fine if you're working on a video game by yourself (since real-time applications only use low-poly meshes anyway), but these two limitations make it very difficult to share work between team members. Additionally, scripting is not supported in MODO Indie, although I've yet to encounter a situation where this proves to be a major setback. Thankfully, those are the only major limitations, so go nuts with the animating, texture mapping and UV-ing!There is one issue I encountered with the paint tool, though, and it's that the texture I'd painted on became darker and darker each time I reloaded it. This is easily solvable by simply using a separate program for painting on textures, though, and MODO is primarily a tool for modeling, anyway.Those limitations aside, MODO Indie is a very powerful modeling program, and is very reasonably priced for what it is."

,Recommended,401090,22639768,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,notanumber,"I've been a user since the original MODO Indie (801) and I'm still a huge fan.  Previously, I came from Maya LT, but after trying the demo version of MODO, was excited to see it come to Steam in an Indie offering.  I think it's well worth the price and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in 3d modelling.  If you're on the fence, grab the demo version from The Foundry's website and take it for spin.  Once you've used it for awhile, come on back here and pickup the indie version.Some caveats before you buy -- be sure to checkout the restrictions on the indie version listed in the details.  While it's nearly identical to the full version, there are a few things that may impact your decision, mainly the Python scripting is disabled (meaning a lot of external plugins that rely on scripts aren't going to work), and there's a 100k polygon limit on any FBX/OBJ file you export.  Personally, I haven't had any major issue with any of the restrictions.  The 100k polygon limit just means I bake my normals in MODO and export the low-poly version, which is what you probably want if you're doing game development anyway, and the missing scripting isn't as big of an issue as it used to be since the newer versions of MODO include a lot of the functionality that external scripts added."

I put in about 80 hours training on it and found that it was just too buggy.  I should have read the reviews -- ""Crashes way less now"" and ""Works well on Windows 8"" aren't actually positive recommendations.Judging by forum traffic it seems usual for experienced Modo users to see frequent crashes and malfunctions, and as a new user I certainly saw this.   Most areas of the program have vague bugs floating around that wedge or crash it, and painting was so faulty it wasn't usable.  I'm sure there are legit fans, who go back with this program, and work around all this without thinking about it much, and manage to do great work.  But I'll never be one of them.Overall the Steam version served its purpose: it allowed me to find this out without paying $1600 for a full license, and I'm grateful for that."

It features great tools to speed up your process, and has a neat, tidy and customizeable UI. The Foundry has wisely placed the most common tools in easily accessable hotkeys and menus for quick access, and the tools are amazingly functional.Before I updated this review, I had some compaints about there being some problems with baked texture compatability with other software. This has been fixed in Modo 10, with the introduction of the Game Tools. We now have a what-you-see-is-what-you-get workflow with multiple shaders available, ease of exporting, ease of vertex normal editing and improved baking tools.There still are times I wish I could simply export the high poly model out and bake the normal and ambient occulsion in the Substance Suite, but baking those two in Modo is fun and easy enough now, so I can easily live with it.Enjoy Modoing!"

,Recommended,401090,28997823,Posted: 3 January,all,SuckerFreeGames,"Let me just say I love this software!  I've used a lot of 3D modeling programs in the past, but this one has been the best all package I've come across in a long time.  Blender is frustraiting, Silo 2, 3D Coat and Maya are hard to master.  This program does everything those programs do, but way easier to master.  Seriously, I learned how to use this program in less than 2 days and actually had something to show for it.ProsEasy to use.Professional quality modeling software, doesn't crash, ""just works"" exports easily, imports easily.Animation system is amazing.Seriously as far as software goes, there is nothing negative I can say.  I love this software, it's so much better than anything I've used previously.  I actually understand it!ConsSubscription is $16 a month if you get it in 6 month blocks, this is kind of hard to swing as the previously mentioned software (with exception to Maya) are about the same as the 6 month block to own (about $96).  To buy an outright indie license is $300.I bought 6 months previously, loved it, but am torn on whethor to renew for another 6 months or wait until a sale / I get $300 together.  It sucks to rent it, because if you're like me and working fulltime at a day job, you can only use the software for a few hours a week during the weekend.  That said, $300 is a fair price for something this easy to use with this kind of feature depth, LOVE the animation / boning system!   I guess my only wish would be that they could do a rent to own feature, where after you get through 3 six month blocks you get an actual indie license, but hey I understand devs gotta eat, etc."
76561198032577583,Recommended,401090,29632783,Posted: 1 February,all,HAL10000,"I will start by saying that the only good thing I can say about Modo right now is that they gave me the ability to rent and not buy.  If I bought this outright I would have been extremely upset.I cannot remember the last software package that so regularly crashed on me as this one, and no matter how mundane the task or even the complexity of the current working mesh(es).  Rendering an image?  Crash.  Open a file?  Crash.  Go from vertex selection to polygon selection?  Crash.  My work system is a 2015 iMac Retina system (32 GB), so I suspected that maybe the macOS version is neglected.  Firing it up on my FX8350 machine seemed to offer no respite.  That means I really cannot blame either macOS or Windows.  I hoped this was a case of a sh*t port to macOS, but I experienced problems on the Windows machine similar to those on my iMac.Worse, is that whenever I try to use the UV mapping utilities, I often get a spinning beach ball of death, forcing me to quit the program.  Over and over.  This happened even more frequently on the Windows machine than on my iMac.About 50% of the time I finish baking a normal map, Modo inputs cease to respond although I can grab window bars and move those windows around.  Other than that, nothing responds.   It's Russian Roulette each time I bake a normal map or even switch from layout to layout.  Yet another instance where I have to Force Quit the application, losing any and all work since the last save.It illustrates what a number of us refer to as ""Microsoft engineering"" where stability is sacrificed in order to meet demands from accounting/marketting for new (and often marginal) feature additions.  It's always a good idea to save frequently, but my Modo experience has taken that to a whole new painful level.Modo's Game Tools will allow mesh exports so long as the format is FBX, which I find grating.  FBX is a confusing mess of a format that I feel was designed solely to inflict pain and confusion upon others and I go out of my way to use nearly anything else.  I understand that maybe this layout is geared for UE4 or Unity developers, but It shouldn't be very hard to allow for exporting to Collada or vanilla OBJ.My biggest issue with Modo has been rendered artifacts when baking normal maps (especially over curved surfaces).  My normal workflow was always to generate a low and high polygon mesh inside whatever package I'm using and get Substance Painter to generate the normal maps for me.  The Indie version restricts mesh outputs, forcing me to use the baker provided.  And it regularly generates artifacts which have to be corrected in Photoshop.  That is, unless I part out my meshes to get below the polygon limit restriction and assemble the final object using another program so that I can generate new maps with Substance Painter itself.Another pet peeve of mine is installing new materials in the Asset directory.  Unless I'm reading the readmes wrong, it's a bit of a pain to add new items in.  Guess what happens to me when things aren't installed right?  That's right, Modo takes the opportunity to show it's displeasure and crashes on me.  Maybe the development team for Modo should take a cue from Substance Painter's approach to drag and drop into the shelf for asset addition.I have to say, Modo does feel like a beta release product most of the time.  This experience has left me paralyzed in a sense.  I'm not sure I want to risk renting Maya LT because chances are high it could easily be as frustrating.  I also don't feel like paying a monthly fee and still not own any software.  At least with Modo, they offer it up for a good competitive price.  Especially when the costs of other suites often involves limbs and kidneys.The modelling approach is different from others in the past (Rhino, Cheetah3D, 3DS) and will take some getting used to.The new addition of procedural modelling could be interesting.  Just worried it's just another opportunity for Modo to keep crashing on me.The workplane approach is a bit reminiscent of CSG packages like Solidworks and handy in some situations.Sculpting is fun and could offer up a (much) cheaper alternative to ZBrush.  There is something to say about something that can generate high polygon mesh, retopology, baking and UV mapping inside one program.  It can also rigged up figures and so on.Modo would be better if ""crashes per hour"" was not measured in double digits.  Would I recommend this?  I wanted to love using Modo, but it makes it difficult.  The final price won't just be the sticker price but the instability that comes with it.  If one were to take precautions and obsessively save work, then a person might never see a better deal.___Just for completeness, the only similarity between my iMac and my PC desktop is that they both use ATI Radeon graphics subsystems (380M and RX470 respectively)."
,Recommended,401090,30168992,Posted: 25 February,all,SteelPrincess,"I've been using MODO indie for a bit now, and over all, I do enjoy it. It's a great modeler, the UI is one of the best and most intuitive you can find. As far as its modeling goes, I can't really fault MODO for much. However, it can be a bit buggy at times, crashes a bit, but that's gotten a fair bit better over time and crashes happen less these days... but, still happen at a fairly consistent rate. That said, MODO tends to be somewhat good at picking up where you crashed out.My biggest gripe is the FBX support is limited to 2015, which is pretty much two years behind standards... so, for those of you who want or need full FBX 2016/2017 support, it's not happening here. I suppose that is fine for simple projects, but not for those who want complete shader/material/light/animation exports, etc.All in all, I would still recommend MODO for those who want to do very small scale indie development, it's pretty keen. And while I still kinda recommend MODO Indie, the FBX export is showing its technology age... and while I absolutely love MODO Indie purely as a modeler.... I'm on the fence if in this day and age, it's worth the typical price tag for a Indie package."
