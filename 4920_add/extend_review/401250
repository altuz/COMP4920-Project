76561198049819329,Recommended,401250,26001314,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,echo1,"Important Notice:In my first few playthroughs, I found the game difficulty ridiculously easy and it would take about 5 stabs with my bayonet to kill one zulu. Well, I'm pleased to inform you that this game has the option to crank the difficulty of every concievable weapon and unit type right up. In my last playthrough, I actually dreaded the Zulu charge as it now only took one spear to kill me and my men. In feels like a hardcore mode now, which I absolutely love and the objectives to complete are that much more difficult to complete.Here is what I found and changed:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780052538New UpdateDevs have fixed 8 bugs since releasee and they keep in regular communication with the community. They also explain what's coming up in future updates before they arrive which I appreciate. They listen to EA ideas and respond with enthusiasm. I certainly trust the devs with sticking with this excellent game.The ReviewI'm going to give this game a tentative thumbs up for now.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=779961514I've been anticipating the release of Zulu Response for a few months now and now that its released, I have mixed feelings towards the game.First impressions are not great. The visuals are very outdated with player models looking more like tin soldiers than life like characters. The foliage is quite convincing but again the texture detail is very basic. The animations of the characters fair a little better, with Zulu warriors breaking into tribal dancing and British soldiers stretching their weary legs, unfortunately the animations aren't convincing in the heat of battle. British soldiers don't yet seem to know how to aim down their Martini-Henry rifles yet and the Zulu's who primarily use melee attack with their asagai's don't quite know how to throw them.Please note, if you have a good PC or laptop and you have Nvidia, then you can up the graphic capabilities in Nvidia control panel and the game in EA can look like this:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=782059458However, there is something about Zulu Response which gives me optimisim for its future and that's it's completely broken command system. I'm not quite sure why the Developers decided to place the complex command orders for your squad through a hotkey (K) rather than a command wheel as seen in Insurgency, which would feel more intuitive to use and drastically reduce the confusion that players may have, however having said that the commands you can order are historically accurate and quite fleshed out. I think this is where Zulu Dawn's strength lies. If the devs can simplify the command orders using a command wheel, instruct the AI to actually go to the correct position and fire on command then I think this game can go far.To be sure, the visuals need a complete overhaul to compliment the ""realistic gameplay"" and the animations need a lot of attention but those are relatively easy to accomplish than if the command system was lacking in historical detail. The small dev team have said the game will be in EA for about 8 months. In those 8 months, I believe they could make the Zulu's Response even louder if they focused on enhancing the realism of the game, fixing the somewhat broken AI and changing their command order system.One area of the game that does stand out is the audio. Whilst the fighting sounds are rather simple, the music which accompanies the action, with the Men of Harleck and the Zulu's singing is rousing to the soul and does intensify what is rather a bland combat experience as of now.Oh and please, please devs remove for now the frightened/ suppression system it feels as though I am on the high seas and it could make some people violently ill. A simple grey out would suffice.For now I'd rate Zulu Response with a decent 7.5/10. Given time, I'm optimistic that Zulu Response will be a ""must have"" for anyone remotely interested in the Anglo-Zulu war.Update: I was having issues with performance on my laptop, however I noticed it was running on the integrated graphics card. For those who have Nvidia control panel, Zulu response is under UDK (Unreal Development Kit).Having almost reached the 2 hour mark now, I can say that I was slightly too harsh on the audio and combat mechanics. I was just in Rorkes Drift defending the farmstead with 30 men and the inevitable Zulu charge really made me see the huge potential in this game. The Zulu amassed on the South wall, but I had placed my men on the North wall. I had to order my men double time to cover the South entrance and as I was doing so three of my men fell to spears. The Zulu war chants and the speed in which the Zulu arrived unnerved me, and I ended up taking out my sword and swinging it wildly at the mass of oncoming Zulu. I was wounded and decided to order my men to form ranks and fire on command. Zulus fell before my eyes as smoke filled the air. The hospital during this assualt was set ablaze, which was a sad sight to behold. As more Zulu's arrived, I ordered an orderly withdrawal to the Kraal Biscuit boxes and it was there we made our last stand. The bugle player sounded his last command, as the Zulus overran our lines."

The audio is massively out of wack (too low sometimes, then WAY too loud), the controls are clunky, more than half the commands do not function, MP doesn't seem to work yet.  For $15 dollars no way.  Reduce the price and raise it as it gets closer to launch if you want to keep testers.  Refund for me.  I'll be back on release."

Graphics are a joke, but that I can live with. The controls... seriously... try to invert the mouse. Oh, you can't! Remap the keys... 'key already in use'. Yes, they all are and I want te remap. So you have to remap them to a non-used one, change the one that has the key you want to another unused one, then change the original one to the one you wanted and then the other one... you get the picture. For 30+ keys. F5 actually is needed for in-game action (impalement). I won't dignify this game with mapping it differently on my (programmable) keyboard. This would have been nice back in the ninities. That was another millemium..."

However, the execution is not great at this stage in Early Access and the voice acting definitely needs a re-record before release (it sounds like they paid someone down the pub to come and talk into a microphone).If the shooting, controls and graphics get tightened up, and the combat gets made more immersive, I'll definitely be coming back to alter this review."
76561198009230826,Recommended,401250,26040174,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Vykk,"First off, do not play this game for the graphics, they're getting there. But overall a great concept and game. I am a history buff and have always wondered when a Zulu War game would come out. This game is great! It has Historical accuracy and it is fun You can mold the settings however you like so you can either breeze through the defence, or be backed against the wall, out of ammo, standing on your comrad's dead bodies with hundreds of Zulus running at you with a one hit kill spear. Once you figure out the game's machanics, it is great. Overall great game, can't wait for the full release.Tips:1.) To make your guys go somewhere, Make sure you have selected them (they will appear darker in their picture), then choose the place you want them to attack and click on the name of the place you just selected on the screen. If you still can't get the guys to move, make sure in your settings, you applied the orders to everywhere instead of just the feet around you.2.) Press 'r' to reload unless you put it on automatic reload.3.) If you want to throw your spear, you MUST aim first before you throw, or it will just stab.4.) HOLD THE LINE!!!"

The AI is currently quite buggy, the menus are fairly gross looking and the graphics are pretty bad. I do like the concept and I think, if the developers continue to work on it, the game could end up being pretty good.As of right now I don't recommend buying it unless you want to support the developers, but I have hopes that the final result is a good game worth purchasing."

Some things went wrong such as sometimes the uniform and sometimes the rifle goes black. the zulus ai are some of the dumbist i have every seen. but i have not played the zulus side yet. motian blur for me a least caused lag and sometimes the game freezes then exits out. I found zulu charges scary (manily because of their dumb ai) but also cause all the other solders die almost instanly. But i still really enjoyed my time in the game and i would recomend it to you.

You get to be a British soldier or a Zulu warrior and run around and fight Zulu warriors or British soldiers. That's what I expected and that's what I got. The little glitches and drawbacks have been more or less covered by other reviews. I'll just say this; if you're interested in this period of history and this subject, buy this game. Remember, it was just released. There're going to be some problems, but $15 isn't that much for a decent game and if we support the developers now it will make it easier for them to improve the game as time goes on."

,Not Recommended,401250,32611205,Posted: 20 June,all,DSU-firebird,got this game because I thought it was going for realism like other games like insurgency but I shoot a zulu and he keeps runnin! Maybe there is some sort of setting for that I thought i found it with the game settings but guess not. It feels like an alpha. My bots are rubberbanding. Waste of my 15$. Dont buy this game.honestly i love the idea of this game but its not ready. If the game is going to stay in this quality the developer should really lower it.

The game plays really poorly, the units don't always move well, they go in odd places, you can kill loads of English soldiers before one takes you down. The interface is horrible - look at Operation Flashpoint for pointers. REally clunky to play, needs an ability to pause batle and give instructions. Menus are about 20 years old and are not that responsive. The missions are limited and there is no ability to create your own - you can only play a couple of missions on my version - I won one to get another one, I want to play in my order. Besides, the first open nbattle is Rourkes Drift - which happend after some of the others in the game. Really feel I was duped with my hard earned cash. I never usually leave game reviews, but this was poor and way too early. Some folks might come back to you"

I love the whole Zulu vs British history era and was looking forward to this games release. firstly what it is with devs nowadays releasing a so called game which no where near finished and so bad its not funny. Graphics very poor gameplay very poor not even any great depth to it if i were a dev i would be ashamed to release this what the hells wrong with u ppl. just another poor excuse for a game and charging ppl for the pleasure or not in this case probably another money making scheme like so many of these devs r doing now knowing full well ppl will pay to see what its like. shocking if this is your best attempt at a game please do us all a favor and get another job cos u suck at this.

If you are playing this game you should really see that movie. Anyway, I thought I  would write a simple review about Zulu Response...I would recommend this game as it is now and I'll tell you why:___Very detailed graphics. I can pick off an Impi sniper using Iron sights if I WORK  at it...breath control and a proper sight picture is what's needed to pick off the enemy...especially the Zulu King, He sometimes runs around in front of my firing line with shots flying at him, but I swear that King Zulu Dude is totally legit when it comes to impressing everyone...he dodges all the bullets coming at him. His anticipation of just when I am going to fire at him is uncanny and frustrating, but he was BELIEVABLE, not fake and now I know why he is their King*.___The movements of large bodies of Zulu Warriors are realistic and very, very scary when you know they are coming for you.___Sound is mostly very good and true to ZULU (introducing Michael Caine) the movie. The Zulus banging their shields make for a haunting, deafening sound....their chants to creep you out or demoralize you and the men. The anxiety affects you and it shows...blurred vision for a few seconds is one possible effect when a human wave is coming at you.___the system to move my men just works. Point at the ground where you want them to go, one button to indicate the area and one button to send your men to that marked spot. You can also orient them North-South and East to West.___Rifles are loud at times, as is the Zulu Warriors when they are bashing their shields. Don't wake up Pa in the middle of the night.___Many config options for weapons and other stuff.___I guess because this game is fun is why I'll rate it positively.___You may find yourself in a situation where panic may set in. Don't let it get to your head! Keep calm and use your bayonet if you have to!This game is all business. Hold on as long as possible, stay alive! Keep your head when the bodies begin piling up...You gotta keep your head or else you may be captured and who the heck knows what diablical events the Zulus have cooked up for their enjoyment? BRRR! Don't even want to think about it!Recommended to a friend or family member 8.5/10...minuses for some graphical and ""up close"" clitches, but not that bothersome.*You can pick him off...the Zulu King isn't superhuman, but impressive nonetheless(sic)."
