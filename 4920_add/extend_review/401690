Most topics on the community hub are a few days old too. Not a good sign.**Almost 5 hours played and I seem to get bored after an hour or 2. I tried both what seems to be the easiest setting and ""normal""; however I am not hitting that ""lose yourself"" in the gameplay mood I have with other strategy/sims. **Dev communication is on point -They released information for possible additions on 2/29/2016, however there are no set patch dates or any kind of ETA on when we could see more content. They had some bug fixes roll out but nothing game changing.The game is enjoyable overall and I feel that with strong updates the game could become something great (and well worth $16 or more even)... just as it is now I would wait and see what the developers do within the coming weeks. Feels like a beta more than a release.Pros:>>Strong Survival/Strategy/Sim potential.>>Game has a rough charm and systems that could work well if they were more polished/in-depth.>>The multiple layers system allows for many possibilities when designing a bunk.Cons:>>Research can be completed almost too easily (especially if you have more than 1 scientist).>>Bunk residents are generally annoying – They don’t seem to manage their jobs and personal affairs very well.>>Older residents and children are completely useless in terms of gameplay (maybe add a classroom function for children(unlocks 1 additional random job choice or something) and add in some chore style jobs for elderly(teaching children, maybe only elderly can do research even)).Tip if you buy:>> Play on 1 or 2 speed (> or >>) ... Playing on 3 is fine but you will zip though the game pretty fast to cycle 50. **You don't have to end at 50 but it seems to be the soft end game goal.For now I will vote “Negative” and update as I play throughout the month of March. I really WANT to like the game more and hopefully some updates will help.TL:DR - Game seems like an Early Access rather than a released game. For an easy, norm, hard playthough stopping at 50 cycle you may get about 10-12 hours of gameplay out of it. Not horrible for $16."

Not worth $15.99.The AI is clunky and unresponsive, mutiple time works gets in the way of others, or walk on the other side of walls, or not respond to their jobs.The UI is terrible, and unintuitive.  You end up clicking through 5 different menus and views to do two actions...like swapping from construcing pipes to wanting to view the overworld.  I've requested a refund.Lastly, it's easy.  Bare bone's builder with nothing unique or grasping, or challenging.  Resource management is a breeze by the 3rd attempted game.  The biggest thing that I didn't understand, is why do you have the ability to make rooms when mechanically there's NO penalty for having a waste bin, in the kitchen that houses your reactor and the sleeping quarters.Don't waste your money, $15.99 is too expensive for low quality like this."

The game is good, but currently not outstanding. It however has HUGE potential and could become something great. The AI, for example, is something that absolutely needs to be resolved. Once during my gameplay, the water pump broke and the engineer did absolutely nothing to solve the problem. He was perfectly healthy and the servicing priority was set to ten. That was the only time I was legitimately frustrated with the AI.Despite the faults it has, they can be easily fixed. I hope the developers really try their hardest to make this game the best it can. As I am writing this, they are currently working on a big update so I'm looking forward to that. As for now, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes management simulations and aren't afraid to encounter possible bugs in the game."

You have to keep an eye on a number of their needs such as their health, hunger, hygiene and fitness. You also have to monitor power, water, oxygen, ore and building supplies. You can also encounter creatures that will attack your humans on sight. To increase your population you have to incubate babies. To keep your bunker alive, you have to replace the people that die e.g. by old age, fighting creatures etc. Furthermore, when your people become old they 'retire'. The younger generation have to pick up their slack and it's a constant balance of trying to fill in for them and grow your population.I only wish that there were more research options as it's pretty easy to have a scientist constantly working to rack up those reasearch points or scenarios as there are only three in the game.I love management games and there aren't many bunker management ones out there. I've been following this game since it launched and it's made some good improvements. The developers are only a team of two and this is only their first or second game. Love their work!"

You'll get a bit of satisfaction on that end.Downside is: it's more like a mini-game to be honest. 5 hours, and you're done. It's not worth the 15$. There's no real interesting scenarios, or tech tree or sort of advancement or reward from making a Big Bunker. Once you've reached understanding of the mechanics and reached equilibrium of your first bunker, you will soon lose interest.It could be widely improved by adding interesting or funny tech advancements and increase difficulty gradiently on these and it could turn into a ground breaking game that would complement the DKII base-builder genre. It has all the right things in the right places, it just feels incomplete for now.So: recommended for those that love base building/ressource management games and want to contribute and get a bit of satisfaction on that. Not recommended for those who mind losing 15$ for something that doesn't have a lot of replayability."

Survive until the surface becomes habitable again. I bought it because of the strong Fallout-vibe it gave off, but I didn't even make it through a single playthrough, as it is very shallow.Tutorials are odd, but informative. Gameplay is simple and repetitive. The logic behind certain choices betrays a short developmental phase. For example, new pops are generated by a machine, which simply produces a pop a specific time after hitting a button. AI is absurdly ineffective, visuals are somewhat nice but not really clear. Music pops in and out at seeemingly random moments for what seems like half a song. Research ads no real new items, just improvements to exisiting things (like a percentage improvement). Resource management suggests there was a lot more planned, but there was no time to actually implement anything."

,Recommended,401690,34262348,Posted: 15 August,all,Ghostwheel,"As a former Dungeon Keeper and Fallout fan, overall, this is pretty cool. After reading previous reviews from old builds, it seems the game has come a long way. This is good for a game that has 2 developers. There are some balancing issues. I'll get to those later. Oddly enough, being a long time big RTS guy and hearing this was too easy, it was actually a challenge. Sandbox mode there was not 1 second where I wasn't clicking trying to keep my dwellers alive. So much so that I didn't have any time for a creative approach. One big open room with the essentials. Once I got there, I could slowly start building my vision of a well made vault. This was with aging turned off. With aging turned on, it was purely survival... no time for anything pretty except keeping your people alive. I don't care how good you are. This almost felt like ""work"", more than fun gameplay.With over 20 hours on record so far, I know how to play the game how they've intended. It's not that complicated. So... balancing issues. Also, AI. A lot of them ""slack off"", won't do their jobs... won't go to the doctor when they should, get food when they should, or won't clean up garbage when they are just walking around. Clicking on the dweller themself, it often just says ""walking"", ""lonely - going for a chat"", ""Slacking"" etc. It's difficult to maintain a large population to account for all the people not actually doing their job. There's also not enough resources to account for the ""glorious"" looking vault you expect to create. Without serious diligence and changing around the settings (I only play Sandbox), your ""vault"" is going to look like unorganized crap trying to survive 50 cycles. Not very rewarding. Out of pure determination, I spent an entire Sunday and there's only enough resources (All 4 floors) to make one floor look like a serious vault. But I had to turn off aging.I'm not sure where the improvements need to be made, but there's several nuances that if resolved, could result in a fantastic game rivaling Dungeon Keeper.Personal thoughts: I wish the textures were a little less ""cartoony"" and the models a little less blocky. This is just pure immersion. Save the blocky models and low res textures for low quality graphic settings, and more Fallout looking realism for Ultra. Something to shoot for.Also very sad there is no multiplayer feature - or at least co-op. I hear this won't ever be implemented. But it's fun to think about.All that being said, great job for a team of 2! 20 hours of entertainment for 15$ isn't bad. Keep up the good work folks.Update: Seems the game has started breaking. Filling in the last corner of the entire floor with a few farms and they are flashing no water and no power when several lines are running to it with plenty of power and water to spare. Oh well, it's been a fun run."

One thing that I would like to see added is the possibility of making the cycles longer (i.e. 1 cycle=1 Year as opposed to 1 cycle being 10 Years).Also, there should be more ways to get resources in the game rater than mining. My recomendation to that is to make recyling machines turn trash into building materials, or to create another machine to complete this task.Water seems to be an issue a lot where, after about 5-10 cycles, I need to build a new water plant because I've already ran out so quickly...Other than that, I've finished the game multiple times already and I've had fun playing the game. The game does get annoying with the ensuing wrath of all the pop ups every that scream at you every 5 seconds, but you grow used to them."

76561197971289138,Recommended,401690,21539115,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,spacerevolver,"LIB is a neat little management game that plays like a less frenetic (and easier to grasp) Dwarf Fortress, though it is nowhere near as deep a dive as that cult game.The titular bunker is your fiefdom under the earth, where you shepherd the remnants of humanity until the world above is safe. Your job is to keep a few dozen plates spinning until the timer runs out, carefully trying to guide your bunker society toward a sustainable balance. This is kept challenging thanks to a scarcity of resources and a crush of demands that ensure you have to stay on your toes (expand too fast and you won't be able to maintain what you have and risk attack from molemen, expand too slowly and your people will start to suffer from starvation and sickness). To accomplish this you're given a lot of control and there are a few different ways to tackle the problems, which is essentialy for a good management game (after all, no one wants to lose because of pure RNG).Postiives:1. Setting is pretty unique for the genre2. Game is well balanced to provide continuing challenge3. Has some replayability as you test and experimentThat said, the game has some shortcomings. The game can seem a little thin in places, especially compared to other management games which often offer more room types, objects and systems (the game especially lacks for traps and defenses, but I'm not sure they would really suit the type of game). There are little UI tweaks that would help (a bit of simplification - for example to build a bunker wall you must go into a menu, then clock a submenu, and then click on the wall, which would make sense if there was more than one type of wall to build, maybe hotkeys? - and making it easier to tell how things are going at a glance). I'm also worried about replayability, since once you've ""solved"" the game then it doesn't offer any other modes or challenges.But overall it's a good little game in an underserved genre that deserves some attention."

I've failed all of my bunkers so far, but you live and you learn and this is very challenging game and you learn something new every time you play. There are some bugs in creative mode that need to be fixed (such as having many availible working showers and toilet pods and no one using them, or no one coming to eat food until it says their starving) and I hope the developers fix these in the future.

I forgot to put down cooking stations and forgot to grow food. The first five hours of playing I had absolutely no idea how to get past the first cycle of people starving to death leaving only the children who had just been born.But when I finally figured out how to make the bunkers last, the game became beyond mildly entertaining to play. It's a wonderful game with a nice simplistic style! Although the residents aren't the brightest (you could have fifteen showers down and the game will still tell you that there needs to be more showers just because the residents do other things than shower), it's more than a challenge to complete the achievements. The only ones that I'm missing are the ones related to the final scenario as personally it takes time to complete something to that degree.When I play, I end up spending hours upon hours creating a single bunker. And whilst challenging to collect the ore to get more building materials, after a while it piles up and having stockpiles of building materials is very satisfying if I do say so myself.The only cons that I would give this game is the few small bugs it has, with no update in sight. It was last updated in May whereas of writing this review it's August. Though I'm not quite sure what needs to be added, it could certainly do with having a few tweaks made before it's a 100% no brainer buy. Honestly, if you're a fan of something such as Bethesda's Fallout Shelter this is definitely something that you should try out at least once."

(maybe add in some more upgrade features?)There are a few drawbacks in the game play, as well as the tutorial! The 2 big issues I have (and hope that might be updated in the future!) areYou can't drag out rectangular/Square shapes when destroying and building (open rooms with walls and closed shapes with floors and destroying).The other thing is the tutorial. It is created in a good way that explains everything however even though the way it takes you is good it also seems that between the length of it and the cost of going through those things first, it almost forces the player into a corner. This doesn't happen usually when you play the game without the tutorial but following it to a T will corner you I have found. So perhaps an update in there somewhere would be nice.--Enjoyment--Overall I really enjoyed this game and will continue to play it. It's on the relaxing side, while a nice refreshing take on the strategy simulator/survival genre.I definitely recommend this game, and for those of you who would enjoy seeing my play-through feel free to check out my let's play video below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXijUmwvNpUThanks!"

It takes about ten minutes to learn how to play, which admittedly is a long time, but once you've got it this game presents ample opportunity for creative society building.This game is *not* a massively sophisticated resource management simulation. Instead it is a delightful chance to imagine how generations might survive the apocalypse given barely enough science and a strong vault door.Life in Bunker lives up to what it promises and then some. There are some bugs, and nonetheless the experience is both immersive and compelling. If you think this game is for you, I would be willing to bet that you're right."

I just had a game where my power was low, so a bunch of things shut down, including my water pumps. This is fine, except my resources panel showed no lack of power, it showed a lack of water. This would lead one to believe they need to build more water pumps, when in fact you need more power.Disasters happen far too frquently, especially on low. I played through with normal and low disasters and noticed no difference. I would applaud an off option for disasters as well.Growing people with limited life spans is a little redundant. You are constantly checking to make sure your people are assigned to a job. This needs a little more automation. Perhaps at the very least give a default job upon reaching adulthood and allow us to simply change them where we see fit? Starting them with no job at all makes no sense, especially during busy disaster periods when you accidently miss a few people reaching adulthood. Also life spans need to be a little longer.Make the notification for reaching adulthood and retiring different please! I am busy trying to manage things and get excited when I think I can assign a new worker, only to find out I lost one instead to old age. Why is the icon the same for these things?My people just don't feel like they want to live. The AI is just awful. They battle molemen with no regard for self preservation. This should be something I order them to do or not. Maybe create another job for soldiers? They should at least retreat when there is 3 molemen and they are alone, not fight to the death time and again!"

Those coming to this game hoping for a Dungeon Keeper style campaign may be disappointed. You have one mission and that is to create a livable bunker and survive through multiple generations until the lands above are habitble. That isn't to say there isn't variety though. When creating your bunker you have several options you can tweak to change paramters in your game which in turn will have an impact on how that particular bunker plays out. This combined with the fact that each map is randomly generated means there is real incentive for multiple playthroughs.There are a few reviews that raise issue with the tutorial or the UI or the difficulty. Personally I've had no issue with the game in any of these regards. The tutorial is well thought out and gives you a firm grasp of the mechanics, it also guides you around the UI which (to my mind at least) is very functional and easy to navigate. In regards to the difficulty, there is a learning curve when adressing resource management and things like timing the next generation of dwellers but it's a fun challenge and it's very satisfying when you work these things out and start getting your bunker in to a smooth well oiled rhythm.This game in my opinion is currently absolutely worth the asking price and will soon leap in to being an absolute steal when more features and community suggestions start coming in."

It's basically Fallout's setting with the Vaults, only without the Great War. It's Dungeon Keeper for the gameplay only without the fun. It's the same with Evil Genius and without outsiders poking around. And it's Sheltered without the chance of going out and exploring.All in all, this is a very dull game. I don't like the graphics that much. I do like the challenge you face. You have to maintain a steady population, they grow old and old people can't do anything, your kids can't do anything and you need to supply all of them with food. This is more of a game meant as an experiment to see if the gameplay can work. And I think it does. You just need to be patient and give it a better backstory and improve the graphics so we don't get the ugly box biceps.But sadly, this game doesn't explain ANYTHING. Like, what are those molemen doing here? Have they always been there? And what's with the giant Larvae? Where did they come from? And how come the giant meteor was on a path on to Earth? Shouldn't we have noticed that long ago or done something about that? Granted, that's why we have the Bunker. We saw it and we left most of humanity to die to save a handful of people.If you want this gameplay to go somewhere, you could buy this game, but only because there are no alternatives save the ones I mentioned previously.

Once you've gotten over the steep learning curve, it a pleasure to play.After playing through the full 500yrs there was a couple of features, I wish was included however.Notable the function recycler; although an expediant way of getting rid of all the trash that my little humies created. It ould had been better, had it generated a small amount of building material. Even if the ratio was 10 trash to 1 build piece, it would have gotten me out of a hole I found myself in mid game. Running out of ore to mine and lacking the build pieces need to construct a new drill & power it; it saw me ripping up half the base just to get the required resources.Research points however, it seems I couldn't get rid of fast enough. By the end of my 2rd play through, I had amased around 2k's worth; so It definatly needs an extra use for them.The mole men, in the end, turned out to be no trouble at all. Simply keep a plot of the cave visable but unused and wall them in. They can roam round to their heart's content, while barely effecting my little humies at all. So long that is, that the rest of the living space was floored, which prevent the little blighters from poping up inside my bunker and bringing my humies's lives to a swift end, as was the case with my first bunker. Well live and learn!All in all, it was a lovely game to play.Alex (430Flox), it'll be intresting to see what you do next."

Hopefully the devs will update with a lot more stuff. You can choose not to leave the bunker after the 50 cycles when the earth is cleaned up and continue to build out your bunker but its just not worth doing since your just repeating the same build.

It's a resource management game, if you've played them before it's nothing ground breaking or revolutionary. But the graphics are cute, there are enough moving elements to keep it interesting, and you can play with the settings to make it as hard or easy as you'd like. I think there is plenty of replay value in playing with different difficulties and set ups. The most interesting part right now is definitely the first part of the game, when you're trying to keep eveyone alive and allocate your limited resources, but near the end game, unless you've attempted to massively expand the population, it's pretty easy to reach a point where everything just runs itself. But the dev has been pretty responsive and I think the game will only get better as they tweak the game. If you like resource management games, and want a fairly cute post-apocolyptic one with plenty of moving parts to manage, I think this is definitely worth your time."

Minus the horrific (And sometimes kinda cool) Social experiments. Instead you're fighting to ensure humanity survives to repopulate an earth devistated by an asteroid.It has some down points though, things are pretty limited. Structures are pretty repetitive. There's no real science aspect with the labs. Things can break down quite easily. And sometimes they break down too often. There's no way to defend yourself against Molement besides having your people pummel them with shovels. You can't decorate your Vault and make it feel more like a home. After all it is meant to support a populace for 500 Years (50 cycles), you could at least have gardens etc. Like a Aerponics room to grow food and plants but also contributes to oxygen production and happiness, while costing a lot of power and water.Good Luck Overseers!8/10"

Even when the future of the bunker and their race is at stake, they will happily slack off while suffocating because the generator is dead. Farmers outright refuse to actually farm, leading to food shortages and starvation, and god help you if your people suffer from disease because the medic just despises work.Could it have been a good game? Hell yeah, though a bit lacking, it's got a solid foundation, however the stupidity and slacker nature of the residents means they're a bigger threat than anything else.Until that issue is fixed, I cannot reccommend this game, and I'm genuinely sorry for that.

Startled, the random residents look up from what ever they have been doing (eating dirt, licking the walls, or playing with faeces) and make a stampede to get to any new area they can.When the dust settles, and the new walls are in place - you will usually find the majority of residents in pockets of air BEHIND the walls where they stare blankly at the wall and start to cry. If freed, they will even see someone building the last section of wall and make a beeline to be on the other side again.I also had a resident who broke a toe on a treadmill... at the start of the game when I don't have any treadmills.I would like to be able to play this game, but at the moment its causing rage-quit.

The research helps a bit ... but by the end-game I had four or 5 drills running, and they couldn't keep a single refinery supplied, and getting to that point was tedious in its own right.In addition, each level has only about 1500 - 2k building materials, (with nearly 1k of that spent on the lift and life-support), leaving them pretty much barren of anything save some 1 tile wide ""corridors"" between each resource pocket / rift."
