,Recommended,401800,29808743,Posted: 9 February,all,Flashydragon,"I've supported Pixeljam for a few years now, and I like a fair bit of their stuff. Bitku is different, yes. imo it's pretty viral, and memetastic. I mean, if you have zero creative desire, you should probably avoid this game, as it's not expressely a *game,* with a set *objective*...there's no points, no real scoring system, and all you can really do with your work, is export it, lol.but if you're looking to craft weird stories, make funny memes, or aotherwise do something a bit different, with an 8-bit retro spin, give this a try! I did this in about 5 minutes, behold my masterpiece!https://ibb.co/gYe0Tv(I mean, it's free, what else were you exepcting, exactly?)"
,Recommended,401800,29807064,Posted: 9 February,all,Invain,"Bitku invites you to stretch your imagination and come up with a story using just a handful of random pieces. It's not much of a game, but it's fun to play with for a while."

The game limits you in a sense where you only have few materials, but can create infinitely from those materials.I suppose its not everyones cup of tea, and appears a bit goofy at first glance, but i like trying to figure out what I can do with the picture pieces the game gives me and see if I can create a cohesive story with it.7/10I think the game is awesome, if it had steam workshop and could play the comics like flipnotes i think it would be amazing. Try it its free."

It allows you to access your creativity without being overwhelmed with too many possibilites.  It gives you an accessable framework to start pondering how to put things together in a creative way to get the visionary juices flowing.I actually found myself being even more creative, having to think outside of the box, on how I could repurpose items in the limited collection to create the result I was looking for.Good job Pixeljam!I love your games and your creative vision!  Keep up the great work!"

,Recommended,401800,29811981,Posted: 9 February,all,Cube of Ages,Played the beta of this when it was first released. I like the limitations - Gotta work with what you're dealt. It's a lot of fun!
76561198209318897,Recommended,401800,29816184,Posted: 9 February,all,Ophl,"Just started playing this and I'm already loving it. If anyone's confused, you start off with a creation with a topic of your choice out of two it gives you. With that topic, you are given 10 objects/characters/backgrounds which you can use each panel of the four. You can edit your objects by resizing, altering a pose, rotating or mirroring a object (except backgrounds which sucks), change color of a object, and add text. At the end, you are able to export your image to your PC, where you can share to wherever you want. If your not finished with a comic, you can always save and exit but be warn, if you start a new comic while you already made another one, your progress for the previous one will be removed, as when you've started a new one, it'll override your previous progress, which again I recommend the developers make multiple slots for comics. If you didn't get any of this, there's also a tutorial, which comes in handy. The graphics are like your standard 8-bit Pixeljam games put into artistic symbols. Sadly there's no music, but it fits I guess. There are also tons of references to other Pixeljam games like Dino Run, Potatoman, etc. So yeah, Bitku is a good game which will challenge the player to work with what they got, but has a few flaws that need fixing, but nothing to turn away gamers."

,Not Recommended,401800,29833081,Posted: 10 February,all,Lady 3Jane,"the idea of a software giving you ideas every time you start a new project is good, but this is just too limited to do anything, not even cranking out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ comic after ♥♥♥♥♥♥ comic is satisfying because you have the 6 objects the program gives you and nothing else, not even line drawing!"

,Not Recommended,401800,29804549,Posted: 9 February,all,Gaming Authoritah,"The comic creator....well, perhaps I'm not its target market. The available graphics seem limited. It's OK if you're trying to do basic transforms.  But one wonders if MS paint would do a better job...just saying.Make up your own mind with this gameplay:https://youtu.be/PMWys3RR8aw"

You literally get 6 things to choose from. I was miserable having to play this stupid thing for five minutes just to leave this review.
