The experience is short. Very short. You'll be done in a little over an hour. The previews have made the game look like a lot more  polished experience than it is. Below are the issues which I have encountered.1. The Game Doesn't Launch in VR Mode - I was unable to run the game on muy HTC VIVE until I set the executable (""jottun.exe"") into Windows 7 compatibility mode, which was extremely frustrating to troubleshoot.2. Poor Controls - This game begs for touch controls but the developers have made a choice to have it work exclusively with a gamepad, maing the expeience a sitting one. As the result, the movement is unpleasant and turning, regardless of the choice of control you make, is either incredibly nauseating (it takes a -LOT- to make me sick in VR. I pretty much never feel even a bit queasy. Using the ""natural turning""  ade my stomach swim almost immediately). You are able to make choices and communicate by nodding or shaking your head which is terrific. The rest of the control scheme is clunky and unpleasant to experience.3. Stiff, ""Dead"" Characters - though the sence of scale is great and the art style is delightful, the characters animate in a very poor, stiff way, stanidng in default poses, barely moving, except for opening and clothing their mouths and, occasionally, blinking. Everyone just stands there, upright and manequin-like, walking and turning in an awkward way. On the bright side, the character models and environments are beautifull.4. Uninspired Voice Acting - Voices seem fitting to the characters they come out of but feel stiff, boring and uninteresting. Your character's father's voice is particularly flat, as is the oen belonging to the first distraufght vilager you find upon returning ""home"".5. Price - Fot as short, clearly unfinished, and unpolished game, ""Fated"" costs a lot more than it should. I would -gladly- pay $20 and more for a short yet breathaking and engaging game. I desperately wanted ""Fated"" to be it and it just wasn't.If you are looking for a great episodic game on the VIVE, I urge you to try ""The Gallery: Call of Starseed"" if you want to know what I am talking about here - it's worth every penny and is an unforgettable experience. ""Fated"", on the other hand is bland, poorly animated and uncomfortable to traverse at this point in time."

If it were $20 for all future episodes it would be a great deal, but from what i understand we paid $20 for what is a 1.5 hour game. If all episodes end up costing the same, then this will end up being a VERY expensive game once they finish every episode, and its clearly not worth that much.I have some other minor complaints like Walking seems a little slower then it should be, but overall i did enjoy the game. It is fairly well polished. Its a bit of a walking simulator, with a few puzzles, but the story keeps flowing. The giant actually makes your heart beat because in VR its legit scary.I can't downvote a game i enjoyed, but i do feel the price is too high for one short episode. As much as i like roomscale games with motion controls I have zero complaints about the lack of motion controls because the game works fine with a Xbox controller while sitting down.

Will there be more episodes or is this is it....it says episodic but it is not clear if it means the episodes included in the 90 mins or future episodes.Lot of potential and the fact that they added many ways of combating motion sickness, including snap rotation to a degree of your choice, or fluid rotation with a choice of speed, or on screen comfort markers, is great and i wish all developers would do this as it will eliminate motion sickness for many and is better than teleportation (snap did it for me, or fluid rotation at full speed with tiny taps on the stick also is great as its kind of like snapping but with more control). Sadly, it's very short, so if you are on a budget £14.99 for 90 mins might be to much."

Like most games this early on its a bit light on content for the price. I still think its worth the purchase. Need more games like this. Not to go in to spoilers it has som nice action sequences with great sense of scale and vertigo. It has standard 1st person controls, but it works great. Using snap turns I didn't get I'll. The walking is slow enough for that not to happen, at least not to me. Recomended.On a side note it wouldn't launch in VR for me at first, playing on Vive. That is a known problem with Unreal games when you also have Oculus Home installed. Uninstalled that and worked flawlessly."

Also there's loads of comfort / movement options to choose from and you can change them on the fly in the game which is always nice.The only downside is that it's pretty short and it's arguably expensive for such a short story but I guess that's the trend for VR games since it's such a niche market.Other than that, 5/5, would recommend to anyone owning a Rift / Vive."
,Recommended,401820,22702792,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,elephantbutt,"Played on a DK2 with Oculus' 1.3 Runtime.This game is visually stunning, the low-poly environment is brought up to almost Dreamworks/Pixar levels by the excellent texture work. There's lots of techniques done really right for making convincing VR, e.g. a tracked torso that moves as you do (as does your shadow), and characters' gazes follow your own. It's easy to get swept away in the narrative, and the game's world is very lively. I initially intended to play just one act then ended up playing through the whole thing from start to finish. Note that this is definitely a movie-like narrative experience first, and a game second.The presence of animated, fully voice-acted human characters really breathes life into narrative games, even more so in VR. This shouldn't be taken for granted, it's something missing from quite a few VR experiences at this early stage. The characters in FATED are all really well done. I've seen at least one review criticize the voice acting, but that's a problem with video games in general and FATED's voice acting is fine, it's at least better than any Bethesda RPG.FATED's price is undoubtedly steep for a 1.5 to 2 hour long game. Discounting the economic necessities of developing for a niche, budding or unproven technology, I suppose you could compare the price per unit time to paying a similar amount for going to the cinema with snacks, which provides the ""immersion"" of a large screen and surround sound, both of which are easily surpassed by VR, where you feel like you're really there,Some occasional bugs are present but not particularly distruptive and will probably be fixed with time, so my only real criticism is the rune puzzles, which are embarrassingly simple whether they were supposed to be created by humans or giants, and really don't make sense being there. I understand not wanting to stall the narrative by getting the players stuck, but really, were they trying to keep out babies? The game's story, lively world and characters are its strength and it seemed pointless to throw these in. (This was just a criticism of the ""puzzles"", not the handful of brief action sequences, all of which definitely added to the game.)FATED is well worth picking up for the experience of dreaming while you're awake, if the price isn't an issue for you."

Some of the comments seem to indictate that this is en episodic thing, but I've found nothing from the creators that suggest that. If that is the end of the story, then I'm angry, and I dont get angry easily. And I'm not saying that because it is a relatively pricey game that is only an hour long, I'm saying that because it has one of those endings that is done so poorly that you actually get angry. Absolutely no resolution.You're brought back to life at the beginning of the game to protect someone's life. You fail. The end. You dont know why the person was important enough to warrant reviving the dead to protect them and you dont see any consequences that arise as a result of your failure. They die, end. And they die in a way that is not at all plot-relevant. The game literally ends in the middle of a dungeon.Aside from that, I found that many of the other reviews were spot-on. The game has its good moments, but the characters all have these big-soulless eyes that give an uncanny valley vibe, the voice acting is just as wooden as the characters, and the walking speed is way too slow. The NPCs even walk faster than you! And they can run, too! If I ever learn that this is not, in fact, the end of the game, then I will remove this review. But until then, I cant reccommend this game to anyone."

,Recommended,401820,22706576,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Brancki,A pretty short but worthwhile story expierence. While it is alot of walking there's plently of dialogue to keep you busy on your journey. Between all that you get some nice action scenes inbetween to spice things up a bit. Althought its a shame it is not longer as soon you get all connected with the story it comes to an end. This does not make it a bad game you just want more of it.Aside from the only game that provides a story progression with intresting characters on your side you get a good choice of comfort options and resolution scale in options menu. I think its worth it for the expierence. The price is what it is beceuse of the niche market currently now. And this game has been in development for almost 2 years thats why they went with controller support only. You cant implement motion controls that did not exist and was not designed for.It works for HTC vive and oculus rift and yes you can use your steam controller.
,Recommended,401820,26443544,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Paethon,"Where this ""game"" shines is the characters. They are well animated, voiced and just feel very real despite the very cartoony style (or maybe because of it). In this regard it is probably one of the best VR experiences at the moment and for that reason I would also recommend it.BUT:1) This is not really a game. There are a few puzzles and a few parts where you have a slight interaction with the world, but for the most part you push forward on your gamepad to progress along the extremely linear levels and navigate to the right spots (which are even highlighted) so the next scripted sequence can start. I felt especially cheated in the ending sequence which is somewhat dramatic and you soon realize that the control you are given during that sequence is completely meaningless. Personally I think the developers could have made a completely non-interactive experience out of it and it would have worked better.2) The story is pretty forgettable and the ""game"" ends at a point where the prologue of a normal story driven game would end. I.e. the premise of the story might be interesting, but you don't really get much more than the premise.In summary: Buy the game because it shows what might be possible in VR in the future (esp. regarding emotional attachment to virtual characters), but don't expect a teriffic story or an actual game."

This was a bit annoying as I was standing there looking at them expecting dialogue.Second the controls could use some tweaking, the comfort options are great but what would have made this game would have been motion controls and idle interactions.Multiple times I wanted to reach out and pat Lif on the head, I reached for Svens torch before he was able to hand it to me or I wanted to take Freyas hand when we sat next to eachother. Small things that could have been done with the current controls.I hope in future chapters motion controls will be implemented.Lastly many seem to have issue with the freelook/body turning motion they used in the game. This could be remedied with a snap body to head orientation control such as clicking a thumbstick.PROS:Story is heart-wrenching and convincingThe visuals are prettyVoice acting added to the game rather than detractedCONS:Lack of motion controlsControl scheme and mechanics could be improvedInteraction with NPCs could improveThe game is only 9.99 and I would say though short, it is worth it.

It is short, and the price may be an issue for some.When I started, it spun me out, the colours, the characters, but when I began moving I became nausious, only when turning though. I never get motion sickness so this was concering. I ended up changhed to snap turn and that fixed the motion sickness I was getting.Yes the story is short, but  considering it's one of the longer games on vive I've played I was actually quite surprised. Some games are 8$ for 15 minutes of play, so consider that when buying this game. It's also the first episode, and I can't wait for the second, as in most stories they take you to the point of no return and leave you hanging there.To summerise this game, for me it was pretty. There isn't a lot to do in the way of interaction, but again I enjoyed sitting back and watching the story unfold. If you're a hands on person then this likely isn't for you. but if your a fantasy nerd like myself you may find it ropes you in.Note, I also have a bad back, and I was able to sit and play this game, which was very appealing to me.Hope you enjoy it."

This means you need to be able to walk around a bit and explore your surroundings - even though ultimately you will be sheparded into the next scene since that is really the only place to go.When you can only walk at 2mph like in this game, nobody has the patience to try and walk around to look at anything.  So you just walk in straight lines from one thing to the next.Game is very short.  Granted, I walked mainly in straight lines to the next thing, but still, 80 minutes total.  If you explore a little more, you're still definitely less than 2 hours.For graphics, the characters look good - the ground looks awful.

Due to the nature of the game I wouldn't suggest it for those which are prone to VR sickness, even though there are a number of sickness reducing meathods implemented by the Dev.Note: While I enjoyed it and thought it worth the money at the steam sale price, I would not ourtright recommend it at the full price due to the gameplay length."

It still feels like a well-polished tech demo, all these months later.Without motion control or an updated locomotion paradigm, this purchase will leave you frustrated and feeling like you're on a last-gen VR set.  The publisher should consider a significant price drop or some badly needed updates."

Time to play target practice with a doll!Overall, it feels like the devs bit off more than they could chew. There are a ton of voiced Characters, for example, which have nice looking models but are *very* wooden feeling with little facial and hand animation. It was just super hard to get sucked into the world or the story.FATED looks pretty good in screenshots but I noped out of it after half an hour."

I haven't had that feeling with other games. I think its because you need to use the xbox one controller and you dont always travel in the same direction as your controller. Not a good feeling.. Forgotten realms is a much better experience because it uses the Vive controllers and doesnt give you the horrible sensation."

The opening scene is on a moving wagon :) But I made it up until I had to walk forward .. then it was all over.Will try it again when they support snap forward or some sort of teleport.

Some of the ideas here are amazing i only wish there would have been more action. I wish i could have wielded a sword or even shot a couple enemies with the bow, and last but not least it would have been nice to fight the giant in a god of war fashion."

,Recommended,401820,34928734,Posted: 13 September,all,プリンス・モクサン💖,"Pros:+Great soundtrack+Interesting storyCons:-Gives the player a body-Slow NPC reaction timesThoughts:The soundtrack, sound design, and environments were very immersive. The story was surprising and ended somewhat abruptly, but it was very touching and relatable. There were a couple of bumps in the experience, however. First of all, the player is given a body, which is problematic in VR (if you are sitting and the character is standing, there is an odd disconnect between what you feel and see). It is much easier to make the player invisible, except for the hands. Secondly, after asking the player a question, the NPCs wait a little bit too long and it becomes awkward.Score:7/10"
