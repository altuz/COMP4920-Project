76561198040837514,Recommended,401890,21085794,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Brudda,"There isn't much to say except that if you like the ""Warriors""/musou game series, this would be a great addition to your library.  Although I should say this, youmustbe a fan of the series or else you won't get the full experience out of it, you might as well be playing dynasty warriors.The gameplay is very similar to the dynasty series, borderline copy and paste almost...But with some variation to make it not such a direct copy.  You find cards on the battlefield after defeating certain enemies, completing objectives, or finishing a level.  These cards give you passive buffs such as increased power, defense, musou/special gauge attributes, increased health, etc...In order of increasing rarity you have C, B, A, (possibly S as well, I will change this once if I find one).  As you go up in rarity you get more passives per card.  There is a mini card crafting menu that lets you combine (10) cards to create a new one.What I did enjoy though is the mount combat, I haven't played a dynasty game where you kind of want to fight on your horse.  You can actually pull of combos, which I find is a very nice touch.Weapons, you can carry two at a time and can swtich between them in combat.  The weapons work in such a way that as you keep using your selected weapon and defeat enemies it will get stronger by recieveing elemental effects and increased combos.  And you can get different weapons which have different elemental properties, there are 4 in total.The story mode follows the current season 1 anime very closely, so if you haven't finished watching then I would suggest to avoid this game if you don't want any spoilers.  Progression through the story is seamless it goes:  Battle -> story cutscene -> battle -> story cutscene -> battle and repeat.  There is no pause in between to equip cards or weapons, it is all done in the menu during the battle phase.The game is quite linear.  You are free to move around and kill enemies, but eventually you have to complete a certain objective to advance.  The stages are broken up in segments, so continuing with my explanation, you have to do/complete certain objective to advance to the next segment. You cannot proceed if you don't complete it.Then of course you have all the different characters you can play, each having their own skillset and weapon of choice.I should also mention that there is online-coop, I personally haven't tried it yet, maybe a bit down the road.  But it is there for those that want to jump into online play right away.Graphics, I feel are very nice, the whole anime-style drawing of characters with the 3D-ish backgrounds.  You have many graphic options in the menu that you can mess around, which I feel is very nice for those that do like to change their graphical settings.  I'm not so great with the terminology with these settings, I just set it to whatever they give me, but I will say the visuals are very pleasing to my eye.From a hours:money stand point.  I feel it is a bit overpriced, you're pretty much paying for the anime name, which I don't see it being justifiable of a 60$ USD price tag, this feels more like a 30-40$ game.  So you must like the anime and the gameplay to almost justify this purchase.Overall this is great game, a solid ""warriors"" type of game.  And one last time, I can't stress this enough though, you must like the anime in order to get the full enjoyment out of this game, else the game will be mediocre to you.  I hope this review helps you decide in purchasing this game or not.*edit* 2/18/2016:  So after putting some hours into the game, I would like to change my opinion a little bit about needing to like the anime before purchasing this game.  The gameplay is actually really fun.  After spending some time and unlocking new weapon combos, they look and feel really cool.  The combos feel really unique and fit the characters really well, which I really enjoyed.With that said, I feel that if you do like Musou kind of games, you can definitely enjoy this game without having to watch the anime.  As for price I still stand by my review  in that it is a bit overpriced.  BUT if you do have some extra cash to spare, then by all means purchase this game, it is worth it."

This is KT best port of a Dynasty Warrior type game I have played, however it still has a lot of flaws.Reasons to avoid:- If you play with KB and Mouse.  Game doesn't support using mouse.  Button prompts are xbox360 so you need to memorize the keyboard controls.- If you prefer English dub audio. This game has Japanese audio only.- Not familiar with anime. Not require to watch anime since cut-scenes summaries episodes.You can watch Arslan anime steaming from Funimation website. Subbed is free, dubbed requires subscription.- Not using a 16:9 aspect ratio display.- Possible performance issues with AMD video card drivers.Improvements compared to other KT games- Able to select resolutions above 1080p.- A lot of graphics options to configure.- PS4 level of quality and better if your system can handle it.Suggestions for KT:- Add mouse support to control camera.- Support multiple button prompts. If player is using keyboard switch to keyboard button prompts if player starts using controller switch to controller prompt.  Allow modders to customize controller button images to support other type of controllers.- Add more AA options such as SMAA.- Don't lock real time rendered cut-scenes at 30fps.Issues encountered:- Performance issues with resolution 1440p and high settings.  My Titan X usage isn't maxed out and CPU has very little load.  I have to switch to medium setting or 1080p.  Even at 1080p there are some frame drops.- When displaying on my TV game doesn't launch properly showing a green screen in full screen mode and causes performance issues.  I get around this issue by launching game in windowed mode then switching to full-screen in game.Video of tutorials at start of game. Detailed tutorial prompts don't display since I already completed them.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620740830"

Arslan: Warriors of Legend has perhaps the best combat of any Musou game, the best action, the best graphics, the best 'story' (clearly borrowed from an anime), the best character selection, and the best- well, everything.But the entire game is let down by a lack of content.  Previous Musou games guaranteed not only dozens of hours of main story to chew through, but plenty of free modes, unlockables, and 'what ifs'.  Arslan gives none of that and only has a 9 hour long story-mode to show for it with 150 dollars of cut content resold to the player as DLC.It's a shame, too, since the story was lovely and well presented.  Even at half-price (30 USD at time of writing), it wasn't enough of a game to make me feel like I got my money's worth though."

The combat is very fluid , very dynamic, and have an adition of a infinite combo system, that if you know what your doing you can chain attacks forever!Technically , KT finally listened and the game can run at 4k, provide your system can run it, and the graphics are beautifull, run at 60 fps , but it have a 30 fps lock on mid-battles cutscenes for when you destroy a barrier with the cavalry, but they are fast animations and dont distract you from the action, you would only notice that if you run with a fps counter. The transition to in-game engine from anime cutscenes is pretty well done too!Heard AMD can have drops in fps, i run on Nvidia and didnt had any fps drops was solid 60 all the time.All in all, its worth its price, lots of fun, and a must have for Musou fans :)"

,Not Recommended,401890,22722353,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,Caex,"The game has a few major issues, of which I will post here:1) The gameplay. For those of you who are drawn here as Dynasty/Samurai warriors fans, know that the gameplay in this game will feel like a snail's pace when compared to these two series. Instead of there being officers proper in the game, the game throws a lot of 'Generals' at you, and the 'Generals' are frequently uninteresting in their combat style. Compared to the consistent named-units you get in the Dynasty/Samurai warriors games, this honestly feels like you're fighting fodder to get to a 'boss' at the end of a level.And what this does is create a feeling of wasting time until you can get to the end.Not only that, but the idea of the 'Charges' - while a brilliant idea that's fun in the first execution or two - does not stay fun. Once you've done it once or twice, all it becomes is a mechanic that has you 'moving forward' instead of feeling like the leader of an army.2) The visuals. Dear god, the visuals. Anime style is perfectly fine - I would've LOVED if the anime visuals were beautifully done, like watching an anime. That'd of been a huge turn-on for me personally. Instead, we got some kind of mutant abomination of anime - where every character does not feel like they were animated, so much as they were drawn on a page, cut out of the page, and treated like cardboard cutouts placed overtop a background with mouthes that flash up and down in the movement.3) The story - I do not think I am qualified to overly talk on this one, but the initial presentation of the story created a very repetitious level design out the gate. You start with a story that has you do a few mechanics. Cool, I can get into that! Then it cuts to a flashback of... something, in the past. Which is really just a nicely-masked tutorial. Ok, cool.Then we start the very first level again, only... from a few minutes before the same point we had already played. Literally, the first level... Played itself twice. So it was a slice of the level that it made you play twice with an extension on the beginning/end... It just didn't really feel fluid.The things I liked:+ I felt the tutorials were nicely implemented into the game, to create story+gameplay. I like when games do that, though everyone may not agree.+ I like the customization of the characters, and know that had I been able to get into this game, I would've enjoyed using the 'cards' system to customize my stats and skill loadouts.+ Voice acting is really nice, though it's only in Japanese. I didn't mind it too much.+ THE GAME HAS CO-OP CAMPAIGN! Can play through with a friend, BUT A huge minus because your friend has to be either CLEARED of the stage OR ON THE SAME STAGE AS YOU, or else they can't join. So, if you're gonna pla with someone, make sure you're at the same point or one of you will be going back!This was a refund for me. I might re-buy it at $20.00, but not worth it at $50.00"
76561198068920890,Recommended,401890,21211692,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,Wirewing,"I feel like I can review this now after 10 hours before I sink another 60 hours in.Positive Remarks:This game marks a turning point for KT and for all of us who love their Omega force games. This game needs more positive attention.  I mean that in the most don't ♥♥♥♥ this up for us kind of way.  I want more of this sub genre in their catalogue. Curse me, I even want more DLCs.I knew before I started the game I would love it -the instant I saw it. Usually, that feeling is met by severe disappointment.  Not so this time, Not so, Sir! There are unlockables in this game. Unlockables. Allow me to explain the gravity of that to the uninitiated:  that's stuff they could have just charged you for on DLC.They have kept the same broth for this lovely stew but added some unique flavors.  The combat system is varied from character to character. You don't have the rigid, ""normal-normal-strong MUSOU!"" kind of solution - although it's still there as a core of the game and having an anime shell makes it more poignant as a system. The equipment system includes both weapon ability upgrades and stat upgrades.The animations are top notch. The characters are fleshed out with an intro mission, at least two paragraphs description and a character-specific side mission apiece. The story isn't predictable -although it may seem that way to people who don't grasp what dramatic irony is supposed to accomplish.Now for the bad side:Arslan himself is annoying AF! I want his story to end or grow up. He's an ok vehicle for the story and vagaries posited by the writers but man, that kid was not raised to meet the needs of a medievel, feudal, class-based society entrenched by recurring iconoclasm, religious monarchies and psychotic nepotism.  Seriously, it's just bad parenting.  Secondly, The constant dialogue is annoying as well. Mostly because there's not a drop of english and I get tired of being reminded of that.The neutral:The way that slavery is addressed is extremely east Asian. You'll see. There are other tropes, memes and themes."

Very solid game and it is indicative of the direction that Japanese game makers are going.  Keep this trend up (60 fps, online coop, polished quality product).I have never heard of the Arslan series until yesterday, but it matters not.  The story is there for fans of the series, but the gameplay is where the meat is for this title.  I appreciate that greatly, and it is nice to see that KT has not dropped the ball on this one.  The new gameplay elements separate this from DW, and that is a great thing!  If you like the DW, SW, or any other KT title, this game is fit nicely into your Steam collection.Thanks, gents!"

If you just want a dynasty warriors game get the real thing. Koei ports on PC aren't usually great and this is a good example. Game lags when lots of enemies are on screen. I already knew this buying the game but the dialog is in Japanese with english subtitles which appear frequently in battle and its really hard to read while playing the game. It takes a bit to get used to the all keyboard controls scattered all over the place. Use a controller if support is available. This game follows the story line from the anime pretty close. I have finished the series and nothing much is changed in the game which is why I really only recommend this game if your an fan or research the game before buying.

We have a PS4 port instead of a PS3 port, Controller button prompts, 4K support, and Online multiplayer all in one port. The game itself is around 10 hours long with not much replayability but the actual story/gameplay is quite good. Here are the issues, or rather single issue about the port:- Framedrops like crazy (Even on lowest settings around small crowds my framerate drops to about 30-40 with an FX-8370 and GTX 970 on lowest settings, which shouldn't happen.) (Mardan Rushes dropped my framerate to 13 FPS at one point on medium settings.)"
,Recommended,401890,21110215,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,DaPhuuLz,"a little Better version of Dynasty Warrior maybe?Gameplay Mechanics:The game has some progression on weapon arts. you unlock different combos as you use the weapon and level them up.then you have the Skill Card that will give you different stat boosts. a character can equip up to 3 cards which will cost them the skill points ( level up to have more skill point to equip bigger cards)This game has Mardaan Rush (something) that you can activate Cavalry Charge, Infantry charge, Archer Barrage and such. It does ridiculous amount of chain combo. (like 2k-60k chains) and can use to get the objective or getting through some obstacle.Pros:-The game able to go beyond 60 fps (vsync off)-Mindless Slaughter (like all DW games?)-Anime-Graphics is nice. and have many resolutions (can go 4k i think) and advance options (in-game AA is not very good)- Local co-op (split screen works just fine. in fact, you get more FOV this way) Online Multiplayer(?) I have yet to find an online match. been waiting for recruit / found no one looking for recruit. FYI none of my friend play this game lol. so no point sending invite to any of them.Cons:-super narrow FOV.-poor Camera control. Cannot change camera speed. No target lock. very limited angle. (it's super bad when your character is next to wall in which you cannot rotate camera because it's somehow stuck to the wall and try to look at your character)-what is mouse? is it delicious?-poor Control. For example the Guard button will turn your camera to where the character facing. it also use for dodge (guard+direction). It also turn the camera to face the direction you're dodging. Result is a super spinning camera. Combine witn Super narrow FOV for great disoriente effect combo.also the characters seem to be able to move 8 directions with the left 'analog' stick. while you can move forward fine turn with right analog stick. (maybe it's just my gamepad?)-poor HUD. the Minimap and Objective panel take 1/3 of the screen on the right, then your character take the center 1/3.but in the end i kind of enjoy the mindless hack and slash and the anime. It takes me like 8-9 hours to get through the main story on Normal mode. my characters Level roughly around lvl 8-16 by the time it's end. but the Max level is 50 and there's still more scenarios to play to levelup weapons/characters, unlock/collect cards recipes and achievements.i'd recommend the game to anyone who is comfortable with playing with Gamepad. and can handle all the cons i mention."

,Recommended,401890,29156963,Posted: 9 January,all,Zellith,"First a short summary on what to expect of the new game by Omega Force the studio that brought you the Dynasty Warriors series. if your a fan of ""Musou"" titles then I'm afraid to say this game is a bit far from other Dynasty titles.though I say that it doesn't necessarily mean anything bad.It just means that the game tried to do something new with Arslan. if your expecting a lot of things to grind for like costumes, side stories or such, afraid to say Arslan does not have much to grind for. but what it does have is a good combo system that takes after the years of experience that the studio Omega Force has cultivated. one thing new to the game is the ""Charge Shift"" system that makes you feel like one of them bad♥♥♥♥♥♥commanders in one of them [insert feudal era movie here].Honestly it was fun ramming into hordes of pitiful enemies who falls to their deaths when charged by hundreds no thousands of calvary and infantry men in the game. it was a short but fun experience.Gameplay:The gameplay is a modified ""Dynasty Warriors"" game, the characters are all OP as usual but even more so with this title. the grind you may expect from a dynasty game isn't there anymore at least not as much. but that makes it even more or less easier for new players who are fans of the anime who haven't tried dynasty titles to transition in and maybe adjust to the title?I honestly like how each character has his/her own skill sets that doesn't look recycled or modified. though it may have reduced the amount of combos you could do but it is expected of something that is new to the series as Arslan is.Graphics:I'm an anime fan so I'm going to be biased here and say I love how they manage to make a balance between anime and pastel art.Sounds and Voices:Japanese voices what else do you want? English subs? they got 'em too :DOverall:I will recommend the game for people who are fans of the anime or looking for an alternative to Dynasty Warriors."

You actually feel like playing a part of an anime.True its still lots of slash and hack but there is a good variety of characters and interesting scenes. The only comment I woud add is the need for some strategic choices that would make it perfect....I would recommend this game through and through... but just a point of warning... it ends like an anime as well :p

After intial probems that I had to sort due to the fact it read my intel chip rather than gforce.A mousou game that actually runs better than the ps4 version I had to pinch myself.Very responsive combat system evan with dodging and blocking.A very good story and lovely variation in maps and objectives. From one on one duels to full scale front line battles.Finally a port that PC users actually deserve.Please keep them coming :)Cons:Price as much as i love the game it cost me £50 which is £10 pounds more than any ther mousou game and I will fully admit I am not ritch it did hurt my pocket.No keybourd and mouse support. I always use a controller so personally I dont care but there is a large keybourd and mouse community that refuse to use a controller will be annoyed. To be fair koei cant win before they had keybourd prompts and it drove people crazy now they have adressed that keyboourd users are going mad.For the price the game can feel short.all in all 8/10 this game put s a real smile on my face. It would have got a 10 if it was 10 pounds cheaper and the story lasted a little longerwould highly reccomend if you like the genre if you dont like he genre this si nto for you and go back to playing COD BYE
,Not Recommended,401890,33641219,Posted: 18 July,all,President Erect,"Honestly I was prepared to like this game, I`ve always enjoyed the Dynasty/Samurai warriors games and any that use their engines/system of combat, whether it was base games or spinoffs I enjoyed the fast paced combat and mowing down thousands of enemy troops. The game started off promising and I liked the rush point mechanics and the story, but I was quickly lost with the pointless officer barrier mechanic that they put it. How do we take away from an enjoyable fast paced combat system? Put in a barrier that will have to be broken repeatedly in order to do damage to the officer and while they have that barrier they are unaffected by anything hitting them and once its broken it stays down for under 10 seconds before coming back at full strength and having to be broken again."

The game isn't long for a single play through and it's on sale right meow for 50% off so $33.24 CAD is what I paid for it and it took me 11.3 hours to beat the thing with doing some free-mode stuff after... so that means I've paid $2.94 per hour playing this game which is a pretty steep price. So for the current price? Eh it's pretty darn expensive if you only want to play the campaign... It is the full first season of Arslan though with the Keep of Saint Emmanuel so that's cool. So? I'll say this game is a recommend from me due to how much fun I had as an Arslan fan... but only buy this if you love Arslan and haven't played other Mousu games by Koei Tecmo that have better pricing to what you get for game content or singleplayer storyline... even so? Only get it on sale. As a singleplayer game? it's not worth the full price of $66.49 CAD.As for the storyline? I'm a big fan of Arslan and super enjoyed watching the anime series (which you can stream and watch legally AND for free with english subtitles or pay money for english dubs atwww.funimation.com)... and Koei Tecmo of course are the masters of porting anime to games. It's incredible how damn well this game follows the Arslan storyline on missions and outside of them with only very minor tweaks to make the game format work better. This is truly the best marriage of any story telling to video game I have ever seen, and that even tops Telltale Games to give you an idea how highly I rate this game for staying faithful to the source content. :)The gameplay? If you've played Dynasty Warriors or the Samurai Warriors series by Koei Tecmo then you know what to expect. You play as super skilled heroes from the Arslan anime and beat the crap out of heroes/villains and random soldiers who mostly just get their asses handed to them by people who swing their weapons about 99.99% of the time more than they do. There's a few interesting tweaks to the formula like the shields system for both bosses and mini-bosses that takes a bit of getting used to instead of trying to just button mash your way to victory :PThe performance? Eh, this is a spot where sadly this game isn't as good as previous KT ports of console games to PC... Tbh I can't even tell the graphical difference between medium and high settings lol so you're better off running medium settings or heck, even low settings with textures, texture filtering and shadows to medium if you're having bad performance issues, or heck, just set the game to VSYNC mode 2 which is VSYNC on at 30fps which brings it in line with the console version as the game swaps to 30fps during certain special moves like the Mazdan Rush or cutscenes.So the performance isn't that good, but damn, I kinda wish there was a little more meat to the game for the price. The storyline on Samurai Warriors 4-II is about 17 hours and I felt that was well worth the price.. where-as this game is about a third shorter... so if you haven't played Samurai Warriors 4-II? I'd definitely recommend giving that a go... if you love Arslan like I do? Then yeah you'll enjoy the crap outta this game but then feel like your time with the game ran out faster than you though."

Other's have complained of performance issues, but I've had none, so eh.------------------------------------While they can't take credit for creating the world, or creating the main story, they can take credit for telling the story well. The game itself is gorgeous, with fantastic gameplay to boot, and on top of that the world is amazing. Even if you never heard of it like me, it's easy to get yourself immersed into and wanting to know more about it, and the story told is good enough to keep you informed on everything you need to know. The cast and voice acting are all amazing, (all Japenese though, only English Subtitles), and really bring out the character's even more than just their unique looks and combat styles.The story itself is strong and gripping, and the way they tell it is great. There's of course the amazing big battles with plot happening on the field, but there's also the superb animations in between each stage of battle that further the story. It's fun to watch and feels like you're watching a show, getting lost in it's story and cast. The gameplay is like other Warriors games - lot of slashing and hacking. But, they do add some cool features - shields on bosses, stuns, dodges and  unique abilities seperate from a special attack (musou attack). There's also special events on the field of battle, that let you charge with cavarly or infantry, leading destruction in a glorious blaze, or fire volley of arrows with archers. It's a fun game with a nice unique twist and mix put into the Warriors franchise, telling the badass story of Arslan."

This is the first time in a long time that I played a Koei game and really bought into the story. Sure there's a drawback to how most of the characters are very similar in play style and that there's little difference between them other than Daryun who's essentially the LuBu/ZhoaYun of the game, but there is fun gameplay and how the combat system is very fluid. It is a more fast-paced ""DW"" game because in order to get a perfect rating you do have to do a lot of chasing around the map to make sure that events happen (making sure the support unit gets there in time, etc.) and the A.I. in this game are incompetent when left on their own so you do have to make sure certain events happen by your own hard work, which can be stressful, but once you start getting your character at a higher level then that stress goes down and you are able to have an easier time and the only thing time consuimg and annoying would be redoing the battle because you didnt quite get that perfect rating. It's an excellent story that unfortunately cuts you off in a cliffhanger because the game is following the anime and the anime isn't finished so this game's story isn't finished. However, if you can enjoy good gameplay and an excellent (unfiinished) story then I recommend this game, but at a discounted price, because without having a finished story personally it feels like an unfinished product."

The config screen on startup just flat-out didn't work. There were options in-game that solved the problem, but confusingly enough you couldn't access them until you completed the game's ""prelude"", so not a good start.Once my graphics were up to a more manageable middle level, the FPS slowed down considerably (NOT 60, oh no). It wasn't totally unbearable, but after the relative smoothness of DW8 it was jarring to try and play like that. When my game crashed during the first major battle, I decided to get a refund.As for the actual gameplay, it's good. Very similar to regular Dynasty Warriors, though. If you're looking for some Warriors action, just go get DW8. I didn't watch the anime, but for what I saw of the story, I felt like it did a good job of explaining and keeping itself comprehensible for newcomers. If you do like the anime and don't have the PS4 this was ported from, then you wouldn't be making a terrible mistake by buying this.

Half way done with campaign). Its not a bad story by any means, but nothing special.I bring up the japanese only VO in hopes that Koei Tecmo will see that people who are supporting them want English VO. I know why they didn't do it, recording VO is expensive, and this game was a risk. But I'm hoping if these releases are successful, they will be willing to add English VO to their future releases. My main complaint is that, while playing, I have to either focus on combat or reading the call outs, which causes me to either miss short call outs like ""The messenger is running!"" or completing an objective slow.tl;dr:Better than the other licensed warriors games so far.

The controls are poor, horseback combat is lame, and combat on foot is mediocre.  The controls just don't respond well, and the camera's annoying.  It doesn't follow you so you can see what you're doing most of the time.  Enemies just appear in front of you from nowhere, and some disappear for no reason, too.  You only attack on one side of your horse, mostly, and you simply button mash while mounted.  It's not skill based at all.  On foot there's a tiny bit of skill involved, but not much.  Mash buttons, win.  Yeah, if you want ""high scores"" you have to get better, and really learn how to exploit the game mechanics, but it's just not worth the effort.It's too bad the fighting is so poorly done, and so silly.  One guy can't take out thousands of troops no matter how good they are.  It's ridiculous how hundreds of enemies, and a few dozen allied troops, mostly just stand around waiting for you to do something.  They rarely attack, barely do any damage, and generally just mill about on the battlefield waiting to get REPEATEDLY knocked over before they die, and vanish.  The only challenge, other than actually lining up your attacks, comes from mini-bosses and bosses.  That's partially because they have some lame shield mechanic where they *SOMEHOW* regenerate a shield during combat and you have to repeatedly break it down.The ability and gear system consists of cards and styles.  The cards alter your abilities to some extent, and they're limited by your level and their point value.  No matter the point value, you can equip 3 of them maximum.  You can also swap weapons around a bit, and they do have different options for attack styles that each have different effects, but even if you repeatedly hit the right combos they don't always work.  You also don't get to choose your weapon options, or armour, it's just doled out to you and you're stuck with whatever you have.The story is tired and predictable.  That's about all I feel like saying about that.The animation and graphics are okay, nothing special, nothing terrible, but it's clear a lot of work went into it.  It's too bad the gameplay is flat, dull, uninspired and repetitive.There's very little here that will be able to hold my attention, but it might a game some people can enjoy.
