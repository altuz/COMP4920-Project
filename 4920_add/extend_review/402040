(I've read some complaints about this before I bought it, which is pretty shocking to say the least)- If you are looking for a well-rounded, misteryous and fullfilling experience, go for it.I certainly enjoyed the whole game, and did not get tired of it at all, which is something that uses to happen to me lately. Played it in 2 sessions, 3-4h total, and found many carefully placed secrets (most of them were not even needed to complete the game, which is something I personally love) and interesting details.As an indie game fan, I would say this game highlights the difference between a studio who loves their job and COD-like titles.TL;DR: If you want a 3-4h well-rounded indie narrative, go for it!

,Not Recommended,402040,21846249,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,PyroTyger,"It pains me to give this a negative review, but I was left feeling so underwhelmed.I LOVE Room Escape games. From The Room to Submachine and every free Flash game in between - if it has intriguing, logical puzzles then I'll be glad to play. A room escape with an intriguing story line and detailed graphics? Hell yes, I'm sold.The puzzles were... fine. None of them really challenging for a seasoned puzzle addict, more a case of hunting around for the bits you need and putting two & two together. Solid, but not spectacular. Mechanically, they were extremely well implemented, and integrated into the world, and for that I do congratulate the developers - the influence of The Room is clear. One in particular - involving aligning markings to form a pattern - was elegant and truly innovative.But the game falls down hard in the extras that it promises. Without wishing to spoil anything, I found the writing to be clumsy, tired and directionless. It starts as a mystery and smudges seamlessly into the worst of tired tropes, without really making any sense in between. The puzzles and the story don't mesh together in any way - you're told what the arbitrary challenges were for, in-world, but at the same time they're presented as far deeper and more insidious than they are. (Using blunt sinister thematic keywords as passwords is sitll arbitrary - change the theme to Lovecraftian horror and replace the puzzle answers with ""DAGON"" and ""RLYEH"" and nothing is lost, see?)The writing, in short, was a thin thematic skin and nothing more. Which would've been easy to brush off if it hadn't been such a clumsy cultural throwback too. It was like a Mcarthyite fever dream. 1984 for kids. Given the rich detail of the assets and lighting, the theming was all the more jarring.The other big problem was the mechanical immersion. Having the game be first-person is such an interesting and unusual tool for puzzle makers (cf The Witness, Portal, Perspective, FRACT) that, sadly, only ever served to get in the way of this game. Stumbling around furniture in the dark isn't tense or fun, it's just annoying. Not being able to see properly into drawers & cupboards makes the object hunting a chore. Both these problems are nonexistent in room-escape Flash games, but are introduced by using first person perspective. It was a bold move that didn't pay off.And the labyrinth, my god, the labyrinth.The labyrinth really exemplified the problem I had with this game. It wasn't fun. It wasn't challenging. It wasn't tense. It didn't communicate anything about the character, the world, the game mechanics, it wasn't a puzzle or a significant storytelling device, it was nothing. Nothing but a tedious 5m+ trial-and-error walk through a blocky corridor, rendered in quite pretty atmospheric lighting. I just don't see what the developers were trying to achieve or communicate through that device. I don't see why they thought it was a good idea. It was an incongruous, boring intermission.It was a gimmick, not a new or clever one, and it made no sense, didn't tie in thematically or mechanically to anything else, did nothing but frustrate and distract. What was the point?I played the game through in a couple of hours, and enjoyed the puzzles well enough in spite of the problems I've stated. But while I could've played the puzzles quite happily for another two hours, the theme, the 1st-person mechanics, the writing, all would've annoyed me more and more. It ended when it had to, and left no impact in the process.The developers clearly have real talent with regards to building a solid, pretty, functional game, and I hate to imagine that this review might discourage them from pursuing that. They have good ideas, solid mechanical competence, and I want to see more. I just feel like they never had anyone sit down with a critical eye and ask them, ""What is this bit for? What are you trying to accomplish there? What are you hoping to make the player think or feel? Do any of these elements support each other, or are they just thrown in to fill the gaps?"" Some good writing and creative direction could've turned this game into a little gem, but it's not a gem. It's coal. Solid, functional, unexciting - burn it up and it's gone, leaving nothing behind.I'm not angry, just disappointed."

So you have to figure it out by discovering the surrounding and look for clues. To proceed and unfold the story / secret, it is necessary to solve puzzles.The puzzle spectrum (level of difficulty) can be described from simple / easy up to hard and challenging, but always logical. One particular puzzle is based on audio, so you should have good acoustical capabilities. Up to a certain extent, the puzzles are procedurally generated.The decent graphics and sound build up an amazing atmosphere.If you are an achievement hunter and not rushing thru the game, it keeps you busy for a couple of hours.Great game; clear recommendation!Update: Let us be thankful to the benefactor; work hard, increase production…! ;-)"

The graphics were superb and the sound design created instant mood and tension. This was truly the rolls royce of room escape games and a first-person experience that really drew you in. Again, I have ONLY one criticism; that it was short.In other words, I want MORE.Bravo to these devs for giving us an intelligent game for human beings. I hope you make a dozen like it or one a dozen times longer. Either way, you earned a loyal customer today. This game was absolutely EXCELLENT.

The way the music is played and how cryptic the messages are makes you feel like you're constantly being watched with every move you make, which in its own, is very creepy.The puzzles can be a little difficult at times, one of them was so easy but I just needed to take a break from the game for a minute to refresh my mind. They can be easily solved with just a little more thinking, plus it's always helpful to keep a small notebook beside you for notes, just in case. I haven't fully completed the game yet but it's amazing to see how many different puzzles can be created in just one portion of the room.I highly recommend this game to someone who like to have a little chill run down their back but one who loves a mystery as well. I'm not one who can handle scary games that well so this is the perfect type of creepy for me. I'm also looking forward to completing this game and hopefully adding more to this review after. :)"

76561198042646749,Recommended,402040,25524476,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,kris.aalst,"'The Guest' is a first person adventure puzzle game. You wake up in a hotel room that's locked. You don't remember how you got there. You find some puzzles to solve, most of which require you to use items you find across the room to solve them. Solving a puzzle leads to other puzzles to solve etc.  'The Guest' an ok game, worth playing if you don't expect too much, but not at full price. If you're into the genre, I recommend picking it up when it's discounted by 50% or more.The puzzlingMost of the puzzles are pretty clever and well-executed. Sometimes they vaguely reminded me of the quality of the puzzles of the game The Room, which is a huge compliment. The Guest clearly aspires to be as good as The Room and other games that set the bar. It does not succeed but it doesn't fall flat on its face either. The puzzles are challenging, visually attractive, non-repetitive and they reflect the atmosphere of the adventuring aspect of this game i.e. the mystery of what's going on.The adventuringThe Guest is a puzzle game first and foremost. But it has some adventuring elements, too. This means you'll be exploring the hotel room you're in and be picking up items to use either on things in the room or on each other in the inventory, to create new items that can be used on things in the room. There is also a story being told while you explore and solve puzzles, but don't expect too much story, it's certainly not a narrative driven adventure game. I appreciated the story, however basic and surreal, for what it was.Steam related thoughtsSome of the achievements are pretty challenging, which always adds an extra layer to games and especially to puzzle games. One of the achievements seems bugged for me (Houdini) but 4.2% of the users have it, which is more than the usual percentage of achievement cheaters, so I'm not sure why it won't trigger for me.A warning to conclude: the achievement for the labyrinth (you need to complete it without failing) is completed by pure luck. So save before using the telephone and reload to do the labyrinth again and again if you want the achievement. Do not trust the so-called guide you'll find here on Steam, it's a (bad) joke. If you look at the final part of the 'guide', you'll see the author put some letters in the middle of seemingly random words in capitals. These spell out 'troll'."

Evertyhing is so well thought and polished that you can feel the love put by devs behind it. Most of the games of this genre usually have a huge problem in my opinion: sometimes you get major feedback about your progression so you know exactly where to go next and sometimes nothing is said to you so you feel completly lost. However this game alternates perfectly those pauses and feedback moments, so you don't feel too much lost and at the same time they don't tell you ""monkey, IT'S THERE"".The atmosphere is very nice too, the lights and shaders make it even better and the music and sound keep you uncalm all the game along. There are two moments where the music changes: the first one is an amazing song which I really enjoyed (I searched it later on the internet to download it) and the other one is a classic one.There is also a scene so beautiful that I would like to print a screenshot and put it on the walls of my bedroom.Globally an amazing game.

This game differs a bit from other escape room games in that your character is able to move around freely like in a first person shooter.I was surprised at the graphical quality as it’s quite nice for a game in this genre and you can tell the developers went the extra mile on the visual and audio aesthetics. Controls are intuitive and other than wishing for a run button I didn’t have any problems exploring the game.The puzzle difficulty in this game is intermediate for escape room games with only a few puzzles requiring you to think outside the box. You will definitely need to have a pen and paper handy for a particular puzzle involving an array of buttons, but the rest are simply solved through connecting clues.The Guest typically goes on sale for around $3 which is also about how long the game will take to beat (3 hours), so it’s a pretty good deal and worth picking up if you’re down for an evening of puzzle-solving."

,Recommended,402040,29437305,Posted: 22 January,all,libcrypt,"The Guest is a very fine game.  I played it on my TV, and so because of TV gamma (albeit adjusted for games), I found myself fumbling around in the dark quite often, as most of the game is quite dark.  That said, The Guest is in no way a pixel-hunt.  All the necessary interactions are sufficiently lit to complete them easily.  (Pixel-hunting is about needles in brightly-lit haystacks, though, not thumbtacks on an unlit carpet.)  The puzzles are all well-hinted and comprehensible, and there are just enough interactive distractions to make the environment enjoyable.  I found myself wondering whether there was a ""happy"" ending when I completed the game, and unfortunately, the save I created when I realized I was near to the end did not allow me to backtrack far enough to explore and find out whether that was the case.  I checked out a few gameplay videos and everyone seems to have the same ending, so if there's another ending, I don't think most folks have found it.My complaints, few as they are:  The story is underdeveloped.  Bits of the story make little intrinsic sense, like the ""dizzy-pills"" episode.  (Some folks complain about the ""maze"", but it's easy to solve and I think it works well.)  The ending is rushed and seems bolted-on.  The hints during most of the gameplay that attempt to explain the player's predicament are thin and ultimately unsatisfactory, which I think led to my feeling that there must be another ending.  The audio is good, but the game really could have used an actual soundtrack, at least in some places (the record player worked nicely, however).My complaints are minor, however, and I would gladly pay for another similar game from the same developers."

Thankfully, there are fairly few ""MacGyver"" puzzles, and instances of combinable inventory items generally make sense. There are also scattered papers that you can't keep but that you can read to reveal context to your situation.Visual quality is nice. Good textures, good lighting, good particles. Several of the areas are in total darkness, but the light switches are easy to find.A bunch of the achievements are easy to miss, including some that involve solving certain puzzles in the fewest number of moves without a mistake and at least one that is totally up to dumb luck. It's a little disappointing to have to replay the game to clean up the achievements, since puzzles don't really have much replay value.I got through it the first time in about 2 hours, which is honesly pretty hefty for a room escape. If you like this type of game, it's worth your time.Pills / 10"

Early puzzled do a good job of slowly ramping up.The game is lovely (although I did need to play with the brightness due to bloom - but that's a personal issue), and I found generally played well as far as being able to manipulate objects.Cons:Towards the end, some of the puzzles felt obtuse to me. I eventually had to go to a guide to find the answer to one that was required for game completion. While I finished the game, part of that was diminished a little to me since I KNEW that there were two puzzles that were left unsolved. This does mean I'll play it again, but not for the reasons that I would normally like (branching paths/morality choices).A note to any players who have a hearing imparement: There is a single puzzle that is tone based and is randomized.

The Guest blew me away. The atmosphere of the game is well-crafted both visually and musically - the rooms are detailed and immmersive, with each object well-modeled and rendered. Subtle music and environmental sounds (such as your own footsteps) build a quiet, uncomfortable mood into the game, reinforcing both your isolation and apprehension. The background information/story is well-placed in small news snippets and notes that reveal the story at a good pace.The puzzles themselves have a ranges of difficulties -- some feel akin to the ""find the object you need for x"" in escape the room flash games, and others are more logical and must be worked out on paper, while others feel more Myst-like, requiring the player to piece together clues.

If you just want 'some fun' or it is on sale then by all means, let the game entertain you.The title etc is a bit misleading from my point of view. You go in thinking you  will solve the mystery of how you got into the room and eventually will come out again which sort of makes you want to play  this.This won't be happening though. The ending is really abstract and makes no 'proper' sense.+the graphics are stunning+the atmosphere is amazing at times+the puzzles are creative, with various levels+the story line is okay-no guidance on what you have to do so you sort of just figure it out, the puzzles aren't super easy or sort of numbered out-the ending leaves me going 'oookay' in an abstract way(has nothing really to do with the 'real world' anymore)-you get to know the history of why you're there and what you ought to do if you weren't stuck in a room but it's not really..impacting anything or giving you information as to why this is happening?If you buy this game, don't go in thinking it's a horror game, the end will ruin it for you.

My only hope was a patch. And it arrived in late April. But despite the patch the bugs are still there.Major issues:- The game starts with a blank screen and a solid cursor. (Not moving.) ALT+TAB and other tricks aren't helping. The only thing I can do is CTRL+ALT+DEL then select e.g. Task manager from this Windows menu. So I get back to the desktop. Now if I switch back to the game, turns out that it is running. I can play.- Same for exit. Blank screen with a cursor. CTRL+ALT+DEL, Task manager and I have to end the process.- The game is unresolvable for me. I had to look up a complete walktrough gameplay video and turns out there are things missing on my machine: the ""congratulations"" sound recording. (It is silent for me.) The red lights on the ceiling.Minor issues:- For example: I can reach the ""This dosen't seem to be..."" note without opening the drawer.- The game freezes for long seconds sometimes, which kills the mood.- No save game slots. Combining one game slot (progress) with achievements that require advance in-game knowledge is a bad thing. Do you think I will re-play the whole game just to achieve a badge? No way. (Sorry if there are multiple save slots. It is not working for me as it falls under the first major issue.)Altogether, by my heart I'd recommend this game to the adventure/puzzle/exploration lover community, but there are many similar out there with much better game experience.

The puzzles are fairly easy, or can be brute forced without much difficulty, and there are lot of loose ends with no real lead up or resolution, and the twist is unexpected but akin to finding out at the end of Myst that the main character was a Lizardman, out of nowhere and lacking any real connection to any of the previous elements.I never actually knew or cared about why I was Leonard, why a game set in 1986, of all times, has some futuristic trappings, and while you get to see a glimpse behind the curtain of the room trap, it goes no further than that and you're railroaded all the way, barring some obscure hidden puzzle.Puzzle solving at it's core is hunting for random stuff in the dark, and most of them are red herrings, so much so there's a cheevo for grabbing all the crap, which makes inventory management a little hard. I wish I wasn't being so dead honest about the nature of this game, it is nothing but finding junk in the dark, and finding ways to turn on the light so you can find said junk, and then using it to solve a puzzle.I guess a good way to put how the ending makes me feel, is that I didn't really feel indoctrinated- Bioshock and White Night made you realize that you'd been playing to someone else's rules all along and hadn't noticed it, whereas this game's antagonists have a very low bar for conversion. I guess if you can solve random puzzles that have no interconnection or deeper meaning, you're okay enough for them, I guess?Worst part is that if there's room for multiple endings, and I just got a bad one, two puzzles are so full of tedium, the lazy maze I could have coded in my sleep, and the one involving rotating 3D objects to form a 2D puzzle, which are slow, and imprecise, I'm not even interested in going back to the beginning to try something new, which I doubt exists, as the game is very linear. Even found a bug when I hit ""continue"" after beating the game that had me back in the locked room, with buggy access to my inventory, and forced to sit through the unskippable credits again.Save up your money and maybe try something a bit more groundbreaking, like Layers of Fear or something."

Solving puzzles is in my nature and if it’s your nature too, then this game is right up your alley.As with most games, there are pros and cons:- Pros- A richly detailed world- Many riddles to solve- Puzzles are well balanced- When you play this game again, there are certain puzzles where the solution has changed.(For example: valve puzzle, music puzzle, and labyrinth puzzle.- Cons- Much too short (I was really getting into it and it ended.)- Even though this game is “a gloomy adventure”, there are some areas that are a little to dark.- The area in which you can explore is very small.All in all, I would rate this game 8/10.  Dare I hope for a sequel?"

The script has left me a bit unimpressed but I enjoyed nonetheless. It took me about 3 and a half hours to beat the game. Don't expect The Guest to blow your mind."

Overall it was a great little four hour experience. I'm pretty sure I missed a few things, and some of the puzzles were tricky but for the most part everything could be solved with objects and information collected. Had to look up information on two puzzles, though afterwards sort of realized that I'm an idiot and had the right idea but was going about it the wrong way. My only issue with the game is that the controls were pretty wonky and moving around/viewing objects was difficult at times. Looking forward to what the dev comes up with next."

The puzzles could sometimes be a bit obtuse which was frustrating, but it was also kind of refreshing when I was finally able to crack a few of them. The story left me wanting more in the sense that I really wanted to know what kind of set up Dr. Leonov has gotten himself into by the end."

Decent graphics and sound with some challenging puzzles, some hard puzzles, and some puzzles that are a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ A pretty wierd story?!? if you can call it that. It's the puzzles that make it fun. Can beat this game rather quickly, but if you are going for the achievements, you will have to play it more than once. There are 3 achievements that require you to to solve the puzzle in one run, 1 of which you can't reload and start over. You have to restart whole game, and one achievement that seems to require you to find all the papers in once run, no reloading. I one achievement that requires you to wait at least 8 hours, reload game, and then you can get it. Took me a few runs to get one achievement alone. Still, had fun playing it."
