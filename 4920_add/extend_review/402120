If it wasn't obvious from the description, you only control the character's movements and dodges while it autofires based on enemy proximity. It's an interesting mixed of lovecraft in space lore, mixed with 80s synth music, visual effects, and cute/gross pixel art. On my first run, I found an item that transformed me from a female graduate student into a being of mangled flesh destroyed by fire that wants revenge on all non-burned life. Then I found another item that let me shoot laser axes. Some of the strategy appears to revolve around weapon select, as different weapons fire with different effects and in different patterns, providing different pros and cons. Also, you unlock different characters who have different special abilities, which require MP. I would recommend this to any fan of rogue-lites and rogue-likes."

,Recommended,402120,31166302,Posted: 15 April,all,it's💀shoepacabra,"Let's get this out of the way: If you're reading reviews it's probably because you saw a game that looked like The Binding of Isaac and were curious if it was good enough to get. It's not the same experience.You can play Deathstate with one hand (and only slightly more optimally with two.) It's far more about the bullet-hell aspect of play than about adventuring. You automatically fire and automatically target the closest enemy at all times. You control movement, ability usage, and items as you push various humans and monsters through the astral plane to battle various horrors, punctuated by the occasional boss fight. Good, clean, undemanding fun that's ideal for playing while listening to a podcast or something. You'll have to focus to avoid getting shot by the projectiles swarming the screen, but you don't really have to *think*.And that's a fine recipe for a game. It's not any kind of all-time classic and past the superficial similarities it doesn't really approach the engrossing nature of Isaac. But if you wanna kill some time and shoot some mans, Deathstate is one of the better ways to do it, I think. The only real negative, in my opinion, is that for all the wild variety of items you can find, your run is pretty much always going to come down to whether those items add max HP, mitigate damage, and/or improve the damage you deal. The weird features, the various damage types, the fun gimmicks -- they're neat but they're largely irrelevant against the brute-force advantages of hitting harder and being able to get hit. That's what makes Deathstate more of a chill-out game than a lasting classic."

I'll  try  to  keep it simple this time around.Pros:Great Pixel art and oldschool computer game styled music.Enemies are distinct letting you learn and remember what they do on sight.Extensive lore, one of those games were EVERYTHING has a name and some lore attatched to it (thought the character info screen tends to break needing you to double click a few time to get the info to pop)Upgrades clearly define what they do, save for relics, and tend to make you feel immediatly more powerful as long as you like the style of weapon.If you ever get bored of your chosen character there's a chance to find an item that lets actually swap  your ""class"" like you would any other equipable, changing stats and your Q button power at the same time.Cons:By far the biggest and the thing the game is designed around is the auto targeting system.  You cannot control your own attacks except for the two special attacks you can get while playing. This means unless you get a relic specifically made for crowd control you're stuck hoping  the autotargeting system attacks what you see to be the biggest threat first. It also means most enemies will  get a chance to unleash a salvo at you first because their range of agression is  much bigger than yours combine that with enemies that can stealth or teleport as well and sometimes it has a hard time keeping up.Screen efects are distracting, the game constantly has this  shadowy border along the screen to  add tension and mysticsim to  the GREAT Eldritch lore but it can be distracting, not to mention every second level usually distorts  the screen in same way with waves of color or shadow to distort the screen. Some  enemies ONLY FUNCTION is to  distort the screen, using special abilities, distorts your screen via shaking it, GETTING HIT distorts your screen turning into a jumbled red tinted haze of pixels, being close to death distorts the screen and a majority of bad potions? They distort your screen because the devs knew the WORST thing you could  do ina bullet hell is to do something to distract the player.No invincibility frames, and if there are, they only happen DURING the  screen ditortion fromgetting hit meaning you can get wombo comboed to death while not being able to see anything because the screen has become angry red bees in a snowstorm from you getting hit in the first place.Health becomes WAY too scarce. Unless you grabe a health regen power by the end of the game you'll end up with a HUGE health bar with most of it being empty because all increases I've seen come in the form of empty copntainers you need to fill up.Grid based movement. Your character floats in this game because of their special powers so if you stop  you float forwards in movement that's clearly bound to an invisible grid, extra frustrating because I made it to the final boss my second try and not realising that caused  me to casually float into one of his bullets when he was on his last legs.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And yet I have to reccomend this game. Every problem I have with it is a fundamental flaw in the games design but you can just FEEL  that  this project was an experiment that loves everything that this game is about. If it had Enter the Gungeon controls  with WASD and SPACE to dodge and let you aim your shots with the mouse it'd eliminate a good portion of  the frustration because in a roguelike game you need to give full control to the player it's a genre MADE for the purpose of putting a player into  hard, nigh unwinnable situation and go ""Let's see just how far your skill takes you"""

But let me tell you something; if you play for a while (say, an hour or so) you'll forget you're not in control of the firing. That's because in a way, you are in control. Your positioning relative to priority targets is crucial to your success in this game.I absolutely love this game. The visuals, the smooth gameplay, the music (dear god the music sounds like it was ripped straight from a Sega Genesis game, i.e. AWESOME), everything about this game was clearly made with so much love. And it gets HARD.If you can look past the term single stick, this game is a lovingly made roguelite with all the right pieces. There is one downside for me, and that's that there are a few items that are clearly strictly better than other items, but other than that I don't have any complaints. Would highly recommend!"

76561197993926065,Recommended,402120,18594355,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,Waffles The Cat,"I really enjoy this game.Very simple at first, with the ""one stick system"" being a fairly intuitive movement. Bullets shoot out of the character, attacking only the closest character, and tyou progress through the levels.The wrinkle comes from the second stick, providing a short dash that allows the player to avoid bullets, as well as two abilities that can be activated. Several passive abilities, such as bombs, rockets or flamethrowers, round out the characters attacks.What starts as a fairly simple, easy system quickly becomes more complex, the difficultly ramping smoothly to provide a surprisngly engrossing experience. It is much closer to games like Touhou or vertical bullet hells than to the immediate cousins of Nuclear Throne or Binding of Isaac. This works to the games benifet, providing a tense, methodical experience where foresight and planning pay off.I would definitely recomend this to many people, though with the ceveat it's closer to a true bullet hell than other games that are visually similar in gameplay. The patterns get tough, and careful use of your dash and a bit of luck make for an excellent experience.Also, I love the pixel art, and the music isvery fitting. The neon effect goes a long way to turn what could have been a boring visual design into something memorable!"
,Recommended,402120,22622030,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,applebaps,"Deathstate is not only visceral fun in its own right; it also makes for fantastic training for danmaku shooting games, and a great distraction from them if you want something a little different.  It scratches the itch of shooting and dodging in a very satisfying way, and out-Isaacs the Binding of Isaac while it's at it.The game is a ""single stick shooter"", by which they mean you only control movement and the usage of your activated items.  The movement feels fluid and natural, and it's worth noting that the developers absolutely nailed the feeling of a true danmaku shoot-em-up, even down to things as subtle as the speed of enemy bullets, or the size of the hitbox proportional to your character sprite (not too tiny, not too fat).  Your character automatically targets the closest enemy, and fires without stopping.  This frees up more brainspace for you to focus on positioning and managing the enemy horde, within which always lurks a few stronger and more threatening enemies that need to be eliminated quickly despite the popcorn piling up in front of them.There is technically a 2nd stick at work, here: using the right analog stick on a gamepad will activate a dash dodge ability that you can use to get yourself out of bad spots.  I don't know if this figures in more at higher level play than my own, but I find relying on it tends to actually end up killing me faster than if I simply played more cautiously in the first place.  YMMV of course, but there are ways to herd bullets into lines and create gaps through them without relying on a dodge, and these are still just as effective as they would be in any other shooter.The game features a (unlockable, but easily so) dynamic difficulty system called Desecration.  You can find altars and desecrate them to raise the difficulty level of the game for the rest of that run, giving enemies more health, denser bullet patterns, and in some cases ""suicide bullets"" fired when they die (think Ketsui on the Ura loop, or 2nd-loop Dodonpachi).  There's also an Insanity Portal option, turned on before the run begins, that cranks up the difficulty right from the get-go.  It presents a significant challenge, even for someone with 1CCs of other games under their belt.There is a pretty sizeable pool of items you can find, mostly in the form of ingestable organs, with a smattering of swords and books and other relics sprinkled in.  These unlock as you play, and I appreciate that a lot of attention has been paid to making sure that (for the most part) there aren't any that are useless or actively bad, with the possible current exception of items that change your firing to a burst or flurry, which removes your ability to handle the game's popcorn hordes with any sense of grace.Grace is the key word with Deathstate.  It's fluid and fun in an immediately gratifying way, and is the kind of game where you'll ""Just One More Run"" yourself into the ground, only noticing too late that it's 1 in the morning and where did your whole day go?"

You only move and the character shoots in auto. This is, in my opinion, better than the twin-stick-shooter system, because it reduces complexity (moving and aiming at the same time), and allows you to focus on movement. This does not mean the game is not hard, just watch someone play the new insanity mode or finish a desecration run.If you like Binding of Isaac, I strongly recommend this game.

I inevitably get frustrated somewhere around my fifth or sixth death, utter a loud expletive, and take a break. However, I keep coming back whenever there's a temporary lull in my day. Judging by the extensive list of items and features I have yet to unlock, I have a long way to go.The controls are responsive and surprisingly simplistic. The etheric 'bullets' your character fires aren't aimed manually, but are instead fired automatically at the nearest enemies, making it your responsibility to put your astral explorer in the right place at the right time. The many swarms of weaker, projectile-less enemies can become a real problem, because they act as constant meat-shields to the more threatening enemies, prolonging every encounter and increasing your chances of losing precious hitpoints to your own incompetence.Like most roguelike-likes,  the items you to pick up or don't pick up can make or break your run through the game, but you aren't entirely at the mercy of the Random Number Generator. Success always feels possible, if difficult, thanks to the bullet hell elements and the dodging mechanic. The many, many projectiles in the lower levels can be phased through or dodged by the directional arrow keys if you are fast enough, giving the game a high skill ceiling.In short, the game is easy to learn and hard to master, and I give it extra points for the cool setting. I am very much enjoying this punishing fever dream of a game."

I was initially pretty reluctant to get into the game at first due to the auto-fire thing that your character does but the difficulty does ramp up and you'll probably be thankfully that you don't need to pick and choose individual targets with your main attack while you're trying to dodge a thousand evil glowsticks from every direction.Good variety of items and enemies and with Lovecraft references galore.If you're a fan of bullet hells, this game may or may not be your cup of tea.

,Recommended,402120,20025654,"Posted: 28 December, 2015",all,Cream-of-Plenty,"Deathstate is what you get when you take Binding of Isaac, add some ""bullet hell"" mechanics, and put it in a colorful 16-bit H.P. Lovecraft universe.   It's a relatively simple game:  Steer one of a growing cast of unlockable characters through a series of procedurally-generated worlds, gobbling up unlockable guts--monstrous hearts, eyes, brains, lungs, etc.--and equipping arcane tools that modify your stats and offensive capabilities.And I quite literally mean ""steer"":  As a single stick shooter, you don't have direct control over when or where you shoot.  Instead, your character automatically targets and shoots enemies when they come into range, leaving you to focus entirely on movement and dodging.  This unusual choice may turn off some players because it sounds like a dumbed-down twin stick shooter.  It doesn't help that the first map (called a ""layer"") is frequently pretty easy, leaving many to assume you can simply sleepwalk through the game while your character does all the work.However, it's not long before the difficulty ramps up and you realize that the game is built on maneuvering around the dozens of bizarre enemies and their various projectiles and attacks.  The single stick conceit doesn't make the game easier...just different.Fortunately for those who descend a few layers and feel that the game is still a little too easy or light on the ""bullet"" aspect of a bullethell, the game gives you the opportunity to increase the difficulty.  This comes in the form of crystal skulls, which are located at the beginning of each run and then randomly throughout the middle of levels.  Approaching one gives you the option to ""desecrate"" it, upsetting the cosmos and upping the ante; enemies will be a lot nastier, projectiles will be more plentiful, and the player will die to fewer hits.  There appear to be differences between desecrating the skull at the beginning of the game (which activates an ""Insanity"" mode) and those that are periodically discovered within the Deathstate (which simply add ""Desecration"" levels to the run).  But once you start a run, you must die to undo the effects.Nonetheless, Deathstate isn't exactly the most complex roguelite shooter.  You won't constantly stumble across novel item synergies (or contraindications) like you would in Binding of Isaac.  In fact, you're usually free to hoover up all of the stat-enhancing guts you come across.  But as of the v1.20 Beta, the developer has taken a lot of community feedback regarding item, organ, and character balance in an effort to significantly expand on the variety of item effects, combinations, and character classes.  The result is that there's a greater depth and range of options in Deathstate than ever before.In sum, the game offers up enough unlockable characters, items, weapons, and dungeons--and more than a few weird gameply mechanics and secrets--to keep things fresh and interesting for anybody wanting a new roguelite-shooter in their lives."

All normal attacks are handled automatically by the game; leaving you to move, dodge and use any special abilities. The majority of your time is going to be moving slowly around levels waiting for enemies to die. This becomes worse when fighting bullet sponge elites and bosses.I managed to beat the game on my third try, and I haven't felt the desire to go back for another full run despite unlocking new items and areas. Maybe if there were more advanced mechanics built around dodging or doing something else it wouldn't feel so repetitive.

It's fun being able to take on hoards of undead fiends single handedly. Though it still has it's cons it is so worth the $15.Pros-Unique enemies and characters. With the exception of Seeker and Scar, each character seems to have drastically different play styles. The priest is good at avoiding damage, the eye is a glass cannon, etc. Even the mid-game aspects seem to play fairly unique as well. Each enemy is for the most part unique in their own way and even bosses, while only holding a few different attacks, are still fun to fight against. (Except the High Starchild. Screw the High Starchild. I hate him)-Each organ, weapon, tome, if unique and capable of drastically altering the way you play the game. Burst fire, plague bullets, LASERS, and the like can edit how you go about the game. Each set even comes with it's own description which you can read if you're into that sort of thing. Each one telling you how such things could come into existence.-Unique unlocks reside in the game. While a lot are just ubberly powerful tomes and weapons many gameplay events are also unlocked through this manner. Giant chest, planer seals, and other events are to be unlocked. This also includes a whole new set of worlds previously hidden from the player.-Despite it's straitforward apperance and simple gameplay, the game has the potential to become fairly difficult typically through desecration shrines, Which is cool. Course I suck at the game too much to bother with desecration shrines while I still only have a 33% winrate.Cons-Autoshoot automatically targets where an enemy was when the shot was fired. For the most part this isn't really an issue since most enemies walk towards or away from the player and it's what makes the game stick out from others, however enemies with unpredictable movement patterns (such as the Crystal skeletons boss fight) can be very hard to hit because of this.-Aspects, while unique, are undervalued in the game. There are only 3 of them in the game and they completely overwrite the previous character, meaning that achievments and endings obtained with that character will become null. Personally, i think it would be cool to create a mixed aspect slot so you can have both the player aspect and the new aspect. I like the horror aspect since it's also an enemy in the game. Perhaps more of that could be added. A Cultist aspect with lower speed and MP regen, but more Damage and max MP and being able to fire entropy bullets in a circle like the seeker. Or a Kobold aspect that increases speed and fire rate but lowers damage and has the ability to slow everything down like a watered down speed potion. There just feels like there's so much potential with the aspects.-Despite having a good deal of event unlocks, many in-game terms are never truly explained. Terms such as ""Luck"" or ""Dark-Seeking"" are never really explained While plague/ice/fire damage typically explains itself since items will typically notify you that it changed your way of firing or that it increased the damage of a certain type of bullet, Dark never seems to have that and it's very misleading.-Certain enemies that constantly fire bullets upon seeing the player will typically continue firing even if the player leaves their line of sight. Characters that also walk towards the player while doing this (Lesser liches are by far the worst offenders of this) Can end up clumping together in groups of 3 or more around a corner, creating a field of bullets where damage is unavoidable.Other than that this game is great. It is well worth the money to dive headfirst into the dark realms and uncover power beyond your wildest dreams."

Do you like to mix element from danmaku (bullet curtain) and rogue-like? Then you have your game :Deathstate.This review has been made after clearing the full game at version1.13, which means 100% achievement and the hardest possible run.For which player ?Thanks to a scaled difficulty the game can be played by both novice to danmaku and experts. However, as it is now this can has some flashy effect that may pose a problem for color-blind people along with those having photo-sensibility.Pros :The game is alive: you can post on the forum and the developer is present to answer and give insight on the game and its future, which is a strong point as bug fixing is ensured by the presence of the developer.MusicThe music is good and sounds effects are carefully used. Thank to this mix, you can hear what is happening around you, which is pretty valuable for hardest difficulty.Art: Simple and effective pixel art in the Lovecraft world. Even if it is not extremely ""original"", it is done properly, the game has its own style and you will remember it.A good choice of characters: As for now there are 10 playable characters and 3 in-run transformation that will modify the gameplay from a little to a lot. This is good as you can have some affinity with a certain type of gameplay (dodging or heavy DPS) which is present in the characters.Privacy: It is the first game which ASKED me if I wanted my data collected for improving the game anonymously. Just for having the game asking my consent it is a great pro in this market where some developer have no concern for players' privacy.Cons :Color effects: It is how the game has been programmed and it serves in its difficulty by adding coloration effect (color inversion, blur, increased gamma) making difficult to see where are the bullet on the screen. However, I believe this is a con for people who cannot stand such effect, may it be for personnal taste or medical reason.Heavy RNG: As for now, hardest difficulty are way too much RNG dependent. There are build where you simply cannot go on, which lead to reset fest.No lore: The last con I would add is the scenario and the lore. There is little to no scenario in this game. You are trapped in a simulation like, you kill monster and that's pretty all. Therefore you play the game for the gameplay and not for unfolding the scenario.Overall? I recommend to buy the game at full price for people who do love danmaku and rogue-like. If you are not a big player of danmaku or rogue-like you can buy it either full price or on small sales. If you hate one of those style or are waiting for a Lovecraft like story, do not buy this game, it is not made for you."

Playthroughs are typically 15 to 30 minutes long and beyond WASD for movement the other main keys are ""F"" to examine and the arrow keys to dodge (all keys can be re-bound to whatever you like).  The keys needed to use potions and other items are helpfully overlaid on the on-screen display you see while you play.Should you buy Deathstate?  Well, if you are a casual gamer like myself who likes to occasionally unwind playing simple yet fun RPG-styled games then the answer is ""yes!""  Deathstate features a mix of science-fiction / horror-style chiptune music mixed with some very fun heavy metal for one of the mini-boss fights you can choose on every playthrough.  The metal track (called ""Desecrate"") on the Original Sound Track (OST) is thrilling.  I would compare it to the game version of an all-out table-and-chair throwing bare-knuckle brawl with Satan himself, set against the background of the cosmos.  Good stuff.While I don't see myself putting hundreds of hours into Deathstate the game is, for what it is, fantastic.  It is a pick-up and play sci-fi horror-style RPG game with very simple game mechanics and challenging enemies and bosses.

The game autofires and aims your main attack, which was a bit shocking to see at first, as I thought that would suck the fun out of the game. But, I feel this puts the shift mostly on tactical positioning and dodging. I wouldn't let that mechanic be a deciding factor in getting/not getting the game. You still do control two attacks; one character based and one that you can potentially find in the maps.Speaking of maps, the game cycles you through various maps as you progress that have different enemies. The variety of enemies keeps you on your toes, but most are predictable and controllable in a small group. Maps will throw in obstacles to make fighting more difficult, too.Special items can be difficult to find in the map itself, so the first floor may feel a little slow. Once you find a few items, though, the gameplay picks up and I personally become more bold in my attacks. But, unlike some similar games, I don't think this game relies too much on finding the right item combo. Sure, some items are good and stack together, but it's not a luck of the item draw on whether you make it to the end.Controls:]I've only played it with a controller, but after doing so, I don't think I would want to try anything else but a controller. Easy controls to pick up, and nothing difficult with them at all.Graphics:Has that retro feel to it. What you see in the screenshots is a pretty accurate representation of the graphics; bright pixels everywhere.Sounds:Pretty addictive soundtrack. Nothing too intense, but its there to keep you focused on the game.How it Runs:Easy on a fairly basic laptop with integrated graphics, I've noticed no stuttering at all. As long as your computer is not a toaster, you should be able to run it. (That was somewhat in jest, but its an easy game to run)Final Line:If you're looking for a bullet hell game that is easy to pick up but difficult to put down, I personally think this is the game for you. Controls and gameplay allow for quick little bursts of playing, but the difficulty and variation on each playthough will keep you entertained. I'd consider it a must-buy when it's on sale."

Also no doubting that.The mechanics are easy to master, and with the variety of mostly useless equipment that you can pick up, most runs will be quite different than each other, and this is a good thing. The graphical style is pleasing, and the colors are quite nice, even though sometimes enemy bullets seem to blend in with everything else. The music is very good, and is probably the first soundtrack I've heard in a while that had a true retro feel to it.Bullet Hell, Rougelike. Painful heaven.However, I think that there are two poor decisions made with it.If you want to make a difficult skill based game, that's fine. Dark Souls is fairly difficult with mechanics that can be mastered, Touhou is a series another good example of that. However, I feel that even will skill, the reason this game will still be difficult is not because it requires luck, but rather because of the visual filter that frequently brightens and can sometimes pulsate, making bullets impossible to see. Or, at least, very difficult to see. I can't judge if this was an intentional decision to increase difficulty, or if it was simply a stylistic choice. It /feels/ like a cheap way to increase difficulty, and I don't like that one bit.The second, and probably more minor and definitely weighing on my lack of knowledge, is that most of the organs in the game seem to provide minimal benefit if any at all. This could change later in the game, perhaps the slight pushes in either direction will affect the outcome of a run, and I can't currently say if that's true or not.If I were to give this game an honest rating, I'd give it 6.5/10. It's decent and fun, and I will definitely be playing every other day, but I will always hold a small resentment for it in my heart for the cheap deaths it often presents me with."

Some items are practically required, and others are completely worthless. Every run feels more or less the same with different characters because you'll be hunting for the same items. There's no diversity, and no real challenge. Doing good or bad depends entirely on what items you get. That's just not fun.Hard mode feels impossible to get past even a single stage. Stonewalls repeat play, but maybe that's for the best."

,Not Recommended,402120,20387286,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Bleach,"Deathstate is a game that I wanted to like. The idea of simplifying 2D shooters to a movement only based scheme is novel. It allows the player to focus on dodging and placement. This would be great if everything built around it wasn't so faulty.The music in the game ranges anywhere from tolerable to aural punishment. The Maze of Ix has undoubtledy the worst track I've heard in a game in years. The art style is quite nice, even though various enemies are recycled through areas. Half of the enemies are barely animated, though. Visual design choices also get in the way of the gameplay. One of the zones cycles through colors, and some of those are almost the same hue as the bullets. Using or picking up healing items accompanies with a blinding flash that blocks out vision of projectiles. The clutter and aesthetic bits strewn about the levels make it hard to tell what can be walked over and what can't. Factor in that characters get stuck on corners like they're coated with rubber cement, and you have chunks of life lost to bad movement.Aside from characters getting stuck, the core mechanics of the game don't work as well as they should. Runs are almost entirely determined by the quality of items picked up. Some items are good, most are relatively unimpactful, and some are outright bad. Why have an item that increases damage but slows rate of fire to once a second when the player is going to be surrounded by enemies? The later levels are swarmed by high health enemies that fill the screen with bullets. That could be forgiven if the player wasn't also on a timer to get through each stage. If they items picked up during the run were below par, then winning is almost surely out of the question. Money even feels like a wasted resource because shops are rare and usually are either a straight up gamble or just have consumables, which may or may not be bad.I don't recommend the game in its current state, and I don't expect it will improve drastically enough for me to change my mind. If you are considering this game, I strongly urge you to look at Nuclear Throne instead. Although much harder, Nuclear Throne is well worth your time and money.(Sidenote: At the time of writing, many items in the game outright do not work if you use an XBox One controller. Expect to use your keyboard or another controller until this is patched.)"

There's no button to fire and you don't have to aim. You automatically lock on to the closest target and fire at it. You'll probably hit it.So with that out of the way, Deathstate is a game where the combat is less about how you fight and more about how you move and in this aspect it really shines. Movement is fluid, you always move how you would expect to move based on your input and you have a neat little dodge which allows you to quickly move in a direction, destroying enemy bullets along the way. It's very short and you definitely can't plow through fields of fire with it but it can help you out in a pinch and learning to use it properly is very important. The thing is, I tend to forget about it but surprisingly it hasn't hindered me greatly, though I imagine that if I used the dodge more frequently I would be much better at the game.There's plenty to unlock and new runs never feel samey, there's plenty of characters with different stats, abilities and passive effects to toy with and the visuals and soundtrack are pretty nice.

76561198156142503,Recommended,402120,29388521,Posted: 20 January,all,DrBrainzzz,"So, after nearly 5 hours in this game I'm finally gonna give it a review. I do like this game, and have been a huge Roguelite/Roguelike fan since Isaac got popular. I've played a bunch of them, good and bad, and most don't engage me as much as Deathstate does. It's a fun game, and challenging to boot. However, I feel like it's challenging for some of the wrong reasons. I'm gonna go over why.The first thing I'm going to talk about are the things I really like in the game. I like the update to the visuals. I played this game before that, and hated it simply because looking at that grainy screen and terrible animations was painful, and in any game if you can't even look at it, it's not gonna be a good game. All of that was fixed in the visual update, and the game looks great now. It maintained the aesthetic it was shooting for, but managed to be brighter and more pleasing to the eye. The references in the game are cool (particularly all the Cthulu mythos references) and sometimes made me chuckle a bit. Some of the items are super fun, and getting cool synergies is a blast (talking about you Laser Sword and Shoot more bullets rank 3 >:D) and it's honestly why I play these games. Enemies and levels tend to be very diverse and interesting, and the game always feels like it's changing.Onto some of the bad things, and while the good things slightly outweigh the bad, the bad are REALLY bad. One thing that I hate is the combination of the time limit, and no mapping. I understand it adds a challenge, but god is it annoying. If it was only one or the other, I wouldn't care that much. But both is simply infuriating. You have to entirely rely on RNG to be powerful enough to kill enemies fast enough to progress through the level. And it's not just finding the exit to the next level, it's finding the miniboss, checking for a shop, finding any chests, altars, giant chests, book stands, forges, etc. And if you're really powerful and wrecking things early, you might be able to secure some of this stuff. But sometimes you end up running out of time scrambling to get SOMETHING so you can have a bit of power to actually kill things. If I don't find a book or sword by the third level, I forfeit. Because I know without at least one of them (and it has to be a good one too) I won't last a chance making it through the second level in time. Also backtracking is nearly impossible because of the lack of a map and the time limit combined. Wanna try to get 30 more gold to get that book from the shop? Oh wait, you can't find the shop again... too late shadows consume you. They seem to have toned the timer down a bit, but it still punishes you for not getting good items, which is based entirely on RNG. This is the only game where I've seen it punish you more for bad RNG rather than no skill. Games like Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon both reward you even when you're behind. Is the game harder because you got♥♥♥♥♥♥items? Yes. But with enough skill, you have a chance to make it through. I've seen people do the first 4 or so floors with only the starter pistol in Gungeon. I've seen people do entire Isaac runs with absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥damage. Sure, it took them like an hour, but they still did it. Deathstate you don't have that option. If you have♥♥♥♥♥♥items, you aren't going to make it. And that is that. The only way to get good items is to explore, and the only way you can explore, is if you're strong enough to kill the enemies fast enough.Another HUGE problem is the games horrible lack of any invurnerable frames. You have your dodge, which gives you maybe one frame of dodge on the basic characters. And you have maybe half a frame of invulnerablity after you get hit. But that's it. If you get caught in a corner, or can't get down a corridor before a hail of bullets comes flying down it, you can very easily get your entire health bar melted nearly instantly. It is next to impossible to react as fast as this game wants you sometimes. And this is a bullet hell game. And it means hell. See, comparing again to Gungeon, you get invulnerable frames long enough to take a breath and see what you did wrong in Gungeon. In Deathstate, you don't have time to think about what you did wrong. You just have to keep dodging as you get hit. Because if you're still being shot at, you could take 2 or 3 before you even figure out how you got hit. So instead of the thought process being ""I got hit, how, oh that's how, ok I'll dodge that next time."" it's ""I got hit, oh♥♥♥♥♥♥more bullets, dodge dodge dodge"". It feels horribly unfair sometimes, because you don't get any chance out. The only thing you get is your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodge which only feels like it works half the time.My last big complaint about this game is the true randomness of this game. Now, most games such as this, you are guaranteed some kind of upgrade each level. Isaac has item rooms, boss items, and shops. Gungeon has two item rooms, a boss item, and a shop. Deathstate has a miniboss. And he drops one passive item. That's all you're actually guaranteed. Things like books, swords, relics, extra items, potions, etc are all complete RNG. I've had levels where I got a book, a sword, two giant chests, an altar, two minibosses that dropped organs, and a shop. I've also had runs where I got nothing but minibosses for 3 floors and got absolutely destroyed on level 2 because I had no real upgrades. Tying in to my earlier complaint, it feels ENTIRELY up to the game whether you succeed or not. And if the RNG of getting items isn't enough, it seems what enemies you'll encounter on each floor (and how difficult they are) is also RNG. You can get really hard bullet helly enemies on the first floor, or nothing but skeletons. I've had times where the first 4 floors where harder than the second levels 4 floors. I've had times where the 2nd level's 4 floors are literally harder than the last level. The enemies, despite having the same visuals, tend to randomize their attacks. There's no ""this enemy attacks in this way"" with all of them. Some enemies completely changed mechanics in different playthroughs. It's frustrating, because after playing for nearly 5 hours, I thought I had most of these enemies (at least on the first couple of floors) patterns down to where I could reliably dodge them. But instead they completely changed attacks, and now I had to relearn a new enemy. Bosses also have no pattern. They just shoot at you, increasing in bullets after they get to half health. While some have some kind of normal firing pattern, they will throw in other random bullets or things like dropping skulls or lasers just to throw you off of dodging said pattern. So everytime you fight a boss, it's going to be different. After roughly 20 playthroughs, I don't think I've had one run where the enemies on the first floor are all the same as a previous run, and to me that feels unfair. It's hard to get good at a game that isn't even remotely the same any time you play it through.So, all in all, or TL;DR this isn't a bad game per-say, it has it's fun times, and is a good challenge. More hardcore people could even play something like Endless or the god-forsaken unholy unfair gauntlet that is Insanity mode (aka ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fiesta). I probably wouldn't pay full price for this again, but it's not bad if you wanna get a new roguelike to ♥♥♥♥ around in and it's on sale."

The mechanics are different, the enemy designs diverse and interesting, and the long list of items and powerups has definitely got me coming back for more, just to see what I can unlock this time. The only real problem I had with this game had to be the choice of visuals. The filters and overlays that are always present in every level of the game can range from mildly annoying to downright obnoxious at times, the one example that always comes to mind has to be the slow-panning band of negative-filter that'd sweep over the screen every so often. I find myself getting a headache from these effects if I play for too long of a sitting, It'd be one thing if you had the option to turn these effects off, but as the game exists now you simply have to bare with the feature.If you can find yourself looking past this I would recommend the game, otherwise I emplore the creatores to make some if not all additional visual effects toggleable."

Good range of difficulty, too, nice and accessible by default but with options that ramp all the way up to extremely intense. Good soundtrack too."

The endless hours that you can spend on it is great and many difficulties.I would say this game is very good, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great and the whole game itself is great!"

This game makes so many improvements to the shmup roguelite formula that it's surprising more games haven't incorporated some. The most notable is alternate versions of each world that unlock the first time you complete a world. For example, the first world you go through features skeletons and gray stone corridors on an astral background, but once you've cleared it, sometimes when you start a run you'll start in an underwater area with completely different enemies and challenges. This keeps the game from feeling stale or frustrating if you get stuck in an area. A few of the other great features that contribute to a welcoming experience for people new to the genre: an option to make your hitbox visible so beginners can feel awesome squeaking through some of the more complex bullet patterns, a simplified control scheme and gameplay style that has you focusing more on the meat of shmup-style design (placement, dodging, knowing when to use special abilities) than aiming and resource management, and a distinct lack of keys, cheap deathtraps, and other annoyances that turn people off other games of this type. In fact, accessibility seems to be the name of the game here, as the game is easy to play one-handed with either a keyboard or mouse. Given this, it's a shame there's no ability to turn off the more intense, shifting visual filters, as these seem like they could cause migraines or motion sickness for some people (though I am prone to both and have had no issues, even during long play sessions).The visual design is fantastic across the board and fits the Lovecraftian setting perfectly, with extra attention paid to all the bosses (especially those death animations). The music and sound design are also wonderful and add to the slighty cheesy yet foreboding atmosphere. All the monsters feel suitably strange and otherworldly, and the environments are unsettling mazes you have to navigate quickly due to an encroaching darkness that appears after you spend a minute or two in a level (at the beginning this time limit is negligible but becomes a real threat by world 3 or 4). The unlockable characters all add interesting facets to the gameplay and each will make you change your playstyle significantly to suit them. One character moves slowly but has more health and power, which is fairly standard for a game like this. But then there’s another character that is powerful right off the bat but can't utilize one of the upgrade types at all. Another is weak but makes enemies run away, and my personal favorite character is strong and can do melee damage, but he can never stop moving which poses really interesting gameplay challenges (i'd only use him with keyboard though, analog sticks and d-pads don't move quickly enough to change his direction as often as you need to).There's a lot more to say and love about this game, but I feel comfortable saying to give it a shot, whether you already enjoy action roguelites or not. The only caveat is those visual filters, but you'll figure out whether you can handle those within minutes of starting up, so if you do need a refund it'll be easy to get. The game also gets updated fairly regularly. It's a great game and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. 9/10"
