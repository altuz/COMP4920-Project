76561198008996513,Recommended,402160,21529528,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,canshow,"Star Command galaxies is a spaceship simulator that revolves around a small, micro-managable crew that runs a starship and interacts with the game universe on the player's behalf.  You run missions for various factions in the galaxy, from establishing trade routes to destroying other space ships (in the most glorious manner might I add) while hiring new crew, upgrading your systems, and buying new ship models.  At the present, the game is a little incomplete, but the developers are hard at work at adding content and polishing bugs, and most importantly, listening to the community. Even so, you can still get several hours of enjoyment out of it as of now before you start feeling the ""early access"".Once finished, Star Command Galaxies will become a fine spaceship sim that throws the player into a spontenous and ever changing universe full of mystery and adventure. It is extremely moddable and could very well turn into next FTL-like hit in its genre if the developers keep up their great work."

,Recommended,402160,31594290,Posted: 6 May,all,Gen. Shrub,"The game has a lot of potential but right now its very incomplete and buggy. It seems rather shallow. Your crew members randomly hurt and killthemselves when they use powerful weapons (like shotguns and machine guns) at close range and some items  that should be able to be used can't (Wepaons crates, large lokers, etc...) This could become a very good game if the devs continue to work on it."

It's frustrating however to see bugs springing up left and right. Basic commands cease to work over time, frame drops (like come on, it's not even graphic intensive) and a litter of glitches that break immersion. Unplayable for longer than 30 minutes tops. Just to list them;-Very first play attempt and I got confused as to where my CO was. After a bit of looking around it dawned on me what had happened. The shuttle he arrived on in the tutorial was still bound to recall even though it had de-spawned. In my spamming of commands I believe I had somehow managed to recall to a ship that didn't exist which is why when I double clicked his icon the camera panned to the empty space where the shuttle had been.-Throughout the game I found myself repeat clicking, constantly re-issuing commands and click spamming just to get others to even register. This wasn't broodwar level lagging however, this took command lag to the next level. First I had to click what I wanted, had to wait for my character to get there, find out it was bugged, then had to walk away in order to un-qeue the order and then try again,-To illustrate just how poor the UI is, you don't actually click on the overlay, you have to find the tile amidst the clutter of overlapping textures that are in the way to select the item you want. This resulted quite often in random civilians being attacked accidentally, brawls ensuing, and crew being evacuated to de-agro the AI. The flip side problem with this is other objects ARE accessible simply by clicking their overlay, This becomes frustrating as you realise there will never be a way to move your torpedos out from behind your nuclear reactor if you start with the blue ship.- At one point I ran out of food and so naturally I bought more. But the game failed to register that the box of food was even an interactable object so my crew proceeded to starve around the completely full box of food. (kinda morbid)-There are no hot keys or auto-fire capabilities for weapons stations. This makes combat fairly harrowing as you go from issuing commands to go back down to manually ordering your weapons to fire. And in engagements where you're outnumbered with allied ships taking fire, it becomes a management nightmare. At the very least I should be able to issue fire commands at the press of a key, not trudge the the exasperating struggle of managing my apm between in map actions and toolbar effects."

It isn't.My first playthrough, what seems like a year ago was pretty solid for about 30 min. It's clear it hadn't ever been intended to function for longer than that. It wasn't possible to reload weapons, and within about 30 minutes you were out of ammo, bombarded with requests for help, and had a suicidal crew whose morale was crippled because you weren't completing quests....which you couldn't complete because you couldn't reload. So I uninstalled, watched and hoped.Seeing all the updates I just reinstalled the game. I was confused because somehow Alpha 8, exactly where I uninstalled it all those months ago. So I flipped to the beta branch which is on Alpha 10. Curious, did Alpha 9 get lost in the mail? Clearly it didn't get delivered.First 10 seconds on Alpha 10 the game crashed on launch. Launched again. Played through the intro space station. Followed the quest to warp to the next sector. That sector was empty, and the quest just seemed to stop. I warped into the next sector, there was a ship but no interaction. I tried to warp into a third sector...and my ship got stuck moving into warp. I tried adjusting course and I was able to warp back to the previous sector.Now it had a rescue encounter, where in order to rescue the crew of a failing ship I had to hire one of them to work at my space station...and leave the other one to die (I guess I could have paid to hire that one too but...). Teleporting back to my ship I discover that the alien I just rescued has vanished. I assume to my space station? So I warp again, towards home...Oh wait. It's the same F$!@%ing rescue encounter.Is there a game here somewhere? Or is the entire plot just me flying around the galaxy hiring people to work at shops in my space station?!"

Its only the teleporter.And then none of the other stations except for the shield were man-able.But that's ok, I'll just teleport over to their ship and kill them the old-fashioned way!Except the last guy on the ship was untargetable.Alt-F4.I'll wait until the game is further in development - way further - before I revisit it.I want to be good.

There is literally not a single aspect of the game that isn't bugged. It's not even close to playable at this point, no matter how hard you try. As if this wouldn't be already a deal breaker, the really sad thing is that the devs are simply incompetent to manage the mess they've build. Development is slow, unfocused and unprofessional. IMHO this game has not the slightest chance to be finished and without any doubt will end as abandon ware. Trust me, I know what an abandonware candidate looks like since I learned it the hard way by supporting Kinetic Void, Spacebase DF and way to many other EA titles... and those games where even in a better state than this game.

Again it is in early access but the fact that the developer is constantly working on it is a very good sign!Getting a little tired of the people who seem to want a perfect version right now.Edit: Full Early Access Review:Synopsis: This game is a bit of a cross between FTL, XCom(take your pick), and Space Base DS9. Your a space captain trying to explore the universe, gain reputation, and generally go full James T. Kirk on the galaxy (""We come in peace. Shoot to kill!""). Unlike FTL though there is no real ""rush"" other than some missions are timed.Pro's:1) Crew that levels up.2) Customizable ships (currently only the interior, eventually the entire layout, I believe)3) Bright, fun pixel art! I am getting a little tired of pixel art at this point, but art style is subjective so I'll give this a pro.4) The Developers are constantly working on this and give feedback in these very forums often.5) The Developers know about all the cons below and are working on them as I type this.Cons:1) It's buggy as heck (Early Access is Early Access)2) The AI is currently set to suicidal manic depressive with lethargy and a tendancy to procrastinate. This includes your crew. Especially your crew.3) Unless your really familiar with these types of games you will be more than a little lost after the first very brief tutorial.4) They have disabled a lot of features (or have yet to activate them) currently. It's a litte frustrating not being able to buy basic stuff you need like beds and food.5) The website for Star Command Galaxies hasn't been updated since October and is missing a LOT of information it use to have like the future progression of your crew and what planets will eventually look like.Remember: This game is a kickstarter that has entered Early Access, a lot of people on Steam seem to want feature complete games the moment they hit the Store. Take this into consideration when reading the downvote reviews, you will see many of them have some rather high expectations for EA games. This is a fun little game even in it's current condition and I would give it a buy especially at it's current price and remember --""We come in peace. SHOOT TO KILL!"""

The experience I had was fun, but there are still some major technical issues.In short I would only recommend the game if you are into alpha state games and working with the developers.

I've been following its progress for a few years now (I owned and enjoyed the mobile version when it first came out). I saw the bad reviews and warnings about the bugs and crashes but I couldn't wait any longer. I told myself that at the very least I'd be helping the developers by giving them money during the early access stage.I like these developers. Like I said I've been frequenting their facebook, twitter and blog updates regularly for ages and during that time I've seen them deal with a lot of negative and sometimes needlessly abusive comments. They've been accused of scamming people and lying and generally being horrible but I couldn't dissagree more with any of that, they've always seemed to try and communicate as best they can and are a genuinely funny bunch of guys.HOWEVER. Yes unfortunately there is a however... However the game is a freaking hot mess. Not just the bugs, everything; the UI, the design, the logistics it's all kind of off. The mobile version had a simple charm that could have been expanded upon but this recreation seems overly compilcated and at times ugly (which is sad to say because the pixel art is beautiful, just not all clumped together the way it is).Now, I know what people are going to say, it's early access. Yeah, ok sure but this has been in the making for years  now guys. I know it takes years to make a game but it's already been a long time and frankly at this stage in the game I was hoping for more. I don't doubt their commitment or integrity but I do have very serious doubts that they'll ever really pull it off. I mean, I have a very genuine fear that these guys are going to run out of cash before they finish the game y'know.I hope that one day soon I will have to eat my own words. I sincerly hope to dine on these words when WarBalloon complete the game we've been dreaming of. I will gladly come back here and swallow down every last one and write an update about what a fool I was to doubt them but as it stands today I have to unfortunately warn others not to spend their money on this product as not only is it not ready, I have a horrible feeling that it might not ever be ready.Pessimistic?

It has been a slow process, but they are adding to and updating everything as they are able.  It has its share of technical issues, but as a whole, the game is decent.  Organizing a crew, upgrading your ship, and supplying your team with weapons, food, and furniture is fun.When this game is complete, and officially released, I feel it will be the very starship simulator game that I have hoped for.  The IOS version of Star Command was fun, and I think this is an expanded version of that.  Would I recommend it to be bought early, in alpha?  No.  But, after final release, I think people will pick it up and really enjoy it."

Loved and enjoyed it from the first creation of star command for android. even sent a few angry messages cause it took so long to be released and i was impatient and couldnt wait.however for the price may not be worth the stress. ive found the interface incredibly clunky and so vary vary buggy. it would often zoom all the way out and wouldnt allow me to zoom back in. theres often missing animations on the sprite. animations for things are buggy or missing, the interface text is sometimes difficult to read due to low resolution fonts. had to quit and restart so many time because some bug broke the gameplay. even crashes while trying to just quit the game. They have a lot of content for sure. but are still missing lots, im sure one day it will be fantastic.  but they still have a long way, long way to go and a lot of bugs and polish to take care of before i would consider paying that price for this game.that said i believe it will one day be worth it.Just hope the devs put just a little more work into cleanup and they will be on their way for sure.i want to see it prosper and support the developers.if you want a game that you can actually do what your suppose to be able to do. save the money for now."

What I did expect was to see the game progress towards a final product and for the developer to regularly communicate their progress and goals as the game developed. That is not the case with this game. While this game is ""progressing"", the progress is limited to annual (or bi-annual if we’re lucky) updates that are so miniscule that this game will likely not be playable (let alone completed) in my lifetime. Communication from the development team generally comes in fits and spurt and largely focuses on assuring people who bought the game that despite all evidence to the contrary, the game is still being worked on.

Crew members level up with experience and, upon their first promotion, specialize in a profession of your choosing: Security, Medical or Engineering.Ship to ship combat is fairly straight forward.  Your ship is equipped with a basic shield for defense, and a machinegun and a torpedo launcher for offense.  In addition to slugging it out with ranged weapons, you may attempt to board the enemy by beaming crew members over.  Enemy ships may not be captured; however, ship equipment may be seized (or purchased) to upgrade your own vessel. You may upgrade your ship by purchasing a new one at a space station.The game is in early access, and I experience the occasional bug - most do not seriously detract from my enjoyment of the game. I recommend Star Command Galaxies because it is fun. The current price (14.99 USD as I write this) is reasonable for what you get."

I played the default for 3 hours trying to figure out the content before realizing this.I was a big fan of Star Command on Android, and this game looks like a fantastic sequel to that, but it's not quite playable yet.  I've had difficulty with playing due to some bugs and general UI being a little laggy (probably due to using a lot of memory), but I can see a lot of fun stuff that I'd like to get to when everything is stable.  If you run into trouble, try reloading your save as that's generally worked for me.  Overall I would say this is still an early release game, and you should expect some issues like this until it's completed and released.  I very much look forward to that point!If you have played the first Star Command game, FTL, and the like, then you'll like this game as well, just keep in mind it's still an early access game."

I've been following this game ever since it came out on IOS and android, and I'm proud to see that it's come to this. HOWEVER, one major thing that has caused me to play this less and less is the sudden 'stutters' the game has. While I get around 60fps on max graphics, and the game runs rather smoothly, I've noticed that it tends to stutter, or lag for a few seconds randomly.

Combat is a joke. Crew members run around aimlessly and need constant attention for some idiotic game play mechanic that requires you to keep them happy every minute.

Still doesn't really work.  There are problems with trying to use different screen resolutions, mouse control is a bit buggy, out of 3 attempts to teleport, I had two game lock ups and had to exit to desktop.  If you pause the game, you can not give orders to your crew. Trying to talk to someone on a space station is frustrating, as they rarely stop moving and with the mouse lag you really can't right click on them while moving. Since you can't pause and give commands, you can't talk to them that way either. You just have to hope they stop moving.I still can not recommend this game."

Speed up! Keep Going forward!ALWAYS FORWARD NEVER BACK----------------------------------Just waiting on the long process of getting updates is frustraighting... Lol  Other than that this games a blast for early access. There pretty active on Twitter and always asking for people to test in the beta (But im not a Beta Branch) Guy i wait for the OFFICIAL updates. Tho the wait be long. a real review will come onces outta Early access"

But I won't make any refunds, as I do belive that it will progress and gets waaay better, bigger and bugs-free. It has a lot of potencial, guys and I bough it mostly in order to support the devs. It's great idea, just... Pretty crude at current state (Alpha 5). But sometimes the bugs could be fun... Like this one time when I accidentally kidnapped a random alien with my teleporter, trying to teleport my crew back to my ship. He's been like the vessel's mascot, wandering around aimessly, talking with the crew... Untill he died of hunger. So, yeah. Buy it if you want to support the devs."

Buuuuuuut it's in early access so I totally get it.Plus, the devs have been updating it and making the fixes so that's active team.Besides that, it is actually a cool game. I say that as I deal with the bugs. That's rare. I like it, and I'm looking forward to the work they're adding into it. Great concept, the game looks good and it seems to have a fairly big space for you to play in too.My men are hungry so I keep having to recuit new people for them to consume :P."

I know exactly what I get into when buying early access games: bugs, crashes, corrupted saves, I was ready for them all.... but then I purchased the game and I realized that this game isn't ready for full release. I looked the discussion section and realized I should wait a little bit. in 20min I did spend in the game I experienced some bugs like the UI from the map showing on inside of the ship and going black and white which is accually kinda cool. I'm not really saying don't buy it, I'm saying that it can become better and if your the type of guy/girl to jump head first and start punching bugs in the face and report them to the devs, by all mean buy it. but if you'd like to play a game without any interruptions then look else where."

The annoying one was one or two times when the jump animation (lights) wouldnt end after jump ended. The first game breaking one is the already commented upon placing item/resource bug where you cant get out of the place function and have to alt-f4The second game breaking bug i just encountered when going to center of the universe from that asteroid belt below the top antarian space station, it didnt warp me to the center of universe, instead it opened a rift into a realm of complete darkness that i couldnt escape. I will post info on the bug in the forums for you guys to go over. But the times that i have been playing this are genuinely fun! I would definitely recommend this title."

The game has just been releashed in early access and its in a fairly difficult to play state due to the number of bugs in the game.However, having played the IOS version of this game. Their product will be solid, and they've expanded the scope of the game to have a lot more.Currently, the game is looking a lot like an FTL and Xcom mix."

Just put it into your watchlist and follow up with the dev progress if you are coutious (fair nuf), if you are a true space adventurer though and not afraid of puny bugs you should get on board and help bring this one to its full potential."

But like many other rewievers i have to complain about the performance of the game that makes it nearly impossible to play along. There are many bugs and the game is not really intuitve. If they improve this game further I will clearly update my review.UPDATE:I recently looked into the new changes and the game really went a long way in quite a short time. I only played for a short time, but it already felt a lot better and i think if you like this kind of game you may have a nice time with it. Of course there are still things to improve, but I'm optimistic they will keep on their work."

The game became very slow after few hours gameplay on my laptop, maybe its my cheap laptop fault but i didnt experience this problem with other heavy games2. the ai need to be more smarter, example = eventhough your idle crew near invader they wont attacked it, you need to control attack manually, sometimes they dont react with their desire to eat, sleep, or doing their asignment acording to their job (example:engineer wont repair damaged ship eventhough its on the same room, you must control it manually closer to the damaged part)  its ok if you only have small crew but when you have alot of crew thats getting frustating.3. The control sometime became frustating as it hard to target object (sometimes it just snap other object next to it and wont target object).4. object cant be rotated 360 its make harder to manage room in ship5. Interface doesnt scale with lower resolution6. I dunno if this one just happen to me or not, its hard to get bed and that is  game over for my 1st gameplay.thats all the major thing i dont like atm, theres others bug like npc graphic artifact, cursor and any other small glitch.I have big hope that they will fix all this in the future and I will update my review.ATM i dont recommend this game to my friends, we'll see after alpha 9.I know its alpha so dont hate me for make such bad review.Sorry my engrish suck-----------------------------Review update 14 february 2017This game is geting better and better,I have good faith on this developer, they keep fixing it and burning some bugs.As alpha stage this game is bright, but still there are alot of room for improvement and bug fixing.Keep up the good jobThumb up at this stage"

However the game is still in development, and has a ton of potential, if you are like me and bought the game because you have it for the Andriod/IOS than you might be a bit disappointed because of it state of the game. But don't let this hinder you, the game is still in beta and the devs and community have spent hours upon hours on ironing out the kinks and glitches within the game and the feedback and communication from the devs to community is very frequent and helpful unlike many other developers.All I ask is that you give the game a chance, and help take part in building a wonderful little masterpiece."
