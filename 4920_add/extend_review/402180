The game itself serves as a somber reminder of the event, but most of all as a critique of the American reaction as such. The two girls, referencing the Twin Towers no doubt, also provide a deep philosophical insight into the post 9/11 governmental response, of the bickering between two political parties despite both of their intents being the good of the American people, represented by the main character. Truly a work of art and a standout for its deep thematic elements that rival that of any great work."

But I really don't like how the story ended, not that the story was bad, but the fact that, much like with the other Sakura games, the story could easily keep on going and I felt it a bit short.While I know that Visual novels are not for everyone, they are great when you want to take a break from intensive user input games and when you want to relax and read/enjoy a story. This is no exception. It has an good story and has left me wanting more.Pros:- Original Artist Back.- Amazing Soundtrack.- Ecchi, But modest and doesn't take themes too far.- Story that if you actually read, will have you wanting more.Cons:- Story was too short IMHO, could have extended to a FINAL choice was needed.No Other ConsThat's about it.If you like visual novels, a fan of the Sakura Series (Spirit & Angels) with the original artist making a return, You may end up liking this VN as well.UPDATE:I had no idea there was a patch for this game, thanks to Videogame57 for saying.It basically means that my previous review is null and void. Ignore everything I said about the ecchi images, the patch takes it a lot further. When I reviewed the game it was within 4 hours of its release so I had no idea of the patch.My point still stands for the other Pros, the fact that is has a really good soundtrack is the same ect.I will not post a link to the patch, but it is available for download if you look for it."

Upon his arrival at the new school, under the encouragement of a teacher, he decides to join an under-represented swim club in the school that only has two girls Hiromi and Mieko as its members. Over the course of this visual novel, Kaede would gain the drive and commitment to swim for the school's swimming team, the love and attention from Hiromi and Mieko and his father's support to allow him to continue his studies and training at his current high school.The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice. There are more than 1500 positive reviews at the time of this review, nice soundtracks by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail' and great artwork by Wanaca. Recommended for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series and the great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game and when at discount or bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to read through the visual novel and unlock all CGs."

This was the impression I gained from all the positive reviews.The sad fact is that this game spends 1 hour (default autoforward settings) introducing characters and establishing 'my' backstory, with a few sprinkles of softcore stills.

Sakura Fantasy introduced more storylines (decisions) and interesting dialogue which I find a necessity in games like these.There is so much work that could have been done. I understand that sometimes you need to release content that you know will sell quickly regardless of its faulty, its how business works. And in the end we all know what these games are: to satisfy the male population whom wholeheartedly seeks to fulfill theirdesiresniche.Unlike some people, I'm willing to admit I like drawings of female students with melon sized chest and apple bottoms.But when it can be so much more than ""wrist injuries"" and ""tissue management"", don't you think you deserve more than this?What I feel this game lacks and what I think games like this deserveA variety of choices that effect the direction of the story (Which, in SF, was a step in the right direction)A better emotional attachment to the characters (Specifically referring to: ""My mom has cancer"". Really? Couldn't have explained it better?) - This is however, improving in the sakura seriesAnimation ( Yes, I'm specifically referring to the animations like those in NEKOPARA)What I feel like this game fulfills or exceeds at:18+ Content that more than half of the community desires. ( Which I think is part of games like this)Artistical talentFinally, I feel like the Sakura series could be so much more. Anyone that plays this game can wholeheartedly agree that there is something missing to it. I recommend this game only because I hate to see potential be frowned upon."

But I do not recommend this visual novel reason can be found below.The storyFollow the story of Kaede, just your average high school guy. Upon transferring to a new school, he meets two beautiful girls in the swim club. Things haven't gone well for the swim club lately, but with Kaede's help, that all changes.Audio and Visual elementsVisual elementsas much as I hate to say this, the art for sakura games are always very solid always nice and really smooth looking, overall pleasing to the eyeAudio elementsI am not really sure but I think i heard some of them before from their sakura clicker game which is being re-used (just a portion), obviously it is a huge negative for me in regards to the audio, this just shows how much effort has been put into this visual novel.Reasons for not recommending this Visual NovelThe story is very generic, when I first read this visual novel I felt bored very bored because its generic and predictable. The story felt like it was being taken from somewhere and then being placed into their game and just change the location/theme that it takes place which in this case a swim club.The fansercvice, while playing through this visual novel you are literally being slapped in the face with boob and panty shots every 15 minutes, this just shows that they are using fanservice to cover up their bad and generic story.Some scenes, I will be honest here so scenes does not make any sense despite it being very nice to look at 1 - 2 scenes just does not make any senses lets take for example, the scene where the 2 heroines were kissing each other underwater.To sum upNo i do not recommend getting this game at all unless you are a sakura series fan or just want a story that slaps you in the face with boobs every 10 minutes in a attempt to cover up their bad plot/story."

A 2 hour long trip full of fan service and harem genre cliches, but unlike Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 this game follows the trend of the first two games (along with their marginal improvements over one another) with the story focusing on a pair of two genuinely entertaining swim club members. While the other Sakura games all have a ""suddenly tragic backstory"" section where an attempt at making the reader feel a connection towards a character none were handled particularly well I must admit this one actually is a pretty decent improvement over the others (not good, but an improvement) even if, ridiculously, literally every character has one.The dialogue overall is basically on par with Sakura Spirits, but there were a lot of typos throughout the entire VN which is a pretty big issue when it's so short.If you're looking for some entertaining and funny harem style story you're going to get one here. It's actually pretty funny breaking new records for the Sakura games in terms of the oblivious MC and his funny as hell deadpan responses the events around him. If you want rounded characters with rich backstories who you can relate and connect with then look elsewhere.Is it a good VN? No. Is it a good VN for the genre that it wants to be? Yes, and that's why I can recommend these only to those who find this style funny/entertaining.Side note: The menu sound effects are SO SATISFYING THEY ARE LIKE THE BEST PART OF THE GAME. 10/10 MENU SOUND DESIGN."

Why? Well, the story is fairly mediocre and extremely linear, which is usually fine in an H game, and something I wouldn't ordinarily be so picky about. However, the game is also quite short, and I beat it and followed every possible path in about 2 hours, and not only that, but there are honestly fairly few H scenes to be found regardless. All in all, the game is likely worth your time if you're an average hentai VN reader, but at 10 dollars the price is rather steep for what I consider to be a short and frankly unpolished VN. This being said, it's great to see an American studio attempt to bring Visual Novels to an English-speaking market, and hope to see better things in the future from Denpasoft, as I have great hopes for this company."

This story is an high school slice of life story with an ""eroge"" love triangle. I thought it had very good, understandable, funny and interesting story. It has great artwork, japanese voiceovers, english subtitles, music and sound.  It has a free hentai patch, wow nice extra hentai material, uncensored xxx.  It is a cliche anime story, characters and fanservice.  The choices don't really change the ending, just the dialog or the visual scene.

What are the real differences between close friends and a couple?It was interesting to see how the writer handled 3 kind-hearted and well meaning people in the early stages of a forming ""love triangle"".

This is my first sakura game and most certainly my last, the only reason I bought it was because of the good reviews and because it was in the same category as Huniepop (which was an incredibly fun puzzle game).This wasn't a game.  I made maybe 4 interactive choices in the game, and the rest of the OVER AN HOUR OF ""GAMEPLAY"" was my clicking to get through the terribly written (terribly translated?) ""story"".  The character you play as is generic and boring, completely void of personality, and the girls (the only 2 sprites in the entire game) are copy paste from every anime ever.  Even as a porn it sucks.  5 or so ecchi pictures throughout thousands of dialog boxes, all of which happen ""accientally"" because you, the main character, Keade or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ would walk into the girls lockeroom, or into their bathroom while they're changing, then act surprised, and procede to try and skip 30 fedora-tipping dialog boxes about how pretty she is.What the ♥♥♥♥, this whole thing was trash.  Gameplay?  None.   Story?  Garbage.  Length?  Nonexistant.  Replayability?  I wish I didn't ""play"" it in the first place.  Characters?  Copypaste.  Art?  Pretty good, oddly enough.  But for $10? (~$7 on sale?)  I would expect more than two goddamn avatars, and a handful of backgrounds.Not a game, don't advertise it as one.  If you want something similar that you can actually play and have an impact in, try Huniepop.

If you play these only to beat your meat then by all means go ahead and catch a glimpse of a few ""revealing"" pictures, don't expect too much though. There's several reasons why this fails as a good VN. The characters are shallow and provoke no feelings at all. The plot is cheesy, highly unrealistic, boring and rushed. Kaede, the protagonist, makes no connection to the player in any way. Simply throwing in some daddy issues and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥soul searching does not immerse the player in the story. While the two other characters provided some hopes as plot devices they failed their role of both heroines and plot device. Feeling sympathy or empathy for the heroines is nigh impossible since their conflict is touched only slightly and immediately resolved once they're introduced. Apathy is the only thing I ever felt towards any character since their choices are ridiculously simple and have no impact on anything. There is only one route which is too perfect to be happy about. Plot itself is cheap and very dull, there is no real main conflict until half way through the game and even that is resolved just a few moments later. If you're not looking for conflict but rather romance even that concept is slaughtered by a stupid ""tease never show anything and no real feelings"" relationship. This is a VN without plot, depth and characters. Huge waste of money there's plenty of better VNs."

The others at least had some thought behind them. This one is literally ""The quest for breasts"". Sakura Swim Club is about our main character Generic McWhiteman having to find a gf. Where to look first? At his new school (what a new concept) which conveniently has a swim club where only two females with big boobs attend. We all know what's gonna happen.The game starts with our hero being in his room (also something we've never seen in a Sakura game) talking about him being at a new school and being so edgy that he doesn't care. Even during school he doesn't care, which causes the teacher to have a talk with him. You doh't get to see her, but we all know how they would have drawn a female teacher in a Sakura game. She asks if you want to join some club to live out your interests, and the inevitable choice is the swim club, which seems to be rather imfamous. As you go there you bump into one of the girls going there and get to see her pantsu. She is sooo embarrased but ends up liking you anyway. Surprise. Anyway, you progress to the pool and see the two boobs. Girls. Sorry. You get to meet them, hang out with them, yadda yadda, it's basicly a more straight forward Go! Go! Nippon or Sakura Spirit. The game's writing is as amazing as ever and features our favourite actor Typos BadGrammarston. Also don't forget about the CG scenes. In one of them one of the girls literally tumbles over a controller cables which causes her to be unable to move and be half-naked. Yes.I can't really say there's much to expect from these games story-wise, and this one's purpose clearly isn't story. The other games had some sense of story. They were books with a certain amount of hentai stuffed in them. This one is hentai with a certain amount of novel stuffed in it. Apparently this game, along with Sakura Fantasy got censored for steam even, and we're not talking ""oh no a nipple better put a conveniently placed object over it, no. That was the case in Sakura Fantasy, yes, but in this game's original cut you got to actually see some... ""action"" I guess. I mean that's what some of the guides suggested when I alt-tabbed.Edit: I did some uh...practical research. Never again.I recommend this game for people who have no idea where to see lewd pictures of 2D waifus. I don't recommend this game for people who are looking for a meaningful visual novel. It does serve the purpose of a novel, not a good one, but a novel. But the bigger purpose it serves is to get you hard."

That is true, though I was more interested in the simple story more than its original purpose (not like I had a choice since the  nudity is only availible through an official patch, because steam). Its not terribly complex, but it didn't need to be if it had such interesting and more importantly, relatable characters with struggles too real and sad not to care for, for a setting based around a swim club anyway. Someone did actually thought of that.Nudity can only be accessed by downloading a patch and ♥♥♥♥ing with the files a bit, though if you'd like a simple story with cute anime girls with character (such a novel concept), I'd reccommend this.Mieko and Hiromi best girls."

Even as a fan of VNs in general, I feel the Sakura games typically cater to a niche audience.  If you are part of that audience, this game is a definite improvement over the older Sakura games.  The presentation is cleaner, the dialog is less awkward, the story makes more sense, and there happens to be an 18+ patch for the game if you are over 18 and would like more explicit content.A word about the patch.  It isn't available directly on Steam and the game itself is not uncensored without the patch in order to comply with Steam's rules and make the game more accessible.  So ignore the complaints from those who say there is false advertising.  It does take a bit more work to install the patch than say the one for Sunrider did, but it's not bad and you definitely don't need to enjoy the patch.The bottom line is, if you like the Sakura games and don't have this one, pick it up while it is on sale.

Also there is a uncencored patch which adds actual lewd matierial they're small but will probably work at making someone horny whoever out there that is, Throw in some pretty decent music and you have Sakura Swim Club but what I see more out of this game is improvment in writing from the developers which is always goodOverallStory 5/10 Nothing Groundbreaking just normal rebelious kid doesn't want to be like family stuff except with actual reasoning from the main character that feels legitamitArt 6.5/10 Nothing too different from WingedCloud here which is fine, But the background feel like they took a step up in qualitySound 6.5/10 This has some pretty decent music except for one track that has a real off saxophone, and good usage of ambiant noisesOverall 6/10 Its your average visual novel but with a kick♥♥♥♥♥rock track within it, Whats more important is that it shows improvment from the developers which is good"

Sakura Spirit is a 2014 visual novel developed by Winged Cloud and published by Sekai Project. The game was released on July 9, 2014 on Steam and MangaGamer. It is one of the few visual novels that are developed outside Japan and aimed at the English-speaking market. It is also one of the first projects published by Sekai Project that is not a translation of a Japanese visual novel, but rather an original English work. The game is a visual novel where the player reads text on the screen combined with anime-styled artwork. However, unlike some other visual novels, Sakura Spirit does not allow the player to make selections (except for one at the end), which normally allows the visual novel's plot to progress in the direction of the player's choice. Overall Sakura Swim Club is a must buy for any japanese artwork lover (anime) at its best."

This is awful.

If you label your game as a ""visual"" AND ""novel"", I expect for both to be of a certain level of quality. Though, to be fair, phrasing it like that implies that any sort of effort went into the art. It's basically as minimal effort as one can get.The worst of all was the music, though. Here's a bit of a tip, devs. If you want your music to not feel jarring, put in a bit of effort and make it into a proper loop, don't just have it stop and start again five hundred times.TL;DR: Abysmal writing, awful dialogue, lazy art style, grating music....look into Sakura Fantasy instead or seek something from a different developer."

Because in every other aspect, this game doesn't feel like the 6th installment in the Sakura series, having very low potential on a series that is already pretty lukewarm.StoryLike Sakura Spirit, nothing too remarkable, in this one however, they took a more down-to-earth tone, however, not compensating with more meat to the bone, even when it gets humorous or ""attempts"" to be tragic, is still way too basic for its own good, Spirit wasn't much better, but atleast we had a more diverse and exotic type of plot.CastOh geez, what did they do to you?Spoilers aside, you only have two girls, as oppose to the (5?) in Sakura Spirit, it could have been good if each was introduced and dug deep into, but we never learn anything from them besides their latest trauma/worry, our main character isn't any better, needless to say, this results into a very empty attachment with the characters, if not for the fap or waifu material, don't get me wrong they are charming, but the lack of compensation makes it a step backwards.WritingIs just K, can call a couple of typos and as the previous segments have told already, everything is very voidy in this game, nothing is truly developed to create a... you know... Visual Novel.At times you are given plot options, but the only difference is that one of them triggers a few additional lines of dialogue and the other doesn't, I didn't have much of a problem, but for standing of VNs, this would pass as the barest kind of minimum.GraphicsWill say, just as good as its previous games, the BGs and your girls are pretty nicely detailed and with the CGs the detail goes all out, showing great... exposition, if you get me.Not everything here is bliss though, like Spirit, the number of Portraits is limited (Still more than Spirit anyway) and at times, they can be lacking, losing some cinematography, especially when the girls reveal their problems.SoundtrackLike the Graphics, it remains pretty solid for the most part, the songs bring various types of beat to them and they generally work good with the situations used, they can get kinda loopy at points, and the music fades-out instead of looping, which bothers me to no end (Spirit did it too, but atleast the tracks were longer).DurationOH BOY... Just when you thought the strongest and most prominent point of VNs was missed with this one.Legit here, it barely took me 1 hour to finish the game, AutoSkip can do it under 7 minutes.Most of the game is bland, but this point takes it too far, Spirit atleast lasted 2 hours at bare minimum, in what mindset one releases a Novel as short as this?Don't let my playtime decieve you, i just had to run the extra hour because I was getting the Trading Cards.tl;drI want to like this game, but the sheer simplicity and mediocrity of this game unables me, is not terrible, is just bare and too plain to be a good VN.If you wanna support Winged Cloud, Check out the other Sakura games see if anyone is better, if you are looking for a decent VN, look somewhere else, you ain't gonna find it here.It has the ingredients, it just happens to go by the path of plain functionality.As such, i shall grant this game...PlainOmelette/10"

It sounds depressing but guess what? There's BOOBS!I was oddly surprised with Sakura Swim Club.  Having never read (""played"") a visual novel before I wasn't quite sure what I was in for.  I had played some choose your own adventure style games like Appointment with F.E.A.R. in which you design your character and make choices throughout the story.  Your choices in these games have immediate consequences and often lead to dead ends.  There are no dead ends in this.  It is truly just a graphic novel on your computer.  Your choices are menial and make no real difference in the story line other than a few new lines immediately after your choice.  So let's break it down.Visuals: 2/5Well, there are well drawn busty anime girls, that is the ultimate benefit to the visuals.  You get to see about 20 images of our two sexy protagonists Mieko and Hiromi.  Other than these shots the rest of the game is pretty lacking in the visuals department. There are about a half dozen backgrounds that are repeated throughout the story. They obviously could have expanded on the environments and background images. There is no animation of any kind.  When you are talking the characters kind of fade out and fade in to a new position and that is the extent of it.  Some panning across the screen or simply guiding the character across the screen would have been a bit exciting.  The other odd part of the visual backgrounds is that there are no people in them.  You end up talking to your teacher in class, but you don't see anyone in the empty classroom.  I found that a bit odd.  Were they too lazy to draw in classmates and a teacher?Gameplay: 1/5Well you don't really play anything.  There are under 20 ""choices"" that you get to make, but they do not change the story.  They merely change a sentence or two after you make your choice.  Your character, Kaede, immediately reconnects with the original plot no matter what choice you make.  So essentially you click through the dialogue.  I took my time, writing notes, taking screen shots etc for videos and finished this graphic novel in under 4 hours.  It will probably take you a lot less.  I believe if you just wanted to cruise through and see the boobs, you could probably rapid click this game in about a half hour.Audio: 1/5The music in this game is pretty sucky.  There are about a half dozen songs that loop during the chapters.  They loop often though.  Each song is about a minute long and does not loop very well. The songs feel like they were ripped from another game where they actually made sense and fit the mood of the game.  In this novel they do very little to enhance the story.  In fact they distract you from the story because they suck so much.  On a different not, the sound effects and ambient noises are great.  The water for the pool sounds great.  The muddled hall conversations give the reader a feel of being in school.  Not sure how they could do so well on one aspect and completely blew it on the other.Story Line: 3/5This is the part that blew me away.  I was expecting some cheesy high school relationship banter and some silly hentai situations that result in people seeing each other naked.  Well they have that in here, but they also have some really deep♥♥♥♥♥♥  We have a protagonist with a serious rift that has torn his relationship with his dad apart.  A girl whose mom is suffering from cancer and another student that has been ostracized after her best friend was paralyzed in a drunk driving accident.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥  I didn't see anything like that coming from previews that I saw.  Thankfully the heavy story line is filled with bouncing breasts to ease the immensely depressing doses of sadness and struggle in this game.Overall: 2/5At first I felt a bit shorted on the value of this game.  Three hours of game play for more than $5 seemed like a rip.  Then I remembered that this was a graphic novel and thought that I paid about the same price I would pay for a manga at a book store.  I got shafted on the music and was disappointed by the lack direction that different choices took me.  This could easily lead to great replay (reread) value and unlock more boobs.  On the upside, the story was actually kind of serious, the sound effects were decent and the boobs were plentiful."

Not to mention the fact that you only have two choices and they don't appear for every ten or so minutes. Even then you can't pick choices you even care about, the game automatically forces you to date both girls anyway.Speaking of which, both of the girls fall in love with you but they do as such miraculously at the same time, for reasons that make absolutly no sense nonetheless, regardless of the fact that they know next to nothing about you. Supposedly they're very smart yet disprove this by both agreeing to date the main character at the same time: Again showing that they have no personality. Or at least the personality they do have is torn in half and thrown under a bus by the time they fall in love with you.Moving on: The dad, whose only purpose in the story is to talk to you on the phone and stall time so that the days don't feel so close together. Later in the story changing that purpose to becoming a temporary antagonist, telling his son he has to move. Which I, as the player, do not care about because the main character is practically brain dead anyway for chosing two girls rather than one like a normal ♥♥♥♥ing human being. For those people who DO care though, don't fret as this only last for about five minutes going a little something like this;-""Girlfriend 1, girlfriend 2, I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so my dad is making me go to another school""-""What? Noooo. Call him back, tell him no.""-""Okay.""Calls the dad back.-""Shove off, Dad, I'm staying.""-""Pfft. Alright.""WTF is happening?! Obviously, these aren't the exact lines but they're not that far off so it doesn't even matter. I can't even make up a story this bad. I can't, I really can't, beyond that I don't even WANT to make up a story this bad. It's that bad. That's all this stupid visual novel is! I had to turn my brain off in order to keep playing half way through. Do I even need to talk about all the absolutly forced fan-service? I'm all for it, as long as it doesn't get in the way of the good stuff, but in Sakura Swim Club, or whatever this crap is called. Don't even know if that's right. Here though, you have fan-service up the♥♥♥♥♥ walk into a room with a girl in order to study so you don't fail at life? NOPE! She's stripping now? Okay. ""This is stupid"" Shut up brain.Oh! How about that one moment? You want to play videogames with a girl? NOPE! The controller, inexplicably, has a magic ♥♥♥♥ing cord. Managing to not only strip one of the girls, somehow, but wrap around her body and tighten into some weird BDSM kink fantasy. At least it was kind enough to cover her nipples though, that silly controller cable.It saddens me, it really does. The girls of this game have some really good designs, and Himori has an awesome personality for the first half of the game. It just sucks that this game waste their potential by trying to force itself. For the most part, this isn't even a visual novel. It's a poorly written book with fan-service drawings every few pages and the ability to, slightly, change a few dialogues here and there. Though not perfectly, I feel like this visual novel wouldn't totally suck if it just gave you the option to chose which girl you want to date rather than being forced to date them both.Now for the ♥♥♥♥♥ out there who skip to the end of my review.

Eh, ""despite"" isn't actually a good word for it, since being a hentai game doesn't really prevent it from having a nice story. People just rarely bother to develop one. Winged Cloud did it right, though.This is Sekai Project's first game on Steam that has actual hentai in it (it does need a patch though.) The art is great, and the soundtrack is actually surprisingly good for being a visual novel/h-game. Sometimes I didn't want to advance to the next page because I enjoyed listening to the music so much. (And there were other times where I was too busy looking at the............( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) scenery ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )For $10, it's a pretty great visual novel/h-game with a nice soundtrack, a great story, and kinky hentai. I may be biased to the story since I've had a relationship with two girls at once who both knew and were (somewhat) okay with it, but you don't need to be able to sympathize with the main character in order to enjoy the HOT KINKY HENTAI so trust me, it's $10 well spent."

I like to think of myself as a VN enthusiast, so when I first saw Sakura Swim Club, I thought  it was going to be a load of bogus. I was thinking that there was going to be alot of fan service, perverted moments, etc.While it does have some suggestive themes you would typically see in anime, manga, and VN, it provides a great story. The story is short, but it contains alot of detail about being a nobody, then turning into a sombody after trial and error. The game has a ton of questions which can affect the progression of the game. I haven't gone back to play it again yet, so that piece will be reviewed soon.Overall I was pleased with Sakura Swim Club. Given the shortness of the game and the lack of full blown content, I can't knock on these guys. It may be a really small dev team that can't provide that much.

,Recommended,402180,18085540,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,Nermie,"All the filler reviews are funny and all, but I think this deserves at least one serious one. I'll split it up into sections and then provide an overall.Art - 8The art hasn't changed all that much since the earlier Sakura games, still the same big-boobed designs and similar faces. Not that that is a bad thing, because it is appealing art. What has improved is angle representation and overall anatomical presentation. The characters look more natural in their CGs, which is very important. There is room for improvement, but it's gotten a lot better.Characters - 7Fairly cliche characters, which again is not a bad thing, because it's comfortable. The girl's personalities are engaging and entertaining, with Mieko being a classic tsundere and Hiromi being the cool girl. My main qualm with the characters is actually the protagonist. Where these two girls are pouring their hearts out to him and he helps them work through their individual issues, he seems set on refusing any help for his own. It's annoying.Sound - 8Nothing to really write home about. It fulfills it's purpose, and matches appropriate scenes with the proper music for the mood. The sound effects sound fairly natural and nice. They could do with a slightly wider variety of music at longer lengths though. They loop too quickly and too much.Story and Writing - 7These two go hand in hand, so I'm combining them. I won't put any spoilers, but the story is fairly cliche, like much of everything else in the game. Again, not a bad thing. It's comfortable, and has some very amusing parts. The main problem I have is with the pacing. Things move VERY quickly. I know it's hard to complain about the length of a $10 VN when longer full-length VNs are somewhere around $40-50 (although much of that comes from voice acting), but they could definitely have transitioned events better and not time-skipped as much as they did. I feel like there was a lot of wasted opportunity in the story. Not every scene needs a CG to accompany it. The writing for the most part is solid, gets the point across, and the jokes are amusing. Not really much to say here, except they should have given the game a more thorough QC pass before sending it out. I've pointed out a number of easy grammar and spelling errors that any half-decent QC and editor should have noticed and fixed.Overall - 7Sakura Swim Club is a decent short-length VN with an amusing and sometimes dramatic story. While it's main purpose is certainly showcasing the famous boobs and butts of it's illustrator, it is a fairly fun ride, albeit with some quirks and definitely has room for improvement. It moves along a bit too quickly to really get attached to the characters and their various personal issues, so it has pacing problems, but it tells it's story well enough in the time it's allowed. I'd say it's worth it's $10 price tag."

Of course, to be fair, I enjoy the Sakura series of games (Sakura Spirits and Sakura Angels) :I like the art and the character designs in the game.  I also like how Winged Cloud presents the male protagonists (aka - the dude you control) and in this case the guy was just coasting along, apathetic toward everything when he meets Hiromi and Mieko and ends up join the swim club with them.  He isn't King Stud who gets all the girls, but he isn't quite an ""everyman"" either.  I mean Kaede (our hero in this game) is, in my opinion, someone who many of us can relate to in that he has so many other people telling what to do with his life that his only defense is apathy (I went to high shcool with a couple of guys like this).Now, there's a lot of cheesecake here (even more with R18 patch ), and there might even be a love story that ranges from sappy to unrealistic  However, this story also focuses on three people that due to circumstances they cannot control, are deeply unhappy with the directions their lives are going in and turn to each other to give themselves the strength they need to get a grasp on their lives and steer themselves in a better direction.So yeah, there's gonna be T&A (or allusions to it).There's gonna be sex (if you patched it out).But there's also a very pleasant human story in the midst of all that and it's one that almost anybody can enoy no matter what the rating of your particular game may be."

But it wasn't until now that I caved in and bought it thanks to the summer sale.  But is it any good or should it of been drowned in the development stages?Well I went into SSC with high expectations as the only VNs I had played before hand was the Nekopara and because of this I ended up coming out a bit disapointed. In regards to plot well there isn't really any I mean it's a hentai I game I get it but at least Nekopara was able to create a story with varying character arcs that could also lead to sequel games but eh. The protagonist is called Kaede and honestly he has about as much personality as a cardboard cutout of the WWE wrestler Roman Reigns. He transfers to a new school and looks for a club to join he stumbles across the swimming clubs and after a hasty start with its members eventually becomes romantically involved with the 2 members of the club.Honestly if you have seen any school anime you have seen this kind of story before, they try to make it emotional and act as if the 2 girls actually have character but after the touching moments the character development seems to go out of the window and the matters discussed no longer effect the 2 girls at all. Honestly though the story comes across as cheesy and I found myself actually laughing at some of the predictable tropes that occured in the story to the point where I see its cheesiness as a good thing. There is also now a Japanese dub for the girls in the gae and honestly the VO is great I would sahAh yes I may as well talk about the girls whilst I am here. Allow me to introduce typical tsundere character number 761 and typical calm and collected character number 828 yeah they are basic characters that don't have much depth to them at all but again it is a hentai game so I don't really know what was expecting.Last but no means least and the reason the game has this infamous reputation is the 18+ scenes although they are not animated like Nekopara I would say they are nicely put together but I suppose the great artwork is the reason for this. They're okay. And are honestly worth both your time and use of hand cream.So even though I see Sakura Swim Club as a some what mediocre game I can't say that I wouldn't reccomend it as it's a hentai game and those scenes aren't bad in all honesty. The only other thing to note is the music apart from 2 tracks THAT WILL DRIVE YOU INSANE AFTER BEING PLAYED OVER AND OVER the soundtrack is pretty good too.

Было много эттчи сцен, но х♥й так себе стоял, ну не найс они были. Сюжет во многом хорошо проработан, и в целом он получился неплохим, но один х♥й он не найс. во- первых, сюжет сделан так, что тебе в любом случее тебе покажется что он  быстро летит. Игра получилась славной, только короткой п♥здец. Прошел на одном дыхание. Было очень обидно, когда там не дали выбрать с кем мне встречаться а, то я бы беззусловно выблял Миэко . Отличной идей разрабов была- озвучка персонажей( двух тян), я тек от этих нежных голосков. Есть одна вещь, которая на протяжении всей игры меня бесила. Это мелодия ""непристойных сцен "", эта мелодия настолько еб♥нная, что из- за нее я не мог нормально сосредоточиться на игре, не говоря о мастурбации!!!

""read"". this one has some good H-scenes for the perverted crowd out there, and also a good dating-sim feel. the characters are pretty bland in this one and follow some typical anime archetypes, but that doesnt take away from the story too much. get the uncensored patch. do it. the music and sound in this game are well done too for anybody who is listening to anything but the moans of their new VN waifus. If you have seen the show Free! iwatobi swim club; this game is the exact opposite: a raunchy over-the-top hentai with more females than males, but hey, at least they are both about swimming.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."
