All you do is monitor the incoming planes and try to find a gap to send departing planes on their way. It starts off simple, but gets progressively more difficult as the sky gets busier. This happens until you lose enough attention to cause 2 planes to collide. You then swear profusely at how stupid you have been, think about rage quitting. Then instead of exiting, you press the retry button again and again until it's 4am. It's a form of self inflicted torture, but you cannot stop playing. You have to beat your previous score. This has been true of Airport Madness 4 and World Edition.So along comes Time Machine. I found the demo on their website, and got immediately hooked. I'd often play it at work out of boredom, and the hours fly by (pun intended). So when it came to Steam, I was all over it like a rash.Instead of Airport Madness 4 or World Edition's several airport levels where you just attempt to accumilate enough score until you collide 2 jets, and then try to better it because you're stubborn. Time Machine takes you through numerous levels/years of just a single airport. From a basic field in 1925, you go year by year, watching the airport expand and take shape until you get to 1970 where you've got to deal with more aircraft than Heathrow and LAX combined.Each level presents new challenges, from new runways, new facilities, to having to deal with military and civilian aircraft in World War 2 at the same time. Then even more...Once you get to certain stages in the game. You also unlock a Victorian Style steampunk airport and an airport from far in the future. These present further challenges and add a nice change of pace from trying to beat each level in the main part of the game. This means more fun and more addiction!Time Machine stands as my favourite in the series for the different direction it takes. It doesn't matter how many of these games Big Fat Simulations release. I will always buy them on launch, because they are just really, really fun to play. I look forward to the possibility of seeing Airport Madness 3 on Steam and their current development, Airport Madness 3D in the new year. For me these are ""Must Buys""...I suggest you go to their official website and play the demos on their site. Discover the addicition, and buy the series here on Steam. You'll be hooked in no time!"
,Recommended,402210,18205984,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Erbkaiser,"A surpisingly deep strategy game. In Airport Madness: Time Machine you run an airport by deciding when and where planes are allowed to takeoff and land. You have to keep a steady flow going of takeoffs and landings, without causing crashes.The game begins in the early 30s and each level is one year later, each year introducing new features such as additional runways, faster planes, priority transports, etc..What starts out really simple with simple queuing up planes quickly becomes a deep strategy of making sure runways are /just/ cleared when a new plane has to land or take off, dealing with multiple waiting planes and deciding the optimal order for them to launch, etc..Visually the game is really underwhelming but the graphics do their job.On my system the game started fullscreen stretched across three monitors, but fortunately pressing ESC once made it windowed.Sound: music is limited to looping time period [ieces. Soundeffects are basic and limited to plane engine sounds.Control can be done completely via the mouse, or by using keys 1 through 5 on the keyboard once a plane is selected.A fun game that won't bore you too quickly, with decent length levels. Recommended for anyone who likes management strategy games."
76561197968553599,Recommended,402210,18170941,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,InfoSoph,"Great little game. Well worth the couple of bucks it costs. It takes you through the history of an airport from the 1930s up to about 1970. And two bonus fantasy scenarios. Your job is to coordinate arriving and departing planes. Each level offers varying runway, taxiway and aircraft configurations. Even the music changes, depending on the decade. But there may be more to come with future free updates. It would be a blast to get some more decades.So overall, it is one of the best of it's kind. I'd love to see more of that. There are some small issues still to fix and some details to improve. But even at this stage, right after release, it is a very well rounded game.What could be improved?- a few more decades ;-)- there are still some minor bugs. For example, sometimes, not too often, flying planes decrease speed dramatically. That seems to happen occasionally (maybe once per hour at most) when those planes are directed over paved parking areas and remains until the plane has landed. It's not a game breaker, but should be fixed.- I may just not have found it yet, but there seems to be no way of getting to the bonus scenarios, once they are unlocked, other than to finish the last level again.- Some levels are over too soon. For that, there is an endless-play mode. But I'd prefer just to have a harder game mode. So here is how I'd implement that: Once a player gets through the game, a new button gets unlocked in the main menu. With this button, the player can switch between 1x and 2x mode. 1x being the normal  game, 2x being the very same game, but starting at the first level again (meaning that all levels for this mode have to be unlocked again) and with twice as many aircraft to handle per level. Once the player has played through the game that way, a 3x mode becomes available. And so on.- It would be great, if the prices for other Airport Madness games were decreased a bit. Also, it would be great to see Airport Madness 1 and 2 as a bundle on Steam."

76561198037157856,Recommended,402210,28267275,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,trottier.wong,"When I first saw Airport Madness: Time Machine (AM:TM) on steam, I thought this was one of those shovelware titles. Boy, was I wrong.GameplayThis game has a story but it's unimportant. What is important is that you got a job to do. As an air traffic controller, you got to airplanes know when it's okay to come into the airport, and when it's okay to leave.What makes AM:TM unique is that you get to do manage airports throughout history, starting with dirt runways in a farmer's field back in the 20s. Those airports are simple, but things get complicated very quickly.The difficulty comes in that you'll have multiple runways to manage, often crisscrossing each other, and lots and lots of planes that come at you all the time. Oh, and different types of planes behave differently. Mark my words, you do not want to let a biplane take off while a Boeing is coming in.As you can probably imagine, there's a lot of crashes. And you'll begin questioning the intelligence of some of these pilots. But once you get through a year, you'll feel a sense of elated satisfaction.GraphicsThere's a reason I thought AM:TM was shovelware, and that's because there's not a whole lot of eye candy here. At best, they get the job done. To see what I mean, here's a screenshot.There were certain graphical features I wish this game had. I wish there was a zoom feature. I wish there was some sort of off-screen indicator of planes coming in. I wish it has more impressive explosions.But in the end, the graphics are simple and to the point. You're looking top down on an airport with planes coming in and out, and that's it.SoundThis is where I feel AM:TM shines the most. There's music recalls pop tunes of each time period. I quite like the jazz tunes. But just as nice is the ambience of the airport. And by ambience, I mean you'll be hearing lots of jet engines.The sound effects are actually quite practical. In order to manage your airport effectively, you'll need to pay attention to the audio cues that tell you how quickly a plane is embarking and disembarking. Generally, the bigger the plan is, the bigger the noise it makes, and the bigger the concern it will be.ControlsThe entire game can be driven by the mouse and left click, which means AM:TM is generally easy to use -- and most people should be able to pick up and play it. However, you can also use the numeric keypad for shortcuts, and that often comes in quite handy.What you got to do is click on a plane, and command an action. Sometimes, you need to taxi it to the runway, whereupon you have to tell it when to depart. With planes coming in, sometimes you have to tell them to delay their arrival so they don't crash into a departing plane. In other words, there's a lot to do which is why I'm glad the controls are so simple.SynopsisIf an airport simulation appeals to you, you should love AT:TM. But don't let the word ""simulation"" put you off. This game has as many similarities to Diner Dash as it does to SimCity.You won't be asked to build airports or runways. All you have to do is decide which planes are departing, and which planes are arriving. Thus, the most important skill here is time management.Now all of this might sound too easy, but by the time World War II comes around, you'll be failing quite a lot. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I love a good challenge.This is what I call a ""sleeper game"". It doesn't look like much, but it is."
,Recommended,402210,31928684,Posted: 23 May,all,Guru Cube,"It's a very good game and provides a good gameplay equivalent of being an Air Traffic Controller. This game has a nice progression as it moves through history and gives a sense of achievement.Downsides are that sometimes traffic glitches (flies at taxi speed or doesn't follow taxiway routes) and also, it feels like there are mechanics to engineer collisions (for example, two aircraft landing of the same type. You tell number 1 to expedite vacating, yet halfway down the runway it slows down. The second one doesn't slow down and collides (It's stupid, as pilots would never do this in reality).Recommended for a few dollars. It's a good game for occasional play. Just some fristrating mechanics and bugs."

The game is fun but there are some bugs that needs to be fixed before I can recommend this game.  Some of the bugs that needs to be fix includes the aircraft not leaving the runway at the same speed as other aircraft.   I know this developer is working on another game in the series but he does need to address the bugs in this game.This game is pretty fun with some historical informaton related to flight. Once the bugs are fixed this game will  be fun but it does seem like the developer has abandoned it.

There is a lot of functionality missing that actually helps you manage the airport. The buildings are just cosmetic. All you get are more space for the planes and more runways.Worst thing is when planes landed and are told to leave the runway but doing so at different speed. Even the same type of plane are sometimes fast and somestimes slow. This is a joke. I lost so many games because my calculations were wrong. It´s like gambling. Another thing is that you can´t tell planes where to start from. You can only do that when they land. And for now ♥♥♥♥ing reason they want to cross runways to go the other hangar. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does not matter where the terminal is, the planes just go where they want. Totally random. You can plan nothing. Not fun to play."

You can usually redirect airplanes to a different runway when landing only, as well as change the direction/speed  manually. So yeah it is fun, especially seeing your airport grow into this huge airport. You can set the planerate before you start the game as well as the year you want to begin with and which era. Mind that you need to unlock levels by playing one level, that leads to the second level and so on (same for era's). About era's, you have 1925+ (to 1970), fantasy and the future era.. after that the game will just start over to the 1925+ era.Bugs?Yes, there are those. One I've had two times is the planes stand still in the middle of flight, which was really stange. When you are too close to a runway to land the the plane can not make it's turn to land it will just keep circling, this happens when I redirect planes sometimes before they collide. There seems to be a few more out there from what I saw on the forum, but I've only had these two.Do I recommend it?Yes I will, but I am a bit hesitant because I thought it'd go on from 1925 to the future in one go. I missed choppers, fighter jets like the F16, Fokker planes, also newer planes and planechatter.  The era's should've been, in a different order. I played this game out in a few days, took me less time than Airport Madness 4."

Unlike the other games, you have only one airport to play, but it expands over time.  You start in the 1920s and play your airport until 1970, unlocking one year at a time.  After you complete 1970, there are some bonus missions set in a steampunk 1800s and a futuristic 2100s airport.You have less control of the planes on the ground in this one, as you can't direct them to which runway to take off from, but you can still control your planes in the air and have them land on a different runway.Overall, I think I like Airport Madness: World Edition better (but you pay more for that one).  This title offers the opportunity to watch an airport grow over time and play with some more classic airplanes that you don't see outside of museums and airshows today.There were a few bugs (planes crash on the ground inexplicably in the 2100s airport), but nothing really gamebreaking.  Each year you play is maybe 5-10 minutes so I never felt that I lost a lot if I did have a crash.I completed the game in 8.6 hours."
