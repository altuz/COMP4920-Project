,Recommended,402260,32793519,Posted: 25 June,all,Azralynn,"See written review belowor watch it here:https://youtu.be/DoYK46EhxFcTL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Dead Secret is a first person, point and click murder-mystery adventure. The game is available in VR, but I played using my desktop.You play as a gossip columnist hoping to break into the world of journalism, and be taken more seriously. After hearing about the death of Harris Bullard, you suspect there may have been foul play involved, so you venture out into the middle of nowhere in search of evidence at the crime scene.Dead Secret makes you want to explore and learn more about the characters in order to solve the mystery surrounding the murder. Some of the clues may give a little too much information about the characters early on, and I found that I kept having very strong suspicions about the characters long before the game actually confirmed them. I still enjoyed the story though, and how it all played out.There are some jump scares, and times where you need to run from a masked figure. The added tension this creates helps to add some panic and excitement to the game. There aren’t many gameplay mechanics to discuss. You can look around freely, but all of the interaction and movement is done by pointing and clicking. The movement is a bit on the slower side, and there are times where you will need to backtrack through different parts of the house and you look around for clues, and items to solve various puzzles in order to progress.The puzzles aren't much of a challenge, which allows you to focus more on the story, and solving the mystery rather than how to solve any individual puzzle. The relevant clues are often easy to find, and the game often suggests what you should do with newly found items, or what items you still need. If you happen to need further hints, there is also a special mask you can equip that makes points of interest more noticeable.Pros:the story is very interesting and intriguing, and it’s revealed as you explore and read through all the clues and documents found around the housethe game makes you want to explore, and the notes, and information you find are satisfyingthe puzzles are straightforward, and they are implemented nicelythe ambience, music, and sound effects are decent enoughsome nicely placed jump scares, and there are plenty of times where the game does really nice job creating a tense atmosphere that may have you feeling apprehensive about progressing forwardfull controller supportCons:some of the clues give too much information early on, and you may figure things out long before the game confirms it for you(nitpick) dated graphics aren’t very appealing (but they don’t detract too much from the story experience as a whole)(nitpick) the voice acting needs improvement, and it’s completely devoid of emotion to the point where it almost sounds like a text to speech program(nitpick) none of the controls are customizable, but most people will be fine with the defaults (WASD, M1, M2), and there aren't any in-game options aside from invert Y-axis and mouse sensitivityThe game took me just a little over two hours to complete all five of the endings. I explored quite a bit, and there were only a few notes that missed along the way. There isn’t any replay value, but reading all of the clues is a very good idea to get the most out of the game.Conclusion:All in all, Dead Secret offers an interesting and immersive story with a nice touch of jump scares to keep you feeling uneasy. I expect the game would be even more immersive in VR, but since I played on desktop, and since the game is quite short, I’m glad that I waited for sale price.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

If they do and fix the issues I mention I will definitely re-purchase (I have requested a refund). This *could* be an excellent scary game but for a few major issues. First, the game is not room-scale enabled. If I deviate from my original standing position even slightly I can see a headless corpse of my own body just to the side of me. Since jumpscares often work by putting a scary person/monster close to your viewpoint I find myself constantly scared of my own body which just gets irritating after a while. I would rather not see my own body at all. Secondly I can't see my own hands in the game. Thirdly the movement mechanism of sliding my body to the location I've chosen just doesn't feel right. I much prefer to teleport to a location and then wander around a bit.This game has clearly been built for the Oculus Rift first and then ported to the Vive. If anything this game showcases just how much more immersive the Vive is compared to the Rift. To see how to address all the issues I've raised download the horror game A Chair In A Room, which is excellent."

This is a pure point-and-click game where you play as a journalist investigating a potential murder scene and unraveling the mystery behind the death of a professor.There are puzzles to solve, a decent amount of exploring to do, and the storyline is intriguing to the point where I can't stop playing. My only complaint is, while the protagonist is voiced, none of the dozens of letters/documents you find are voiced. But that's just me being nit-picky really, this is a great little adventure game and I can't wait to finish solving this mystery!(I'll update this review once I've finished the game.

Pointing and clicking to use an object is poor by todays standards.I know Dead Secret is a port from the Gear VR but I was expecting an updated version to take advantage of the vitual reality presence of the VIve.I really wanted this one to be great but the lack of full use of the Vive is dissappointing."

Roadhouse,"I clearly didn't read the game description and reviews of this game very thoroughly before I bought it, as I was just expecting it to be a tame little point-and-click murder mystery game. I didn't realize it was actually going to be a horror-mystery that would scare the living bejesus out of me!There are so many things about this game that should have put me off: the clunky mechanics (also didn't initially realize the game was made for VR first, not PC, which is what I played this on), the plot holes and loose ends, the brief playtime (I took it slow and still completed all endings in about 3 hrs), and the truly terrible voice acting, but ultimately the whole thing was so tightly plotted, designed and presented that the final product was compelling enough to totally override all weak points. I also really appreciated the designers' attention to finer details, like the objects in the pantry named after mystery writers and characters, the presence of a set of Lafcadio Hearn translations in Bullard's office, etc. It felt like the developers really wanted this world to feel immersive and fully realized, and even as a PC player, I really appreciated that.HIGHLY recommend...even though I'm going to have nightmares tonight."

It's not very long so I'd recommend getting it on sale, but it's a good little mystery. The draw for me was that it has VR support, but as I understand you can play it just fine with a mouse, though I can't promise that it'll be as interesting on a monitor. That's the only downside I really felt about it, actually; even though the game supports the Vive pretty well, your character has a physical body in the game that only moves when you're moving from waypoint to waypoint, so you aren't really free to move around in the Vive's roomscale unless you want to deal with a hideously contorted headless body standing all over the place. It feels like they didn't do much to the original seated Oculus Rift controls when making the Vive version, and that's fine, but it would've been nice if they had gone the extra mile and added physics and real motion support. But either way, it's still a fun game."

GAME.First up, the interface is so logical and easy to comprehend that even the relative lack of a tutorial shouldn't worry you. It's basically a first person point-and-click adventure, but you can look around 360 degrees as well as up and down, and move to a series of fixed points in a room to get nearer to objects and/or gain different vantage points.However suspect that may sound, it ultimately works every bit as effectively as this game would've in full-blown, free-flowing first person. (And in case you're wondering, yes, there are some real-time moments of tension mixed in there too, which also work every bit as well as they should!)Secondly, the story kept me quite hooked for the duration, with more than enough mystery to keep me immersed. I even played it in a single sitting, which I virtually never do, unless a game's under an hour. This one's closer to three.Overall, this reminded me a fair bit of an old-ish game called Scratches, only done more ""right"" in my opinion. Whereas Scratches was an intriguing failure full of perplexingly obscure puzzles, this game seems to have hit the nail right on the head. Sure, it had me scratching my noggin a few times, but never for so long that my hair began to thin.Highly recommended to horror and mystery-adventure fans alike, and while I can't comment on the VR version (pauper here!), I suspect this is one experience which could only be enhanced by such fancy-arsed technology.Verdict: 9/10."

It's got a unique, complex story line, decent puzzles, multiple endings, dozens of documents to find, and a creepy antagonist that kept me on my toes.  I feel like I took my time, and I finished the game in around 3 hours, but it was definitely time well-spent.  Admittedly, I haven't found all the documents or endings, but I got 95% of them, and that's good enough for me.

If you have an HTC Vive, Rift, or other compatible VR Headset this game is in my opinion definetly worth the price and is a must have. Hands down the scariest game I have ever played, with the fantastic atmosphere created by the combination of story, ambiant sounds and music, and overall graphical design and art style of the setting.Pros:- Great atmosphere- Scaryness of the game dosn't rely on constant jumpscares- Decent length, took me about 2 - 2.5 hrs to complete over two sessions- Didn't experience any motion sickness throughout the entire game despite not using the blink/teleport option because the locomotion is designed to be slow enough as to not cause any nausea.Cons:- Your virtual body won't follow you around as you inspect the environment from different             angles, this resulted in the first 2 frights of the game coming from seeing my headless avatar    leaning towards me as I glanced back.- Textures could be of a slightly higher resolution, but didnt take away from the experience or immersion at all- The puzzles in this game are very easy to complete, and a higher difficulty setting would have been niceAgain I wouldhighlyrecommend this experience to any owners of a Vive ( which I used ) or Rift, i'm not sure what the gameplay is like outside of VR but im sure the lack of a headset wouldnt take away from the game all too muchThanks for reading, and please rate this review if it was helpful :)"

This psychological thiller-horror game has the soul of a murder mystery in the best ways possible. I felt quite immersed in the story, which felt authentic due to its subtly. The game keeps good pacing except for a few sections when you're searching for items and documents in a single room. I think the dream mask mechanic was a bit underused--honestly they could have better incorporated the mask into later parts of the game.A few jumpscares, which to some gamers may seem like cheap attempts to shock the player, but I found them well-placed and useful for driving the game along. The atmosphere was delightfully unerving and creepy. Overall, a well-designed and well-made indie game."

In her investigation, she uncovers a tale of blackmail, murder, and secrets...and may die at the hands of a masked murderer.The game has its ups and downs, and while the ups count for something, the downs weigh quite a bit more.PROS:—Incredibly well-done suspenseful gameplay. Almost right from the start of the game, I kept bracing myself every time I entered a room because I felt that something was going to jump out at me. There are a few jumpscares, but they're not abused like in a lot of indie horror games, so they're rather effective.—Excellently composed music.—Some genuinely good scares.—Despite being designed for VR, you can easily use a mouse and keypad.CONS:—Very short: I finished this and got all the endings in just over two hours gameplay.—Poor game design: you have to go to the painstaking process of collecting all of the documents to understand the plot, otherwise you will be left very confused.—Several parts of the game (including the parts where you have to run/hide from the killer) relies on trial and error rather than reason, which I found frustrating.—Bad voice acting. There's not a lot of it, as the main character only speaks during short cutscenes, but her delivery is almost painfully bad.—Slow movement.—Puzzles are very easy.—Ending is a bit sudden.—Plot has some good twists and details, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.—Little replay value.VERDICT:Dead Secret is a good horror/suspense game, successfully cultivating a creepy atmosphere that leads to some good jumps. However, it is not a good mystery or puzzle game, suffering from bad game design, easy puzzles, lackluster writing and a short plot that leaves too many open questions. It might be fun to play once, but it's not something that's worth playing again."

That was a mistake, I blew it. The game is complete, and the Vive support is just fine. You locomote by going to different points in your surroundings, which is more or less like teleportation, and there are plenty of them that you can get close to everything.Excellent atmosphere, and good story. I loved the lil quizzes at various intervals to refresh your memory. I more of less followed along, but I'm not a strong reader, and read the spoilers afterwards.Turns out the real killer is Gordon Freeman from Half-Life who is the Gman.I beat it in 1-2 settings, maybe during one night, I forget, but it the length was more than sufficient.

First of all the gameplay is horrible, you can only move to pre-determined areas. The level design is linear and the different endings represent just different points in which you die if you fail to run and hide from the killer. The puzzles are a joke, suitable for grade school children and the worst of all, you get instructions on everything you have to do. There is simply no brain work involved... just point, click and read (you could also just skip all reading material and finish the game anyway). It feels more like an object finder than an adventure game. The story is veeeery weak and the voiceover is laughable. The graphics are totally underwhelming. The game is extremely short, can be easily finished in 2h. Definitely not recommended, the first game I regret buying."

The problem is, I enjoy mystery and puzzle games more than survival or action games, so hack-and-slash zombie games and the like are all out. This game was perfect for what I wanted.I can also honestly say that, despite having a series of jumpscares I could easily count on one hand, I had trouble playing this alone. There's just something about this game's atmosphere, lighting, music choices, etc. that I found terrifying. Not in an in-your-face, loud, or flashy sort of way, but in a creeping, get-under-your-skin kind of way.In terms of gameplay, the puzzles vary in difficulty but are sufficiently interesting throughout. I also like that the game requires you to draw your own conclusions about who did the whodunit. A fun, somewhat bizarre, horror-tinged mystery game that you might enjoy playing if you're into puzzle and investigative games. With a friend. And the lights on."
,Recommended,402260,33405892,Posted: 9 July,all,Psyringe,"Decent short first-person murder mystery with horror elements, though nothing specialDead Secret is a first-person adventure game in which you, as a reporter, investigate the murder of an eccentric old scientist in rural Kansas. You have four suspects, and most of the game consists of searching the scientist's house for clues, reading notes and newspaper articles, and piecing the evidence together until you know what happened. There is also a supernatural aspect to the story, which helps creating a creepy atmosphere and maintaining a sense of danger throughout the game.I found the story interesting and quite good - it unfolded naturally, made sense, and the revelation at the end did not feel tacked-on or forced (perhaps a bit foreseeable if you do find and read all the notes). While not the best story ever told, it's definitely solid material for an adventure game, I've seen way worse. Don't expect too much from the ""multiple endings"" though, they are just different ways to fail. The story is pretty linear.The puzzles are fairly easy - solutions are either obvious, or at least have clear cues. Sometimes the game even tells you explicitly that the item you just found can be used to solve a puzzle you encountered a few rooms earlier. All this did not prevent me from wasting 40 minutes with searching a key in the wrong place, but I think that was rather me being stupid and overlooking a cue, the puzzles really aren't difficult by themselves.The game does not provide free movement. It puts you into a fixed position, from where you can look around in a full 360 degree panoramic view. Clicking on hotspots lets you interact with objects or move to a different position. While you move between positions, the game shows a very slow walking sequence in first-person view as if you walked yourself, but you have no control over the movement and cannot interact with anything during these sequences. This restricted type of movement was probably chosen because the game was also released for VR, but unfortunately it creates a less immersive experience for players with ""regular"" monitors.For the same reason, controls are a bit unusual, but I found them easy to use regardless. You have to look straight at the hotspot you want to interact with, and left-click to perform the interaction (open the drawer, move to the next spot, etc.), or right-click to access your inventory and notes. For some reason I couldn't find a good setting for mouse sensitivity and had to move the mouse across large distances just for looking around, which was a bit annoying, but perhaps that was just a problem with my hardware. (I'd suggest to check other reviews for similar issues).Graphics are good but not stellar, voice acting is unfortunately pretty terrible though. A robotic female voice slowly reads lines as if her mind was somewhere else completely. It's not quite bad enough for saying that the game would have been better without it, but it's close, in any case the voice work did not do the game any favors. The overly correct pronunciation gave me the impression that the actress had had basic training of technical aspects, but lacked the ability to actually convey emotions through her voice. Thankfully only a few passages of the game are voice-acted, most of the information is text only.The game includes a few jump scares - nothing extreme, just something unexpected appearing on the screen, accompanied by a loud sound effect. I did not find them particularly shocking, but if you'reverysensitive to jump scares, then you may want to consider that youwillencounter some in this game.Dead Secret is a pretty short game. I think I completed it in 4 hours and I'm usually a slow player. I don't mind a game being short, actually I appreciate a game that tells a complete, engaging story in just a few hours over one that tries to waste my time with repetitive gameplay or grinding - I'm not a kid anymore and rarely have time for the latter nowadays. However, I think Dead Secret's price tag is a bit high for what it provides. You may want to wait for a 75% off sale on this one, but for a price of under 4 bucks I'd definitely recommend it to adventure and mystery fans.Caveat: The purchase also includes the VR version of the game. I don't have VR equipment, therefore I can only review the non-VR version."

You get so much more from games like The Room for one third of the price.- Cheap attempts to scare and in exactly the same way it becomes predictable.- Story is weak in compare to phsychological horror game.- Graphics outdated for a 2016.- At some point I actually dosed off in front of my computer which shows a lot about a horror game.In short - I'm disappointed and you shouldn't support this kind of indie games. Support companies who deserve it.

I am doing a full play through of it and if you'd like to see my initial reactions to the game, I'll leave a link!Dead Secret First ImpressionsSo the game starts off pretty timid, it looks like just an exploration game but quickly starts to become hair raisingly creepy. Like I said, I wish I had a VR headset to really experience this for myself, but it DEFINITELY isn't needed as the gameplay style keeps you feeling helpless while you move around the house. The game is a simple point and click detective/reporter game. You don't have weapons obviously, you can't fight as far as I know, but the story keeps pulling you in with interesting twists and turns. WHO is the murderer you ask? Well you'll have to find out!I personally love puzzle games and room escapes like the game, The Room. And although this game doesn't seem to be as intriquette as The Room, it shares a lot of similarities and has a narrative to go along with that is easily able to be followed. From creepy ""you're being watched"" moments to ""oh crap, what do I do!?"" moments, I've enjoyed almsot every second of this game so far.One thing I'm not 100% sold on yet is after each section (or at least at one point so far) there is a quiz that makes sure you're paying attention to the clues you've found. I don't feel it's needed but maybe it changes the outcome of the game, as there are multiple endings which is always fun.I'd say pick it up if you have a VR headset, and pick it up if you don't and just want a simple game that will make you want to keep playing."

If you're a fan of ""Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder"" or ""The Lost Crown"" then you'll find a lot to like in this game. It is shorter than the latter game and somewhat more a parred-down setting than the former title, but it has a dread atmosphere enough to stoke even the most jaded point n' click gamers. Without giving too much away, if you like spooky Japanese folklore, fringe science gone awry, a nebulously weird narrative or just fancy a good old fashioned muder mystery you will probably find something to appreciate in this game.

It was a little slow to start, but after you start solving some puzzles and moving forward, the story really starts getting interesting.  Although some of the story seems pushed to make you FEEL a certain way about some characters, it's still well told, and it had me engaged.If you love point and click adventures that have a CSI, investigative story to tell, or you like those adventures about serial killers, etc, this is definitelya fun game to play.  There were a few audio bugs in the game, and no option for audio change, which was a drag, because the music was **way** too loud sometimes.Other than that, I was very pleased with this purchase.If you'd like to watch me play it a bit to get an idea of my thoughts, you may watch here.https://www.twitch.tv/videos/125512696I'd give it a 7/10"

I was looking for that when I started playing. But what I found was a delightful accident. The Vive is in a content draught, unfortunately. Will it get more games? Yes. It's relatively new tech and I am willing to put money on it succeeding. But this draught led me to this gem as I desperately searched for a story based game that wasn't Call of The Starseed in its unfinished glory. This game is far from a usual Vive jumpscare bait horror game. It's basically a first person point and click investigative horror experience. It isn't a roomscale masterpiece like A Chair In A Room. It's a standing vive game that employs the (now literal) point and click genre to see how immersive they could get. This game is the first point and clicks I have genuinely been invested in in a long time. That being said, I'm a little over half and hour in. It isn't much but I could tell you characters names and small plot points right now if I so should choose and that doesn't happen for me. The Vive allows this game to be really something special for people who like point and click horror games. It gives me hope that we will see more of this from indie devs with stories in their head to tell.TL;DR Dead Secret, even upon a first glance, is a very immersive point and click that uses the Vive to showcase how this genre could very easily succeed in VR."

Otherwise the limited movement was actually a good thing, because I tend to get confused in games where you can go everywhere, not knowing what to do next. For example, I got stuck in one place where I had just two rooms available, so I knew the answer had to be in those rooms and just kept looking until I found it.There were some creepy moments and a couple of moments of panic. Unfortunately, what happened after the panic moments never got explained in the story, or at least in the parts I found. I did miss a few documents, so I didn't get quite the entire story.

,Recommended,402260,31914439,Posted: 23 May,all,Zombra,"Yes!This is an excellent detective story.  The basic structure is very simple: somebody died, here are your four suspects, now go gather intel and figure out if one of them is a murderer.  The story proceeds with perfect logic even as things get weird and scary.  Assembling the history of the cast and putting two and two together is a pleasure.Gameplay is also very simple and the game can be played entirely with a mouse.  (It was designed for VR but plays beautifully on a standard desktop PC.)  Explore the environment, read clues, use objects, solve easy puzzles.  It plays very much like any traditional ""point and click adventure"", except from a first person perspective that really drew me in.  The game will not stump you or have you tearing your hair ... but it will keep you on edge and force you to pay some attention to the evidence you find to correctly solve the mystery.The main line of the story is straightforward, and most importantly for a mystery, does not ""cheat"".  It has a few solid twists to keep you thinking, but the whole thing doesn't hinge on some ridiculous surprise ending you can't predict.  The mystery is perfectly ""fair""; perhaps even too easy, but I'm OK with that.Above and beyond the minimum amount of info required to give you a decent shot at guessing the mystery's solution, there is a great deal more waiting for you.  If you really dig deep, putting together the more obscure elements reveals a truly fascinating story.  After finishing the game, I watched a friend play, and even though she read the same clues I did, I learned much more seeing it the second time around.  The game may look simple, but the story has a great deal of depth and subtlety.Short game; I finished in under three hours from beginning to end.  Well worth an evening of your time!  $15 might seem like a lot for such a quick piece, but it's solid adventure gameplay, no filler.  I paid full price and I don't feel ripped off.  Also glad to support these devs as the design is impeccable.  Can't wait to see what they do next."

I did a pretty thorough play-through and made it in 2.5 hours -- I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything (though I did not bother to get all the endings -- I got the ""best"" ending on my own, and then watched You Tube to see the rest).That being said, I really enjoyed it.  It delivers what it promises.  It's interesting, there's a lot to explore, but I never got severely frustrated (there was one part where I did have to look up what to do ... but a tiny hint was enough to get me going again.)The mechanics of the game are a little odd; you don't very directly control your character.  Instead, you click to 'hot spots' that she is allowed to walk to.  When you 'mouse look' and look around, you can actually see your own body and you turn in the direction you're looking.  This leads to some funny moments where you can click someplace to walk past a mirror and see yourself moonwalking if you turn around while you're in motion to a 'hot spot'.I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of this mechanic and I would have preferred full freedom of motion.  However, it ultimately didn't subtract from the game.  I do wish my character would move a little more briskly, but it didn't bother me enough to find it frustrating.It is kind of interesting; sometimes the game really leads you by the nose and sometimes it lets you free without hints.  I found it a good balance and overall I found the game to be enjoyable if brief.  Better for a game to be short and leave a good impression than wear out its welcome anyway!I would definitely recommend it to people who like the point 'n' click sort of genre."

Not too long before playing this game, I played Layers of Fear as well. And while I do believe the two games are not super similar, I believe this game did a better job of making me feel tense and threatened at all times. The soundscapes and the subtle music is all masterfully done.I also was impressed by the small amount of voice acting done by the main character.The game itself is essentially a point and click adventure. When I first started playing it, I did not even imagine that I would be spooked by a game where I simply click to move. But on the contrary, I think this actually helped enforce the almost helpless feeling the game gives you at times. Many of the ""scares"" happen during times when the game is auto-moving you between clicks, the times when you are most vulnerable.The mystery itself is interesting.

Why you chose the trackpad as the main selector button is baffling and frustrating.Secondly, I loved the effect of looking at myself in the mirror, but being able to see my headless avatar float beside my body in first person really breaks immersion.Thirdly, the locomotion mechanic, while different i guess, isn't really intuitive and the walking speed is begrudgingly slow.

Without VR, you play the game entirely with your mouse, and having to move (in some cases quickly) by clicking towards the direction in which you want to move is really not fun. Personally, I'd much rather this (and all other games designed primarily for VR) allow me to use my keyboard/mouse for movement/aiming when not in VR, rather than completely ruling out the classic WASD keyboard movement style that has been used for first person games since their inception. This is probably not a con if you're playing the game in VR though, so I won't fault the game for it.-Stop quizzing me before allowing me to leave an area: On a few occasions throughout the game, you'll be asked to confirm (multiple-choice style) major plot points. This shouldn't exist IMO - if I missed a major plot point, it's my fault, I'll live with it. Having to complete a short pop quiz before being allowed to leave an area is just annoying.-Voice acting: The voice acting in this game was just... not good. Every voice line felt very emotionless, I'd almost have rathered just reading subtitles.-Bug with the safe:After getting the combination to the safe in the upstairs room, I went up to open it. I had the combination - I knew what I was supposed to enter, however it still took me over 30 minutes to open the thing. The dial kept bugging out and turning sideways, I had to restart the game and try it again 4 times before I finally got it open.This was very annoying, I probably would have stopped playing at this point if I didn't like the story so much."

For me it had just the right amount of spookyness :) Graphics great, controls intuitive, gameplay fluid, puzzles solvable, also the reading (you will get to do some of it) is enjoyable (no spelling errors etc) Fantastic kind of hint system which absolutely suits and even enhances the spooky atmosphere of the game (it took me some time to realise it's the hints ;))Thanks to the game designers you can continue the game if you chose a wrong action and get to a dead end.You can even experience all 5 endings, if you like.All in all: great entertainment!

This is an actual real adventure game with a decent story.it's all cursor based interaction but it's not bad.  Feels like a point and click adventure game.The locomotion is just weird.  It actually plays better using teleport just so your body doesn't gosliding sideways across the room.I play it standing so the headless thing isn't too much of a problem at least your characters body tries to lean with your head which helps keep the immersion.

,Not Recommended,402260,34401636,Posted: 21 August,all,Criwall,"Dead Secret is a pretty mediocre and very short adventure game (about ""two"" hours, more on the reason for "" "" later), that is further hampered by awful controls and UI, that probably work better with VR. You are a reporter that try to get her big scoop by finding out the truth about the deathof an reaserch professor. The police think it's a natrual death, but you belive there is something more to the story and that it's actually murder. There are some minor horror elements in it, but it's mostly cheep jump scares. The game builds a fairly decent mystery and it does get a little creepy from time to time, and the overall story is good for the most part. But the games problems destroy the experience for me.You walk around to hotspots in each room like in all similar Myst-like games, but instead of instantly moving there like in most similar games, the devs for some reason choose to play the slowest walk animations I think I have ever seen. Seriously, each time you click to move there is an excruciatingly slow animation for no reason at all. I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth of the gameplay was that damn crawl of an animation. The UI is also really poorly implemented, and slow to navigate. The actual puzzles are really easy, but even if you get stuck you can brute force through them. Other than that, it's mechanicly pretty much a ""escape the room"" game, 90% of the puzzles are find a specific object and put it in a slot and you will get another item to use in another slot... It get's really old pretty fast. The good thing is the actual mystery of what happend, but it's entirely told in documents you find around the house, why the police didn't care about the piles of documents that hint that it might not be a a natrual death is anyones guess. It is quite funny that you can ""Nope the f*ck out"" when bad things start to happend, and that is one of the 5 endings.There are also lots of minor technical issues, There are no resolution settings. There are no manual saves and only a single save file. You don't even have sound settings in game. It's not a deal breaker but together with the above mentioned problems, it really comes down to what feels like a pretty good story stuck in an technicly and mechanicly mediocre game.Was quite dissapoited in this game, but It's not worth the asking price of 15€ IMO. If you could pick it up at +50% discount, especially if you have a VR rig, then you might be satisfied. But for anyone else, there are many better adventure games out there."

Almost no Jump-scares, most of the horror comes from confronting the murderer head on, as well as the possibility the murderer could be anywhere nearby. The puzzles are not too taxing, most are realitively easy to solve. The story is interesting and kept me invested in the gameplay.I have a few complaints; firstly the ""body"" you inhabit in-game (the female reporter with the broken arm), is rooted to one spot, so roomscale movement causes her body to contort and stretch. Often it would even seemingly ""rise"" up over the camera, making it difficult to see. Secondly, most of the game is spent reading clues (diary entries, letters, newspapers, story chapters), and the notebook you read from is always aimed downwards. Vives are more heavy than most VR headsets and at times I found myself getting a neck ache from looking down at an angle so much. This won't affect everybody but it will affect some, so it'd be nicer if the text was at eye level during reading.Those complaints are rather minor, though, and I extremely enjoyed this little experience.

The scares were also very easy to predict. Not willing to spoil this for anyone who might be interested, so I'll just explain the one that happens first since it's so early in: When you see a mirror in a horror game, what the heck do you think is going to happen in the mirror? But since I knew that, after seeing the thing in it, turning to look behind me would show it wasn't there, I will say I appreciate giving me a really good, long look at your spooky killer right at the beginning. Really heightens the tension.The modelling and texture work are entry-level, but at least they are consistent to the... theme? I guess? The hands are where the problems are most perfectly exemplified. They're vaguely competent, at least.The puzzels are where I was most upset by all of this. Way too simple, and, given the pretext for the puzzels, I'm not sure what the in-universe justification for some of them is.The best I can say about this game is that it's apparent that a genuine effort into making a good horror game telling a good horror mystery story was made, and that's something you don't see too much nowadays. I think the developers have good reason to be proud of what they've accomplished here, but I can't help but think that more work should have been put in to elevate this from a simply mediocre game to something really special.5/10"
,Not Recommended,402260,28576401,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Comrade Beaglsky,"Let's begin the review with a note that I bought Dead Secret expecting the game to be a first-person horror experience akin to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It's not. Dead Secret is a first-person point-and-click puzzler. I don't have a lot of experience with the genre, but I decided I'd give it a shot anyway - so take this with a grain of salt if you're a big point-n-click fan.Now, I found the interface incredibly cumbersome. I tried to give the game a pass as it was clearly intended for use in VR, but it was frustrating and cumbersome to use with my mouse and keyboard.The puzzles were generally well sign-posted, but the amount of backtracking combined with the characters incredibly slow movement speed meant that it just felt like padding when I just wanted to continue learning about the storyline.The ""horror"" aspects of this game are not particularly good, unfortunately. It pulls the odd horror trope, but none of them were executed in a well enough manner to actually elicit more than an eye-roll response. It can be given a pass on account that the game isn't really a ""horror"" game, though.The voice acting is limited exclusively to the protagonist, a reporter attempting to dig out more clues with regards to a murder victim. It's not awful, just mediocre. I took particular note of the constant monotone - even when talking about subjects that should inspire or excite the protagonist such as finding new clues or talking about their idols.The game seems to launch at the Unity ""Fastest"" preset. I've read that this occurs on a range of hardware. To sort this out, hold ""shift"" when you open the game and you can change the graphics settings. This will sort out the flat lighting and distracting aliasing - but the game is no visual spectacle (probably on account of it being available on mobile platforms). The art style is nice though, and largely makes up for it.It's a shame, because these gripes aside the storyline is relatively engaging - and the various scattered notes are well written and provide a real sense of world building. The plot contains various supernatural elements, and while the scares are consistently not up to par, they do make for an interesting additions to the plot. Also, I'd really like to read the full text of the books interspaced in-game - whoever wrote those in the development team should consider writing a book.All in all, I really wanted to like this game - it's obviously a labour of love from its developers, but I generally found the experience was a few solid pros outweighed by a ton of niggling cons. Those that revel in point-and-click games and harbour any interest in the supernatural / murder-mystery will likely extract some enjoyment from this game."

Solid sound design and an engaging story make this game worth your while, though it could have been just a little bit longer.GAMEPLAY: It's very straightforward - point the cursor to where you want to go, and the protagonist will move to that location. You will need to explore a mid-sized house and the surrounding area, collecting files (for narrative exposition and puzzle hints) and items (various forms of keys). The puzzles aren't mind-bending, being just enough to keep the player on their toes - a little added difficulty would have been welcomed, but they don't insult the players' intelligence by any means. The game also includes short quizzes throughout, to remind you of the large amount of data you've collected on the course of your investigation. It works quite well, being implemented in-game (the protagonist speaks to herself and writes the answers in her notebook) so they don't take the player out of the game world in the process.AUDIO: The game makes great use of audio, with the exception of some lacklustre line delivery from the protagonist - some lines are delivered believably, while others are very flat. Fortunately, the sound effects and music more than make up for it. The game utilzes some jarring sound effects to unease the player, and uses silence to great effect - while also not being afraid to play dreamy rock songs in the vein of Silent Hill 1, Twin Peaks, or Portishead.VISUALS: The environment is nicely rendered, going for a realistic cell-shaded look, if a little sparesely decorated at times. However, all of the different areas are uniquely modeled, which allows for ease of navigation and immersion into the environment.STORY: You play as a reporter investigation the death of a scientist in his countryside home. You will gather a list of suspects in regards to his possible murder, and collect clues to determine who - and why they did it. It's a pretty basic premise, but all of the characters are uniquely defined, making it easy to understand and engaging to participate in. Though one problem is its length. I usually don't complain about a short experience - I tend to appreciate more concise narratives - but this game fits a bit too much exposition into its brief runtime. A few extra puzzles to put some breathing space between the many files to read would have helped pace it a bit better.I'd recommend this game to fans of classic survival horror, especially those looking for a more relaxed experience, or those looking for a good, short narrative."

For three mountain size reasons.1) the body your stuck in without room scale2) the 'on rails' camera3) no controller support..just nod n move your headIts obviously set up for ppl who sit down and play ...like psvr and rift because there is little to no attention to roomscale. Now you might be thinking why so harsh, just stand or sit and play. Well you have a body in vr in this game ..not just a camera as a head and hands like most othervr games. This is commendable.. but also the total vive downfall. the body is not free to walk around and even though this is a room by room mystery game...you dont even use hands to open things in the room..you just turn your head and click the controller button. there is NO interation with anything. This is literally a point n click mouse game thrown onto VR.A note on the body..on HTC your head (the camera) detaches from your body..you can walk around your headless body...its surreal..because the game is set to standing and not moving. The main characters hand is in a sling for gods sake.. so even if HTC VIVE was to be supported in the future with the VR controllers...Your character cannot use one , because her hand in the game is not usable.... a little bit of an oversight. BUt the whole move away from your body ion game is so surreal...forget whos been murdered..you got bigger problems, as your own head is detachableThe camera..oh the camera..woeful. You dont choose where to walk in the game ..you turn your head to where you want the mouse pointer to go, it turns into the standard adventure game magnifying glass on any object rtelevant to the game...when you click on 'walk to object' the camera just walks you there...if you looking around the room whilst walking it still just carries on walking to its destination...its so disorientating.So far i have over 50 games for VR and this by far is the most unrealised of them all. murder mystery has HUGE potential ...especially room by room murder mystery. Can you imagine room scale version of this ? wow..total freedom of movement in rooms  4m x 4m , using controllers as hands to go through every drawer , sofa, fridge for clues ?well this isnt it ....in all honesty , this is not even a game where programming can save it for VIVE as its broken as part of the actual mechanics. i think the dev should remove the VIVE logo as its misleading. its only going to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off anyway.

I played it with a Vive, and there are a number of annoying things about the experience:* Locomotion is really awkard, you point at the ground and click to move, but it seems you have to point a certain distance away or it won't allow you to move.  Simple trackpad locomotion or the usual teleport mechanic would be far superior.* The button assignments are awkward and non-intuitive; you have to click on the trackpad instead of the trigger to interact with things.* Interacting with objects sucks, you just point at them with a tiny little laser-pointer dot and click the interaction button.  Not very immersive, and actually very difficult to interact with small objects.  It would be much better if I had hands in the game, which I could move close to an object and then use the trigger to interact.* The game relies heavily on reading to deliver the story (at least from what I played).  Reading in VR is terrible due to the low resolution (you have to hold things right up to your face, which is again awkward).* You have a body, but if you move around at all the body stays in place and bends towards your headset (since your head is attached to the body).  While hilarious, it is completely immersion-breaking and it would be much better if the body weren't rendered.  Also, why is my head attached but not my hands?I really wanted to like this game, but it's not suited for VR at all in its current state."

Other than that, I totally recommend this game."

It is not one of the most amazing games in this categorybut it's worth a shot."

Point and click for horror is usually a mistake. This is like a knock-off Gone Home with an occasional reminder that there is spooky stuff"

,Recommended,402260,31956486,Posted: 25 May,all,bullpup ツ,"Cool adventure game, not too long and not too difficult. VR implementation is quite done. Some minor quirks like the fact that you can only stand on not walk around without distorting your virtual body, and keys are not really intuitive at first. Also, you cannot use your hands to grab things, it's basically point&click.7/10 from me."

It has great visuals, the puzzled are a bit more chalanging than normal, and there are jump scares galore.  I am a horror geek and even I jumped a few times.  My heart was racing practically the entire time I was playing.  If you have patience, try for all six endings, it's worth it."
