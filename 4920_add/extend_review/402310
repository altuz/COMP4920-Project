,Recommended,402310,23053794,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,Rueya,"Overfall is a fantasy turn-based rpg filled with tons of lite questing as you forge your own destiny by leading two heroes on a path to unite a single race of your choice torn by faction and conflict. Here are some of its most prominent features to give you the gist of it:PROS:*High replay value due to ton of unlockables from Classes, to Companions, to Trinkets, to Weapons, to new Skills/Spells.*Neat turn-based battle featuring the usage of a 3 step action-point system consisting of Movement (Step 1), Utility (Step 2), and Attack (Step 3). This allows tons of combo and synergy between classes and companions!*A dynamic world where each race is in constant conflict with their arch rivals. Picking sides will further improve relations with one but at the expense of a deteriorating relationship with the other. This will reflect in the World Map (Seafaring) where they will chase each other with their ships, and you for helping their enemies.*Tons of questing variety based on the different factions you can interact with for further replay value. Numerous dialogue bubbles will emerge during your quest for you to select with differing results based on your hero class composition.*Tons of variety from how a character looks, with a character aesthetic that grows on you, from the heroes, to companions, to npcs, to enemies.*Despite the familiarity of the races, many of these have their own backstory and lore, unique to Overfall. These races consist of a nemesis system involving Orcs vs Forsaken, Elves vs Hollows, and Dwarves vs Goblins, with a wild card consisting of the Vorn who is the aggressor, the Undead who populate razed territories, the Everguard who are somewhat neutral, and minor factions like Pirate Ships, Merchant Ships, and Guild Ships.NEUTRAL:*A single play-through can be done in a relatively short time (1-3 hours). Quest are lite at best and does not have a strong narrative. This suits multiple playthroughs but does not reward players looking for a long and deep narrative.*Buffs and Debuffs in turn-based battles are a huge part of Overfall with icons to symbolize them. Tons of strategy can be garnered from it, including combos from the stacking of buffs and debuff effects, offering greater depth. This might or might not be your cup of tea as you will need to diagnose its various status effects very often.*Enemy AI during turn-based battles are punishing and does not hold back to ensure that the weakest link, health and defense wise comprising of your support heroes or companions are targeted with every opportunity the AI can get. Due to the rather medium to small battle layout combined with relatively high enemy movement, strategies to protect your supporters will be a challenge.*Healing can be done at the world map by food consumption, at Inns where you can sleep and heal, and during turn-based battles in small portions via timed spells (for the most part) where healing will only commence on the next turn. You will need to plan ahead to ensure your party maintains a feasible health count before and during a battle.*Personas which have positive or negative traits are a huge part of Overfall. Your heroes will aquire traits when you fulfil a certain requirement in-game which may completely affect your party stats either via benefiting or downright screwing your play-through to a certain degree. There is an option to remove all Personas at the Inn.*Only two heroes can be selected at the start with extra slots for an additional two companions that will gradually join later on in the game. If both of your heroes die (permadeath) despite your companions being kept alive, the game will be instantly over. There is an option to resurrect a fallen hero, but at a cost.*Unlockables are done from fulfilling various requirements from a mixture of hero composition, hero traits, and island types which will then trigger a questline where rewards can be unlocked once the game is over.*The only manual control you will get (apart from combat) is via the world map where you control your very own ship. Upon landing on one of the many islands, a quest will ensue which happens via fade-in and fade-out sequences as it changes scenery from one location to the next. While this is somewhat linear, it will fare well for creators to contribute their questlines to the Steam Workshop.CONS:*The map layout consist of randomly generated islands within a simple sea setting. Despite the heavy reliance of seafaring, the boat you are in is non upgradable and is merely used as a vessel for transportation between islands. While this is not its strong suit, it can be understood due to practicality purposes.*You will constantly be in a race against time as the Vorn (Antagonist) increase in forces while you rally a racial faction under your banner via doing quest. Things will get a little hectic and the world dynamism will be heavily skewed in the Vorns favor if you let the timer run its course.*Shop offers only basic upgrades in the form of upgradable skills and buffs. There are no buying of equipment. (The only way you will be able to change weapons, trinkets, and skillsets is by unlocking it in your play-through and selecting it from the character creation menu when you begin anew).*You are unable to customize the way your hero looks. You can however rename them.It is pivotal to take note that I heartily enjoyed Overfall, including those under ""Neutral"" and would definitely recommend it. However, I do feel it is important to list these prominent features down so one could make an informed purchasing decision based on their sole preferences."

I think the art style doesn't present well in static screenshots, the style used for the characters in particular looked amateurish and I was worried that Overfall was another cash grab indie title. However, in-game they came to life with nicely drawn animations for all actions, in fact, the deeper into a playthrough I travelled the more diverse the characters became and the better the art style seemed to fit.Overfall's true strengths are a trifactor of: Gameplay, Replayability & Storytelling and let me say, it has them in spades.Accolades Overfall can boast are:Some of the best creative writing I have experienced, awash with many movie/game/media references.Challenging & strategic hex/turn based combat with emphasis on buffs/debuffs and skill synergies.A fair risk verus reward rogue-lite with hundreds of random scenarios, encounters and quests.Many of the scenarios have multiple branches, endings & rewards for maximum replayabilityEasy to use yet powerful scenario editor, in which you can make anything from a tiny encounter to a multiple island hopping questline in which the only limitation is your imagination.Steam Workshop support with loads of player made encounters you can easily add to your game.In summary, Overfall is a hidden gem of a game which is somewhat let down by its ambiguous name and ""amateurish at a glance"" art design. It worries me that a significant percentage of gamers may give this game a miss based on these factors, which would be a real shame as Overfall is definately a book you should not judge by its cover.Score: 9/10 - Highly reccomended."

The dialogue is often quite hilarious and witty. Exploring islands is a lot of fun, and when you have died and started again.. and you run into an identical situation... it does not go as planned. Love that. Pretty refreshing.The learning curve and advancement is also a lot of fun, some battles in the early game you must simply avoid (I got pwned so hard by running into a ship, on purpose, after only visiting two islands; 4 pirates vs a Cleric and a Fighter = doomed). The combat is so much fun with the bad-azz music that seems to crescendo at the right times. Awesome spell animations/fight animations. Great art-style.It's a great game with an active dev and consistent updates. ♥"
,Recommended,402310,23075826,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,Reedo,"A game more than worth it's moneyI've owned overfall since it has released in early access and it hooked me straight away, Be under no illusions, the game is tough, You will die and you will have to start over, this is a rogue-like after all, but a very rewarding one at that.With little introdution you are thrown into a world full of fantasy and myth, rich in different stories. On every island you go to you will encounter a little bit of a story, sometimes just a few lines of dialogue, sometimes a whole murder mystery. Most of these encounters are little self-contained stories, sometimes funny, sometimes serious. And often ending in a fight. What's even better, many of them will only unfold the second, third or even fifth time you encounter them, as with playing other characters, your choices and options change.For those of you, who are looking for cohesive story lines and lore, don't wory. There is a main plot and each of the different races has a major questline, each of which portrayes the races in a different light, depending of who you decide to side with.Of course, you can only side with one faction in each play-through, but that gives extra reason to play the game over and over again. As you can see, I have nearly a hundred hours in the game and I'm looking to crack them soon.The reason being the amazing re-playability. A full play-through might only last two or three hours (if you manage to win at all), but there is something that makes you come back: The unlocks. This game has a lot of unlocks (don't ask how many, way over a hundred), ranging from weapons, trinkets to playable starting characters and companions to join you on your journey. And these weapons aren't (only) cosmetic, they can change the whole role of a hero on the battlefield, making a normally melee focussed monk suddenly a ranged critter or giving a healer suddenly surprising offensive capabilities.Due to the amount of choice you will have as you progress in the game, you will be able to change party and weapon compositions to use a sheer endless amount of combos.Speaking of combos: The games buff and de-buff system offers increadibly good ways to combine heroes' powers to dish out lots of damage, as well as avoiding a lot of it. Juggling with these buffs can be crucial and enable weird attacks like the druid's, which deals 6 damage, but also heals 6, to do massive amounts of damage or healing your guys by considerable amounts, if used correctly. I dare say the combat system as a whole offers a lot more than your initial impression might show and contributes to the game's great replayability.EDIT: Forgot to mention the story editor! This is a very cool tool, which allows players to create their own adventures, may they be complex or short, dark or light-hearted. I have already posted two items to the workshop (easily done with one click) and it is even easier to download them and have them use them in game. Did I mention the re-playability? The workshop makes this even more important of an aspect.I know this is getty quite lengthy by now, so I will end here.Bottom line: I would not hesitate to buy this again."

However the nice things is that if you take a different classes from the beginning it may yield different speech scenarios.I'm not extremely sold on sailing from one identical looking island to the next being chased by enemy ships that are very difficult to get away from.The most important aspect of the game however is that despite some of its flaws; you can't help but give it a go once again to try out your shiny new class or companion or skill you've just unlocked for yourself.https://youtu.be/k_fGIX-EC7MPlay this game but beware of the difficulty spikes that can happen during the course of the game."

76561198056954616,Not Recommended,402310,21608355,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,Donovan,"Gameplay is based around a repetitive and linear combat system. It lacks the basic dynamic feeling that gameplay of this sort requires to stay enjoyable.  Unlockables (alt classes/trinkets/weapons) that might add some variation to gameplay are difficult and extremley time consuming to acquire. Character progression is non-existant in any traditional sense. Upgrades are instead purchased or aquired through traits (as often bad as good). Consequently, the steadily increasing difficulty curve gives no heightened sense of achievement, just consternation on the players part. Some classes/races are clearly superior to others, only, you don't have acces to those.As the end game approaches, players are faced with a need to constantly feed (heal) thier troops, to a point of tedousness and extreme in-game poverty. This is just as well as there arn't many other things to buy. Units do not heal outside of battle, meaning the 'strongest' builds are ones focused around low damage high healing parties, which extends the length of any given combat inordinatly. It seems as though the player is on the wrong end of the developers practical joke--when you manage to recruit a 3rd unit, the enemy has 4. When you manage a 4th they field between 5 or just add additional rounds, between which you are unable to heal.Eventually you are forced to conclude that combat is a dimintioning return reward system. Random quests which feature no combat often provide greater rewards. Faced with a quest I chose to face down two elit units (trolls), which was likely suicide, but I did it for the apparent oppurtunity to aquire two full trasure chests (pictured in the backround and commented on in the dialogue section). Having won, against high odds, I was promptly cutscene defeated/cheated (described as 'suddenly blacking out') and was then forced to leave the island with nothing, except my wounds (which cost money to heal). Why bother with such loose story telling/gameplay?Bottom line: Gameplay is in linear in the extreme, reminicent of some oldschool flash games you used to played, and not much more. Balance is needed, but likely won't enrich the fundementally flawed core of gameplay."
76561197976257424,Recommended,402310,23129415,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,Aramazon,"TL:DR - This game is fantasy FTL with turn-based battles.At first I was dubious about the tactical combat, but I soon realized that it gets quite in-depth. There are a huge number of unlockables and many different party set-ups. You start with 2 characters, but during the game you eventually get two additional companions from a very large selection.The combat is based largely on conditions and I quickly learned that various combos are incredibly powerful. Vulnerability increases damage taken from each attack by 1, meaning that damage over time effects (bleed, poison, agony, etc.) do 2 instead of 1. Vulnerability + DOT = Awesome!Tormented is a condition that damages enemies for each tile they move...fear is a condition that forces opponents to move 5 squares at the start of their turn. Add vulnerability to the mix and you have 10 damage before they even start their turn...then if it's a melee unit, it probably won't be able to get back in the fray without dying.These are just some examples. I'm still learning the intricacies of gameplay. It's very fun, and I highly recommend it!The only downside I can think of is that most things need to be unlocked before you can use them and that might not be everyone's cup of tea."

,Recommended,402310,23151234,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,DrMcGibblets,"Wow. This game really caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard anything about this game before seeing it featured in the store shortly after it's release. I spent the better part of the next two days debating if I should buy it....and man I am glad I went for it!First off, the art style is incredibly unique and charming. I love interacting with whomever my adventurers would cross paths with, and it was neat to discover that the same encounters would play out differently depending on who/what you chose for your adventurers, followers, or conversation arcs.The writing is also top notch, not every line of dialogue lands, but when they do....it's comedy gold. I don't want to spoil any of it but there is some expertly crafted references to mashup the game universe with our own (if that makes any sense).Now, don't get the wrong idea about this game. It is most certainly a rogue like game, and a difficult one at that. It took me several playthroughs before I REALLY understood what I needed to do, and if you want to complete the Story successfully, you have to go into this with a plan of what races you're going to befriend, etc. Time is the true enemy in this game, because as time passes more and more of the enemy hordes will begin to populate the game world, causing untold amounts of havoc, and making your task that much harder.Also, you'll find after several attempts that whether or not you succeed has a whole lot to do with simple dumb luck. For you to gain reputation with any of the 6 different races in the game, you'll have to do things that will earn points with whichever race you are attempting to befriend and eventually ally yourself with to combat the hordes of evil. Well, the way you go about earning said points is by visiting islands that correspond with whichever race you're trying to become BFFs with. Easy right? No. Not when you can visit island after island without getting lucky and getting the random acts that will allow you to gain/lose reputation. I don't really mind it too much myself, but I know that this may be something that could possibly agitate some people.The trading/upgrade system is fairly simple, almost too simple...but yet I think it fits perfectly here. Each of your two adventurers is allowed 3 Class upgrades that you can purchase from any of the corresponding Class ships (Fighter, Cleric, etc). Class upgrades cost you 5 ""Dust"" per upgrade, adding up to a grand total of 30 Dust for you to fully upgrade your Class skills. Then you are allowed to visit a Bazaar where you can further upgrade your chosen adventurers with Weapon upgrades. Now this also follows the same rule of 3. Each adventurer can upgrade their Weapon Head, their Weapon Hilt, and then you can roll for a random enchantment to complete the upgrade boogaloo. Now these Weapon upgrades cost ""Frags"" with each of the Weapon upgrades costing 12 Frags each, and the random enchantment costing 5 Frags per roll. Now BE CAREFUL...Don't be a dummy like I was and roll an awesome enchanment and then forget to apply that awesome enchantment. BE SURE TO CLICK APPLY ENCHANTMENT AS SOON AS YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU WANT. Also, when you're in the screen upgrading Weapons at the Bazaar, you'll have to select which hero you are upgrading by pressing the corresponding button underneath their character portrait. Otherwise you might pimp out one adventurer, while leaving the other one left hanging.Well...what more can I say...If you like Rogue like games, or games with great art and tremendous dialogue that will at times cause you to roar with laughter then this game is for you...buy it...like now. It's awesome and you'll get an excessive amount of replay value from this game.If you enjoy games that hold your hand, and wipe your bum, as it compliments you and hands you a ""Good Try"" Participation Trophy...well this game isn't for you Sparky. Move along.If you fancy yourself as one of those creative types and would like to make your own story with this games art style...well then you're in luck. I haven't used the Story Builder myself, but I know its an option and I know I'll eventually get around to seeing what I can put together with it...after I play...just one more tryFinal Verdict: 5 out of 5 Gibblets"
,Recommended,402310,23045697,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Jonas,"SummaryOverfall is a turn-based rogue-like exploration game with a vast selection of discoverable classes, skills and upgradeables - Darkest Dungeon meets Renowned Explorers.The gameplay is similarly addictive as the traditional ""just-one-more-turn""-feeling, hours feel like minutes. A price under 15€ for an expected 40-50 hours to master the game and unlock most content sounds fair.GameplayDuring the story mode, the player switches between a real-time ocean map and quest encounters. Most quests are solved through grid-based combat although some also offer diplomatic approaches. The writing gets repetitive rather fast although user-generated content could fill this gap soon (a quest generator is included and first results are already in the workshop).Macromanagement in the form of four different exchangable resources (food, money, trophies and runes) is required to survive and further develop the party. Furthermore, a reputation system for the ""neutral"" factions allows to choose between different main quest lines.The harsh story doom timer (viking invasion) can quickly turn first approaches into frustration and leaves no room for extensive exploration. Expect a steep learning curve. A full story run takes about 2-3 hours depending on party composition.CombatDifferent party combos keep the combat refreshing and diverse. The combat system itself will feel familiar to anyone used to turn-based games. Each unit turn is split sequentially into movement, utility and lastly attack. The developers refrained from strong healing abilities and set the focus on avoiding damage by utilizing buff/debuff and cleanse abilities.There is no prepositioning of units and initiative is predefined for all units (no turn saving). This sometimes results in deaths before being able to move, e.g. double trolls charging... :-(. The AI prioritizes buffing/healing over attacking and often behaves suicidal/stupid when accompanying your group - just using them as decoys works fine.ProgressionThe group size starts with 2 of the 9 customizable main classes. While progressing through the story, the party can be extended and refilled with 2 from 36 unlockable companions (encounters seem to adjust to either group size or doom timer stage by adding more enemies to quests).Randomly generated positive/negative ""personas"" similar to DD's quirks and a small selection of upgrades for the core heroes replace traditional level-ups.

At this point however, Overfall is looking very promising. For early access, this game has a healthy amount of content, with very few bugs.Overfall incentivizes you to keep starting up a new game since you're always unlocking new classes, skills, weapons, trinkets, etc which carry over from your previous playthrough, allowing you to try out new builds and party member compositions. The combat seems simple at first, but once you become more familiar with the combat mechanics and unlock new things, you are rewarded with some deep and satisfying gameplay.If you enjoy turn-based RPGs, definitely give Overfall a try. For 10 bucks, you can't go wrong here."

If you die ... well you're dead and have to start over again!You choose two heroes in the beginning and start your adventure on the seas. Over 190 randomly generated islands of different flora types are waiting to be visited and every island triggers quests, offers events and opportunities to gain reputation with one of the 6 races. The dialogues are scripted entertaining and funny. There actually is also a story builder where you can script your very own story and events - awesome! The mission is to fight the Vorn ... or the Everking ... or both? You will have to find out on your own! Once you have enough reputation you can hire companions that help you fighting your enemies in increasingly more difficult battles.I love the battle system! Every turn has three phases (movement, special action, attack) and there are lots of weapons and abilities to choose from. There are several different tactics you can use for fighting and you can combine skills to increase your damage output. With every run you can unlock one or more of the hundreds of items, skills, weapons, companions and heroes this game has to offer."

You play games sailing around islands and doing mini quests, and they give you the chance to unlock new characters, new weapons for the character, new skills for the character and new advantages for the character.  Additionally the skills themselves can also get upgraded.It's a low-stress game where you don't care too much about dying - a lot of different quests to do.  Since there is a quest creator in the steam workshop I'm hoping that the developer will make a free DLC with all the high quality ones in there.A lot of games, you take a break for a week and you can't really bring yourself to carry on playing.  This one feels like a game that will be easy to dip in and out in the future.The only extra I would have liked would have been a bit more joined up effects from each quest.  There is an effect of increasing your reputation with a race to get special big quests with that race - but I was hoping to unlock special achievements through being totally good or totally evil in a game (which currently doesn't seem to happen)."

The description isn't necessarily wrong it just isn't as enjoyable. Combat plays a giant role in this game which isn't inherently good or bad. What makes it not good is the fact that combat is almost always a tedious chore, you don't particularly get more powerful as you play through the game which makes sense in regards to this game. The issue with that is generally fights continue to always take the same amount of time to finish throughout the course of the game. I dread combat, there isn't much to it, it's a very one dimensional strategy-esque style of combat. For the most part any time you can have an encounter and avoid combat you receive just as good of a reward without the game taking your personal time and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it with the drawn out encounters your playthroughs with be filled to the brim with.Random story bits/events that you discover going from island to island are pretty fun, except it doesn't take very long at all to see the repetition in these events. It makes continuous playthroughs feel predictable and scripted which ruins the random nature of the game.Abilities gained from different weapons and actual new ability unlocks don't differ much from eachother which makes progression and unlocks in the game seem unrewarding. That may be strictly due to the combat being such a drag.I can't recommend this game, despite its glowing reviews it doesn't really respect your time or intend to entertain you, and if its doing neither then what is the point?"

I'll try to describe it since it's hard to get a complete picture from the outside:You have 2 primary party members, gaining up to 2 more, and sail around a series of islands that offer random short choose your own adventure story bits mixed with tactical RPG combat. And it has a larger progression that takes you to a natural endgame. While each of these components isn't super deep they each have enough facets and content to stay fresh replaying it when you fail (it's got a rogue-lite structure).For example you can unlock new primary classes (available selecting your starting people) new ability sets for them, new secondary classes, and there are multiple variations to the main story of each play through. Different characters give you access to unique choices in the story vignettes too, so while you will start to see repeats it's not unbearable. And there's a good amount of synergies to using classes together that make trying new combinations interesting."

While it has refrences to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls and a few other things, they are actually funny, and much more importantly subtle. I like the way each time you start, things are just slightly different, character abilities balance impressiveness with practicality, and the battle music is the most epic thing I've ever heard.That said, there is one major flaw in the game tough, the bigheaded art style really clashes with a its general tone.

Combat is tough even on normal difficulty. The game rewards you when you lose by letting you unlock new classes and abilities for your next runthrough. The presentation layer is nice, with some decent soundtracks, art, and little stories.Where the game suffers a little is in the story department - but it's a roguelike, so you should be expecting there to be a thin story I should think. The item management is also pretty barebones, with Dust, Food and Runes being the only resources you need to acquire, money itself being pretty worthless (only a few upgrades outside of those consumeables).Worth $10 bux or so, I think I'll get 30 or 40 hours out of this.

Might return one day when I'm bored even! - Because it has impressive depth for a game which at first could give a bland impression.The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master, at first sight one might think it's simplistic. But that is far from the truth, its like saying a shooter game is very simple, and ignoring all the tactical depths those usually have - movement, sound etc. - Here it is personas, debuffs and buffs which will save or kill your party. You can have 4 at most, 2 characters which you start out with and 2 companions you will find on your adventures. The amount of optional characters and companions is impressive.. very much so even.The most positive thing about it is the amount of optional companions, items and characters you can unlock, hunting them throughout the islands might be a chore for some, but for me it felt satisfying to gain new optional playstyles. No companion is bad, none op either. But if you read their skills and abilities carefully, there are very powerful combinations in battles you can unlock if you pick the right party.The adventures on the islands are short, but entertaining, sometimes downright hilarious, it all depends on your sense of humor. Sometimes even when you try to be the absolute saviour of the world.. your good actions might actually turn really foul, so much that it's funny.The choices you can make in them is limited to -two ways- usually, which is a bit limited in my opinion.Pros:Deep tactics are possible with huge amounts of options for your party, more options than you can possible explore before you've finished the game.Many different adventures on the islandsArt, if you like it - I do!Music, if you like it - I do!Lastly, the story is quite interesting if you care about those things.Cons:A bit too few adventures, not enough endgame for a player to have time to try out all kinds of characters and/or companions before the endgame feels repetitive. Yes I've said there are many of them, this is true. But it is barely enough to contain a guy who wants to experiment before it is finished. Hunting enemies only for the battles isn't enough for me.I don't understand why it isn't possible to upgrade the companions as you can do the Characters you start with - even if they are Perma-dead when they die in this game, it would have been a fun thing to do.Summary: In the end, I warmly recommend this jewel. Would've loved to be part of a team making a game like this."

A lot of love has been put into this game and the devs are keen to hear what the community have to say.  The game has a finished feel so for me the whole ""early access"" thing is just the devs wanting to make the game even better with your feedback.

Any game of this type needs to have an enjoyable pull to replayability since it is built around redoing the same level over and over. I spent too many hourse replaying after I had stopped enjoying the game.Positives are it is colorful and even cute if that is what you like. Dialogue is short and to the point yet interesting. Easy to jump in and learn. Lots of things to unlock including main character classes/items/skills and companions etc.Negatives:You have to rush each game as the longer it goes the more enemy ships swarm the map so those of you who like to take your time and accomplish a lot, sorry you can't here.Each run through visually is the same and you will do most of the same quests over and over.While there are lots of things to unlock, the ingame hints to how to unlock them are horribly vague and the requirements so varied and contrived it makes it hard to know and accomplish a lot of them which reduces the drive to replay. I spent more time on wikis looking up and trying to figure out how to just accomplish a couple unlocks a run through that it was ridiculous."

76561198133124049,Not Recommended,402310,23435625,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,jephrey64,"Overfall is played as a series of short hops between islands in a fantasy setting.  At each island, dialog choices and often combat occur, allowing the player to progress toward the overall goal of winning.  It features interesting turn-based combat on a small hex map and a wide variety of artful npc's to deal with.  Aside from combat, the game focuses on making choices that may impact race relations or in acquiring some basic resources.  And therein lies the strange problem with Overfall.It would appear the writers do not understand basic principles of right and wrong.  It isn't that the game teaches rebellion or 'evil' or anything like that, because that requires a world view itself.  Surprisingly, they don't seem to understand the concept of making important or moral choices at all.  For example, there is an encounter where a group of dwarves asks for help retrieving their stolen ale.  Why was it stolen?  Because the thieves, quote, ""are addicted to it, just like everyone else!""  Interesting choice of words.  Based on outcomes, the game clearly thinks that helping these drug dealers reclaim their addictive (and stolen) brews is the ""good"" thing to do.  It doesn't seem to understand the moral conundrum it creates in doing so.  In another instance, the game throws a guilt trip at the player for taking a runaway child home; the young child wants to remain a runaway, and the party-pooper player has insensitively returned him to his father!  I can only assume that none of these writers has any children in real life.The image of non-humans is wildly inconsistent.  In some instances, orcs are portrayed as good people who (I suppose) are unfortunately monstrous in appearance.  In other cases, they speak like stereotypical cavemen and engage in kidnapping and murder.  The game doesn't seem to realize it is showcasing opposed stereotypes side-by-side.There is a 'style guilde' written for the game's encounter editor, I assume in the hopes of preventing home-made tripe from being uploaded to the Workshop by players.  But the game's authors themselves break the standards of that guide,  not just a few times, but consistently.  It's really a shame."

You can tell there's been put some love into this. The Turn & Grid-based Combat feels inovative, mostly relying on a ton of buffs and debuffs (some of which are unfortunately different in name only). I'm not the creative type, so the encounter-builder isn't really for me, but it's great for the longevity of the game to involve the community like this.So there is a lot to like here (it's cheap to boot) but I still wouldn't recommend this game to anyone intrigued by the store-description alone: As a modern rogue-like this game is kinda useless. It takes too long to assemble a more powerful party every run, just to get unluckily crushed by a good enemy composition or a couple of bad encounters in a row. You can unlock a handful of classes, items, weapons and companion-types, but not enough to help you out in the early stages of every new game. Now if there was some kind of pick your perk system based on the Score of your last run or something similar, this game would probably feel much more rewarding. But there isn't and the Score-screen and the end always feels like insult to injury, since I barely ever unlock anything persistent :(Thanks for reading,Khytomer."
