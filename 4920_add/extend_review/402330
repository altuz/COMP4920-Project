76561197970262142,Recommended,402330,18767725,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,neildittmar,"Remember all the things you loved (or perhaps, hated) about FMV games back in the 90's?  Well, All Seeing Eye Games does and has packed ""Press X to Not Die"" full of them, along with a bit of self-referential humor and even some current industry tropes along the way.Like the games from decades past that it undoubtedly draws upon, Press X to Not Die casts YOU as the protagonist in a world that has all of a sudden gone mad.  In true ""Interactive Movie"" style, the video scenes that follow as the story progresses are shot from your perspective and characters in the game address you directly.  At certain points, you will be presented with a situation that requires a button press (or combination thereof) within a specific time frame depending on the difficulty selected.  At other times, the player selects from a dialog tree or similar to keep things moving.  Though these interactions represent the entirety of the gameplay, the approach here is faithful to the FMV games of yore.  Additionally, the developers have done a fine job of interjecting humor (self-deprecating and otherwise) into the proceedings.On the standard difficulty, I was able to get through the entirety of the game in just about a half an hour on the first go through with minimal deaths.  While I was a little surprised to have seen the ending that soon, the length of Press X to Not Die is commensurate with the price of admission.  There also exists the possibility of replaying the game several times, whether it be at a higher difficulty or to intentionally not press the required buttons or make different choices to see how the alternate video scenes play out.In all, Press X to Not Die succeeds as a throwback to a genre that left the spotlight as quickly as it entered it over 20 years ago.  It also succeeds as a tongue in cheek reference regarding why those games had limited appeal and short shelf lives.  Regardless of which one is more prevalent, Press X to Not Die succeeds and is worthy of a purchase."
,Recommended,402330,23771218,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,silversuriv,"Portable DescriptionPress X to Not Die is a short (~30 min) FMV game filled with cheap humor and predictable QTEs. With various death triggers, nut shots and game endings to experience, be prepared to stay on those fingertips.GameplayFull Motion VideoIn a world where a certain type of people are immune to some rage-inducing virus, you must get to your girlfriend and figure out how to survive. This FMV game is comprised of 7 chapters. It will take the player approximately half an hour to reach the end of a single play-through. This interactive movie parodies a lot of common tropes observed in a virus outbreak story; however, Press X is much more laid-back and comedic about it. It even breaks the fourth wall quite often to help develop a more direct interaction with the player, while making fun of itself at times.Although this game is extremely amusing, many players may not enjoy the style of comedy or sense of humor Press X employs. The dialogue and script can be too cheesy at times, and the cast is a tad on the ordinary side. From a more technical standpoint, the video clips are often too discontinuous between decisions. A more seamless transition would be ideal.Quick Time EventsThe gameplay of Press X is all about the triggered QTEs, with sprinkles of multiple choice decisions mixed in. On a M&K setup, the game utilizes approximately 9 different keys/buttons to proceed through each QTE. Some will be “press _,” others will be “rapidly press _ and _,” all in an effort to: dodge, hit, swing, run, climb, choke, etc.Most of the QTEs will be fairly predictable with regards to timing. If an obstacle, object, or human is suddenly in your path, a QTE will occur. There are very few abrupt QTEs, and upon death, the player will restart from a recent checkpoint (generally immediately before the failed QTE). The button prompts mostly vary, even if redoing a scene. Several QTEs will also need to be failed to achieve specific Steam achievements or discover unseen footage.ConclusionAdvised SuggestionsThere are a few suggestions that may improve gameplay listed below.Allow the player to skip certain sequences (useful after dying for the 10th time).Improve the transition of spliced clips between decisions – a little too jarring at times.Implement dedicated save slots (similar to visual novels) or a “rewind to last decision” option.VerdictPress X to Not Die is essentially a QTE simulator with a “story”. Unfortunately, the editing, script and dialogue leave a desire for more; however, the lack of FMV games on Steam makes it hard to regret purchasing Press X, especially at such a deeply discounted price ($0.59). The game’s blatant disregard for the fourth wall and plentiful amount of death triggers earn it a recommendation for any non-hypercritical fan of FMV or QTE-heavy games.Before You Buy– analyses of newly released indie games"

Maybe you've played the odd Telltale adventure. Perhaps you've come to loathe the QTEs in the latest Tomb Raider:A Survivor is Born. This game is set to redeem them all, in 30 minutes of FMV (well, actually, some scenes are missing video) filmed with a basement budget and a GoPro camera. Because sometimes it's not about what you do, it's about how you do it, and these guys and gals are doing it right. (No greenscreen scenes.) This can only get better if they add ninjas for the sequels.Very much recommended. Now let me go die some more and unlock a better ending."

I have liked FMV games for years and when I saw Press X to Not Die i had to get it. The video quality is good (amazing compared to the old games).

So I bought it and I'm glad I did.This game is kinda like a tribute to those old FMV video games from the early to mid '90s like Wing Commander 3 and Night Trap. I've personally never played those kinds of games, so seeing a video game done in this way was very new to me.I recommend you play this game on Normal difficulty because the higher ones expect you to press about four buttons in three seconds. Unless you are going for achievements of course.It's a very short game, but satisfying in many ways. The acting is pretty cheesy which I enjoy personally. The menus feel really well done which surprised me even.And yes this game is just quicktime events basically, but one that made me laugh through a lot of it. This game has a strange sense of humor from referring to M. Night Shyamalan to FarmVille. But it does work. I greatly appreciate the use of Kevin MacLeod music by the way, it actually fits nicely here.Overall, this is a very fun and cheap indie game that I recommend if you just want to be entertained. It doesn't have the same level of substance as most indies I've played, but it is to become a classic in the future!"

First time on Normal and second on Hard.My first play through was entertaining and quite humorous - the normal mode can be difficult to someone with slower reflexes and not used to quick time events in games. The acting and dialogue comes off as trying to be ridiculous which I found entertaining.Second play through was on hard mode and was considerably more difficult to do the quick time style events. It added more buttons and different combinations which definitely added to the challenge. There is also a higher difficulty level for the crazy people out there.The game has a high score system integrated into Steam and measures how much of the overall ""clips"" you've seen or options you have chosen while going through it.It's not a super long game, but for someone who wants to challenge the high scores and likes reflex games, it's definitely worth the low price."

Instead is more like an experimental interactive movie in which buttons must be pressed at certain times to get certain results. While interesting at first, this also makes the game extremely repetitive.+/-Adequate sound but not fantastic.+/-Nearly no music though music is not very intrusive.-Extremely repetitive after just 2-3 play-throughs.-This game seems to be eternally stuck in the early-access phase. It doesn't seem to be improving or growing very much as time goes on though. Meanwhile the developer already seems to be thinking about making a sequel.-There are many more things that could have been done with this game. Not all failed button presses should result in death or repetitive do-overs. Entirely alternate branches of the story could potentially exist if the game was ever actually finished.-What's wrong with watching your girlfriend shower? The apparent prude who wrote the script for this game seems to be under the misapprehension that there's something wrong with wanting to do that.-Some button-pressing combinations are overly difficult.-There should be an easier than easy difficulty for old people who might get a kick out of the game but are definitely not gamers nor have any great hope of ever greatly developing such button mashing skills.-What little gameplay exists mostly consists of reaction-time oriented games and button mashing.-The game is short and the ending feels somewhat abrupt and the plot is not resolved."

I reckon the old lady fighting the two people in the street was funny as she was one of the normal people and if you block the punch of the girlfriend a different dialogue occurs. I died from the stapler guy a couple of times and the clown twice as you got to be quick, This is a funny game and needs to be longer if a sequel comes should be two to three hours to be value for the money you spend, and a great fmv game the 1994 version was nice to play.I did a new game and this time left the bicycle guy and he shows up still in the end and if you don't die comments you should play on hard and goes you left him and it was cool, and sits there having milo. I think the marshollows in the milo are quite a lot and some plot holes in the game, like the room mate at Christina house not attacking her for some time until you get there.I reckon one more improvement could be having control of your character as in the game you only could choose the words and buttons, having control would make the experience better and also driving a vehicle in the next game."

It's an interesting twist on the zombie apocalypse scenario.Pros:I loved this game and was cracking up from start to finish. The humour is great and the dialogue is clever. The acting is cheesy which perfectly fits the style of the game. The characters were all interesting and crazy in their own unique way. Full disclosure, I do have a soft spot for FMV games.Cons:I played on normal and I did find the difficulty a little high and some of the key press combinations a bit tough. The death scenes were pretty entertaining so I didn't mind failing once, but I was stuck on the boss fight for a while which got a little frustrating. It's also only about 30 minutes of gameplay, although it does have some replayability and the price reflects the length (it's cheap!)Conclusion:It calls itself a B movie and that's exactly what it is - an intentionally cheesy and sometimes bizarre FMV game. Its offbeat humour and dialogue keeps it fresh and entertaining the whole way through. If that sounds like your kind of game, I'd snap it up. Also, it says it's early access but I didn't experience any bugs, anything unfinished etc. I'm guessing it's Early Access because there's only the one episode and it's designed to be episodic.

76561197975126621,Not Recommended,402330,19743800,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,Cazamus,"Press X to Not Die, is a throwback to the classic quicktime event full motion video games like Dragons Lair, Space Ace, and Braindead 13. FMV is a genre of games where the player would be given a choice to perform an action, or die. Pressing the button for a choice didn’t assure living either, you had to make the right choice, or else your character would still die. Think of the genre as a video version of a choose your own adventure book, that is linear, and a second play through is rarely ever needed.So now that you know what you would get into with purchasing PXTND generally, how is the game itself? (TLDR at the bottom) I guess to start, the game is linear for most playthroughs, with very little variety on how the game changes based on your decisions. There are 20+ ways to die, and its fairly easy to get through the whole game. The gameplay is as such, watch the video, until the game prompts you to press a button, or a character asks you a question. If you fail to press the right button, more often than not you die, and go back approximately 20 seconds to try again. The answers you give do not seem to seem to change anything for the most part, and that’s the game. I finished it once, and to be honest, there wasn’t a reason to play again for the following reasons:This is a game that lacks inspiration. Reviving a dead genre is normally done with a goal in mind, a new twist on the same old story; PXTND is not it. The story is more or less first person Dawn of the Dead, the story of how it happens is generic military scheme, and the spoken jokes are outdated pop culture references. Farmville, Twilight, Hunger games, and angry birds are the references, 4 in total that I found, and when they were not out of place (the Twilight reference was just shoehorned in), it became weirdly pretentious (accepting angry bird players, but hating on Farmville…). There were 2 visual gags that made me laugh, if you play the game you will spot them, but overall if someone is trying to sell this game to you as comedy, you will be disappointed. The few jokes are counteracted by the bad acting, which you have to sit through to get through the game.To start about the bad acting, the game informs me in the extra’s menu that the reason why the acting is bad is because it is purposefully trying to do a callback to bad B movie acting. That is just a lie; when I hear bad B movie acting, I think of overacting, I think of overactive screams, out of place expressions, I think of campy out of place moments and over the top reactions. Don’t let the trailer fool you, the first character Matt nailed B movie. He gives a great intro, lets you know how to play the game, gets shanked, and then lets you know he forgot to press X, ♥♥♥♥ING METAL! That intro, and the fact the game was on sale, is why I purchased the game. For the rest of PXTND the acting past the intro takes a nosedive, the zombies all are doing an impersonation of DOTD zombies, and really don’t bring anything. Again, its college art movie, not B movie, so they lack direction to look like anything other than people pretending to be a zombie/crazed person. Don’t let someone sell you the line that looking like a highschooler filming their first youtube video is what they were going for. It wasn’t funny bad, it was unprepared mess. The biggest problem is the girlfriend in the games acting.The majority of the game, the only person giving dialogue is your girlfriend. While the zombies in the game try to kill you, she tries to kill the game. No expressions outside of line reading, no emotion, not inflection, just reading the lines. A paper plate on a stick would have been preferred. She brought nothing, and while she is supposed to be the sarcastic death relief (oh you died because…) that didn’t happen. I think the writer was imagining a crazy, spunky girl as he was writing her character, and didn’t envision that someone who looks as stiff as a board through the whole game would be the choice for the lead.This is the sort of game that reminds me to be wary of the indie community. This just isn’t good, and the people that are adamant that this is the second coming, I think just want to be part of something. It lacks wit, it is using outdated jokes, its pacing is crap, its death scenes are without humor or irony, its 1 liners are out of place, the acting is bad, and not in the fun MST3K way, and the bulk of its jokes are just pop culture references. The game ends with letting you know there is already a planned sequel, but if this was the dream project of someone to revive the FMV genre, and it lacks all of the charms that made those games great, then why would you buy an into an episodic game series that doesn’t seem to have a direction other than making a movie on their Go Pro and taking your money. This could have been shot in a day, written in a day, and programed in a day. This isn’t a passion project, it’s a small developer banking off of the indie community♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves to proclaim how cool they are for playing such a unique pile of crap, that only true Scottsmen get its comedy.TLDR;Bad, unfunny acting; Spoken jokes are all pop culture references; Story is the definition of generic; Story is pandering to how Meta gamers are... without irony; No replay-ability; Completely devoid of inspiration; Short (less than 30 minutes), with planned future episodes; Overall a black mark on the already stained FMV genre."

The storyline is incredibly weak. The acting is terrible. The jokes are unfunny and the gameplay is bad. This game is not worth your time. The fact that they charge €2.99 for this game is what motivated me to write this review.

Night trap, double switch, snow job, voyeur, all digital picture games, american lazer games, and the like all have a home in my colllection.  Thus i consider myself a connoisseur of this particular video gaming niche.  In my opinion ""press x"" ranks amongst the best of them.  At first, and do to the advertising behind the game, i was expecting more of a homage to the less appreicated genre.  Instead what i was pleasant surprised to discover was a game that was willing to push into new territory.  Generally the main issues with FMV games are there repetitiveness and, lack of options.  Normally there is only one way to solve the game.  This is not so with ""press x"".  I found myself constantly dying on purpose and resetting the game in attempt to discover as much of the world presented before me as possible.  The only con i have with the game is the trait it is often praised for..its fails to take itself seriously.  The meme culture jokes also suck but, again, thats personal taste.  Regardless I look forward to a sequel and would LOVE to see something serious by the developers instead.  Murder mystery ala X-files or something of that nature.  Comedy does not to be the only route this genre has to follow. 8.0 / 10"

They added support for low resolution fliter to make the game look as if you were playing this game in 1992. The options for conversation are hilarious which keeps me coming back for more. The thing that turns me off is the controling. I first played this game on keyboard which was very difficult to do some of the button combinations (including mouse clicks) leving me frustrated. I tried using an Xbox 360 controller and ran into situations where even when I maxed out the status bar I was still being killed.Overall it's a pretty good game, but the controling makes it not worth playing.

I purchased this game for the hell of it.Not only was I completely surprised by the great humour, but the whole schpiel was such an awesome experience. If there's more coming out in this series, consider me a subscriber!Without spoilers:Great game, fun and extremely silly. Seriously, it's insanely ♥♥♥♥ing silly. But this is exactly what makes it work so beautifully. That 90's mode though, what a chuckle.With spoilers:I almost broke when I read the disclaimer at the end. Balloon sword? I love you guys so much right now. Ladies and gentleman, dev team, actors: you have packed so many gems into this little awesome game that I feel everyone should experience it. I will most certainly play it over and over on ALL difficulty levels.TL;DRIf you want crazy, stupid, beautifully crafted corny moments which are timed to perfection, this is the game you want. I take my hat off to the whole team, great job!It's a pity I only discovered this gem now >;p"

Some of the jokes are way too corny for my taste, but the overall game style works in the end. It's not even fully released yet and they're already talking about a sequal. Unfortunately there hasn't been an update in a while. I hope they haven't given up on finishing it or starting the next one. I would like to see more (and that's not just a reference to Chapter 2."

In Call of Duty or GTA it looks like you are killing people but you aren't really, they're polygonal people. In this game, when you hit someone you're assaulting REAL people. These aren't polygonal people getting stabbed and cut up with a chainsaw, they're REAL people. You're cutting up REAL people with a chainsaw.7.9/10"

The game for it's price is really worth the laughs. It's pretty funny, on all accounts very silly. But worth the price for the laughter alone. Buy the game for the laughter and silly moments. I wasn't let down :3 10/10 would fight a clown with a balloon sword again."

But the girls are very cute :)The layout is a bit weird. My first game was on hard, because I was confident in my reflexes. I died 10 times and got stabbed by my gf (yeah, who just has a katana in the bathroom).My first death was because I had no clue what was going to happen... I was expecting I'd be hitting only X, not X and E.But I  caught up quickly. But then my keyboard layout killed me multiple times, because my laptop has stupidly placed keys that also put up no resistance when being pressed. However, that is rather my own problem.This game is better playable with old school keyboards than with the ones that have flat keys. If you have flat keys, prepare to die due to easier mispresses.Still, I believe that if the story gets longer and the fighting scenes get more realistic (And also the sounds used in the game need to be less weird, sometimes I was creeped out by the unnatural use of sounds), it can develop into a nice game."

This deserves to be funded more to refine the game.The dialogue pacing is a bit slow and unnatural, which lends itself well to the campy choose-your-own-adventure feel i got from the game. It can be tightened up a bit, but not too much please.One complaint is the camera angle is a bit too high up and pointed a bit too low angled at times. But again, even with that minor peeve, this game is surprising value for money. Definitely i would recommend this game."

It's a nice take on the reviving FMV genre. You'll end up in absurd situations and without spoiling anything, I can say this game includes a real shower-scene :) Not much of a story, but plain fun if you enjoy crazy absurd horror."

I've always been fascinated by choose-your-own-adventure titles, and this one didn't disappoint. The humor is quirky, and the difficulty is right where it should be. Give it a go."
,Recommended,402330,34965307,Posted: 14 September,all,Argenis,"This is a throwback to the interactive movie games of the early 90s. This one is very funny, if not a bit short. I do recommend it if you're a fan of tongue in cheek games of this genre.The only recommendation I have to the creators is to implement rumble feature in the controller for a bit more immersive game, and perhaps adding an audible attention grabber on easier modes of the game to ease into not dying.If you hate ""timed button presses"" type of games, stay away, this is not for you, that is the esscence of the game."
