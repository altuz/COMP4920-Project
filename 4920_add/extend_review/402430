Altho the mass amount of menu screens makes it look daunting, A few games in and it just gets easier to use and navigate. Currently it is spring training and after playing the first 5 games of the season on the game it really feels like baseball is back in real life. The detail and numbers that goes into this game is incredible! I will definietly be buying OOTP every year now. Great game and I strongly recommend it"
76561198079167443,Recommended,402430,30972000,Posted: 5 April,all,bryanjkautzman,"Now that I've put a few hours into this game, I feel qualified to give a competent review.I have played baseball simulations my entire life.  I played the Strat-O-Matic Baseball tabletop game as a kid, and I invested in the game on my Commodore 64.  The limitation was that I could only buy one season at a time, and even back then, you could play a season pretty quickly on a computer.  To keep playing, you had to buy additional seasons.  That gets expensive in a hurry, and it's one of the biggest reasons why Strat-O-Matic isn't my game of choice anymore.In 1997, Baseball Mogul came along.  That was a great game for its time, but it was extremely limited in the different displays and statistical breakdowns you could view.  OOTP Baseball debuted two years later, but the first time I heard of it was when I saw a copy of ""Season Ticket Baseball 2003"" on the shelves a few years later.  I bought it, and I was amazed.  You could use the Lehman Database to import actual Major League Players!Season Ticket Baseball was a rebranding that OOTP did for two years in 2002 and 2003 before reverting back to the OOTP Baseball name.My strategy is pretty simple.  I upgrade my baseball simulator every 3-4 years.  I have owned copies of OOTP Baseball from 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2017.  My reasoning is simple.  The game improves a little bit every year, but it doesn't improve drastically until you get three to four seasons along.  Therefore, I will probably be looking to buy a new copy in 2020 or 2021.  I will promise you, though, that if I'm still alive, I will be buying another copy.I think the biggest way the game has chagned since 2014 are in 1) the fact that they can actually now use real Major League logos and 2) the fact that career progression seems to have improved immensely.  With past versions of the game.  I tend to prefer to play the historical career mode, and it just seemed like declining players had their skill drop off way too quickly on a fairly consistent basis.  That aspect of the game seems to be better mixed now, except I still do think that defensive ability tends to drop off too quickly.Other than that, I truly think that the only way the game could be improved further would be in adding more reporting options and abilities.  And make everything exportable so I can play with it in Excel.  The GUI is relatively clean, which seems pretty rare in this day and age.  There are so many things you can do with the settings in the game, though, perhaps some of the menus could be organized better.  I'm also happy that they have not succumbed to the modern day tendency to use icons instead of words to label menus because if they did that, the learning curve would be almost impossible.I'm currently playing a truly epic simulation starting as the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1901, and I'm doing as much as the game will allow me to do without cheating.  I unloaded all of my starters except Zach Wheat to land the number one pick in the 1913 draft so I could bring Babe Ruth to town.  A last place finish allowed me to draft Rogers Hornsby and George Kelly in 1914, I won a championship in 1916.  And again in 1918.  Two more in 1919 and 1920.Now it's 1923, and I'm trying to figure out how to get back to the top.   My pitching sucks in a bad way, and Ruth seems to get hurt a lot.  When Ruth is hurt, I can't win.  In 1921, he was hurt trying to steal a base in game one of the World Series.  I ended up losing against the Athletics in nine games in one of the most epic World Series showdowns imaginable.  In 1922, it got better.  My top four outfielders, including Wheat and Ruth, were shelved for over half the season, and it was only through a late season surge that I was able to catch the Reds and clinch the pennant on the second to the last day of the season.  That was the same game that Ruth was hurt again, this time by a collision in the field.  I got the Athletics in the World Series again, but all hopes of retribution were lost when they took the first four games.  I made a show of it by winning the next three, but it was too little too late.Now it's 1923.  My entire team is healthy, it's the end of June, and I'm under .500.  What gives? Despite the fact that my pitching, anchored by Dazzy Vance and a newly acuired Walter Johnson, who some are saying is over-the-hill, is much stronger than it has been in some time, my role players are not playing well.  I have plenty of options at C, 2B, SS, and CF who are all defensive stalwarts, but none of them can seem to hit .200 this year.Did I mention that this game is awesome?I highly recommend the latest version of this game to anyone who likes baseball.  I would estimate that I've put in over 100,000 hours in baseball simulations over the years, so I fashion myself as a bit of an expert.   I can promise you that this is as good as it gets."
76561198032195639,Recommended,402430,23533896,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,ActionJesus,"Former Microleague player, yea back in the mid 80's I started getting into that game. I had all the floppy disk and finally the editor so I could edit and add all the major league players individually, which I did.  Played a whole season with each individual team then.  I can tell you that was a lot of games I had to play and I loved every minute.  This is just to tell you how dedicated I was to simming a entire one season of baseball.  Then came Tony Larussa Baseball, and then OOTP, where I can sim entire season in one day instead of one year of my life.Last OOTP I played was OOTP 11 which was  few years ago.  Enjoyed the game but it had a few faults in it, especially the not so friendly interface.   I haven't bought baseball sim game since, thinking my joy for the game had faded.So you ask why I bought this game?  Well it peeked my interest from the high reviews I have read about it.  So I said to myself why not, lets see if we can spark that old flame again.  It not only sparked the flame, it has caused a three alarm fire.  This game is going to be a classic.   It has surprassed any of my expectectations I had for it.The Quick Sim is now extremely fast because of the 4 processor support.  No more simming and waiting for few minutes, just a quick click and a few seconds delay and the day is done.   I love how technology has made it this easy, instead of the days of me individually going to play each game for each team.One thing I truely love and pretty much look forward to is the unique things that pop in a season.  Things can put your player out, not just basic injuries either.  You might have caused one of your players to be overworked one game, for example a pitcher.  That said pitcher you push him to his limits trying to get him a complete game and his arm figuratively falls off with a tired arm syndrome. So you loss him for few starts.   Stuff like that and players being suspended for fighting is all in this game. Also players age as years go by and you can see how this effects them on thier portrait.  Aging also has effect on how well and bad they play.  Like a upcoming player  starting to reach thier potential or a aging star fading away during his twighlight of his career.  There is soo much content in this game,  I am only skimming the surface of what this game has.If you want to be just a coach for minor league team, you can.  If you want to control every aspect of your franchise you can too.  The choice is yours,  if you want to relive your childhood and see your favorite heros from the past play, you can.  Having every authentic player from both minor leagues and majors makes this game so realistic.I am probably just babbling now.  But for me this game has been enlightening and has taken me back to when I was a kid and when I was playing Microleague,  I had wished a computer game just like this.  I mean some of the extra stuff they did to this game is stuff I never thought off back then, but boy I am enjoying each and every new surprise each day.Buy it if you love Baseball, buy it if you like micromanaging, buy it if your a strategy fan, buy it if you like history, and  buy it if you like gaming.  This is just a game, but its more then game.  If you get my meaning.  This is the Best and I mean ""The Best Sim Game"" out there bar none."
,Recommended,402430,22217464,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,Darth Krampus,"This is the first review I have written here on steam.I admit, I was a bit skeptical about this game at first.Part of me seemed like it might be boring and another part thought that it may be too complicated to get into.Though it did seem like it was unique and potentiall fun to play.I played baseball for 16 years up through high school and into college and coached for two years following that. I have to say the level of detail from every single aspect of the game is present in this title. I was astonished how the attitudes of the players could effect the teams just like they do in real life. That is just one example. THERE ARE SO MANY TINY DETAILS. It must have been painstaking to research and input all this information into the game.To top it off, I figured that the actual game simulations would be boring but nope, I was very wrong there. It brought back my old days of coaching calling the shots from the dugout or sending signals, trying to direct your team to a big win.I simply cannot say enough. I have been gaming ever since I can remember and I have never gotten into a simulator. If you enjoy baseball, you will love this game. If you kind of like baseball, you will love this game. Chances are even if you do not like baseball, you will love this game."
,Recommended,402430,24928843,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,TheMummy17,"I've now put quite a few hours into OOTP 17 now since buying it in July so I can now fairly give a review and also compare to last years OOTP 16.  First thing I noticed different from last year was the design and colors of the screens. Much better imo and easier to read. Something else that is much improved over last years game is the trading. You can actually now make a list of needs you are wanting so the computer makes more offers to you making the game more realistic in that area. Now I'm not saying the trades are easier to make, I still always get the they want two five star players for their 4 star and 3 star thing happening but overall this new function really adds to the game.Now to just go over the game in general and not comparing to last years game. If you like baseball and sims you will absolutley LOVE this game. The options to starting leagues are never ending. There is almost nothing you can't make your league into with all the options given. You can base a league on current MLB seasons, historical MLB seasons. You can dump all the MLB players into a pool and draft them into new teams. You can start fictional leagues. You can decide on whether its an offensive league, pitching league or neutral league. You can start foreign leagues. It's endless.The interface can be a bit tricky to learn to start but after a bit it starts to fall into place for you as things are designed well for the most part. My biggest complaint about the game is when setting individual player game strategies you can't always see all the players stats needed to adjust you strategies. Otherwise they have done a great job on making sure you can almost always find what you are looking for easily after a bit of practice.I highly recommend this game to baseball fans and sim fans, you can't do any better than this game. If you are wanting to learn more about basebal I also recommend this game as well, so much can be learned while playing the game, it won't take long before you know you've improved your baseball IQ."
,Recommended,402430,27741825,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Dustin,"I've always been a fan of sports games. Not in being the rising star player in career mode, not in dominating my opponents online (because, being honest, that doesn't really happen) or in the now everpresent card collecting mode found in almost every sports game. I am, through and through, a franchise mode player. I love to build up my team, scout, draft and trade my way to being the next dynasty. It's doable in the console based sports games out there. Some do it better than others. OOTP Baseball gives a deeper dive into the shoes of being a GM and provides the most satisfying sports management experience I've found.I'll get this out of the way first. If you're looking to actually play a game of baseball, you should move on. The game is completely text based with outcomes generated by formulas. You are able to manage a game from ""10,000 feet"" if you will, but there is no playing a baseball game. This is not MLB the Show for the computer. This is about handling the front office functions of the team more than the actual playing of the game of baseball. I'll also say that if you're looking for a hardcore baseaball management sim, you probably know a fair amount about baseball. If you're not very familiar with baseball, you will probably get overwhelmed and should learn a bit about the management side of baseball beforehand. There's just so much to it that if you're coming in without a base of knowledge you'll probably be turned off. Losing a prized prospect to the rule 5 draft or not understanding service time and suddenly have a player hit arbitration and become expensive could easily ruin the experience when you're just getting your feet wet.If what you're looking for is a deep dive into being a GM of a baseball organization OOTP 17 is great follow up to OOTP 16. You can play in the real MLB as GM of a team, as the GM of a team in another real world league, or create your own baseball universe. You can run more than one organization, but you would have the same controls over each. If you play in the real MLB the game has full rosters with minor league teams containing the real life players and even top prospects for the upcoming drafts. Upon creation, the game world you want is customizable. From things like the size of the active roster and how many rounds the draft go to modifiers for how rapidly players decline as they age and swing and miss rates. There are pages and pages of options you can modify to make the game to your liking. Most of the settings are also modifiable in game if you find you don't like a particular setting, though it's best to modify them in the offseason otherwise you can run into issues. You can also play as just a manager, or running a minor league team, or work your way up, but everything short of GM + Manager is just a restriction on what you can do.Once you're actually in game it functions like a browser, with various tabs and subsections you can navigate to manage your team or see what's going on around the league or even in other international leagues. You manage your major league roster and minor league farm teams. You set your scouting budget and priority as well as review international free agents as they are discovered by your scouts. Set ticket prices, work to make your team's owner happy and balance your budget while fielding a competitive team. The list would go on for quite some time. It's baseball. You're in charge of a baseball team. Rule 5 drafts, arbitration, player postings, PED usage suspensions, it's all there unless you turn it off in the customization tab at the league creation.There is a very in depth system for managing your roster with scouting reports not only on a player's ability and future potential, but also on things like their personality, leadership ability and work ethic. This system is in place for all players: majors, minors, amateur draft and international. Going through the amateur draft you'll look at a player who looks like he has off the charts athletic ability, but poor work ethic and would be a bad teammate versus a player that looks like a solid, above average player who is a hard worker that could become a leader in your clubhouse. Those decisions have an impact down the road. Team chemistry or a leaderless clubhouse can have an impact on your team's ability to perform and desire to play for your team like losing do. It's like the real world. When you're winning, things look better. Losing, worse. Good teammates make things better. Bad ones, worse. You need to figure out how to field a team that works, not only on the field but off.Along with team performance you have to manage your finances. Each team has a market size, fan base loyalty and stadium capacity that are bases modified by fan interest and attendance which go hand in hand. Each team has a floor of a national media contract along with local media contracts, but the major differentiator from team to team is game attendance. If you field a bad team with no big name players, people won't show up and you won't have the resources to improve your team. Winning and player popularity play a major part in your team's finances through boosting ticket sales. As players are in the majors longer and do better they become more popular, and people want to show up to watch them. You will most likely develop most of your big name players in house, but signing big name free agents or trading away big names on your team will change fan interest. Losing minor leaguers can have an oddly large impact on fan interest. I remember one season in particular where I let five minor league players who were late round draft picks that never made it above rookie ball walk and my fan interest dropped 12 percentage points. It made no sense.There are also random events factored into the game like would happen in real life. I have yet to see anything exciting happen, like a league expansion. What I've seen have been things like lengthening the time of DL stints. The mundane, every day stuff that actually happens. Maybe someday I'll see that league expansion I'd be so excited for, but so far nothing.While the game is an amazing sports management sim, there are a few issues in the game. As a note all of this is with the default settings. I wanted the real deal of managing a baseball team so everything is with the default settings. International trades are a bit arcane. Some leagues are willing to trade players or post players, but others are not. There isn't any explanation or guide in the game as to why.The game, like every other sports sim, can be gamed. It's not hard to trade up to get both the first, second, third and sometimes fourth overall draft picks, though the rest of the draft will be pretty thin to nonexistent for you. Minor league players, or even players almost to arbitration will sign ridiculous long term contracts. In the end, it's not such a terrible thing. You want to be able to be amazing. It is, after all, your world so figuring out the tricks and being a perennial world series contender is fun. It is a little unrealistic, but you play and you build an amazing team, one that you built and one you take to the world series.There are a number of improvements over OOTP 16. AI controlled teams are no longer willing to give up prized prospects for a pile of mediocre. The AI is also better at managing its finances. No longer are all AI controlled teams chronically running in the red. The rate of decline in players is also more varied and feels more realistic. No longer is it someone's arm falling off at 32. Young promising players will fizzle out after a season or 2 sometimes and some players will have a slow decline over years allowing them to go from perennial all-star at 30 to riding off into the sunset at 40. The game also touted adding dual core functionality for processing. It does better and worse in certain ways. There will be quite a few hang ups when scouting players and going into the various tabs"

I've played a few sports sims (Football Manager series, Eastside Hockey, Front Office Football), all very good (with Football Manager being the king of sport sims).I hadn't followed baseball religiously since the 94-95 playoff lock-out. Not sure why, but just lost the love for baseball at that point. I've followed with a mild interest since then.Enter OOTP 17. Because I don't have a good grasp of the current MLB rosters, I decided to start a league in 1982. A year when I really started to love baseball, read every stat line in the newspaper, and collected baseball cards. A year that produced some of the era's best baseball players and brought back a ton of memories for me.Commissioner mode allowed me to put together a ball club of personal favorites. This game is deep and lots of fun. The immersion in this game is fantastic. The flavor text, the mounds of stats, the interactive playcalling, roster management....this game has everything I could have dreamed of in a baseball sim.Yes, the graphics could be better. I'd love to have the option to add additional sounds to the game...BUT, those are minor gripes.At the end of the day, this rivals Football Manager in many ways. The only area it doesn't, is the 3D presentation. But again, this is such a small thing for me, because the flavor text is so dynamic and well written.

Yes, this can have drawbacks, and from my personal experience, I wish I would have let the AI control more when I first began playing. But now, I like having almost full control and then letting the stats and RNGesus determine everything elseConstant bug fixes throughout the year. Obviously this game just came out, but Markus and the gang are always adding features and fixing bugs.Really, too many pros to nameConsThe game will let me cheat and pick Pedro whenever he is available for the draft. To be fair, he is the only player I will do this for. And to be fair, we would all cheat to have Pedro.I have learned a lot about confirmation bias. Which has led me to realize I may have other flaws as well. Hey OOTP, I don't need to be psychoanalyzing myself. I just want to live out a dream of being a GM. But, this game is only 34.99. My shrink charges more, so I guess it cancels out. My shrink gives me benzos also. Any chance of that next year????In all seriousness, no real cons I can think of. I'm not saying they aren't there, but I don't want to say ""X"" is a con when I don't even have a solution.Also, to avoid the should I get ""OOTP or the Show"" types of questions I have seen the past couple of years, I will preemptively say they aren't the same types of games. Its not fair to compare them. I personally love them both. But, one thing OOTP does that the Show doesn't is truly upgrade from year to year. I'm not saying there aren't improvements with The Show each year, but that they just seem more minor.I highly recommend. This is a game that could easily cost more and still be worth it.

With 17 it's VERY hard to deal with the computer when trading and come out feeling like you really fleeced the other guy. Which honestly I'm OK with because that's a lot more realistic. So trade-wise it makes you work a lot harder than previous versions I think.The amateur draft also seems a little deeper to me - seems like the draft pool has more guys with higher ratings now - where as before you would look through maybe the first 2 rounds and then there'd be nothing left but 3-stars at the best. Now you have a lot of 4, 4.5 and even some 5-star's still left after like 10 rounds, mostly because their signing demands are ridiculous. Doesn't mean you can't sign them, but you really have to make sure you can handle what they're going to cost you.They've added a 3D game view when playing the actual games where the ball moves a little more realistically... but it's not designed to show the play with complete accuracy... for example, with a runner on 2nd, the ball might get hit to shallow Lt field and the outfielder will field it and quickly throw it to the cutoff but then the cutoff guy will hold it instead of sending it home even though by the timing of it it appears as if it would be an easy out at home if the ball were thrown in.Or when a runner steals second, the pitch will come in and the catcher will hold the ball for 1/2 a second before throwing - so the computer sort of determines the result of a play and the 3D view just accomodates that result irregardless of what the timing of the play really looks like with the ball moving. I still like it better than the 2D view though - especially for home runs - there's almost never a doubt that it's gone when the ball comes off the bat and you can see the shadow of the ball tracking on the ground.All in all, same good old OOTP - lots of hour-killing baseball management fun! And oh yeah one more thing - you can get FIRED if you don't meet the owners demands and/or are just sucking at putting together a winning team! So yeah, hasn't happened to me yet but honestly I think I might be close if my current team doesn't get it done this year hehe... we'll see!So if you've owned previous OOTP versions and liked them or if you're just looking for an ultra-deep baseball management sim, I highly recommend OOTP 17. Pretty much everything you could ask for IMO."

We'd gather around the screen, taking on the legends of the game, arguing about who got to hit the button next and making fun of the one member of our group who was 'only' hitting .560.    I bought this game in a fit of nostalgia, hoping to recreate a little of that magic.   I've been pleasantly surprised so far; this game brings the magic like David Copperfield after a Barry Bonds smoothie.You may initially be overwhelmed by the numbers of screens and info thrown at you, but the user-friendly interface makes it very easy to control.   You can do as much, or as little, as you'd like.  If you wish to rule the world, make yourself Commissioner and have a hand in everything.  If you'd like to earn your way to the top, start as a manager for the Brevard County Manatees or some other minor-league team.  Go back in time and GM the Yankees in the 70's and 80's for the sheer fun of hiring and firing Billy Martin.OOTP is clearly not a graphics-driven, but anyone who played Microleague back in the day will appreciate the 3D presentation of the individual games.  I refuse to sim because I'm having so much fun playing each game.  But if you're more into the long-term, sim entire seasons in minutes.  This game is whatever you decide to make it.It's not perfect; the trade AI is a hot mess which seems almost impossible to reasonably deal with, until they make you an offer out of nowhere that is so good that you never would have thought to make it yourself.   And I can't seem to get my manager to pull pitchers when I'd like, no matter how I fiddle with their settings.Overall, this game is just plain fun, provided you're into baseball, simulations, or reliving childhood fantasies.  While I'm no longer putting myself on rosters with inflated stats, I'm now undertaking something just as unrealistic; making winners out of the 1980 Mets.9/10"

Great improvement over OOTP16. The only issue I had with '16 was the slow sim times and overall lagginess of the game. It takes a matter of minutes to sim an entire season in '17, and I find myself spending 99% of my play time making decisions and playing the game rather than waiting for the game to load. The other major improvement I see is the ""needs"" you can set. It prevents all of those, ""I'll give you my 76 year old $30mil/yr first baseman for Chris Sale"" type trade offers you would get in previous versions. Now you get offers that are only in the area you want them to be in. I find myself accepting far more trades offered to me by the AI teams than last year.I suspect that the game has messed with many ""under the hood"" details as the progression of young players, AI evaluations of players (it seems like prospects are valued wildly different by teams), overall player rating changes seem to be much different in this version. However, take that with a grain of salt as I cannot confirm this is the case. If these changes did occur I like them quite a lot, and you can consider this another positive change.The only negative thing I can say about this game is the price. For me, the $40 is well spent for the faster load times alone. If you don't mind waiting, I would advise you to not purchase this version, as the changes outside of the performance boost don't warrant a full-price purchase.Overall, this version of the game had little tweaks, and a huge performance boost, along with updated 2017 MLB rosters.

I think having 6-10 scouts at your disposal would really help with discovery quality talent.2) Sticking with adding staff to this game I'd like to have the ability of being the President of my team. It would be nice to give the orders to the GM through the owners. Or I could just play the part of President, GM and Manager.3) I'd also like to see the possibility of having a Minor League Coordinator. Someone who basically keeps the GM in the loop in regards to player development.4) In regards to contract negotiations with players who want an mlb contract I'd like to have the ability to offer a signing bonus to lessen the year by year salary. I've tried to not offer stupid contracts, so sometimes I'll sign a guy and restructure his contract to the point where I'll frontload almost half his contract if possible. I don't like doing that though because I have to go into commisioner mode and I feel like I'm cheating the game when I do that.

A friend of mine recommended that I check this out because the level of detail would help me learn about the game and boy was he right. I've played other baseball games and this blows them out of the water. It's not your usual game where you try to use the controller to hit or pitch to the point it's all about your ability to mash buttons. This game really embraces the thinking aspect of baseball that often gets overlooked. I could not recommend this game enough. I will warn you that the learning curve is kind of steep, but thankfully the OOTP Development website is stocked full of useful information.One interesting example of how this game models baseball so well is that I decided to start a game as Commissioner and GM and picked one of the lowest ranking teams in MLB. I thought it would be fun to stack the team with all the best players from around the league and enjoy the fun of offering low level prospects for superstars and then force the trade. There was just something fun about fleecing some of the best teams of their star players. Once that was done I expected to just run away with the season. Boy was I surprised. Even when simming a game I found myself barely above .500. I had to go back and retool my team because while I may have had bats made of fire that launched balls into the parking lot, my defense was a open as a the US border and let just about everything through.This game taught me that there is more to baseball than just star players, there are subtle tactics that only true disciples of baseball ever really see. With what I've learned from this game I started looking around the real league and suddenly Managers choices started making a whole  lot of sense."

It literally gives you a message saying visit the forums for more information on how to play....really?  Very poor and lazy on the developers part.  There needs to be some sort of introduction into the game instead of just tossing you into it with no real directions oncesoever.  Also, if you have ever used Windows 3.1 then these boxes will look very familiar.  It looks a bit sharper in the screenshots provided but when you start playing, you will notice the ugly edges on all the charts/messages/etc and it feels incredibly cheap.  I expected quite a bit more polish out of an officially licensed game.  I saw the screenshots but it looks much poorer once you actually start it up and feels like it was meant to be played on an old box monitor instead of on crisp hd monitors.  Some chart boxes looked so poor they almost seemed like they overlapped.  It's like if you took nearly a dozen Windows 3.1 boxes and put them all together and added in some pictures/icons/colored font/etc.The two things I liked about the game was how in depth it is and the player portraits.  The portraits were all in some kind of weird but somewhat realistic looking shots.  David Ortiz looked almost like a claymation version of himself which I thought was neat and looked closed enough.  This is great for a simulation game since once you progress to a point where you need fake players created as rookies then they can just use any random faces and it won't look weird next to the other real players since there are no real player photos in the game to begin with.All in all, I honestly can't recommend this game.  I'm a huge fan of sports, sports simulations and tycoon games but this feels much more appropriate for gaming in the early 1990's than an officially licensed game in 2016.  I do like the direction they are going in and I may revisit this series if they release a game in the future that adds a proper introduction to the game, better looking boxes/charts and possibly some larger bolder font."

Look, if you're seeking great major league simulator with all the default options, etc., this is a great game.  Truly, it is.  So if that's all you're looking for and don't have a somewhat recent version of it already, go for it.  You'll love it and it'll be worth your money.  If you're looking for for some non standard action that's going to delve deep into the games various options.  Just don't.  It's buggy.  And worse, several options just flat out exist but don't work.  I set up non standard leagues, really trying to stretch the imagination and utilize many of the games highly detailed options and it's painful to see them flat out not work.  Aaron Harang being drafted in a High School league where you have set the age from 14-17?  Yeah, totally makes sense.  Why even have the option of setting age requirements if you have nothing within the system that actually prevents teams from acquiring them?  Mind boggling.  But hey, if you're not worried about that level of detail, little things like that won't bother you.  And you'll enjoy it.  BUT, if you've bought a previous version in the last few years (I moved from 15), you'll be sorely disappointed.  For $35-$40, not only is it a technical downgrade in some ways (bug related), but there's just not that significant an update.  Madden provides more updates in two years than this."

I love playing baseball games but this is not the one. For being a simulation based game, the simulation is rough. For example, runners dont tag up on deep fly balls or infielders wont turn what looks like an easy double play instead only goes to first. Also the game has bugs like multiple times a batter has bunted and the ball goes to the outfield before the catcher runs out and throws out the runner at first. And since this game claims to have accurate rosters, it was strange to see Mickey Moniak (2016 1st overall pick to the Phillies) on Cleveland's roster and Riley Pint (4th overall pick to the Rockies) on Oakland's. I was highly disappointed with the game but I believe it has the potential to be the best baseball game on the market, over MLB The Show.

Pick your favorite team when you start -- it's more fun when you recognize all of the players and the prospects -- but recognize that the first months are going to be rocky given the length of time it's going to take you to figure out how to release that veteran starter that isn't working out, or promote that prospect tearing it up in triple a.  I personally played through half of a season -- one of the great mid 90s Cleveland lineups -- and then started over again once I was confident I was capable of being a competent general manager.Bottom line, if you like baseball and have the patience to spend a couple of hours  mastering the underlying systems, you'll get many hours of enjoyment out of this game."

That said, be prepared for surprises as baseball is a very unpredictable game.Perhaps the best way to review OOTP is to compare it to other textbased baseball simulations. I've decided to compare it to Baseball Mogul 2015, Diamond Mind Baseball, and APBA Baseball for Windows.1. Seasons: All seasons from 1871 to 2016 are free in OOTP. Similarly all seasons are also free in Baseball Mogul. In what I consider a boneheaded move, APBA has stopped free seasons with its newest iteration. The old game was glorious with Ernie Harwell announcing the game. Seasons were imported from the Bill James Baseball Encyclopedia. Now, there is no way to import seasons. Like Diamond Mind - which charges 25.00 or more per season - , you will be paying hundreds of dollars or more to have a complete history of Major League Baseball.2. Endorsements: OOTP is the ONLY baseball sim endorsed both by MLB and the MLBPA.3. Customization: OOTP rules the roost and the other sims cannot compare. Perhaps the closest would be Baseball Mogul as it allows you to creat a universe of any teams in MLB history with a few clicks. I would love to see this feature implemented in OOTP. But, OOTP allows you to creat real minor league seasons; something the others simply do not do.You really are free to create the baseball universe that is your very own, When you compare the proverbial bang for the buck there simply is no contest. OOTP is the king of baseball sims. I should add that this iteration is the most user friendly. OOTP has a great user community as well as a number of excellent videos for th baseball neophyte.PLAY BALL!!"

I was initially looking for a live action baseball game and couldn't find one, so I settled on this sim. It is very in-depth and detailed, and almost overwhelming. I learned a lot about baseball from playing this game. As a casual fan I could understand OOTP, but it gives players a deeper understanding and appreciation for baseball. With time, you start to figure out the interface and menus. It is very rewarding to steer your team to victory, sign prospects and watch them flourish, negotiate with free agents/personnel, achieve goals, etc. I WOULD NOT recommend OOTP '17 for people who like to play as GM only. I only play as GM and don't mangae individual games. I really only play to make roster moves. As a result, I don't see this as much of an upgrade from OOTP '16. AI is perhaps marginally improved. If you only want to play as GM, save yourself $20 bucks and get last year's version (unless if updated rosters are that important to you). Other than that, great franchise and worth the money."
76561198004131548,Recommended,402430,22313034,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,slinkytwf,"Having played and been suitably impressed with OOTP 16, I re-signed for another year when I learned that OOTP 17 had negotiated with the MLBPA to use actual names instead of random ones, as well as making other, incremental enhancements. As I'm heading into my sixth OOTP 17 sim-season, I felt it was time to share my thoughts on the game while it's fresh. In general, my thoughts are overwhelming positive. Still, it has some rough edges.Pros:- The big one: ""Is it fun?"" Yes, especially if you're a real fan or a serious nerd. (If you're not, it might be overwhelming.)- Incredible level of depth and detail, with deep financial and roster rules that are there if you want to use them, but that can be turned off or delegated if you don't.- The game engine runs from values that are generated from statistics instead of directly from statistics. This is superior to older stat-based systems as they can be more easily adjusted by the game for stat anomalies. It also allows the system to more easily project career stats forward for players who want to use multi-season fictional leagues based on real players.- The AI plays a pretty good game, both when you're against a sim manager and when you're letting the game auto-play. (Just don't let the AI do too much, or you might come back after a month and find out that you have a totally different team than the one you drafted.)- As a GM, you can delegate almost anything you want to your staff. You can choose your level of micromanagement. However, beware ceding control to the AI...- The ""owner goals"" option allows you to work for a fickle bonehead like George Steinbrenner if you want the challenge. (Just be aware that the AI might ask you to do something that truly is impossible, like most real bosses.)Cons (AKA room for improvement):- Like many niche games, the graphics are functional. They're fine for baseball sim grognards, but they won't win many design awards.- The likelihood of anomalies cropping up seem a little higher than they should be in real life, and some things seem to be impossible (I don't think that a Lou Gehrig or Cal Ripkin could ever make their historical streaks).- The UI could still use some optimization.--- I find myself having to click to transition between screens often, and sometimes, the process involves several screen transitions to move back and forth. I think it either needs more keyboard shortcuts (with mouseover tooltips so you can learn them) or perhaps a user-configurable ""most used"" button bar or something.--- There are a number of terms used in the UI that required googling outside of the online documentation to find the answer.--- It's often difficult to find things when you need them, and (see above) the online manual does not have entries for all the screens/options you might need. The game is complex, so it's not surprising, but it's nonetheless annoying at times.--- It took me about five tries to get my fantasy league set up. Using the wizards provided make it easier to do if you want all the defaults, but some of the options I wanted to use lay in the advanced options, and there was no way to enable them if you used the wizard.- The AI trading algorithm could use some work. I had to disable it and run trades manually because my assistant GM kept trading off my key players for minor league prospects in the middle of the season. I hated to do that, because once or twice it spotted a good roster move that I didn't see, but on balance, the AI trading and free agent hiring did much more harm than good.- The player personality and morale system is not ready for the major leagues yet. Use it at your own risk. When something goes wrong on your team (particularly if you have one or two ""problem"" players, it is **nigh-impossible** to narrow down the cause, and the team morale problems it can cause will snowball rapidly. After four playoff seasons, I had something odd happen in the clubhouse, and I could not narrow down the cause. It destroyed the team and caused me my greatest frustration as a player. Fortunately, you can turn it off. I hope they can work out the kinks, because it's a good idea—just needs some more work."

It's currently on sale for $10 on Steam, and it is by far the most in-depth simulation of baseball management I've ever played. For example... I live in Grand Prairie, Texas, and my local independent-league team (the Texas AirHogs) is in the game. With the real Texas AirHogs roster. And the simulated players play like the real-life players I've seen play in person. That is an unprecedented level of simulation accuracy, and it really shows how much attention to detail these devs have.Speaking of accuracy... I started this year off as the Cubs (because I'm originally from Chicago and they're my team, World Series or not). At the All-Star break, they had the best record in the majors... two games ahead of the Indians. I also managed to best the real-life Cubbies by having not only my 1B/2B/SS/3B/CF/SP starting the All-Star Game... but I also managed to toss in an all-star catcher as well (Montero, who for some reason became an all-world catcher this season in-game). To put an even finer point on the accuracy... my starting infielders of Rizzo, Zobrist, and Bryant were three of the four guys the real-life Cubs sent to the real-life All Star game, the exception being Russell who according to OOTP is now a 4.5-star-rated SS coming off the bench as a pinch hitter (the game has Baez starting at SS instead of Russell). The CF? Fowler. The SP? Arrieta. Just. Like. Real. Life. The only thing not-real-life about this game is Jason Heyward is hitting like a madman (seriously, in one week he had six homers and 17 RBI)... although not for me 'cause I traded him to the Diamondbacks for Zach Grienke (who's 9-3 with a 3.15 ERA, so I can't complain, lol). Basically, my in-game Cubbies are the boss of the league just like real life. (Now watch them lose Game 6 tonight... :\)If you like simulations of this type, this game will absolutely hook you in.

For me, I benefitted from the recent World Series sale with this version and love the new 3D animation. It's a great alternative to the full match commentary and I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy both options.The FaceGen images are remarkable and, although I haven't played long enough to see this yet, the player images apparently ""age"" over multiple seasons.And I haven't even started looking at the historical replay options yet.Recommended"

This will be quite a barrier for a lot of people to get over.  But it is worth it.The game is a winner because of the stories it creates that linger in the mind.I am in the 20th year of my fictional league.   It is bottom of the ninth in the 7th game of the 2036 world series and my team is down by three runs.First up to the plate is my catcher Okuma.  This guy has been a big disappointment.  He was a great player who I signed to a big $ long term deal.  But he has had a bad year - so bad I brought up a minor leaguer at the end of the year to catch.  But I put him into my playoff roster as cover and my manager has decided to use him.  He gets a hit.Next we have Rodriguez.  He is my 'moneyball' guy.  Just great at getting onto base and on minimum wage.  My scouts hate him as does my manager.  But I have forced him to be used as a starter and he has put up great numbers.  He walks.Herrara now comes to the plate.  I picked him up as a throw-in on a big trade many years ago and he has been pretty good (although the guy I traded has been better).  However my owner has set me a goal to get a better centre fielder, so keeping him on is risky.  He gets a walk.Bases loaded and Koot comes up.  This guy is Mr Mediocre. He is only on my playoff roster because I had one space left and could not think of a good reason not to use him.  I have never really paid him much attention - he is one of those guys you have to rest your real players.  Why my manager has put him into the game in the bottom of the 9th is a mystery.  And then he hits a walk off Grand Slam home run to win the World Series.No doubt Mr Koot will soon be playing elsewhere, I will still be annoyed at the money I am wasting on Okuma, I will still be battling my manager to use Rodriguez as a starter, and Herrara will have gone to make my owner happy.But I will remember those guys...It is stories like this that makes this a great game."

I have logged 78 hours into the current iteration so far using my Macbook Pro. The gameplay is as great as ever, the details on par with last year with a few minor upgrades. What really bugs me though are the bugs. I recognize that it is still relatively early as  far as patches go, but so far the game has crashed about six times over the duration of that 78 hour stretch. This is extremely frustrating considering that it takes a long time to load your league back up. There is an auto save feature. You can choose to save daily, once a week (which is my default), once a month, or once a year. The auto save feature is handy, but it too takes a long enough time to be a teadious hassle. This is the third time I have had to go from several regular season games in to restarting spring training all over again in one save file. I should add that this is the first season of the save file, so it isn't as if there are dozens of seasons causing a crash.

They have THAT in the game too?!!?""I have played HH2003 for years and this game beats it hands down.  Sure, the graphics in HH2003 are more realistic but for the true baseball fan, the realism of OOTP 17 cannot be topped.  The 3D stadiums and on field live action representation is great as it pulls you into the game while maintaining all the stats and controls I love.  When the ball leaves the bat and starts heading for deep left center field, I find myself saying aloud, ""Uh, oh!"" if it is the other team batting and ""Get outta here!"" if its mine.  In other baseball simulation games, I have always had to settle for what the game developers thought would be the best way to control your team but that is not the case here.  As an example, I wanted to move one of my MLB players to a minor league assignment and the game said that that player refused the assignment!  At first I thought, it's my team, I should be able to decide where I want my players.  I looked into the online manual and saw that I could turn that option off so I COULD move players to wherever I wanted.  I then began to examine what else I could change and was blown away.  I could be solely the manager, or the general manager or both or neither!  Heck, I can be the comissioner if I want to!  And in any of these roles, I can opt to do everything myself or assign duties to the AI on a case by case basis.  The amount of control you can have over your league is astounding!  Plus, if I start a league and decide that halfway through I want to change something, I can!  No need to restart here, just turn control items on and off at will.My favorite part is the historical leagues.  I started the 1984 season as the Tigers manager and to see all the names of the players really brought me back to my younger years.  The game imported all of their stats from their careers up to the 1984 season and I get to see if MY management techniques are as good (or better) than the legendary Sparky Anderson.  Can I lead this team to a World Series win, or will I fail?  What about in subsequent years?  Who will I play, what players will I choose to promote from the minors, who will I trade for, what will I pay them?  The questions go on and on and I can hardly wait to find out the answers.If you like baseball, this game will deliver.  It has all the realism you could ever want and with the modding community and future updates and releases (OOTP 18 is already on my wishlist), it is sure to be my favorite game for many years to come.

This game has never failed to build off the previous year, and 17 is certainly no exception. The first thing you notice when you open the game is the official MLBPA and MLB licenceing (yes!). Personally, I have been awaiting this feature since I began playing with OOTP 15. The new design is sleek and original. And finally you don't need mods to get the player faces which is definetly a plus. I do wish that generated players had faces as well, but that's obviously a minor thing and definetly doesn't impact gameplay.I've never been one to really watch games often, but the options you have in game are just fine. Sure, I wish there was an option to choose your plan for every pitch and be able to play the game (like most people) but that's not really the point of the game. Playing the games does however give you plenty of control and gives you the feel of being the manager.Where this game really shines as always is the deep variety of options to truly make each league your own. I messed around with a lot of the settings in previous years and have found the formula that works for me. This games mechanics are nearly flawless, the only slight issues being the AI trade proposals (which, as usual, are as dumb as ever that it's impossible to keep them on), and that the game seems to run a tad slower with other programs running on the computer, as opposed to prior years. In addition, injuries seem to occur MUCH more often, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing, especially because you can change those options. A lot more players seem to become ""wrecked"" in comparison to previous games, which can become annoying. However, these problems do not come close to bringing this game down.As usual, the OOTP developers have not tried to reinvent the wheel, which they don't need to. This series has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The official licencing by MLB is no doubt the biggest change and upgrade over last year. For the casual OOTP player who doesn't care too much about updated rosters and the forementioned changes can stick with last year. This game, however, is worth the price, for $10 or $40, as there is endless fun and no micro transactions (please please please don't).My Yankees franchise is 18 years in, and have 4 championships. I know, not great but hopefully many more to come."

I think This is a great game and if it is not rated 10.5 then it is under rated so right now I will get back to my OOTP 17 once I get close to the finish I will post in the forum."

I just expected it to be one of those lame baseball simulation machines that you just played until you were so bored out of your mind that you had to stop playing or else you would go mad. This was certainly not so. The simulation engine is surprisingly realistic, as the results of a simulated season came out quite similar to how the MLB is in real life. Even the breakout players like Vincent Velasquez had a breakout season in the simulation, even though I could not find any major indicators of how this was so. The interest stories in the game make it all the more fun, and the overall control one can have over a team, or a league for that matter, is intxicating. The amount of work put into the game has shown in its quality gameplay, while some games work tirelessly on improving graphics while trying to have the player play a full 9 inning game where the mechanics engine doesn't run realistically, the developers have worked on the actual simulation experience, while working on making the season as realistic as possible. I honestly don't believe that any one person could experience every situation and human interest story possible in the game in even so much as a full 1000 hours of gameplay. This is a franchise that is like good cheese, (and I know what good cheese is like!) it only gets better the older it gets. Also, this is far more enjoyable that any 2K baseball game that I have ever played, although I know that's not really saying much anyways. This is all I can say about this game, that it is well worth your money and countless hours that you will inevitably waste on it as well."

Or sports management games in general since this is the most detailed one I've seen in a long time.  There is a bit of a learning curve if you aren't familiar with in-depth baseball concepts but they do a good job of offering tutorials if you want to look at them.  Overall an exceptional game.

On downside you have to know baseball which i dont. Only basic stat categories and how its played. But for you to truly appreciate achievements of players or teams knowledge is a must. Iz may not be for europeans :)But from management pwrspective its 10/10. Even back stories and news aroud the league are great.Would recommend it.

I've spent so many hours running a fictional baseball universe and keeping up with its stars that I'd have to say this is one of the best games I've ever played. However, there are three suggestions I'd like to make for the next version of the game.1) There should be a better way to find players' statistics, in this version there's no way to get a leaderboard where one can easily toggle between sorting players based on specific statistics without having to return to the career leaderboards screen, which takes some time to load. A nice example of what this could look like can be found on themlb.comstatistics page. This is my biggest issue with the game.2) I think it'd be really cool if the game automatically selected certain pivotal or particulalry impressive moments from games when they were simulated and kept these moments in their own page. For example, walk-off home runs in the postseason or especially amazing catches would be really cool to see when they happened in simulation.3) I also think it'd be cool if there was a page that kept track of players' use of performance-enhancing drugs. I believe that the simulation already hands out suspensions to certain players if they are caught with PEDs but it'd be nice to see all of these infractions in one place, maybe along with the statistics of those who are caught, to determine the effect of their use on certain records. You know, like real life.I think those are all of my issues, but besides these things I really love this game and am 100% glad that I purchased it."

,Recommended,402430,29213960,Posted: 12 January,all,cannibalchef,"I've loved baseball for my whole life, and it seems hard to explain to many in my generation why.  A lot of people think baseball is boring, but more than any other it's the thinking man's sport.  This game focuses on the strategy of it all, the sheer amount of numbers and math is probably more massive than most other sports combined.  I've always felt there's a lot for strategy gamers to like in baseball, and this game scratches that itch better than any other management simulation I can think of.  There are a few interface niggles (some more tooltips on icons, and a few menus are placed in unexpected locations) but overall it's a monumental achievement."

I can't think of anything that you can't simulate in this game.However: If you are just a casual baseball fan and/or not really interested in the management side of the sport, this is not the game for you. For those who don't know, you can't 'play' the game yourself, but you can act as the manager. It's kind of like the Football manager series vs Fifa/pes. I would only say that this game isn't as much build as a 'game' in terms of the presentation, and that can be good or bad depending on what type of player you are."

While it lacks fancy graphics and animations, it more than makes up for it in authenticity and depth. Being a GM in the real world has to be tough, and it is tough here as well. If you are more ""hands on,"" you can manage the entire game, pitch by pitch. Or if you want to just be GM, you can sim a day, week, month, or season. Deal with injuries, free agency, rule 5 draft, morale issues, it has damn near everything. Fire your manager because he hasn't won a game in a month, sign international players, trade, anything else you can think of. If you love baseball, you cant live without this game. No console game has anything on this one."
