,Not Recommended,402450,23288717,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,Sefer SuperiorServers.co,"1 guild, VAN, leader Holya, owns this game basically. He is allowed to have multiple accounts, inactive characters in every major dungeon, they kill you at the end. Some dungeons take 1 hour to complete, others can take 2-3+. The developer is kinda reluctant on fixing things, his last fix he even said ""I knew this wouldn't fix it, but you guys wanted it, so I did it."" He either doesn't know how to stop them from using inactive account scouts, or refuses to do so.I wasted days playing, look at my time, in all that time trying to get stronger, better gear, different strategies...But when it comes down to it, knowing how many enemies are in a dungeon, and when they are at their most vulnerable when the boss spawns... Trumps any preparing you can actually achieve in this game, its like playing rock paper scissors with someone that already knows what your going to throw down before they make their choice.The good dungeons are spied on by this guild. Before you can get real true good gear, artifacts, they kill you and steal the boss from you, getting themselves even stronger gear in the process and preventing you from getting stronger, throwing you back further and losing your already meager items. I swear to you, don't waste your time... I kept trying, again and again, the guild I was in..no matter how many people we brought, how many alliances we made... 165+ kills and only 7 deaths in 3-4 months of playing the game... Deaths always increase, but kills? They only increase for each unique player you kill, repeatedly killing the same if you havent killed 10 new ones wont count for your total kills... His real kill count is easily above 500+, and still only 7 deaths in 3 months. For a very good reason: They cheat. They abuse this exploit and nothing can be done to stop them, the dev even just said ""Multiclients cannot be prevented. We can't do it.""Don't waste your time. You will feel crushed, horribly annoyed,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sad, and in the end theres nothing that can be done, not even the dev can stop it. This game is clearly headed south, its inevitable that it will die. The population is only 50-60 on a good day. Please, save yourself the time, I don't want anyone to have to go through this.. its worse than hackers, atleast hackers get banned, but this? Nothing can be done to stop it. Nothing. 3 months time and very few deaths is proof of that, and back then the population was around 80.Please upvote this to get it on the top, people need to know. They need to be warned. My warning post was removed, but they cant remove this. Help me help others."

Why? An absolute CATASTROPHIC decision was made at the launch of this game on Steam.The server was not wiped/restarted from previous tests and betas. What does this mean? Well, simply put you are already months behind a large player base who are pretty much geared to the max with huge realms/land plots with everything in place.So, once I had completed the noobie areas I left on my venture to improve my skills and explore the game, upon leaving the noobie area I was instantly rooted and two shoted by a veteran player. I ran back to my corpse to collect my items and I was instantly killed on the spot. Fair enough, I left the noob area via a different exit, only to be immediately killed again by a two man squad, again I can only imagine geared to the very max. I stood ZERO chance. This process repeated itself for the next 2hours while I tried to leave the noobie zone and improve my skills.I've given up."

Graphics are arguably better, but fall well short of current standards.  Some item drops don't use a container and can blend in with the terrain.Also remeniscent of early UO, the user-interface is very clunky,   However, it offers no hotbars, requiring keeping open multiple windows to access frquently used items and skills, cluttering the screen.  Comparing item stats is unecessarily challenging, as it only shows stats via mouse hover and not the item currently in use.Performance seems much smoother than UO ever achieved...at least for solo fighting.  However, I noticed other players glitching at times, raising concerns for PvP combat.The one big departure from UO I did not expect was the zoning.  Based on the official descriptions, I was expecting a large open, non-instanced world.  While it isn't instanced, the mostly claustrophobically small zones were a surprise.  Zoning is not seamless and requires finding zone connections that are sometimes very difficult to discern from the terrain.With the game missing on some key ""foundations,"" I have to give it a thumbs down at this time."

I liked some of the features and it looked nice but the dev team has announced they will not be developing the game any more. You can still play it if you like but I would not recomend it anymore.

Most of the time I don't care about this stuff but it really seems to be a issue with the rest of the community.After many many hours of leveling skills and playing it seems that there really is nobody around the the game. Just over 30 people most of the time. And with the dev doing nothing about  the people that are already fully geared multi account ghosting dungeon bosses, don't plan on catching up to them ever.I know most of the people downvote the posts that cry about others taking there boss kills. But it is a real issue when you can't do ONE dungeon at any time of the day. and there is not enough people to do anything about it or get organized. i know this review is the same as most others but just goes to show you it is ture and needs to be addressed.Playing a archer is the only way to go atm its the current meta casters and melle are gimped. it laggy and choppy for melle since the movement seems laggy pulling you back to the square you just left, plus a archer would just kill you before you can get to him. caster stands no chance against them also. grab a bow or go home!I hear the dev team likes to delete posts like this on there forum's and block the fact that they wont fix this issues. kinda saddens me cause i want it to be good........ but its just not.  hope you like it more than i did.as a added note being able to bless all your items to prevent drop on death is horrible... period.----a let down ultima online fan.----"

,Recommended,402450,23104693,"Posted: 20 May, 2016",all,Axident,"TLDR; Graphics dated but effective 8/10, Sound is solid but repetitive 7/10, UI does its job but has room for improvement 6/10, PVE Gameplay lots to do and work towards 9/10, PVP Gameplay in its current state 6/10 (read third last paragraph for current issues in PVP).Linkrealms is essentially a re-imagined version of Ultima Online.  Having played UO years ago I was already somewhat familiar with the basic mechanics of this game but I will attempt to give a fair review from both sides of fence (UO Veteran & Never played UO).The graphics are simple but vibrant compared to its UO counterpart.  Don't expect next gen diablo styled graphics.  Animations are smooth and generally well done.  Graphics are not a primary selling feature for games of this genre so as long as the graphics do not interfere with gameplay, which they do not, then it's a pretty easy bar to get over.The sound is solid all around.  Sound effects have good weight to them, the ambience is nice (having a separate volume slider for ambience would be appreciated though), and music does it's job of setting the general tone but is average and repetitive.  In a game like this that has a lot of grinding involved in it even the best music will get repetitive unfortunately.The interface is modern but still retains some of the classic UO charm with its inventory system.  Most things can be moved around to suit your personal preference.  I feel like the interface is still a work in progress and hopefully it will be even more polished in the upcoming months/years.The gameplay is what a classic UO player might expect with some reservations however.  Basically you create a character and the skills you're using improve as you use them.  There is a skill cap currently of 700 which means you could max out a total of 7 skills.  One major change to skill caps in Linkrealms is that your crafting skills DO NOT count towards your global 700 points.  If you change your mind it is easy to set a skill to drop and start working on something in its place so you are never really locked into your characters build.  Stats (STR, AGI, WIS, INT) will raise with relevant skill usages and also have a cap of 275 total points & 125 points per single stat so you will need to balance these out as well.I personally play on the PVE server because I do not like having the hours of work I put into getting a good weapon/armor wasted because someone ganked me.  From the various materials I have looked at (YouTube, Forum Posts) there seems to be some glaring issues with PVP in the game's current state.  Some of the major ones that were mentioned are: 1. Healing items have a short cooldown while fully & instantly heal making all the arrows/mana you just dumped into an enemy completely wasted. 2. There are no really effective methods of crowd control meaning your enemy can simply run away with no fear of dieing.  3.  When both players have maxed combat stats/skills there are way too many misses happening.  4.  Some veteran players preying on new players making it very difficult to get anywhere beyond the training areas.Overall impressions for me are that this game has a lot of potential and despite the issues others may have with the current state of PVP none of these issues seem to me like they are unrepairable via future patches.  So in my personal opinion I feel that this game has a variety of content for all types of players with even more planned for the future.  However if you are after a true PVP experience on day one then you may want to hold off for the time being until some of these PVP issues have been properly addressed.  If you are a PVE styled player or don't mind/have patience with the current list of PVP related issues then I feel this game is something that could keep you entertained for years to come.If you are willing to grow alongside this game and have a bit of patience while they work on correcting some of the issues I feel like this game will be a real treat and stand out as unique title that few others today will be able to compete with.  The future looks very bright for Linkrealms and I for one am excited to be on the journey with them.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and if it was helpful give it the mark you feel it deserved!"

And everything that comes with it, the dev team is working hard to bring balance and content to the game. I fully support them and expect this game to be great in the future.You have to be able to handle dying and losing stuff, if you can't you won't have fun. Please don't start the game, get killed, and leave a negative review because your feelings got hurt. This isn't an easy game, but it's what some people want. Don't kill it for everyone because you weren't happy.TIP, there is a safe server where 90% of the world is pvp free, this isn't just a PK world."

Character skill customization is a huge thing for me when deciding to play games.  This game definitely delivers on that aspect.  PvP, PvE, and player housing combine to make this game great for all types of players.  The casual and hardcore players both can find numerous things to do.  Prometheus and the dev team are constantly looking for ways to improve the game and player experience.  When you want to relax, you can gather materials for ""Working"" skills and when you want that adrenaline rush, you can run dungeons with the threat of PvP.  Highly recommended!"

It's definitely what you would call 'early access', as it has a long ways to go before being ready for a real release, but if you enjoyed the UO:T2A era, it's worth giving this game a shot.They have an active developer on the forums who answers questions, and tries to be as helpful as possible. Patches seem to come pretty regularly, and they're aiming in the right direction. Only time will tell. Overall i'd definitely say the game is worth a try. They have both PvE and PvP servers, although PvP is definitely where it's at.Expect to die. It will happen. You will lose items, but they can be easily replaced. The housing system (realms) are awesome. A lot of promising features in the works as well.The only thing this game is lacking is a larger/better community. So if you like old school PvP - let's go."

I tried it because I was nostalgic about my years with UO Online.Now ...  I had some basic knowledge of the mechanics of the game from my experiences with UO and other video games.  I am also more patient than I was 15 years ago.I am enjoying building characters and skills.  Much of what UO never got right, Linkrealms has.  LR Is soooooo much better in many ways, as an early access beta, than UO was in it's first 10 years.Graphics are good for this type of game.  The depth and posibilities for different builds is nice.  This last patch with the magery changes looks awesome!I like that I am not burning skill points on crafter skills.  That was the thing I hated the most about the UO crafting system.The potential this title has, in my mind, is off the charts.  The Devs are involved in the forums and appear to be active in moving the game forward.One big complaint I have is the controls.  I would really like to see the ability to create an icon on the screen that activates skills.  I am not a fan of hot keys.  With hot keys, if you switch characters, you have to try to remember a different set of hotkeys.  It would be very helpful, especially for a magic user, to be able to put up icons for spells and skills that are used most frequently.As it stands, this is a bare bones game that plays well and has few problems in it's current state.  I am excited to see where LR goes from here.One last thing.  To some extent this may be a niche game, however, as big as the industry is, even dated games like UO are succesful.I would recommend this game to others.  It has sucked me in and I am enjoying it!"

The game has very solid UO roots so any die hard UO veteran will love to get his or her hands on this game.From what I have heard about the game is it has more PvP then PvE, like the drop items on death time of PvP that I usually strickly avoid, but then they came out with a PvE server with some PvP so I decided to play there instead of the full blown PvP server. There are to many other full blown PvP games that this one has to condent with like Albion Onliline, Crowfall, Camelot Unchained, Etc.I streamed the game for about5 hourstoday, there were a about 8 people watching and 1 veteran that answered a few of my questions that I had about the game."

Probably like a lot of other people here I decided to dig into Linkrealms because of how much I loved UO back in the day. Linkrealms feels just enough like UO to make it comfortable for anyone who used to play UO but remains different enough to offer a new game experience which to tell you the truth is something I really enjoy. The gameplay itself is fun, and I'm really digging the UO styled skills based system where I can infinitely tinker with different character builds all the time. There aren’t many games I’ll buy into that are advertised as early access but I gave Linkrealms a shot and I don’t regret it.As far as the game being early access well, it is what it is. Linkrealms is a work in progress and if you come into the game with reasonable expectations about what that means then you won’t be disappointed. New pieces of the game are implemented fairly regularly and that's a big deal to me with an early access game -that they are making regular progress toward finishin the game. Linkrealms is not some unfinished money-grab that’s going to evaporate in a few months, and honestly- even with a few things still un-implemented  as of yet, Linkrealms gives you plenty to do (player housing, farming, dungeons, pvp, etc…) just like you’d expect out of a real sandbox style mmo."

Also, devs seem to care about the community feedbacks and keep fixing things or implementing stuff, like criminal system for some sort of punishment if people's lust for young blood gets too intense.Newbie tip: if you usually play alone, stash your loot, make armor and weapon backups and play smart if you delve outside the safe zone and you should be fine eventually :D Train tailoring, cooking and as much tradeskills you can to become self-sufficient.Since I'm a die-hard UO and EVE online fan, I strongly recommend anyone with similar gaming requirements to get this game yesterday. :)"

Well you know what?  Welcome to the game.  This game isn't here to make you kill 10 rats until you are level 100.  This game puts you in an extremely challenging environment that is kill-or-be-killed.  Of course you won't be able to stand a chance against someone who put hours into this game.This game does NOT pretend to be a theme park MMO, nor does it claim to be perfect.Let me tell you, finding a dungeon by exploring, clearing the boss after having to FIGURE OUT THE DUNGEON on my own, and looting a small piece of helpful gear was one of the most refreshing experiences in my life.  Was there a quest to tell me how to get there?  No.  Was there a mini map that just gave everything away?  No.  I found it.  I made it my own quest.   And it was wonderful to experince that sense of exploration again.Is the combat sometimes clunky and isometric an old-school way to play?  Yes.  Well you know what?  If you learn how to play, the combat isn't as terrible as you think.They are also one of the few Greenlight beta games that won't be wiping 30 times before launch.Crafting, while still simple, is also exciting.  Open world farming and the ability to create your own plot of land (or ""realm"") is great.What I do NOT like is the fact that each area is subsectioned off into these realms I spoke of earlier.  The awkward wait to get between areas is kind of weird.  I'm hoping that can change in the future if this game does well enough.  I don't see any problem with one full merge.  This game would earn major points.Leveling in this game is VERY similar to Ultima Online.  You don't have this omnious ""Experience Bar"" that grants you an onminous ""level"".  What does that even mean?  I hate how MMOs have that.This game is skill-progression based with no glorified endgame.  You can be exactly the character(s) you want to be.Full loot is on spot.  There is even a great rival guild in the game that people try to target because of how evil they act in game.This game needs to be given credit where credit is due.  They are NOT budging in terms of P2W cash shops and the creators of the game are ACTIVE on the fourms.  Do you realize how HUGE that is?Games with amazing potential out there sell out to the few who complain.  This game, while small, stays true.Yes there are clunky bugs, but that's what this game needs you for.  Build a community, tell them about the bugs.  I recall a problem being brought up last week and it was resolved in 6 days in a patch.  That's amazing considering this is run by a group of 3 people.Do I recommend this game?  Well, are you a pushover themepark MMO player who gets offended if everything isn't handed to you on a flying mount?  Then no.  Go grind a quest or something until your useless expansion comes out, making all of your crap worthless.Do you want to build community, experience the thrill of full-loot PVP and skill based progression, ready to LEARN a game that actually has mystery behind each and every realm?Then sure.But please, don't listen to these people who drop $15 expecting World of Warcraft 2 and getting a decent piece of potential.  They are toxic and are not meant for this game in the first place."

I LOVE the idea, the videos look great, but its not really playable for someone without perfect eyesite.I played for less than an hour and I got a headache. The bags are too small, items are hard to see, text is hard to read, spell books and quests are ungodly small. Even the text over players heads is painful as they pick colors that blend in with the ground.I am still excited for the game, but I would suggest you hold off for a bit as its simply not ready. I will update review in the future if the UI becomes more usable.I will say I am playing Shards Online as well and I love it. The devs should 100% look at the lessons from shards online of how to handle the UO game interface.  Even something as simple as a +/- button to enlarge the bags.Also, what is up with no toolbars? Why do I have to go map keys to things?

However, the game is absolutely full of dumb mechanics/exploits advanced players in top factions heavily abuse, or benafit from still, even if they were fixed. Things like blinking through walls/roofs at certain angles, duplicating items, skipping phases in dungeons, duplicating currency, getting a MUCH large view distance in PVP, adding permanent +elemental damage of every kind to any weapon(more than doubles DPS, admins don't even seem to know it exists). Trust me, I could go on forever, this isn't a tenth of it.Nearly impossible to die in PVPMost people who play have no idea what they're doing, and tend to die at the drop of a hat due to low endurance/resistances, but somebody building their character correctly should be practically invincible vs. 2+ enemies in perfect gear. Across all of my characters I have at least 2.5k murders, and I've died 12 times. 2.5k-12 looks bad at the face of it, but I'd add if the deaths from bugs/kernal errors/DDoS were excluded, every single death I've recieved would've been avoidable. With full endurance, even half recent resistances, and blink you should never die if all you're trying to do is escape, or the fight has less than 3 enemies.Incredibly imbalanced PVPI honestly don't know how to quickly summerize how bad it is. I've beaten the developers in every duel, come first in every player/admin hosted tourny, have the best KDA, have the most kills and most of the people in my clan have similar stats. I tought one of us new recruits with less than 10 hours played how to counter conjuration mage on his severer, had him fight me naked and I simply could not beat him. In an enclosed space I couldn't even survive. PVP is broken, and if you don't have good ping the broken builds aren't even playable. That said, this issue is very much a high end one. The average player really shouldn't be concerned about balance, as you'll most likely win/lose based on gear/numbers for a very long time.Pay to winThe game economy relies on people spending real life money on repair kits, claim stakes, and portals to be sold to the average player. Putting aside the fact a player can simply spend $200 and be showered in gear in exchange for the items be bought, the main pay to win items are claim stakes and portals. My guild controlls around 70% of the volcanic area, or ""PVP zone"" via claiming with claim stakes. Controlling land means you, or your allies can teleport to/from it, making it EXCEPTIONALLY easy to gank people nearby your realms, and every realm that doesn't directly have a dungeon on it is claimable.Next, portals. You can use them in combat. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, especially when top factions control 95% of the world, and you can effectively farm anything without move more than one plot length away from your realm. Portals were like 60USD each when I started, but I think they were recently made cheaper.Inconsistent/poor moderationI've had friends permanently banned for ""using alts to scout"" when I know they were camping dungeons on characters they intended to use for PVP, just because they weren't well geared/risking a lot on death, something the developers have time and again said is not against the rules. On the other hand, I've exploited every bug I could find, ruined the game econemy with dupes, botted, scouted on 20+ accounts at a time, and never received anything more than a slap on the wrist. The largest punishment I've had was for having an offensive guild name(Pedos Anon). Off of the top of my head I could name 5+ other guilds with similarly offensive names, none of which have been warned. Who is, and is not punished has typically been, in my opinion, based on who the commuity complained about the most, of how publically the exploit/rule they were breaking was.Additionally, I'd point out the fastest way to gear a character early on, when artifacts were better was to crash the server, then claim a bunch of items got rolled back. I don't know how to intentionally crash the server anymore, but I know for sure it's still a firly common thing for admins to give out items to player who did not earn them. They've somewhat recently introdced a new system to track items in order to avoid this, but I know several players have already received items they did not earn, or hidden items from the admins they were suppose to be deleted.I say this with sincere respect for the developers/admins, I don't think they were malicious at any point, just inexperienced and made a lot of mistakes.Low populationThe world is fairly small, and honestly only needs 30-50 players in order to feel very alive. I've seen the servers with well over 150, but after the developers announced they're going to be predominately dropping Linkrealms for other projects, the population has not gone above 12 on the PVP server, and has usually been 0 as of late.For the most part, it's my opinion Linkrealms is a fairly good game, especially since there isn't much competition in the genre. At points its review score on steam has been positive, or very positive. I'm really sad to see this game in its current state. Considering the low number of people required to fill one server it's not unthinkable that one day it'll have a large enough population to be playable again, but it seems doubtful.If you have any specific questions feel free to reply, and I'd be very happy to give detailed explinations for anything."

Hey sorry for a negative on it but others should know the state the game is in at this time, fix the problems and I'll change my review as I'm sure others would also."

,Not Recommended,402450,23425124,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,poquinho,"TL:DR This game at the moment feels amateur. Fun at first but not worth yet investing time: It's shallow for a 7 years old game and if they manage to do what they shared so ffar it will be a poor man's UO.Linkrealms got me by presenting itself as an Ultima Online successor, at first it's a fun experience filled with nostalgia, the graphics are not that polished but good enough, the movement and gameplay are clunky but enjoyable.The game has a solid foundation, the idea of a small map filled with both static and random points of interest where the players have to fight for in order to acquire gear and items is good, but badly executed. And this is where things start to go south.Teleport is restricted to friendly realms, and players can get some of the rare realms around the previous mentioned points of interests, this create a monopoly of the teleporting network by the older/geared players that can raid your progress making extremely hard for a new player.The skill based construction of the character does not work due the lack of skills and the little interactions between them. Many are unbalanced or not implemented.Even if more skills are added it will be hard to get of that hole, due some of the core mechanics being seemly not well thought, like the healing system or the redundancy of spells.Despite being in early access the game is in beta since 2009, the dev team tries but fails to deliver feedbacks or transparency about what is coming and the speed, making hard to believe in the project.The population now (6/6/16) is around 30 players, where at least half is afk leveling. That's 10% of a UO free shard that has tons of content compared to Linkrealms.I really hope they pull things together or receive a huge investment making possible this game. But for now, it's not worth."

The game isnt for everyone and If you cant get over losing your gear, then it is absolutely not for you. If youre into that oldschool Ultima feel then definately pick this game up. The PvE is great, and the PvP is pretty cool too. During my time Ive seen a pile of competition between guilds and the shared dungeons makes you think twice and prepare before adventuring out. Its a good game that deserves a fair chance."

It's in Early Access currently, but that shouldn't scare you off. I've kept myself away from Early Access games over the years, and I'm glad I gave this one a shot. I really hope that the devs keep on top of things to bring a lot more content to the table before the game is in full release. If you've ever played UO or Runescape, you'll feel more or less right at home with what's here so far. This isn't meant to really be a review of any sort, more just one persons opinion. I like it so far, and I can say yes, I recommend this."

It is early access and stuff will be broken. If you played UO and have been looking for something along those lines then Linkrealms is for you. For me it does a good job of recreating the feeling of the UO time. If you like being handed things on a plate then this game might not be for you. I would say dont let the bad reviews choose for you. Linkrealms will be free to play on release. If you buy now you are buying to test the game. There will apparently not be a wipe during the transition from early access to release.I will be streaming this quite regularly.https://www.twitch.tv/the_tartan_terrorI also have videos on youtube from the beta,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNQSi26onFmjgQ05hlEvYw."

The way they got the hud set up it is of no help for people starting out. The basics like using a skill like spell casting is not documented in game and you got to jump thrue so many hoops just to get things set up to works so you can at least try the game. And then when you do get it going its a laggy bug filled mess and no clear way to go. the dificulty ramps up to fast so stuck in one area grinding with a slow moving reaction time. Its literaly so slow in combat on your side you can die just walking to another map and be jumped by 4 monsters. By the time you see them you can be dead. Best to leave these type of so called old school games in the dustbin since the devs don't realy care about the player base or even getting the basic controls down.
