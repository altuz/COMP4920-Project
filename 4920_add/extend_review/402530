,Recommended,402530,24265395,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Dr. Mircow,"The Last Door: Season 2 is an episodic story-driven point-and-click adventure game developed and published by The Game Kitchen consisting of four new episodes and a continuation from where the last game (season) left off, albeit from a different character’s perspective.In this season, the story follows John Wakefield, the former psychiatrist of Jeremiah Devitt (protagonist from Season 1), in search for Devitt after his sudden disappearance in the previous game. Along his journey, Wakefield is accompanied by his close associate, Herr Doctor Johann Kaufmann, an unfathomable German nobleman who displays a high level of expertise in the understanding of the dark forces that affected Devitt and who aided Wakefield in investigating Devitt's condition previously. Both of these characters play similar roles to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson; Wakefield is the type of character who asks the questions and Kaufmann is the one providing the answers, except in a more cryptic manner. An issue in the previous game was the lack of memorable characters, and it is safe to say that that is not the case here. The story provides quite a few twists and turns, easily making it one of the main reasons to complete The Last Door: Season 2. It even has two endings which can be triggered by the player’s choice in the last scene. Regardless of the choice, both endings provide a suitable closure to The Last Door saga.Much like the first game, The Last Door: Season 2 uses the same pixel art for its aesthetics which is simple but surprisingly effective, making it tough to criticise it for as it does not ruin the experience in any way; the pixel hunting (another issue in the first game) has been solved this time with items which look brighter and are easier to spot in the background. On a side by side comparison, the graphics do look polished up compared to the previous game whilst still remaining faithful to the series’ unique visuals. Lighting effects seem to have improved as well. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that its visual presentation might not conform with everyone’s tastes, much like the lack of voice acting. Moreover, both the sound design and soundtrack are well implemented in the world of The Last Door and do their job enough to create a similar atmosphere found in the first game, although, in terms of ambience, it does have some moments where nothing is played in the background which is a bit of a letdown.The gameplay remains more or less the same as in Season 1; thus, expect your typical point ‘n’ click affair where you move the character around different locations whilst collecting items, occasionally combining, and using them to solve puzzles to advance the story. Just like the first game, many areas at the start of an episode are locked, but these can be unlocked by finding keys or using specific items. One notable (and welcomed) addition in Season 2 is the world map which gives the player more locations to explore in a non-linear fashion, to an extent, rather than being restricted to one single map as in the previous season. This helps giving the game a tad more feeling of exploration and variety. The feeling of any backtracking becoming tedious is absent thanks to the small size of the maps and the quick travel mechanic which immediately transports you to the next scene.Once again, the puzzle solving is very easy and fairly logical, making it suitable to newcomers to the point ‘n’ click genre. Veterans of the genre will undoubtedly find it very easy though. There is hardly a need of checking a walkthrough at any given point, except maybe of a specific maze-like puzzle which honestly should not take too long to figure it out after some attempts. On the other hand, the advantage of these easy puzzles is that the pace of the story remains consistent without ending up meandering around, frustratingly looking for clues on how to solve a puzzle. The most noticeable improvement between the two seasons is that the variety of puzzles has visibly increased. As a result, Season 2 is longer in length, with around 6-hours to complete it compared to the roughly 4-hours in Season 1.The Last Door series is well known for its emphasis on tense Lovecraftian horror and disturbing atmosphere, and Season 2 follows the same trend established by Season 1. However, having played the first game, it is hard not to notice how the creepiness was toned down in exchange for, arguably, superior storytelling this time around. Season 2 definitely feels a lot more focused on filling all those gaps left in the story from Season 1 as much as possible, as there are only a handful of scenes as spine-chilling as in the first game throughout the first three episodes. Thankfully, for those who loved the atmosphere of the first game, the last episode is a return to that specific atmosphere fans were accustomed. To provide some context, in the first game there were many moments where certain “supernatural” events would catch you off guard from time to time and created this tense, scary atmosphere as you did not know why those events were occurring initially. There was always a sense of mystery and intrigue. Furthermore, the use of imagery and disturbing backgrounds were also key to their effectiveness. In Season 2, as the story advances, you progressively get to discover, little by little, why these, although not all, events occurred and who is behind them which eventually becomes less terrifying the more you find out. The point I am trying to make is that, personally, I did not feel creeped out by Season 2 as much as I did in the first game which, for me, is somewhat disappointing since that is one of things I hoped the sequel would keep and even improve upon. However, in the end, I strongly feel that Season 2 is superior to the first season as a whole experience due to the small improvements made, here and there, and the better storytelling despite the toned down atmosphere. Do not get me wrong, it still has its petrifying moments, like the ending of the second episode.In conclusion, The Last Door: Season 2 might lack the overall eeriness of the first game, but it compensates in polished up gameplay, crispier visuals, better variety of puzzles and superior storytelling that provides a satisfactory conclusion to The Last Door saga. Probably not as memorable as the first game, but definitely better as a whole package. Highly recommended to folks who finished the first game, any point 'n' click fans, and those who like Lovecraftian horror stories in general. If you are entirely new to this series, do yourself a favour and grab The Last Door bundle and enjoy the ride."

Instead of playing as Devitt, you now play as his former psychiatrist, Dr Wakefield. In four episodes, the game tells the story of Wakefield searching for Devitt across four different locations. It is during these episodes that you learn about what happened prior to the events of season one -- although most of the flashbacks are only in the final episode.IF you thought that season one was too short, you're going to be happy that they fixed that in season two. In season one, you would just stick to one place in season one in every episode. In season two, you can travel to SEVERAL locations on a map in every episode (except for the last one, but given the plot at that time, it's probably best not to go anywhere).It's been developed by the same group of people and their formula of an amazing season one has been reused in season two. Music is atmospheric and beautiful (as expected) and fits perfectly within the game. Graphics still pixelated but the development team seems to have hit the nail on the head again. The game looks wonderful in general (if you can look past the fact that everything's pixelated) but compared to season one, everything somehow seems prettier. They haven't changed anything important about gameplay (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) but they have added some interesting features, like puzzles.In short, the game has the same feel to it as season one but the dev team managed to make it more than just a sequel.Although it will probably not be as well-known as season one (I only found this game by sheer coincidence), it's still an incredibly well-made game and if you're into the genre, this game is a must-have.Pros:- Additional features compared to s1- Astonishing graphics- Fantastic music- Good continuation of storyCons:- Few bugsRating: Solid 9.5/10 - get it whenever you can.(Sidenote: I made a guide! It's a walkthrough to the game and contains achievements as well. If you're ever lost, you can take a quick look at it.)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604795925"

It is rare that I decide to write a review of a game, but in the case of The Last Door Season 2, I am pleased to make an exception to this policy.  I do not speak idly when I say that this is one of the best games I have played in the last few years.  Certainly the graphical style is not to everyone's taste, but I found that it fit the game in a way I cannot quite describe.  Yet I fear I am rambling, so allow me to lay out, in a concise a manner as possible, why I liked this game.  It is of course, not completely without flaws, such as the occasional moment where the game behaved strangely when I was picking up objects (such as the umbrella in Episode 3), but these are the pettiest of quibbles.I. The atmosphere.  This game has a superb atmosphere and sense of place that draws the player into the world and the story. It builds suspense, and manages to be unnerving with a graphical style that I am afraid to admit I initially sneered at.II. The story. Naturally, one should play Season 1 before Season 2, in order to experience the story.  It is taught, well crafted, and creates a fascinating world and lore all its own.  It is perhaps the best Lovecraftian I have ever seen in a game (and that includes the vaunted Bloodborne).III. The music.  The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have ever heard.  While, as with all things, this is a manner of taste, I found the music to be excellently composed, and to fit the mood of the game to a T.In conclusion, to anyone who enjoys Point & Click Adventures, horror games, H.P. Lovecraft, or even classical music, I must recommend this game.   During a time where Steam is increasinly deluged by blindingly unoriginal two bit horror games, it is a joy to see something like this."

(Only Ken plays it) But I'm sure, that this game would be one of the best pixelated-horror experiences you ever play. Definitely worth it. The graphics are intentionally bad, but that's what makes the game so good. Limited vision is one of the best mechanics in pixelated-horror games because as you can't see what is it, you get freaked out. The music is also spectacular and it really sets the mood of the scenario (Though it will be better to reuse some of the pieces from season 1? So to get some nostalgia kicking  in?) And most importantly, Story. It is what drives Wakefield deeper into the mystery; It is what makes Wakefield's motive of keenly investigating such a case; and It is why you should play this. Definitely worth it. Really want to see Markiplier playing it.(And it would be better to release a Mac version as well in the future)(EDIT: 29 Mar 2016. Mac version is released. Very appreciated.

As before, the resolution is so inhumanly low it must lie at the bottom of some unfathomable Stygian pit, reveling in the gelid touch of the rugose abominations that squirm so thickly about it, biding its time, occasionally emitting a liquid chortle . . . Even with pixels so few and -- dare I utter it --cyclopean, it's an evocative style that tells us all we need to know and more; a fuller glimpse, after all, might send our fragile psyches reeling into the oblivion of existential madness!  Having subjected my own frail mind toSeason 2, I am compelled to step back and marvel at the heights that can be reached by willfully plummeting into the jagged depths of low fidelity.  The retro experimentation must continue!I was very surprised at some of the twists the story took, but very pleased to be so, as it never lost the low, infernal thrum of Lovecraftian horror:  a mode in which suggestion and slowly layered atmosphere predominate over messy vivisection.  Thankfully, the English localization has vastly improved over the first half, leaving us to sort out this dense and intelligent weird tale without the added stumbling block of ""accented English.""  The puzzles are slightly more complex than in the first season, but never veer far from the easy side of the scale.  It's more about the experience -- the sense of tense exploration and dreaded discovery -- rather than the challenge, anyway.An excellent achievement in both low-fi artwork and interactive Lovecraftianism!  An absolute must-play (after you've gone throughSeason 1, of course)!"

I really want the people who created this to create more such games.I will not try to express everything I feel about this game, just will say, that this game is in my personal top 5 above hundreds of games I played so far. The second part became more ""quest"" then the first was, so here it will be more walking-clicking, then it was in the first part. That is the only disadvantage this game had for me (I hate point-and click quests). Also it slows the game - I spent two-three times more time on this part then on first, while the amount of events was pretty the same. Yet the story made me forget it all, and play it to the end. Also I want to mention sound and music - they are fantastic!So, conclusion. This game recives 194/10 from me.

I agreed with this and Season 2 is no different.  The themes are clearly Lovecraftian and even as a story driven point and click game, it offers enough of a challenge and some great secrets to make it more than just a ""click here to progress"" adventure game.Like Season 1, Season 2 is not ""terrifying"", but it has that feeling of dread and the score really adds to the tension.  Over the course of the episodes you can feel it all building up.  The graphics are the definition of pixel art, but it''s actually a beautiful game with some amazing locations and cutscenes on offer.  Though this means that some objects are still difficult to locate as they blend in with the background a little too well.  Fortunately these moments didn't become frustrating.So it's a fantastic entry in the series, with a really interesting story that warrants more than one playthrough.

Somehow the developers achieved the near-impossible job of explaining what happened while keeping everything as interesting and scary as in the first season.Personally, I liked Season 2 even better because, for me, the story was more emotionally engaging. Season 1 was interesting, but in Season 2 I was actually worried about the good doctor and wished for his success (whatever that means). There was a point in the game where I was devastated.Except for a few insignificant bugs, the whole game is excellent in every way--the story, music and atmosphere, and puzzles.

Without spoiling too much, you play an acquaintance of the protagonist from the first season following a trail of clues to unravel the mystery of the Veil.TLD season 2 features the same level of graphics, low difficulty, and cryptic story as the first season along with a few spooks here and there and wraps the whole thing up within about 5 hours of gameplay. If you’re considering this game it means you’ve probably played the first one and want some closer.As for the entire series, recommending it is tricky since it’s really story-heavy and not particularly challenging at all, though the same could probably be said of telltale games’ point and click adventures so I guess you could say this one is par for the course.

If you're looking for Lovecraft, Edgar Poe or Kafka-type unease, madness and horror, look no further than The Last Door. And play both seasons chronologically.Season 2 seems to be a definite finale to the storyline that began in Season 1 (of course, with possible new games set in the same universe) and answers all the questions that needed answers, without ruining the unspeakbleness of horrors you encounter, leaving them still beyond your understanding. The story feels trailing off guidelessly at times, unlike Season 1, where it always felt like it was more bits of the same story. But it's still interesting, told in a great way that mixes story and puzzle bits without breaking the pace all that much. There are few moments where I felt that I was starting to wonder aimlessly not noticing a necessary item/dialogue trigger to move the game forward, but those moments were rare and didn't ruin the experience in any way. There were also several simple non-game-breaking bugs that will probably get fixed soon. With only big complaint remaining from the previous Season - that you can't really skip scenes if you're replaying the episode and want to find something you might've missed or just to re-experience specific moments. Still, amazing atmospheric horror story game."

And I never thought a pixel game could be that terrifying.Best of all is that this is arguably one of the most Lovecraftian games I've ever played (faithful if you will, even if the lore is completely different).

That ending coukld have been♥♥♥♥♥♥in any other episode and it would have been as meh as it is now.Apart from that, the Spanish version of the game (native language of the developers) contains a lot of grammar and sintax mistakes that make the game less immersive and really ruin the experience.Finally, Episode 2 was way too long and tedious.

Mysterious, diversified, everything was good.Episode two felt somehow less enjoyable on the overall but still awesome.Episode three was a bit of an anomaly here. Not really following episode two, not really necessary to get before the last episode.It was strange, but not the same way as the others, it was disconnected. It is good as its own story but doesn't really fit.The last episode is the best thing that could have happenned to The Last Door.A real ending, the real world losing itself in the long lost realm, sought by the characters since the beginning.And I spoil nothing.Maybe too much linear, as you can see immediately that you are carried by the story.The amount of puzzles, some not really interesting ( the fog returns... damn ), is maybe too much.But I cannot say anything of a story that ends the best manner it could have ended.The game is more dynamic, with new mechanics ( a map with several locations ), and new background and foreground managment.Carlos Viola's music is still present and it serves the ambient, and as we go through the game, the story, so well it transported me perhaps more than in the first season. I have no words to describe it in a better manner.Everything is different but, in a way, it feels just the same.Season Two brings indeed a great sequel to a great game, and a great closure to a great story.The Red Curtains just fell on The Last Door.And all my wishes of success goes to The Game Kitchen."

The story is still extremely convoluted, with seemingly entire parts of it missing and it might take a while to wrap your head around it all. But that doesn't mean that Season 2 isn't good. Some technical glitches and minor annoyances asside, Season 2 continues a story inspired by the greats and serves that purpos brilliantly. It's amusing, creative and intriguing almost all of the time. It's not one of those sequels that improve everything, but hey - how many of those are around anyway?

The episodes are longer and very generously fleshed out. The main character is now Dr. Wakefield, which, in my view, helped a lot with the story pacing, which is now much more straightforward and less cryptic (for the fans of ambiguity, fear not, there's still a whole lot of it). The first three episodes of S2 are extremely well done, adding map travel and a micronarrative element to the already very atmospheric environments of the first game. The last episode follows the classic format, tying the story together nicely.While the pixelated look remains, the mechanics were improved and both movement and text skipping feels less sluggish. Most puzzles are more straightforward while still being fun to solve (except one or two occasions where you're just expected to stumble upon some seemingly random location before proceeding).If you enjoyed Last Door: Season One, even if you don't praise it as highly as other reviews, definitely don't forget about Season Two: it's more than a worthy sequel."

,Recommended,402530,28776492,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,TheDContinuum,"Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed Season 1 of this creepy suspense macabre point-and-click adventure game. I was mad about it ending a cliffhanger, but what can you do. This season brings the finale of the story, and...well, it's an ending at least. Season 1 was about unraveling a mystery through the main character of Devitt, and this season you play as his doctor, Wakefield, trying to track him down. There should have been a lot more explanations as we drew closer to the ending, but it was one big ""Mystery Box"", with more and more mysteries and very little answers. They kept introducing new lore even in the final chapter and gave only the briefest few lines to explain what had actually happened over eight full chapters of the game. The result was that, when I watched the recaps from previous episodes, they were mentioning plot points that were never outright revealed, but that the devs had assumed they had made clear, but I had just played that chapter and my conclusions about what had happened during the very abstract, surreal or just not obvious actions in the story were VERY different from the recap. ""What? That was all a dream? Where did it say that?"" or ""Wait, the townsfolk were doing what?"" There was so much cool stuff going on, but so much of it just got shoved into too late in the story.Pros:+ The music is FANTASTIC. Also good sound design despite it not having any voice acting. Creepy singing, screams, squeaks...great atmosphere.+ Great art. It's pixel graphics, but it's well done. The lack of detail makes your mind fill in the blanks. Can be either beautiful or downright creepy, or both.Neutral:~ Some episodes had great puzzles. Others had very abstract ones, where you had to do things that made no sense just to trigger the next area/event.Cons:- Story was meh (see above). Too much buildup without enough satisfying explanation.Overall: If you liked the first season, it's probably worth it to buy it, if only to finish off the story. Or if you like semi-unresolved mysteries, this one also fits the bill. Or if you just like macabre point-and-click adventure games. 7/10"

Hats off to the writers, devs and community of fans who made this little puzzle gem possible! Particular kudos has to go to the sound designers and composers, since so much of the terror of The Last Door comes down to what you hear rather than what you see (or DON'T see, in many cases). I know I'm not the only one who'll be haunted by a particular piano theme for a long time to come...All that said, a few of the puzzles were unintuitive enough that I know I couldn't have figured them out without walkthroughs (and a couple I managed on sheer luck). I admit I'm not a top-notch puzzle gamer, so some of that is down to my own ineptitude.

This is a fantastic point-and-click adventure game with a beautifully crafted atmosphere and creepy audio design. Both games were incredible and entertaining, so much so that I waited to play the 2nd one with my S/O while he experienced the 1st game.This game is very obviously inspired by E.A.Poe and HP Lovecraft, but in a tasteful way. The story is unique and not something I've really encountered before. It's executed and set up very well and going back to find the secrets that you missed the first time only shines a little more light on the story.

Finally playing the finished product, after waiting years to complete the game, I can say one thing: It could be better. The initial story and tone of the game are wonderful. It truly felt like something apart from other horror games. Then the series devolved into a Lovecraftian horror; this is something that I can't say is original.
