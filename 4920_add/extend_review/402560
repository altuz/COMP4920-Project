The devs are clearly out of their mind if they plan to charge monthly for something that another software already does better charging only once. Not to mention that if you want to create anything you have a very limited storage, a limited number of saved setups, a limited number of creations and if you want to have more space you have to pay more.Just stay away from this, TTS is just better in every single way. Just hoping things don't go as planned and the Tabletopia devs change their minds about their business model, only then this might be a viable choice. For now this is just unthinkable."

This is the hardest choice I've come across in my video game lifetime. The ONLY 2 reasons this game can compete against Tabletop simulator is toA) fund the developersandB) have a easier time finding games with strangers. through a system of oranized games.However, this will burn a hole in your wallet, and it might burn a hole in it faster than you play board games and thats not cool. Board games take time and not being able to know how many board games I can play in a month really makes me feel sick buying a monthly purchase. Not only that, the speed of this game may not live up to it too. Regardless if the developers get 70% of the revenue (So I've heard). How do we know (OUR) favorite developers will tag along too? Some developers may still be completely against the digitilization of their products which makes me believe that this game will have severe limitation to games. I have made mods for games in Tabletop simulator and have even gotten permission to put the game on the workshop by lead designers of the game. Game designers love to at least get their game out there because they know that when people will like it a lot they will buy it.I own all the games I play on TTS and I use it as a tool to test, play around, modify, or rebalance games before and after I buy them with the click of a button. If someone doesn't buy a board game but plays it on TTS. Chance are they weren't ever going to buy it anyways. And if they did then the developers win. If they don't then its not a loss cause. This is always a problem in the digital age especially with things like Intellectual property. I believe this game will only be playable for people with Too much disposable income or people that just got really lucky  were all their favorite developers have latched on to this."

The DLC is also pay-to-own instead of a limited duration 'premium subscription' model, which makes more sense given the way people play digital board games."

The hosts for games already set up seem to be perpetually afk, and the games that I set up don't get anyone to join regardless of the title.Further, the price tag listed for this software is, I suppose, money to pay for the opportunity to create your own game through their board game software and then, through the software, to sell it to people who'd be interested in playing the game online with others.  That part seems well done, but I'm not sure real life board game makers will ever make any real money through this portal or that real life board game fans will accpet paying $10 for an online version of a board game when they could buy the real one for $30 from Amazon and be able to enjoy it with friends/family for the rest of their lives."

,Recommended,402560,28141677,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,Bakonon,"So, here's the thing about Tabletopia: for a while their Steam client ran like garbage and the best way to use it was to actually use Firefox with the Unity plugin. I think the majority of bad reviews came from this fact.The latest update seems to fix this, so hopefully more of the reviews will focus on the actual content of the platform, rather than the technical challenges.For me, it's an excellent platform and the subscription model is only required if you want to host games and a good chunk of the money you pay each month goes to the publishers of the games you play. I think that's a great way to get good games that are well put together onto the platform instead of the janky, pirated messes that you often find on TTS. That's not to say TTS is bad, but I do feel guilty firing up games that are breaking all kinds of copyrights.Pros:-Good UI, better than TTS in a lot of ways, not as good in others-Good model, you can play for free, host some games for free and only pay for premium features.-Almost all the games are tightly and professionally made.Middling:-Selection is not as good as TTS, but the quality is so much better and games like Terra Mystica and Scythe are amazing.Cons:-Bad Lobby System. It's not super hard to get connected to a game but sometimes people can't join after a game is started, you have to load in and out of the game and they made some UI ""improvements"" to it that were just as confusing as before.Overall, I have no reservations about recommending it. It still needs a little maturing but the rough edges are not deal breakers at all. For the record, most of my play time has been in Firefox, so my play time on Steam clocks in at about 10% of what it should be."

I could set up a private game room so I wasn't disturbed and whilst I guess this is maybe not the primary selling point here, something that appeals to me.I bought and am using this on my laptop whilst away from my home base using a ""dongle"". I only dropped connection once and it went back in quikcly where I left off.

I back a lot of projects on Kickstarter and it’s cool to see the components and get to play the games before backing them.The Steam version is very well done.Outstanding graphics and visuals. Everything looks really good and the details are amazing.Clean interface, good in-game controls, customizable camera, automated setups, other features. The gameplay feels smooth apart from some fiddliness with components at times.Can be shared with other people free-of-charge.It’s a sandbox with no AI at all, so you need to do everything manually, including count victory points..No Undo.Laptop battery is not enough to play some of the heavier and more lengthy games.The game needs more people online.So, for what I get now, the price and functionality seem a really good deal.

For example, the hand with your cards is glued to the bottom of the screen and is super convenient, no need to keep the cards on the table. The other people can see the number of objects in your hand on your avatar and what you are doing at the moment.And the table itself is unlimited, so nothing falls off. The tables in TTS really annoy me every time anyone knocks or drops anything off them causing chaos or when you simply don’t have enough room for the components, especially when there’s several players.In general TT looks and feels very nice and pro, I just really hope it did not involve subscriptions but rather sold games as DLCs...

As I understand it, many games will be free and you will be able to play them without paying. If you want more, you can pay. I personally much prefer this to having to pay just to see what’s in the box. Or paying and downloading games I won’t like in the end.Some people wrote about being unable to download the client or start the games. Well, in my recent experience this never happened. The devs really have improved many things over the time since the first reviews.

Unfortunately low playerbase at dead times. You have to know to know the rules for the games you want to play or read the instructions. Intuitive interface. Boots and runs nicely for me.I recommend this platform for virtual boardgames primarily to boardgamers, because you have to know the games you want  to play and the rules. The game has plenty of the most popular boardgames, except monopoly, so its safe to say that the developers know what real modern boardgames are. Also has a lots of recent bg that are not available in my country or are too expensive for me and you can try it out for free, and maybe later that can lead you to buy the game if you like.Don't get me wrong, this can not substitute irl boardgaming in any way, because the principle of boardgames is to get people together and have a good time, but is good that exists for the reasons mentioned above.Contrary of what has been said, the platform runs nicely on my PC atleast, and i believe i should work for most cases as well.Tabletopia is a spectacular platform for sandbox boardgaming, that you can play trough Steam or trough their site. At people complaining at the game being a broser, that makes no sense whatsoever because every client your use for a game is Literally a browser for that game. Don't let the ignorance flow trough you and give it a try if you like to play boardgames.One thing not favorable is that is very hard to play games with strangers because the playerbase is low. I guess it needs more people start playing the more popular would get. But is still good if you bring your own friends.If you want to play a game you don't know or don't know what modern boardgames are you have rules available that you have to read, so people should not blame the game as it was made to be universal sandbox and nto specific games so you have to do almost all the actions that are specific to a game.The premium version gives quality of life upgrades and acess to premium games and acess expansions and has the possibility to invite more people to your games."

Terra Mystica in particular looked very impressive all laid out.6) The UI will take some getting used to, but has useful functions (like hover over a stack of tokens, roll your mouse wheel to tick up a counter, then click button to take that many of the stack), can also shuffle a deck easily, flip cards etc.So overall... hmmm... not convinced right now. Lack of killer titles in the library will make or break it IMHO as the rest of it is kinda there. If they want this to be the ""spotify of boardgaming"" then they just have to get the top games from BGG signed up."

It seemed a cool concept to try a game months before it gets to me by mail. And it helped me decide that I really wanted the physical copy as well.Since then I’ve tried several other games and it’s been a very pleasant experience overall. The devs keep adding new games and features. It would be great if some part of the gameplay was AI-controlled, such as victory points scoring. But on the whole, great platform."

Its a sandbox envirnoment with pre-set virtual game board, but there are no programmed-in rulesets for board games. Players have to still study the rules and play according to them. Its F2P so I can recomend."

76561198045760559,Recommended,402560,28999474,Posted: 3 January,all,CRUXIF3R,"Let me begin by saying this is not a board game hub. It has many board games but, they do not play like apps. basically every piece is grabable by the app. Which makes it extremely frustrating because you have to use your mouse for everything and you can do anything. Even illegal moves, if no one is watching and correcting what you do. Basically it is not a good place to learn board games. You have to know how to play them.They do include instructions in PDF but no way of reading them while waiting in the lobby. and most board games take a good while maybe even hours for some of the rules of these board games. It is in the advertisement so you can't say they didn't warn you. But being early access the cards and pieces are very beautiful, hopefully some games become more streamlined and have AI to enforce the rules.The most frustrating thing is getting new people to learn. Most expect a ios/android type game.  So, I tried learning Champions of Midgaard and Go, but the players quickly left the game. As mentioned before I wasn't sure how Tabletopia worked. Finally picked a game I knew how to play and found someone to play with. I taught him the game and we both figured out the mechanics of this new sandbox. I lost, lol. But this game would normally take 20 min, I think all in all it was like 1.5 hours. The first ten minutes he accidently took the entire deck and put it in his hand. so we had to start again.Anyway..PROS:Free Board games. (Board games are expensive and take a lot of room in a home)Online: finding board gaming communities is hard in a lot of areas.Variety (has some popular board games)CONS:-HUGGEEEEE LEARNING CURVE--Learning how to use Tabletopia (I recommend starting with a game you know how to play)---Things such as moderating a game, and some people couldn't even figure in-game chat (lower right hand side)-Bugs (I played Fluxx and one card would highlight the discard pile but would not become part of the discard pile it would just lay on top. So we just put it aside.-Clunky controls. Even after knowing how to work everything because the controls are not streamlined more drag and drop for everything it leads to mishaps that are annoying. Say you have a bag with tokens inside. You try to move the bag and it grabs a token instead."

Support from publishers for Kick started Games.For a solo gamer this is a good platform and vastly improved since the last time I looked at it.  In some respects the quality of the games are much better than its competitor.  While there is not the variety of workshop items available in a lot of ways this is better because the Quality of what you do see is better.There are a couple of weak spots, but no show stoppers.  I have changed from a no to a yes.  Keep up the fantastic work.Original PostSpent a few minutes with this one, it lasted about 10 minutes.  personally if you like board games go buy them.  Better yet, support Board Game Arena, while it does not have the selection of Tabletopia each game has a how to play area, with the rules, videos and summary instructions.  The community is transparent and you can see the games as tables are made.  you can also play in Real time or Play by Main where you are told it is your turn.  Skip this one."
