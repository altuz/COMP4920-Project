Well, a good sign that it's a good game.  Perhaps also the ""first sign of madness"", as they say.  But we won't go there...Since an eccentric little foray into 2D, Silent Hill-inspired ""survival horror"" entitled Lone Survivor came out in 2012, a number of other indie devs have attempted to capture a similar charm.  While a couple have come reasonably close - last year's Claire comes to mind - The Coma may finally be a game which equals the inspiration of Jasper Byrne's little ""neo-classic"" (while also owing a tremendous amount to the ""stealth horror"" classic Clock Tower, as well as high school horror game Obscure and maybe, just maybe, the more recent DreadOut).  While The Coma does very little which could be considered terribly ""new"", what it does it does very well.It looks great, sounds great, and plays just fine too.  It's scary enough - though it shouldn't stress any of you lightweights TOO much - and it also isn't that difficult really, until perhaps the very end, and might thereby be a rather good introduction to horror gaming for all of you thus far afraid to take the plunge.  It's a fantastic little game which manages to find a balance between ""cute"" and ""creepy"" without compromising either, and is perfectly good value given the moderate length and substantial entertainment which it provides.Sure, I could make a few minor complaints.  The maps, for example, could take more cues from the likes of Silent Hill by showing you: a. where you've been, and b. where you can't enter (due to a barricade in a corridor, say, or something blocking a door ""from the other side"").  But on the whole, this still emerges as one of the more solid horror titles of recent years, and while that's not necessarily saying THAT much - it's been a quagmire of♥♥♥♥♥♥of late, let's face it - it'll still stand up pretty well in years to come, methinks, not least of all due to the frankly ""ageless"" art style it's chosen.Nice job, Korea!  You're certainly putting the vast majority of Europe to shame at this particular point in time...keep up the good work!Verdict: 9/10."

The detailing, the atmosphere, the sounds, all superb.I would recommend this game to anyone who has the potential to enjoy horror. This game has the detailing(art), the music, the gameplay and the writing to back it all. Some might be like me and go in expecting a new ""white day"", but what you get is so much more. In saying that, I'll start with something more of a con-ish nature.The atmosphere and the killer are both horrifying together, don't get me wrong. There were also things in the enviroment that constantly sent chills. But having more of a variety in scares or ghosts would have been great. We have one killer, a handful of NPCs and hidden ghosts that will damage you upon surprise.This is one of few horror games I've encountered that are so open, and yet so rewarding for exploration. There are side quests, little interactions and notes everywhere with history on the world. It's all amazing. Every character has exceptional personality, and some even having potential for the future title.And by future title, A SEQUEL GOT ANNOUNCED OMG YAY <3Carrying on. There are a total of 5 endings now, one of which being the ""True"" ending, which opens up for the sequel. Here, I will be reviewing the canon ending. Speaking in spoiler-free conditions, the ending was great. It left many possibilites in the sequel, hinted who the next main character will be and left multiple characters with purpose for the future. We can expect great things. But right now? Get this game, it really is incredible."

A side-scrolling trip through a ghostly version of the main character's school, where a crazed maniac stalks the halls in search of you and a malevolent spirit alters the environment. You collect notes along the way that expand on the story as you try to find a way to return to the real world. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a very tense, pulse-pounding horror game."

It gave me a good frighten at the start, which I haven't managed to get out of a horror game for awhile.So far, I love the art in it, and the audio is also really good--the chase music is a little bit hectic, though, because there's a small dip in it that makes it hard to tell if you're still being chased or not, and sometimes the hiding mechanic is a bit of a pain--as it I would be a good distance away from her, and yet hiding would lead to me being attacked.A few of the mechanics put me in the mind of White Day--specifically the utilization of vending machines, the hellish school atmosphere, and then being chased by a school staff member, though this is considerably different and amazingly unique from White Day.Honestly, though, if you were a fan of White Day, I really recommend this one; if you're a fan of horror games in general, I also recommend this one."

This game has perfect atmosphere which was built in a 2D sorta side scrolling game!!!! Majority of modern AAA-ish horror games can't come even close to quality this game has. This may be a little bit rambly review, but I'm greatly impressed with the game and probably a fan boy now.+ Marvellous atmoshpere!+ Very good visuals and I absolutely love their drawing of enemies! That hits every pleasure point for me. I have a super weakness for what people tend to call psychotic killer if she's a lady :D+ Pretty interesting story which build up new mythology and provides us with nice believable characters+ Developers even added additional ending after release!+ Whoever worked on sound did amazing job! Footsteps, music which kicks in when you're in danger, that bzzzz sound :D 5+Bottom line is that this game absolutely ""worth it"" and a must buy in my opinion! AND there is a sequel coming from what I understand on forums here!

While the content is a little less toned down there is an intriguing mystery to put together with some interesting plot twists and mentions of a future installment.The gameplay while simple does a very good job of not containing fluff. You won't find yourself constantly having to fix things or to double back for seemingly meaningless tasks, all of the exploration you do will further the plot or help you get a greater understanding of the situation.Because I believe that rating a game is grounded in what it was trying to be, I would give this game a 10/10 as there is nothing more I could think to look for in this genre so seldom visited."

,Not Recommended,402630,20600133,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Vlaphor,"This review hurts me to write, because I really wanted to like The Coma.  I really liked the Clock Tower games, and this game draws massive inspiration from those, so I had high hopes going in, but sadly, it fails to deliver on several points, both large and small.As for the small problems, I'd mostly attribute them to the ui and controls.  Everything is real time, but all of the buttons are spread out over the keyboard.  ESC closes nothing, so you'll have to find the designated close button to get out of a backpack or something in order to interact with something else and the controls don't feel as responsive as they should be.  This causes a lot of cheap injuries that I felt I should've been able to get out of.   The biggest problem with the ui is the map, mainly in the later areas.  Once you get to the third building, several paths that look like they should be open are blocked off, requiring you to find alternate routes or teleporters.  The routes that are blocked off are not marked on your map, even after you encounter them, and this becomes a massive hassle when trying to navigate the later, maze-like, levels (as well as something else which I'll mention next paragraph).  These issues could be fixed with a simple patch, potentially, but the major issue I'll be mentioning, I'm not so sure of.The big problem is the antagonist who follows you around.  The Clock Tower games had their Scissorman and this game has an analogue, but there are major differences between the two that hold this game back from its full potential.  In Clock Tower, encountering Scissorman was a relative rarity which served to add a bit of tension to the game.  You had more than one option on how to deal with the encounter, and the game also had several ways that Scissorman could show up (walk around, jump out from a closet, leap out from a pool, etc...), all of which added up to an antagonist who added spice and fear to an otherwise standard point and click adventure game.  In the Coma, the antagonist only shows up one way (walking around), there is generally only one way to avoid the antagonist, which is hiding.  You can flee, but you have to flee quite a ways away, which leads to my next issue.  The antagonist shows up far too often and kills all pacing.  If you touch the villian at all, you lose about 1/3rd of your health, so you have to run.  That means that while you are trying to solve the puzzles and navigate the maze, you'll randomly have to run in the opposite direction for a little bit, then find one of the many common hiding spaces, and then wait for about 10 seconds.  That may not sound too bad, but on your tenth time in a row in a short while. it becomes incredibly tedious.  I went from saying ""Oh Crap!"", to ""God Damnit!  Not again!"" fairly early on, and this only gets magified when navigating the mazes in the latter half of the game.  The one thing I'd recommend is perhaps cut the encounter rate in half and give some kind of way to fight off the hunter without damage, or at least reduced damage, because I really cannot overstate how much having to constantly run away kills all pacing.  Imagine a maze where you have to draw over what you've been drawing at random, frequent intervals, or Resident Evil 1 (mentioned Clock Tower enough in this review) where, every time you saw a zombie, you had to run back three rooms and wait, then hope the zombie wasn't there when you got back.It's a shame, because there is a bunch about this game I like, primarily in terms of characters, story, and art style.  I would like to see this game get more refined, but as of right now, I just can't recommend it to anyone who values tension over tedium."

My first time playing a Korean made game aside from mobile apps like anipang...A good visually appealing art style and ambience to go with it. The setting at a Korean high school is where this game takes  place. With my experience of having lived in South Korea for 3 years before, just playing this game brings back the nostalgia a bit. Though I have never gone to school there as a high school student, I had the priveledge to teach once as a guest for an elementary school, and so my expereince was mainly exploring and delving into the countries lifestyle and culture, as well as making awesome great new friends!The game is developed from South Korea itself, and many of the developers don't work at Devespresso full-time yet, as this is their debut game. The horror elements work well enough for this style of game, and there's a lot of reading to be done as it is a visual novel styled game. There is a monster that will be chasing you around the school, which keeps the suspense up.Here's my playthrough of the game, this is not a critique video or review for the most part as it is a playthrough ""Let's Play.""

Thought there would be more of the ""demons"" or possessed entity that could roam around the hallway which can give quite the challenge. There were some flaws during the mid-playthrough where the dialogues can be annoying. Such as, popping up and you got poisoned because it happened when you were right on that poison pods.Most of the gameplay was going on detours, here and there ( I guess that's common in games.) The first encounter of the ""demons"" were in fact, terrifying until to the point that it became annoying. There was also a time when the game got glitched that I couldn't proceed to the game as I got teleported to another floor instead of where I was supposed to be. The game's kinda short although the obstacles made it longer.One thing that bothers me about the last part,SPOILER ALERT:Honestly I kinda hate the part where you had to go through that twisted portals through lockers and all just to go and get that twist ending. I think it would be better if the last bits of the game, as soon as he reached his classrooms, it was seemingly back to normal that he actually failed.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it but the reason I gave into the positive review and want to recommend people to try out this game is because of the beautiful art into it and I believe this game still has potential to do better some more, maybe through an update? ;)I'd rate it 6.5/10.

At first, obviously, this is rather scary. After a while, it just becomes annoying.With that out of the way, let me whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a predominately note-based story game, in which you must travel through an unusual world piecing together the ""why, how, where"" while dodging axe-blows and little surprise traps.The inventory system was not what I expected, but I was sufficiently surprised, and even satisfied, with the outcome. I never needed to use a stamina-regen item, since I could just hide in a closet for a minute and be all good, but my health did take a regular beating. The ""elemental"" effects, poison and bleeding, were an odd addition, I find, and almost seemed out of place.At the end of the day, The Coma is an enjoyable romp through a parallel dimension in which you are constantly hunted and on the edge of death.SpoilersI encountered two problems. Firstly, whenever I tried to go to the rooftop garden in the north building, it made me fall through the floor. Secondly, as I ran for the exit through the second map, I found myself unable to confront the Noteman at the end since the killer would always patrol to that area.

No, my heart can't take it and after watching through videos I know I DEFINITELY can't handle the stress of being chased around by The Killer, especially since the key to avoiding it requires a good speaker (to avoid the footsteps). That is the WORST.That being said, about 20 minutes to the game I have the feeling that this is just the beginning of a series, and seeing the ending I knew I was right. It's a good plan in my opinion, to have The Coma makes its debut and use the profit (if you have any left after production and paying salaries...) so you can put it in the sequel.I'd imagined that the protagonist and the female protagonist will get together and enter different Comas and save people or something, but what you have now isn't bad at all too, especially since it seems to offer the possibility of different characters playthroughs. Yan Hong (I don't know how to spell her name...) seems to play a central figure although her importance wasn't shown in this first game, and I expect to see her as the MC in the next one. Even characters like Miss Song and Mina seem like they'll play a role in the next game; maybe like playing each of them going through The Coma and work together to eventually... well, no spoilers.It's a cool game. The atmosphere is just right, the sound effects are awesome (or maybe I just have super low tolerance against horror sound effects), and while the gameplay can be boring for gamers who are easily desentisized, The Coma is a quality debut of a game.

Good game if you like exploration with a dose of decent horror. The attention to sound is good, though its not always perfect. Highly recommend picking it up on a sale, or paying full price of you're a fan of horror in this style."

A little like a 2-D version of Silent Hill but with more humor.(DANGER: Minor spoiler below)The only frustrating part for me was the maze near the end that you were forced to traverse where your teacher was constantly on your♥♥♥♥♥ It almost stopped the game for me but the story was compelling enough to go on. Looking forward to a sequel!
