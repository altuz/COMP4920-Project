Yes that might not exactly be the fault of the game as a gamepad or keyboard/mouse are simply not the optimal devices to control such machines, but there isn't any support for steering wheels and joysticks either.The radio offers a wide range of awful music, but hey that's at least realistic.And the worst thing, when you are supposed to load material using an excavator this simply isn't possible because almost all material chunks you take from a pile are simply disappearing through the bucket. Now loading 250 tons (game measurement) of material in almost empty bucket loads of 3-4 tons is a quite tedious job.All in all this game feels like a burden and is no fun at all."

Unlike similar titles like Farm simulator or the Trucking sims... you can die from numerous, sometimes funny consequences.It adds a couple of minor puzzles as well... making it an odd mix of genres.It's not sandboxy enough to really ""play"" in... it's pretty much on rails.In the end, it's pretty short... done in 8 hours, even with a bit of screwing around... but I enjoyed it the entire time."

It has reasonably good graphics, it has TERRAIN DEFORMATION (serious props on that one), and whilst the physics is a bit dodgy, most things seem to be physics objects which is a nice touch.However, there's really not much of a game. Most of the time you seem to be taking a long time to just do the same things over and over again, very, very slowly. I can see this being fun for anyone REALLY into these things, but for anyone else, it's really just a bit of a bore. KSP is better if this is the sorta thing you're interested in.Overall, this is the best bad game I've ever played, but I still can't recommend it."

I gave up at the shuttle transport, because the shuttle is falling off no matter how I drive or raise/lower the platforms. Too bad I spent 3.2 hours in it, or I would have asked for a refund.This isn't a game, but more like a demonstration of the vehicles. And the physics is way off at some points, i.e. when you bump a tow truck while walking. I manage to move it around just by walking into it. You get little information at times. I had put on a hazmat suit when I picked up and fixed the T-Rex hoses, and after doing all the stuff I had to do to start the machine, I am told I can't use a hazmat suit while driving... have to lower the ladder and climb down, take off the suit, go back and climb up, raise the ladder, open/close a door and THEN I could drive. And if I am unlucky the physics break my T-Rex and I have to start all over. In some missions you think you are going to a point, and when you get there you are told you need to step on it to avoid tornadoes. More than one time!ATM I would give this game a 3/10 and not recommend buying. I find it boring."

,Recommended,402750,28764366,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,IronSpidy26,"I am recommending this game BUT, with a few reservations!The game is a lot of fun (writing this with an hour of play on my account but have roughly 6 from another account).It works well, mostly, and does well on simulating the massive equipment you use, close to feel that you'd get from a real life equivalent.I like how the terrain deformation works, the speed and weight of the vehicles is felt, and everything sounds decently accurate - EXCEPT the radio.. It is very annoying, please allow this option to be turned off or use our own music.While everything works well and is mostly a quite enjoyable experience, there are somethings like in any game that don't work - have bugs, etc..There are sometimes texture clips when the side of a mountain flashes in and out of existance.The radio as mentioned above.Vehicles stop far too fast.Direction arrows/goal directions sometime's dissapear.And in my opinion the worst part about this game is the controls. In the settings, you can't much modify the sensetivity of the controls. If you turn down gamepad sensetivity, it also reduces the sensetivity of the left anolog stick.. WHAT? what game on EARTH is the movement stick a controllable sensetivity. Also modifying the controls does not always work, and general gamepad support is very poor. My regular xbox one controller will sometimes stop working in the menus and i have to leave my couch to go to the keyboard and fix it with the mouse (even tho i have controller companion).While i do say this game is a yes - i was so excited to play giant machines, i loved doing that kind of work in real life - the controls were not perfect, nor intuitive in some cases, in game.It is a good time, but keep in mind, it is NOT a AAA title, and can be expected to play like it. This game is extremely worth it below $20."

I think if you watch the trailer or a youtube video and it really grabs you, you'd probably be into it.  And at the current sale price of $16, but probably not for $20.I would've liked to see this come out as an early access title.  Some areas are really polished for a budget title, but there are some strange problems elsewhere.  And there's not really a lot there.  It feels sort of like a mobile game on steroids.  Well, it was on steroids, but then it didn't eat right or hit the gym often enough.  There isn't enough meat on these bones.  There isn't really an overarcing 'game' to what you're doing, you just do a few different things in different areas.  But it also doesn't work as a sim because there isn't nearly enough depth to anything you do.But...  I still had fun.  And I kept coming back to it, though it was pretty short.  I could give it several dozen tiny nitpicks, but I noticed those things becuase I still like it and I want it to be better.  It just isn't there yet.  Hopefully the developers keep on polishing this one, and they can really blow peoples minds with Giant Machines 2018."

,Not Recommended,402750,25807442,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Tommy,"This is not simulating anything at all, other then running around on ladders. While the machines may be ""giant"", they are also slow, awkard to control and super boring. Most of the time you are going from point A to point B. At a super slow speed.One of the missions you are driving a giant dump truck. It starts with you refueling it (Walk up to an hose, press X, walk 1 meter to the truck, press X, walk to the valve, press X), then you drive it for 300 meters and come up to an narrow pass which has been blocked by some logs. Now the game gives you some kind of giant-sciscors-machine that you use to snip of the logs, which takes about 1 minute, and then you continue driving your dump truck. Your destination? A ""trucker motel"". Why is this gigantic, super wide, ultra heavy machine allowed on public roads? No idea.After about 30 seconds of exciting driving you arrive at the motel, unfortunately you can't stop there to rest because all of a sudden there is TORNADOES. Yes, you are being ""chased"" by tornadoes, on a road going through what could only be described as some kind of post-apocalyptic asset from the Unity Store.There is nothing about this whole scenario that is even remotly close to being something which could be called a simulator.Nice idea, falls short on the execution."
