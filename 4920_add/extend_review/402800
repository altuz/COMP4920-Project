The game has hardly been patched at all since then and it's still very much just the framework of a game. There still aren't any tools for custom content similar to garry's mod.Theres still time for this game to become great but with so few patches I'm just worried it's been abandoned."
,Not Recommended,402800,30397965,Posted: 8 March,all,DaveKap,"Edit: Previous review still intact but here's an update. The developer, which is just 1 person at Facepunch, is still slowly working on Chunks and there's an alpha branch to use to get the latest updates. I had to go to the Facepunch forums to get him to talk and I let him know he needs to be communicative over Steam. We'll see where things go from here but for now I still can't recommend Chunks in its current state.They stopped development and won't respond to customers. Isn't worth 5 bucks and won't leave early access. Don't touch."

The demo was FREE. Now, Chunk is a standalone that cost 20$ and is basically abandonned.The devs seems to think the community will add content, they only update the mod supports rather than add actual content and make a game of this. -"

The developers, the guys behind Rust, obviously have their hands busy with Rust, so they're not very active on this title. Updates have been slow and minor, and replies on the forums are pretty much non-existent.I think there is great potential for this game, and it IS a lot of fun already, if you're ok with the extremely limited nature of placing coloured blocks and riding rollercoasters, you should buy this.If you're expecting a lot more development with new block types, new mechanics, perhaps connecters to make different contraptions, I would say wait wait wait. It isn't clear if this title is going to become much more than it is right now, as it currently feels really empty and dead.I don't recommend this game in its current state, simply due to the almost complete lack of community.There are a couple members making stuff in the workshop, but I think even they are like ""What's going on with this game?"" right now,So, take ""recommended"" review with caution, I was strongly debating giving it a not-recommended review, for the reasons mentioned above."
,Recommended,402800,22686965,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,Dr. Nebsterio,"So I decided to try out the rollercoaster feature right away because even though I love building, I've been building for the past 6 years with previous voxel sandboxes.  The placement of track is really freaking intuitive and fun so I went all out and finally make a cart and gave it a whirl.  At first it was awesome, but then the curves I made got to me and I had to forfeit my dinner and lay on the ground for 10 minutes just to recalibrate my sense of direction.  Karma finally caught up with me.  After 15 years of torturing peeps in Rollercoaster Tycoon, I now know the misery that those countless victims experienced while riding my constructions of pure evil.10/10 would vomit and lay on the ground with horrible vertigo again.Looked neat though.  The game, not the bucket of sick and spinning room.  I found out the hard way why it's called ""Chunks"", cause I blew them.  Gotta go easy on the VR."
,Recommended,402800,23093479,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,Fireheart,"Holy ♥♥♥♥ the sense of scale. Beautiful. Absolute must have. The building is really intuitive, though menu navigation can be tricky at first. Once you figure out the controls, which are labled if you turn the Vmotes to the side, it's really easy to teleport and start building. It might take a good 20 minutes until you get fluent with it though. The rollercoaster implementation is amazing as well. You need be careful though or you're not going to have a good time. Building of the tracks is easy and works great with the controllers in that you can twist the Vmote to twist the track, and tilt to tilt etc. Just don't make one that will make you sick when you ride it. This game exceeded expectations. It's been my favorite room scale experience so far and has given me the sense of scale no other game has done yet. Highly recommend."

Since I bought it months ago, there haven't been a lot of updates and when there finally was an update it was always just some rather minor changes. It seems to be almost abandoned now, or at least a very low priority for the devs. The game tried to rely on steam workshop for custom gamemodes but failed, since the userbase is just too small and the workshop almost empty. It's sad, because the game can be really fun for a while and has a ton of potential. It just doesn't look like that potential will ever amount to a game worth 20€."
76561198003080415,Recommended,402800,22407373,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,dndx2,I've been waiting for this game ever since I first found out about ViveCraft (former name). The wait was well worth it! I spent what felt like a few minutes building an insane rollercoaster which ended up taking 2 hours. I can't wait for new features and community plugins. There are so many possibilities!The minecraft like textures don't bother me much and I love how easy it is to build things as you are free to scale from 1:1 to 1:64 very easily. Really looking forward to future updates.

Whether you're building a castle or a rollercoaster (and then riding it!).I am having performance issues at times but reducing the loaded chunks mostly took care of this.The UI is a little bit clunky, but thankfully you can rearrange it. I'm sure this will improve in the near future.The moddability is already there, so people can expect a fair ammount of additional content. Can't wait to see what people are coming up with!Already feel like I've gotten my money's worth with this!"

This game prompted me to write another. I've spent over 5 hours in the first night alone.. just building roller coasters and riding them. The Devs got everything right so far and this game at full price is easily worth the money. I'm looking forward to seeing more variations on the block types and more content being added. If they continue to support this title, they've got my support for future titles.  Great job so far devs! Keep up the good work!"

For such an early version of a game it is amazing compared to much of the VR dreck currently available, sure it's not perfect and doesn't have a lot of content yet but I thought it was worth the price for the amount of fun I've had playing and letting friends & family ride the coasters I've created.The only real issue I had was I don't have a lot of space available so building can be challenging but once you get the hang of teleporting and changing your scale it gets easier."

I don't think that will ever happen.  It will fail if it relies on the workshop.It takes too much time to move around as you have to reselect it on the controller.  Making coasters is not that fun either.  I think it would work better with track selection buttons, like in RCT games, instead of dragging the controller.  It is difficult to get the track to look clean and straight.  It ends up twisted.If this game is going to be only about roller coasters, then it needs tons of options and different types of coasters.Same group that made the game Rust... which has been in early access for almost 3 years..... ""It's in our interest to make the game awesome - so please trust us.”Just give us your money and trust us.  We'll finished it in a decade or two.  I'm going to guess this game get an hour of attention a month, if that.Run far away from this one."
,Recommended,402800,22967429,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,STUART,"Chunks is amazing - the roller coaster tool alone makes the game worth it. Combined with the ability to explore Minecraft-style environments at giant scale, then cozy up into a cave at 1:1, this is basically everything I've ever wanted from VR.Also, if you're into experiments in VR interface design, Chunks' panel system has innovations left and right."
,Recommended,402800,22367497,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,icecreammatt,"This game is what Minecraft should have been in VR. The roller coaster builder is pretty cool although I made myself a bit nauseous. I do miss the survival mode, hopefully something like that comes out of the workshop. Switching scale is very cool. I really look forward to seeing what the community comes up with in the steam workshop.I think the controls could use some improvement or a faster way to switch between them rather than having to go to the menus. Maybe something closer to how you switch weapons in Hover Junkers or Budget Cuts. Maybe like recently used items or favorites. The menus in their default position are a bit difficult for me to see without straining my eyes luckily you can move them around."

Thank you for becoming better as a dev and person, Garry.Facepunch continues to become a better and better company. Their games, like Rust, are the best in their genre (though no dinosaurs to draw people in). Messing around with the game, things look good. I won't be able to truly test it until I get a Vive, but I'm supporting it and the developers (yes, yes, you too Helk and all the rest).The only thing I'd like to see in this game is no official servers run by people who let racism slide like Rustafied does."

It made me laugh out loud and felt like a kid again (Not for those motion sickness prone)For that I give this a positive review. I would recommend checking it out if it was closer to $10 though. It is a little pricey for what content is there at this time.

So far I'm loving it for the plugin interface, scripting your own building tools and creatures is very approachable.  Highly recommended if you're a modder or builder type."
,Not Recommended,402800,29576255,Posted: 29 January,all,Captain Otter,"I really wish I could reccomend chunks, and to an average user with the games out on the vive now I just can't. As a support of Gary and Gmod I would love to see what this game could be if some more time would be dedicated to it.I bought it early on when I got my vive and it was pretty fun to play with, it still is fun making a rollercoaster bank to one side then spiral down and slow it right down. That's it mostly, it's fun to create something to induce motion sickness to even the most confident they're not prone to it.The tool used to draw the track feels like magic, placing blocks is satisfying and so is scaling your size, but just nothing else has been added to this game in the entire time it's been out besides a zombie mini game thing which the controls for are quite confusing and difficult.I hope I can change this review in the future to reccomend, I really do."
