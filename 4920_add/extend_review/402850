The very first five moves will be identical to those an hour in, and nothing changes. Period.There is even an identical product by the developer on Steam with a few sprites changed.I can't refund someone else's gift, but I can warn as many of you away from playing a game that involves absolutely nothing but ""taptaptaptaptaptap"" over and over until boredom sets in, with no rewards or variables whatsoever."

The other one is called Tiki Man.http://store.steampowered.com/app/376920/Both of them lack all of the things that make Timberman an enjoyable game, including:Local/Split-screen multiplayerOnline multiplayerAchievementsController supportTrading cards, backgrounds, emotesSteam cloudLeaderboards16:9 resolution supportIt's a lazy attempt to clone a popular game, with terrible Minecraft-like graphics."
,Not Recommended,402850,19350175,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,rinimt,"My full review can be found here.Let me tell you a story. A story of a miner - we'll name him George - who was bored of his regular mining life. He wanted tod o something different, something that most would even consider to be impossible. George wanted to dig into an infite pillar of ore! Oh but of course they told him no, because that's just silly! George would have none of it, and thus he started to have a Miner Mayhem.Miner Mayhem is basically a clicker game where you need to move the mouse back and forth, avoiding the pieces jutting out of the ore, all while you try and get as high of a score as you can. Interesting in concept, and it does work... Just not in this game. A game like this desparately needs the ability to click both the right and left mouse buttons, not just the left. The sensitivity on where you can click got me killed more times than I can count. You can unlock additional skins for the miner depending on how you perform in the game, but that's all they are - skins. They don't do anything special or different for you.Skip Miner Mayhem and go play better titles (like Timberman). Tell poor George that his dreams are hopeless, all thanks to the TOO minimal controls within his poor game. He also needs to not go after ore that looks like it is straight out of Minecraft, and if he really wants to then he should just go play Minecraft instead."

The game is repetitive and really rather silly.I can imagine some people might try to get epic scores like you see in the trailer but I can imagine those people have a lot of free time and (hopefully) very few real life responsibilites. But no I can't really recommend it for most people. I probably had more fun writing this review than playing this game.It does have some positives though, the pixel art is charming and the audio sfx is ok too.This is clearly a one man development team behind this and considering that, it is not too bad... thing is even for a one man team, I can't imagine this took very long."

So I guess I'm the only one to blame for how I feel after playing this game.If you want waste a dollar, I would say having more fun with it. For example you could buy a can of soda, or a candy bar. OR you could roll it up really tight bend over and shove it up yourself. All would be more enjoyable than this game.10/10 would feel deep disappointment and regret again."

It's just a rip off of Timberman, except this is an ore tower with stone branches instead of a tree. You can get way better games than this for free. I recomend for you to not get this game so you dont waste your time, and money like I did."
