76561198006413390,Recommended,403070,33861299,Posted: 28 July,all,woosk,"This second chapter of the Silver Creek Falls series continue from the previous chapter where detective Sara Fitzgerald is assigned to a new partner from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Agent Valdez to investigate further into the unsolved mysteries of Silver Creek Falls. From the murder of Agent Valdez's former partner, Sara and Valdez investigate the disappearance of a hedge fund manager, attempt to locate an informant, search a suspicious bloodstained scene at a fisheries warehouse and follow a trail of clues back at Silver Creek Falls, a college campus, a pharmaceutical company's involvement and a secret research facility as a mystery adventure with thriller and comedic references.Having played through most of the visual novels by Sapphire Dragon Productions, I would say the plot hook and story writing for mystery is better by having interesting plot hooks and development than the romance visual novels which seem rather short and rushed in comparison. I am recommending this chapter and the entire series because I know and hope Sapphire Dragon Productions do read through and take some of the player reviews and comments seriously and will consider my suggestion to focus more on mystery storylines and also consider adding comedic references in other titles in future. This chapter is recommended when at discount or in good bundle offer with chapter 3 as the game can be finished in less than 10 hoursand the chapter has a cliffhanger ending."
,Recommended,403070,18403619,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,Twistor,"TL;DR: Mystery crime adventure is a decent sequel toChapter 1but lacks focus.I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible.Chapter 2 starts where the free-to-playChapter 1(my review here) ends: mysteries of murder and disappearances abound at Silver Creek Falls. Sara Fitzgerald gets reassigned to the case, this time with a laid-back FBI Special Agent Valdez.Story is still the main attraction of the game. A murder rises new worries but there are fortunately new leads to follow, and more ominous parties join the fray. WhileChapter 1had minor puzzle elements,Chapter 2ups the difficulty with a couple of potentially tough puzzles. Fortunately for the more casual players they can be skipped in story-fitting way or in some cases simply bruteforced.Actually, puzzles inChapter 2are what I originally expected (but was disappointed in)) inChapter 1: you actually have to think for yourself and use the evidence to deduce the answers. I congratulate on succeeding in bringing this aspect of detective-work to play a real role in the adventure.Speaking of puzzles: I especially liked the encrypted text puzzle that, while basic if you know some cryptography, made one think and even use pen&paper (or notepad), math and evidence in unison to properly solve it. In-game character would give clues or even solve it for you if you just wanted to get on with the story. This puzzle was very well done except for the long walks that ensued.Long walks are due to the maps being large and sometimes you have to walk back and forth for errands. Also, the investigators walk fairly slowly. There are still no addresses of important places on the map so this emphasizes the issue. There are also long corridors everywhere. These things are probably the worst aspects of the game. Sure, some of the walking and wandering is reasonable, like in searching the campus for a certain person or the back-alley for a certain dude. Fortunately there is a fast-walking mode (by pressing Shift while walking) that mitigates the issue.Also, in a late part of the game there's a maze of sorts that you have to solve. Not only do you have to solve it once, you have to also walk it back through again, which breaks the story flow. I think skipping the maze backwards would have been better (and the characters could have had a nice 4th-wall breaking dialogue or similar after the skip as well). In this way it seems that because of this and other long walks the game becomes artificially longer than it could be. For the story to flow, it is important to cut unnecessary walking or at least spice it up with interesting  interactions in the way.There is lots of dialogue between Sara and agent Valdez when studying the case and this brings out their personalities very nicely. They even have different facial expressions for showing emotions in the dialogue. All side characters (aside from clerks) feel fleshed out and lively and also show emotions when appropriate. There are a few more people than inChapter 1, which is good, though the streets are still strangely devoid of human life. Personally, I would have liked to see more of Sara's hotheaded side that resurfaces only maybe twice during the wholeChapter 2.I encountered several non-gamebreaking bugs and one repeatable crash during my playthrough. Developers are great: all these bugs and issues were fixed quickly as the devs are active in the Steam forum and the game is now in a much more consistent and stable state than before the updates.One annoying bug or feature was the cat in one of the hotels early in the game. If you tried to pass it, it would walk in the way and mock you by meowing. I was stuck there for some 10 minutes before I realized that the cat can be passed by walking past it while it's moving the other way. This was ridiculous but I'm not sure if it's considered a bug (and being fixed) or some kind of a meta-puzzle. I still find myself cursing at its stupidity. On my second playthrough (to see the fixes) it wasn't nearly as annoying so either it's fixed or I just knew how to deal with it.For me the game lasted 4.5 hours to 100%, though the game records 2.5 hours. Some of my time went into reporting bugs and some for idling while solving the encryption puzzles online.There was expectedly a cliffhanger at the end in anticipation ofChapter 3, which finally released in spring 2016. All in all, I likedChapter 2: it has more content and it's more demanding thanChapter 1. Still, it might have been better as a more compact and focused package, with less slow and aimless walking - in thatChapter 1succeeded better. Story is still very interesting and it's the main driving force here: it makes you want to see how it continues.I think the price of 5 € is adequate if you enjoyedChapter 1but mind that it's only about 2-4 hours long. If that feels too short for you, you might want to wait for a sale.EDIT: Oh, I found a fast walk key! It's Shift (either). I'm not sure if it was there to begin with. Edited the review accordingly.EDIT 2:Chapter 3having been released, I updated the review slightly."

A case unlike any other you've seen. It really grabs you into the story and makes you feel a part of it, as if you were the detective yourself. Its creppy, mysterious, comical, haunting and compelling."

Part two of the trilogy pairs you with a new secondary protagonist, a somewhat goofy FBI agent, and this time around you are spending more time tracing leads or investigating the surrounding areas of Silver Creek Falls then actually being in the town, but don't worry, when you return you are given a more free roam of the town. Also, stay behind for the post credits scene, it raises more mysteries aboutMark, as well as Sarah.The price is a little high, but consider you played 1 for free and you can count the price towards both. Really can't wait for Part 3."

,Recommended,403070,18474708,"Posted: 14 October, 2015",all,sam_rawr102,"Hello everyone,Normally I don't write reviews about games I play on Steam, however this one I had to. I happened to stumble up Silver Creek Falls Chapter 1 around the beginning of September and since it was free, I figured I would give it a try. It hooked me in like a video game should. The characters had depth, the gameplay was outstanding and it left me with wanting to unravel all of its secrets. I thought I would've have to wait years before I would be able to play the second part, however I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had already come out.Now, this game is relatively short, however the puzzles took awhile, so if you were able to solve them within a few minutes the overall game would probably be 3-4 hours depending. This had so much more content than the previous chapter and once again the developers did an amazing job and left this chapter off with a cliff hanger. Always leave the audience wanting more, and that's exactly what they did.This game isn't everyone's cup of tea, however It's definitely worth the 4.99$ You won't be disappointed."
,Not Recommended,403070,25348430,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Drakevarg,"I purchased Chapter 2 because Chapter 1, which came off as essentially a playable prologue, managed to set up the atmosphere and story threads to imply a much larger mystery brewing under the surface. We're now at the end of the second act and that's STILL all that's happened. Lots of implications of heavy stuff with almost no payoff. You can't just spend an entire story stringing the audience along, especially if you're charging seperately for each act.Personally, I'm not going to be suckered into buying Chapter 3 based on this pattern."

Glad we finally me Lee Davis. The only bad part was the secret message and the cipher, if I had tried figuring it out myself it would have take 3 or 4 hours. Apart from that, great game and can't wait for the next. (Be awsome if it came out on christmas but probably not gonna happen.)"

I also like that they creators made sure the story didn't stray from the original and that made me pleased considering it can sometimes be difficult to keep the main plot even while adding other aspects into it ( such as all he new characters and enviroments ). Now this next part is the previouse review that I believe still fits in to this second chapter, but befor I start this next part I would like to add that I hope there will be a third chapter to this game.I loved this game, it wasn't just the amazing soundtrack and stunning visuals that drew me to it. To me it was the story, playing this game makes you feel as though you were the actual person. You get to know the people you meet, and the people you dont meet. This is one of my personal favorite games I have played, I played this on youtube, but if you play it on your own please take in the surroundings and see the thrilling detail that the developers have put into this game."

The twist ending do make me hooked and want to buy the third chapter. But I honestly think that the price is a bit too expensive for a game that I only play once and not last that long."

Sapphire Dragon did a great job with the second chapter as they created a longer story and also new difficult puzzles. I am glad that somehow they continued the story from the first chapter.Also I have to say that is a great improvement that they implemented a local map of the town, so I didn't had to get lost again. Inventory seems the same, but now in Chapter 2 you have more items to collect.The new Steam achievements for the game are great as well and you really have to struggle to complete them, which is awesome.From many 2D pixel games I have to say that this one started to be one of my favorite. However, I am a bit disappointed about the soundtrack, which needs to be improved and also perhaps some voices for the main characters would be nice.Overall, the second chapter is really good and I can't wait for Chapter 3 to be released."

So today finally the second chapter came out and after a peek in the game, I already see that there definitely is some work put in here. Details are important and it shows. Also the narrative is interesting and it really seems, that they aren't lying about, that you should listen/read carefully. If things keep going in this direction, it will be a great game definitely worth its price. I will update the review when I finish this chapter.Btw.: Thank you for this nice birthday gift!"

I really liked the finale to Chapter 2 a lot, but won't say why due to spoilers.My main criticism is that it is a little too linear at times, but given that this is as much or more about storytelling than a game per se, I find it totally forgiveable.Recommended."
