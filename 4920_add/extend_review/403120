Highly recommended if you have young children.10 year old, enjoyed a combined 2 hours of gameplay before deciding he rather do something else.7 year old, enjoyed  a combined 6 hours of gameplay before deciding she rather do something else.5 year old, still can't get enough!Now that the intial fun is done with, I think the kids will still get enjoyment out of this from time to time.  The game takes NO parent assistance after kids get used how it works.If you have very conservative views on same sex marriage you may want to avoid as kids can pick either sex for marraige, i.e. men can marry men, women can marry women if selected.  I think it's great though, my kids got a kick out of being able to make the choice on thier own!"

It can be a fun family game, but only young kids will really enjoy the game.The game is fun to play with a group of kids. Adults may tire of the lack of any real interaction. There are times when you have to compete with others using the spinner and these events can be fun with a group.The biggest problem is the lack of interaction. You simply click the spinner and the pieces. By the end of the game, passing the mouse around can get kind tedious and boring. Maybe this is a problem of playing a board game on PC rather than in real life. In any case, you shouldn't come into this with lofty expectations."

No way to control the power of how you spin the wheel, and you can't save and quit your game either.  They did away with LIFE tiles and in place they have these cards that reward you either money, or force you to play a game where you spin the wheel and whoever lands on red gets money or the highest spin wins.  Finally when you get to choose your job, you only have a selection of 4 cards."

This 2016 edition finds a way to make the players feel like spectators and generally disjointed from the experience. I've owned several other PC versions of this board game that were way more interactive than this. I believe that Atari's 1999 version seriously blows this one out of the water which is sad considering technology has advanced SO much since then.There is very little that the user actually does then just click through dialogs. Some of the other editions find an interesting way to make you feel more attached to your choices. That is not the case with this 2016 edition- you choose a faceless peg and watch it drive around the board. To say there is no personality to this game is a gross understatement.The most cringey addition are the odd prompts they've added to LIFE cards. I awkwardly laughed through forced interactions like ""choose an opponent and compare your best karate chop"". We also had incredible difficulty with the spinner which probably accounted for an additional 15 minutes of gameplay. I was happy when the game was over and promptly returned it.I LOVE board games but I do not recommend this version at all. It seems like a shell of a game and even a bit transactional...which is not a feeling I attribute to fun."

I wouldn't pay $5 for a pile of dog crap even if it was on sale.  I almost didn't buy it when I read that it isn't the board from the actual board game of the same name, but it's certainly possible for the game's board to be improved as long as they hold to the original mechanics.  They don't.  And the result is a much flatter game without dynamic options like Promisary Notes and Stock purchases.As far as options go, you can adjust music and sound effect levels.  And while alt-return does activate windowed mode, you can't adjust the size of the window past its full-screen size.   The graphics have bright colors and sparkles, but no anti-aliasing, so it's a pretty rough clash.Lots of times the cards you get dealt from landing on tiles aren't up long enough for a slow reader like me to absorb.  Consequently during many of the unnecessary minigames I find myself saying, ""Wait, what the hell is going on?  What happened to the Game of Life?  Is it my turn?  Where did I set the bong?""In that light, I wouldn't recommend it even for a 5 year old, partly because of the game's assumption that you read quickly, and partly because a 5 year old can be amused by an empty egg carton.  The fact that a 5 year old finds the bright colors amusing in this game isn't a very good litmus test for the value of the game.Wouldn't recommend this game for 99 cents.  You might as well shove that dollar bill up your butt.  The sensation will be more pleasant."

Many years ago, I had a version of the Game of Life that I got literally from a cereal box, and it was one of my favourite games. I bought this one during the Summer Sale expecting that it would be similar, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. My older version had more interesting cutscenes/animations, more and much better minigames, and generally better content. This one was quite bland from a gameplay standpoint. Aside from the two minigames, everything was ""spin to find out how much you gain/lose"" and the same cards were shown repeatedly. There was a lot less variety in what could happen than in my previous verison of the game. I also didn't really like how it tried to enforce players to be social, by putting things on the cards such as ""hug everyone to say thanks"" or ""Describe your dream vacation and then spin the wheel."" Obviously I'm well above the target audience for the game, but I was hoping it would be more similar to the real-life board game. I'd recommend this only if you're looking for a quick, simple game but it isn't the most entertaining."

The core gameplay is there, with a couple additional options for flavor. Nothing exciting, just 2  options, that aren't really explained when mousing over them. There are instructions, which I didn't read, since I've played L.I.F.E for many years. My failure is not reading the docs. Theirs is not making mouse-over pop-up a small description.The game itself plays slowly. The actions (drawing a card, moving the car, spinning all take way too long. It's like the creator decide that since they drew all of these actions, you *will* be watching them, over and over and over and over.After the first 4-5 times, the animations and uninterruptable pacing makes the entire game feel slow. You can't skip anything, no matter how many times you've seen it.  I just wanted to play a game."

There was a lot added to make it feel unique, such as mini-games, video clips and cut scenes, an announcer.  It was pretty fun.While this version may stray a lot from its original counterpart, I don't really see that as a bad thing.  I will say that compared to the other computer version of this game, this one just feels kind of bare bones, but it does still have the charm of the original.The lack of online multiplayer is an odd choice, and I don't like the fact that the mini-games are exclusive to single player.  I would have also liked new themes or layouts of the board just to add a little more variety (much like Mario Party).Overall, I think that this is a pretty good game to play when you need to relax, because it is very easy to win, even against three AI players, and the mini-games are a joke (except for Spin to Win, which is just roulette)."

There seem to be only two minigames for the minigame spaces you can land on, and they are definitely not built for laptops with trackpads. They get old FAST. Would be nice if there was an option to turn off animations so you don't have to see the graduation/wedding/chilren animations over and over again for every player. By and large it has little to no replay value, much like pulling out the old hard copy of the board game. An occasional fun time.Note that online functionality seems to be COMPLETELY disabled/gone."

I had played and won games with 5 kids, no kids, having gone to college, been a farmer etc.If you have a spare wall in the house spend your $5 on a can of paint and watch that dry, it will be far more entertaining.
