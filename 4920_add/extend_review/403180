,Recommended,403180,18917877,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,KipofMudd,"First off, you move by clicking. I kind of hate that but that's personal taste.Secondly, you don't have to make a stick man for your character which is pretty great because I got to make a mudkip. ♥♥♥♥. Yes. The second character you make is more or less your enemy but I think you're trying to save him or something?The gameplay on the first level is alright. You pick up this green pencil thing and all of the trees that are missing leaves you kind of scribble on to add leaves to them. This then allows you to move some of the deadly sludge out of the way so you can progress or kill some enemies. That's right, no weapons on the first level unfortunately. However after you beat the first level if you don't like how your character looks or walks with animation you pick up a sketchbook which allows you to draw more characters or enemies. So don't fret to much if it looks clunky at first.Also, I really made this because I was trying to quit out of the game while I go smoke (so I wouldn't go over the two hours in case I ran into some reason to get a refund) and I could not find a quit button. I might be an idiot (hopefully) but i had to open up my task manager to quit the game which is a big no-no.Overall, this game being on sell for $3 seems well worth it unless I run into something awful, which I will immediately update this review with.Update:Okay. I had no clue this was a puzzle game. It might have been in the tags but I guess I missed it or something. The game is actually pretty thought provoking and continuously builds upon the abilities and mechanics you learn. You actually have to use your brain for some of the puzzles and there is some light comedic moments in this game as well.So far it seems like you will have to back track to get some of the unlockable items, which I despise being in games but whatever. And yes, there is no quit button, you're going to have to task manager to quit this gem. Also, you might want to mute the game while you play because the human-people-npc-guys make this squeaky noise that sounds absolutely awful...Overall I'd give it a 9/10 because it feels pretty unique in it's ideas and it's actually a good puzzle game.Update 2 that's not necessary:Well. It only took a little under 3 hours to beat the game 100%, which is a shame honestly. There's only eight levels apparently and none of them are particularly long if you have a good head on your shoulders. I believe this was a mobile port as well since it has a pop up window asking you to rate it, and then it has a big♥♥♥♥♥button on the home menu that brings you to their website and reads ""play more games.""I'd say buy it for the $3 but the full asking price is kind of pushing it. This is steam, not a phone or tablet. If you think you'd let your little sister or brother play this game after you beat it and you know how to erase all of your stuff so as they can start out fresh, then I'd say get it at the full price but $3 is honestly more than enough for this game, regardless of how much I love being a mudkip with a lightsaber."

It is more for relaxing and fun, and hilarious too.First in the game you customize you own character, well draw you own character. You can make it ANYTHING you want, I saw ppl drew minions lol. Some colors are locked and you need to collect the color dude (not sure what's that called) in the game to unlock more. One thing I want complain though, my drawing tablet doesn't work! I was going to draw some fancy stuff but somehow this game just not compatible with it.The game itself is kinda short, you can probably finish it in like 3hrs or so if you are not up to collecting everything. There are extra stuff that can be collected if you replay the game after finishing it. The plot is similiar to the last one where yr gril/boy got kidnapped and u need to get her/him back.Overall, it's great. Very amusing. Maybe a 8/10"

In this game, if you want to unlock everything, you have to get to the end and then use all the crayons you have gathered to do things you have yet to do. Collect crayons through out the game that do different things,  so you can draw your way through these puzzles. At the beggining, you draw yourself and a friend(which becomes evil,), and your quest is to save your friend.9/10 because I really wish,(even though it might be sopposed to be simple,) that there was more to it, more levels, and harder puzzles. Plus, I also want to be able to save the friend I make so they are not evil anymore.Thanks for reading my post :D"
