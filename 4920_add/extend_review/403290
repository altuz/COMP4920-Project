,Recommended,403290,25769255,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Admiral Teddy,"Burly Men at Sea,This game can be summerized as an interactive story with gorgeous visuals and calming sounds.In short, it'll be a game that you can play during your down time to take your mind off the events of the day and just relax a little.The game works like this: you, the 3 brothers, are inside a circle, which is your view of the world, by dragging this imaginary circle left or right, you explore the world and find new adventures. The game isn't linear, it has a number of branches and stories that you can explore, each with their own tales.The writing is amazing, although it's more or less a series of short stories, I really appriciate it. There are some funny jokes and some serious moments which all together set a beautiful tone to the world. Mix that with the wonderful sounds and music (and trust me you will enjoy this part a lot) and the wonderful, colorful minimalistic visuals and you end up with a true indie gem.Now to my understanding this isn't a very long game as you can tell from the price but it isn't lacking. Considering the gorgeous artstyle, sounds and the charming writing I think it's worth the price point and it should give you around 2-3 hours of entertainment.What you need to know is that this isn't a game for everyone, this is a series ""of soft-choice based intractive short stories"" so that's up to you to decide if that description is appealing to you or not.When i say ""A series of soft-choice based interactive short stories"" I mean that you make choices that shape different adventures and branch a path for you, however in the end once one adventure is over, you end up looping around to start another.This game isn't a ""oh you died cause bad choices scenario"", hence why i used ""soft-choice based"" as the description.Your choices still matter and give you different and unique paths and different stories, but it's more like a series of short adventures rather than a really driven out novel with major choices that drag on and affect you later on.So in short, some of the choices you might make are as simple as going left or going right and this'll give you a new adventure based on what you chose.I hope this serves as a good description for someone looking to buy this game and that if you're interested in that type of game, ends up as a buying point for you.Finally I'd just like to point out, there is a mobile version of this game as well, which you might find more suited to you. (since it'll be swiping left and right instead of dragging the screen with a mouse)In any case, buckle up and enjoy this one :)"

Nary a one.Super-whizzy realistic graphics? Definitely not.But if you've got any child left in you, any fondness for simple, charming stories, you'll love it. I did.For those that are old enough to remember (cough), it feels like a whimsical version of the old ""Fighting Fantasy"" books where you make a decision and then get told to turn to page 120 for the next bit of the story. Nothing nearly that forced here, it's all beautiful, smooth, stylish animation telling a seamless story which weaves in and out of almost invisible choices. And it means that the next time I play it, there will be a different story told.And pay attention to the backgrounds... Poke a puffin, tickle a chicken, furtle with fish.Beautiful, charming, childish, innocent. Not words you usually associate with video games, but this one deserves them all. It made me happy."

The art style is so simplisticlly unique and the soundtrack itself deserves an award. It's not about getting through the game, it's about the narrative that guides you. Well done Brain & Brain.

I wasn't sure what to expect but the price and the presentation drew me in. It is essentially an interactive story that encourages the player to try different outcomes and explore the world in as many ways possible. The writing is well done and very amusing. It fits in well with the quirky style of the environment. Overall I just found the whole experience relaxing and fun.There is no tutorial or directions that I saw but it is simple enough to catch on to the point and click (and drag?) style of mechanics. Saying to much though could give away the charm of discovering this little world for yourself. Very glad I gave it a go and would highly recommend it.

And that's all there is to say.Enjoyable in every way, but I think it should cost way less.Now that you know that and you can see, how much time I spent on the game,decide for yourself.(The mouse control sucks, by the way: sometimes the burly men move, sometimes they don't, sometimes you can move the screen, sometims you can't; after trying for some time, it works, but often not in the first place.)What makes me a little bit angry: Spoiler ahead:So, it seemed like there would be a little more to the story: you are told, you can return to the island, if you want, for more adventures; OK, so I returend and wow, you can visit the homepage, enter a code and voila, surprise, surprise, the secret is, you can pre-order a book.Great art; so it seemed, but now I feel ripped of.The devs perhaps should leave their narcissism behind and think about, what they really gave the ""player"". And, if they promise a secret in the game, it should be in the game. Shame on you!You already know how advertisment works; but that your materialistic paradigm destroys the positive message of the game, do you know that, too?What the devs real profession is/was, I don't know, but this ""game"" seems like something graphic designers would do, to make maximum money with minimum effort. They are able to design sound, visuals et cetera, for the effect to get the buyer hooked and that he wants more. Then he can buy the book, the soundtrack and perhaps some other upcoming gimmicks.Give kids candy with a nice story and then suck them dry. ♥♥♥♥ you!"

This game really is beautiful, both visually and accoustically.Be aware that's it's a very short game, even including replaying it to see all the different routes. It can feel slow when going after completion, since you will be repeating scenes which take their own sweet time to unfold. Emphasis on the ""peaceful"" I mentioned at the beginning. You're on a sweet, strange little journey around your corner of the ocean, not on a swashbuckling adventure.The controls were the only part of the experience I found unpleasant. They were definitely intended for a touch screen, not for a mouse (certainly no keyboard!), since the only ways to interact with the world are tapping, holding, and dragging."
,Recommended,403290,33896090,Posted: 29 July,all,ElusiveOne,"Burly Men at Seais the sort of peculiar object you admire for its excellent craftsmanship and distinguished features without really understanding or fully appreciating it. An endearing curiosity.The game unfolds as a charming storybook divided into a dozen or so interwoven vignettes, with a subdued art style befitting nursery walls, particularly outstanding writing and entrancing music.The result is resolutely cute but not terribly exciting mainly due to its insubstantial format. Most scenes basically offer two exclusive paths, which implies multiple playthroughs to experience all alternatives; a fine prospect save for the emerging repetitiveness.""We meet again, bearded travelers.""Choices begin to feel inconsequential when trapped in a perpetual loop with no proper ending outside a minor acknowledgement once all paths have been crossed. All are a collection of attractive and fairly original ideas but undeservedly underdeveloped.Playthroughs run between 10 and 30 minutes each, approximating 3 hours to travel all possible paths. Pacing is slow with sometimes uneventful moments to appreciate the stillness.The game operates on original mechanics that contribute to its creativity, such as the action of stretching panoramas to move characters. Other actions feel somewhat more encumbered until you realize they require holding and dragging.PositiveAbsolutely splendid writing (every single word is perfect)Playful and impressive soundtrackArtistically uniqueOriginal vignettesNegativeRepetitive short runs don't suitably expand the game's folkloreLacks a main plot device and proper endingA whole village and other areas exist without purposeThis charismatic title certainly appeals to a discerning audience. A personalized hardback book that covers one playthrough can be ordered on the game's web site – a particularly appealing but overpriced proposition, much like the game itself."

You click in objects and interact with people but in my playthrough I couldn't see any important choices. True that I only played(though I finished it) it once but it was very boring so I don't feel like playing it again. It's soo boring to drag the screen to see the characters moving around. The art and the writting are good but believe me, not good enough to compensate the boring gameplay this game has. It fails in keeping the player interested in what is happening which seems like a fail to a adventure game. I can't recommend it."

This game, however, feels like something made for young children that the usual bunch of unemployed millennial game reviewers and philosophers took as being the deepest thing they'd seen in months.Basically, the game is a visual novel but instead of just clicking through, you slide your mouse to reveal more of the screen. You can click on some things which make noises, and then you move on to the next part of the story. There's no gameplay whatsoever here - and again, I don't necessarily mind that. I've played Kentucky Route Zero and Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP, both of which were basically the same thing.What I do mind is that this is a port of a mobile game at twice the price ($10 on PC compared to $5 on mobile), controls like crap (seriously it's just ""translate touchscreen to mouse, done"") and is not worth the money.
