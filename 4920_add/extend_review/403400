The border is way too large, xbox one controller dead zone bug is alive and well (always the sign of great qa for a game), resolution issues, menus that even a console game would scoff at. Its a mess.Which is a shame given how many times this game has been ported well. Even the nes version was better.Why they keep going for cash grabs with the poor ports over the great stuff they did with games like Namco Museum and Namco Legends back in the ps2 era is beyond me.Avoid unless you enjoy playing dig dug with a keyboard's arrow keys while in a window that isnt made for any resolution of monitor on the planet.At least it looks like Dig Dug, and the music is spot on, thats about the only positive."

Nothing's changed in the 30+ years it's been around, and that's probably a good thing.  For a game you can probably find on Google and play for free, the price is a bit steep, especially since it doesn't come with any old instruction booklets or concept sketches, like Megaman Legacy Collection does, but it's finally a proper port of Dig Dug.  And it works, too.  Someone at Bandai-Namco finally saw the light and made an actual working port of an old arcade game.I'll add this to my ever-growing collection in a vain attempt to make a steam museum."

Instead of killing enemies with fruits like in Mr. Do though, you inflate them. This is quite a fun game, and somewhat hard. Even robot chicken did a funny sketch about this game. Be aware this clip may not be good for children:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFkda8N7cCQBE aware this game does not support widescreen pc monitors. That is why there is cabinent artwork on the wide area's of the screen. This artwork is original arcade cabinent art also.Anyways, again, like Mr. Do, and such games like Pac-Man, these games i actually played in the arcade. Recommended for fun and simplicity of game."

(Need to Alt+F4 or end process)-No key mapping-No Fullscreen option (have to use Alt+Enter)-No 360 arcade stick support (Mad Catz stick vetical axis is flipped, PS3 one works perfectly)-Analog Stick deadzone is awful, often moves left while entering no input-Needlessly massive downloads for such small games (800mb+)Game's themselves are fine, but these shells they are in are atrocious. Some very basic functions have been missed and basic input support has not been offered. Unless these aren't fixed quickly, then I would suggest avoiding these or getting a refund if you have already purchased them."

There's an online leaderboard and plenty of options for adjusting the game screen. You dig through the map and murder every monster while aiming for the high score. Dig Dug games have always been a personal favorite of mine, I'd love to see Mr. Driller hit Steam some day."

Its exactly what youd expect.A few minor issues... Like no fullscreen... and how the store page doesnt tell you that it has controller support. Little problems, but still a great port.*edit*It does have controller support, but it doesnt mention it at all."

Ms Pacman, I don't have it)Most negative reviews complains about an arcade game being an arcade game, I haven't got a single issue with the performance and most features are bonuses to the original arcade version (being able to pick up the round, select an amount of score to get a 1-up and a few other settings such as scalines and zooming the screen)People who says ""just get an emulator"" have absolutely no idea of what they are talking about since the Arcade Game Series includes a couple of bonuses and runs via a game engine, it is not an emulator like some Steam games did -->http://store.steampowered.com/app/364840/N2O_Nitrous_Oxide/(it runs directly off a Ps1 emu)I've ever seen some idiots who complained about the game not supporting 16:9 when.. it's AN ARCADE GAME"

,Recommended,403400,31105901,Posted: 12 April,all,thecommanderox csgolive.com,"What an amazing classic. I am very happy this game came to steam, you really can't buy it anywhere else (legally). Except if you could play it in bars like I do sometimes. $4($0.99 on sales) may sound steep at first, but very worth it considering the cost of buying it elsewhere.I like it has achievements, and the background of the game is cool too.My two complaints are the size(mostly unity) and the fact it doesn't have trading cards or such. It would be cool to have trading cards, badges, emoticons, and backgrounds for all the arcade classics games.Overall, if your a fan of dig dug get it immediatley. If you wanna save some money, wait for a sale and get the arcade classics bundle.9.5/10 - file size really brings it down."

76561198282180274,Recommended,403400,29890673,Posted: 12 February,all,tblockset,While many ports of this game suffer from processor speeds that differ from the original (NES port in particular. nearly all online emulators use the NES version). smaller screen size(Gameboy and GBA) or poor graphics(Mac/commodore/Atari ect.) This port does not have any of these problems. It plays exactly like the original arcade cabinet. So if It doesn't feel right this is probably the reason.Some may find backgrounds annoying but I personally don't mind.If the price seems a little steep don't worry there is quality here. Most free ports use the NES version and it's one of the worst ports of this game. Your money will be well spent.If you have never played DIG DUG before I highly recommend it. It's a fun and addictive maze game and in my opinion the best game of all time.occasionally the sound will start to make you think those creepypastas you read on liner were true but the problem fixes after you restart the game.

Whatever flaws are here are pretty small I think. I have no problem playing games like this with the arrow keys. It's Dig Dug and it's still tons of fun.
,Recommended,403400,31307160,Posted: 22 April,all,CyanJDroid,"Let’s be honest here. It’s Dig Dig. That’s pretty much it. As far as I can tell (and remember), it’s pretty much identical to the version I played as a child on Namco Museum for the PlayStation. The addition of achievements are nice, and they pose a nice challenge, but beyond that it’s just a proper PC port of the classic game. It could have better support for Steam Controllers, but that’s only a minor issue as Steam allows pretty much universal customization of controller inputs. Provides a good amount of nostalgia personally as I grew up with the game, and it’s nice to have the arcade classic readily playable in my Steam library."

It runs on Namco Galaga hardware, and was published outside Japan by Atari, Inc.. The objective of Dig Dug is to eliminate underground dwelling monsters by inflating them with an air pump until they explode, or by dropping rocks on them."
