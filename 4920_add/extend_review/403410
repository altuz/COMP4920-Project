,Not Recommended,403410,22539104,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,FleetCommand,"Update - Apr. 26.To be fair to Namco, they released a patch today which allows us to turn off bezel art. If some of the other things would be fixed too, I'd change my review to ""recommended""Later updateThankfully later on we got another update for the series. Finally they added a ""Quit game"" option to the menu and the possibility to hide the keyboard prompts while playing so your gamefield won't be covered. So this review got a little bit out of date, but I'll keep the original text there just for the record.Original review follows:DisclaimerThe sad thing that this review can be applied to the whole ""Arcade Game Series"" collection since they all have the same pros and cons.We go retro, don't we?The other day I was thinking""Okay, we haveAtari Vaultand that's a great retro collection. I wish other companies would do the same and finally a nice Galaga or Ms. Pac-Man would arrive to the PC."".Then I come home and what do I see? Bandai Namco just released my favorite games!Instabuy. Then disappointment.What I love about the game?Nice emulationSolid gameplayThe controls feels goodAchievementsOnline leaderboardsScanlines can be turned onWhat makes it a lazy port?If you go full-screen, the ""bezel art"" goes behind the playfield, so the sharp corners of the playfield become visibleTo go to full screen, you have to press Alt+Enter. No menu option to do that.Can't turn off ""bezel art"" (or ""background"", as this game calls it)No volume sliders. In a 2016 release.The only way to quit the games is to press Alt+F4. I'm serious. No menu option. Nothing. If you play in windowed mode, you can just click X, but in full screen? No chance.Keyboard prompts everywhere. Even if you use the controller, it shows keyboard keys on the screen. You need to use at least 10 different keys to adjust the screen size/position, but you cannot do that with a controller. Even if you can, the game won't tell you how.You can ""zoom in"" the screen for the games to utilize your screen space. But if you zoom in, the always visible ""press esc to go to the pause menu"" prompt covers the bottom right corner of the playfield. WTF?I can't see the dots I'm eating in Pac-Man.You have to watch the ""when this icon shows up don't turn off your computer"" screen every time you start the games and you need to press a key for it to go awayJust nitpicking, but why does it appear FULL CAPS in the Steam Library? I have all four games in the collection and it looks horrible.SummaryWhichever game you choose from Arcade Game Series, you get a great game. You get a lot of fun and great emulation. But the overall quality is not acceptable for a brand new release in 2016.If you just want a few nice arcade retro games but don't eager to have Pac-Man or Galaga, check out Atari Vault. If you want Pac-Man, well, unfortunately you have no other option. Pac-Man Museum is even worse."

In a way, there are a few differences between this game and the pac-man game on here. For example, there are walking fruits in this version that move around the maze..in original pac-man, they just spawn in at one location. The mazes are also different from the original pac-man.Be aware that this game does not have widescreen support, and it uses actual cabinent art from the original arcade game, including alternate ones. Still, this game is very fun. If you played this originally in the 1980's, i think it came out around 1984 i believe, and still remember this game, i suggest getting it.I recommend for nostalgia value and good old clean arcade fun! Also, this is a clean game and even young children can play this game without worry."

,Recommended,403410,29322163,Posted: 17 January,all,dialbolic1971,Awesome love this game i use to play it after school at our local arcade in the 80's. This sure does bring back the memories i highly recommend this game compared to the quaters i spent playing the original arcade this is a steal. Now i need all my quarters back lol. Introduce your children what video games was all about and where it began.

76561198075673573,Recommended,403410,35325984,Posted: 30 September,all,wrygrass,"I rate the game ARCADE GAME SERIES: Ms. PAC-MAN 3/5. Okay.If, on your computer, you want to play Ms. Pac-Man EXACTLY as it appeared in the arcade with very few frills or fringe benefits (other than a few steam awards and some fun alternate settings which, incidentally, will prevent you from earning any steam awards if you modify them away from their default paramaters) then this game is for you.However, even given what it attempts to achieve, this game is far from perfect. The system requirements for this game are stupidly high given what this game allows you to do and it says nothing about whether the game is designed to run on a smart phone (which would be cool if it does). Why does Ms. Pac-Man need 2000 megabytes of RAM? Why does it need at least a 2.3 Ghz processor? These system specs are completely insane for a game of such utter simplicity.Sure, this game runs fine on my computer but that's entirely missing the point. Ms. Pac-Man should have been designed to run fine on ANY remotely modern electronic device which has any kind of screen and some sort of controls. The fact that the game designers didn't purposefully attempt to reach a far wider audience (all phone users which exist) is baffling and absurd. This version's designers simply weren't ambitious enough and somehow caused this game to have system requirements which were completely undreamt of when this game first came out (the year 1982) and that seems to me to be either a little crazy or very lazy.I wish this game's requirements simply said ""Any electronic device which has any kind of operating system which has been made since the year 1990."" That would have been a cool programming achievement to attempt but Nooo! The makers of this version didn't even try to get close to that fairly obvious concept. What's next in the future, a classic version of Ms. Pac-Man that requires two GTX Titans? Or worse still, a quantum computer?"

76561198048801395,Not Recommended,403410,29026018,Posted: 4 January,all,TechnoSyndrome,"Deadzone issues make this unplayable with a controller. Ms. Pac-Man constantly moves to the right if I'm not moving the control stick in another direction, and going up only works half the time as the right movement constantly overrides it. No actual control options so I can't just remap movement to the D-Pad to fix this. Game came out in April 2016 so it's obviously not getting fixed at this point. Avoid."

76561198059769762,Recommended,403410,22603704,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Garrett,"Graphically, a very good rendition of the arcade game.  Best I've played on PC.   Emulation could still use a bit of work. At least for me, it felt like controllers needed a bit of work.  I use a wired 360 controller and there seemed to be a bit of lag at times or it wants to go upwards on its own.  After playing a few games, it nearly makes it unplayable when it goes up when you want to stay still or go in a different direction. Also frustrating when you try to move and it does nothing.   Great deal for a bit of nostalgia.  but as far as a functioning game, it needs work."
