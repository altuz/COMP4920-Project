However there's no joystick deadzone, so if your joystick isn't PERFECTLY centered at rest then you'll be unable to control your ship properly.Come on, who forgets to put decent joystick support in an arcade game?- Can't rebind keyboard keysJust...why?- Poor fullscreen supportFull screen isn't an option in the display settings, but you can make the game fullscreen by pressing ALT+Enter.  If you do that however, you won't be able to quit the game without pressing ALT+F4 to close it or by taking it out of fullscreen with ALT+Enter to bring back the X in the upper right corner.- Doesn't work well in Steam Big Picture modeThis is related to the above point and again, this is something that does work with fiddling.  It just doesn't work like it should.If you put the game in fullscreen mode with ALT+Enter, then close the game it will open in fullscreen next time you open it.  If you do that before starting Big Picture mode then the game will start in full screen on your TV.  However since there's no quit button inside the game you'll have to use Big Picture's 'Close Game' option to make the game close.I'm using a TV set up as a second monitor.  If you're using a Steam Link or Steam Box I don't know if this will work or not."

There have been remakes of this game in the arcades, and even found in collections for ps2,3 and xbox360. Although the versions are different for the game, the game remains at it's heart, a shmup. As this is the original version of it found in the arcades, don't expect anything spectacular.

There is no mouse support-which, really I'm using a computer why should any program I'm using (which was also put out directly for PC) bar me from using my mouse.  I could even see the scroll wheel as being an effective way to move the space-ship, but oh well.  You can't rebind keyboard either, so if you're not into space bar and arrows, ♥♥♥♥ you... which once again, why?  People should be able to choose a setup that feels ergonomic for them.Considering Galaga has been put out in many collections for consoles and has probably sold enough copies, not to mention the amount of money Bandai NAMCO is worth, I don't think they need to charge more than $2 for this, if even that. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I think they should give it out for free considering how long it took to get a legitimate PC version that offers the original arcade experience.Beyond all that... it's offensive to take this long to release this game without having it be an absolutely perfect port and exactly what the community wants.  Otherwise, why are you charging us AGAIN for something we've already paid for in 5 different ways or with 1,000 different quarters.Seriously.  How long have we had to endure the half-fun abomination that is PAC-Man DX+ or whatever that nonsense is, just because actual ♥♥♥♥ing PAC-Man wasn't available?  And now they want our money again...Anyways, it's Galaga, if you know what it is, you'll dig it.

It plays exactly like the arcade original. However, I don't like the fact that the fire button is defaulted to the oversized spacebar. By default, the game is meant to be played with the left hand utilizing the movement of the ship (ie the arrow keys for example) and the right hand pushing a button to fire. This will require a player to have to ""cross his hands"" in order to use his right hand to press the spacebar. My suggestion is to allow the player to map any key he wants for movement as well as firing. Otherwise, change the default button to fire to say the Enter key on the number pad. Overall, this is a great game and the way it's set up now, didn't keep me from scoring 999,990, taking the top spot on the learderboard as well as completing successfully all 20 achievments in the game."

The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to crash into them. In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, or being captured."

OK.This is a fairly classic, fairly well-done and straight forward port of the original arcade game with very few bells and whistles. The game runs well but the control scheme keys cannot be remapped to other keys and there is no online multiplayer functionality.+Classic arcade game graphics which include borders around the main screen which display the original arcade game cabinet art. The graphics seem very true to the original.+The game runs fast with no freezes or hiccups that I noticed.+/-Fairly intuitive and responsive default controls but they cannot be re-mapped to other keys and they do not conform to the control schemes of many other, newer schmups. Most notably, the fire button is mapped to the spacebar and cannot be changed to the Z key which is continuously irritating to me.-Can only get steam achievements by using default difficulty and extra life settings which are fairly hard.-Does not appear to be capable of any 2 player mode for online matches with other players.-Very few bells and whistles or additional features or extras. It's pretty much just Galaga and a few basic menu options. It may be a bit overpriced when it's not on a special steam sale.-Why does this game need 2 GB of RAM?-Why does this game require a processor of 2.3 Ghz?-Why aren't the installation options for this game far more flexible? This game should be advertised as being capable of being run on nearly any smartphone and the fact that this port does not actively support this as an option seems like a terrible oversight, particularly for such an old, relatively simple piece of software."

I was a kid just tall enough to put my quarter in and play the Space Invaders cabinet when it first arrived in the foyer of our Hills Dept. Store. Way before anyone was thinking about an official arcade with dozens of games lined up side by side and a couple of change machines in the corner. Also really happy these authentic classics are available for today's gamers to experience. Especially since 2D and scroller games with 8 bit graphics have made a big comeback.

It's such an amazing 80's arcade game ('81 so very early 80's). The arcade version is perfect, but the Steam version is a port, don't expect perfection when you buy, but flaws are very minor.I tried playing with my arcade stick (Hori RAP 4 Kai) and it worked, but, if you move the joystick left or right nothing happens. You have to move the joystick up and down to get your fighter to move left or right...which is a little weird.My stick is modded to play 3d fighting games though (Tekken). I have a Korean joystick, so playing Galaga doesn't feel as good as it does on an arcade cabinet. Playing on the keyboard works perfectly fine, no weird inputs and it doesn't work bad, imo. Keyboard is more sensitive, but not that bad.You might be able to use something like Joy to Key to get the arcade stick to work. I haven't tried yet.Not a terrible port, imo"

Is it actively trying to download content to play?As others have mentioned, this needs work as far as controls go. Not a whole lot of options there. Music is choppy/stuttered in the beginning, not sure why. Video settings need more options. Not everyone has a wide screen LCD. Please update with meaningful fixes for all the the above."

Well, sure, you can do that. But honestly, what's the difference between any other version of Galaga and the Steam version? Well, it's only a small fraction but you can actually read a fun little in-game ""how to play"" manual. Super simple and easy to learn (Always wanted to know how to get those double ships.) And last but not least we finally have an official Steam leaderboards for Galaga. Which is a hueg deal for shmup fans.Other than these small little changes everything from Galaga is intact. I primarily mostly got it for the leaderboards. If that's what you're wanting then I would pick this game up.Edit: ACHIEVEMENTS! How can I forget you?! There's also achievements in this game.Edit 2: Yeah lack of a controller support only seems to work only with Xbox controllers. I still don't mind it since you only move left and right and hit the fire button. arcade sticks I wouldn't even bother."

My favorite arcade game of all time. Buy it for nostalgia but it doesn't play well on PC. Thank goodness we still have an original X-Box with the Namco disc at home just for Galaga and  a Dave & Buster's down the road if I want to go old school arcade machine.

I've played before the emulation of this game through MAME many years back and have even played on a true cabinet a couple times. This PC port matches just about every bit of the original arcade version, nigh perfection. What's really not to like about that?Port it on over to Steam, give it some achievements to unlock, some nice background artwork and keep the game intact! That's how you do ports.Heavily recommended if you adore arcade classics like good ol' Galaga!"

First, it is a protrayal of the 2nd edition Galaga, the one that did not let you put as many missiles in space as possible.  This one only allows two.   Also the controller and fire button are reversed from the stand up.  With the stand up, you move with your left hand and fire with your right.Also, I am not the first reviewer that commented that there is a certain amount of pizza grease required on the control stick you get that fine tuned control necessary when playing beyond level 10 and 20.   BTW, I still cannot get to my high of level 27.......sigh...the ravages of ages.For less than a dollar, this game is a no brainer.  Be warned, though, I started telling my wife ""Just one more game and I will be ready to go""........ a line she heard many times before back in the 80s."

However, the aforementioned criticism about the sound is true: It sounds like an old record with how it's starting up, & the ""pew-pews"" could be sounding more vibrant. I really hope this gets patched. Nevertheless, it's Galaga for sure & I had a nostalgic blast from the past, but I give an 8/10 for botching the sound."

I ran into both video (slow motion) & sound (fixed by relaunching game) glitches, but neither ruined the experience for me.It would have been nice if it supported DirectInput devices directly since I have several of them, but that can be circumvented with a program like Joy2Key.I got the series in a recent sale that priced them at about $1 each.The decision NOT to include Ms. Pac-Man in the bundle and making it a 4-in-1 is curious though.
