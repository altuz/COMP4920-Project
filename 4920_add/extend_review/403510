The first game was ok, I like the “mini HOGs” in the inventory but this game takes it too far; everything is hidden (need something simple? Well you’re in bad luck because you gotta find every f*cking atom of what you need), and most of time totally blended with the background and almost impossible to find. It saddens me to give this one a thumbs down, especially because I really like Artifex. But damn, this game p*ssed me off.2/10. Get only in a bundle if possible."

It says fullscreen is optimized for widescreen but the images are a bit pixelated and grubby at fullscreen. However it won't be so bad as to stop gameplay. It does not have location hints or a travel map but in casual mode the hints button recharges pretty quickly.This game is good for the price and will provide a couple hours of entertainment. The voice overs are not too bad and the story is good.For the value it's worth it but would not buy it at full price. The 40% discount was nice.

I wanted to try this one, published (it's the keyword) by Artifex Mundi on Steam. And you can't see that it's not them that developed it.Your role is to search who is the hooded man that is trying to bring back giants on Earth (or into that magical world, choose what you want). Based on the fairy tale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", you're going to search for beans, guardians, a traitor and a way to save Jack and stop that terrible plan.While the story is good - I enjoyed it, the gameplay only suffers of some well-hidden objects. But that's where the frustration begins. I rarely hit the hint button during a HO game. In fact, I refrain myself to do it in a game with achievements included. Unfortunately, I was forced here to do it because of these needed items to advance in the story. And it's the same for the HO scenes. There is also a lot of objects that need to be ""repaired"", making you go slower for the achievement where you have to find everything under a minute. You will probably unlock it in a second playthrough, after keeping somewhere in your head their locations.And while the graphics are really correct, though not transcending, I was disappointed in the soundtrack: I already heard it in another HO. Yet, well, it's a good track.Another thing with the gameplay is that it's different in the main game and in the bonus chapter. The main game is showing you a list of items to find from a scene to another to build what you need - and these items become clickable when you find the use for them. The bonus chapter is more behaving like any other HO game: you don't need to find that this item will help you to click on it, you can collect it without the knowledge.While I'll recommend the game, I'll advise you to get it with a discount - I don't think it's worthy of 10 bucks. The -40% discount for the launch was already a better price but this game will probably drop lower, so I suggest you to wait until it's 2 or 3 bucks."
76561198195170475,Recommended,403510,22820794,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Ginger P.,"This will be a slightly new interface for those of you who follow Artifex Mundi. And if you're married to other iterations it may initially feel awkward and contrived. Every scene is now a hidden object scene -- the story will not progress until you find the specific items in play. Frustratingly, and as other reviewers have pointed out, there may be objects in plain sight that you know you will want (at some point) to pick up, but those objects will not be available until you open the part of the story to which they apply. Well, you'll just have to come back. Indeed, if you treat this as the casual game that it is, you will enjoy the game flow, graphics and voice acting, and small surprises. This game is clearly about the journey -- which is predetermined, of course, but enjoyable nonetheless."
,Not Recommended,403510,29532316,Posted: 27 January,all,Sugarstar,"This hidden object game has an extremely annoying mechanic: You're not allowed to pick up items until you have found the puzzle they go with. So you look at a room full of puzzle pieces and obvious things to click on, but you can select none of them. Several locations later, you find the puzzle, and you have to go back to all the places you've already been and find all the items you've already seen.Also, when you have to find several puzzle pieces to complete, say, a torn tapestry, you don't actually get a minigame puzzle to put it together. There are numerous opportunities for puzzles in this game that are never utilized. The puzzles that are there are laughably easy, even on expert mode.The gameplay in this one is especially frustrating.  The art, especially in the moon kingdom, however, was stunning."

So this bit I already tried top pickup 45 mins ago, was it back 1, 2, or 3 panels. because now I need it to progress the story?Had lots of potential, amd extremely pleasant on the eye, but there are better games in this genre, try ""Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink""."

,Recommended,403510,23477441,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,DocCovington,"Another must-buy from Artifex MundiI have only started this game but am already in love with it: the atmosphere, the music, the graphics, the characters. So many wonderful scenarios, underlined by a beautiful orchestral soundtrack. Did I mention the sky is in motion? Yep. This game is eye, ear and mind candy.On the technical side of things, the UI is really intelligent! How you unlock things in order to proceed through the story is truly encouraging your investigative nature. You never feel stuck and always get excited when you make a new discovery.Honorable mention: achievements are kept to the basics, which takes that particular pressure off you so you can focus on the actual story and gameplay and the mystery aspect of the game.A true gem in the HO genre. Artifex Mundi has had quite a few mediocre, rather sloppily developed releases, but I suppose those are necessary to finance the bigger projects -- like this one."
76561198073445985,Not Recommended,403510,18841572,"Posted: 2 November, 2015",all,FranklynStreet,"Another inferior Artifiex Mundi game not developed by Artifex Mundi.There are some minor egg collectibles to search for, and, in the main, game, very few hidden object searches (about 5-7), which seems odd for a hidden object game.  There's also an odd inventory system where, in order to do anything, you need to find multiple objects throughout the environment to build any object needed.  It essentially makes the inventory system into mini-hidden object games, and becomes the primary gameplay of the game.  What's strange is that this system is abandoned in the bonus chapter for a conventional inventory system, and makes it feel somewhat arbitrary, as if the game developers ran out of money to program the entire game as intended.   The bonus chapter also features more hidden object scenes than the full game.It's not a bad game, and some of the inventory/hidden object puzzles are pretty tough.  But for whatever reasons, perhaps as a result of a rather thin and uninspired storyline, the game feels pretty underwhelming.  It's also a short game.  I have 6.3 hours clocked, and that's for both the main game and the bonus, and a good chunk of that was the game being left on during The Leftovers, The Affair, and Homeland where I wasn't playing the game much, if at all.5/10"

When going through the various scenes, som objects were clearly something to pick up - except that is not possible until you got the proper 'quest' for it aka 'gather the required things to do xyz'. Really annoying. Strangely that was not implemented in the bonus story, but by that time I really didn't care much."

I never really felt invested in the game, mentally or emotionally, and completed it just to complete it, as opposed to finding out what happens in the story. Not the best Artifax Mundi has published."

I enjoyed having hidden object scences with a bit more purpose, and was sad that the bonus chapter was back to normal. However, more puzzles would be nice and just a more extensive main game. I finished both in 3 hours, which is way below my average game time. I would enjoy if there where more games coming with the new set up. It is a bit more involving, which is nice, as HOG tend to not have very involving story lines.If you want a quick game for and an evening or afternoon, this is perfect."

You can't pick up the items you need until you know that you need them by clicking on the area that needs something done to it.  For example, you have to click on a pile of dirt before you can pick up the shovel.  There are at least 2 items needed to pick up for each ""puzzle"".  the one thing i did not like was that all items needed would not show at the same time so you had to click on a separate tab of the inventory to see what you needed.  There is a map that you can click on to move from area to area which is really nice.  I would give it a 6.5 out of 10."

It treats each map location as a mini hidden object scene which is a cool idea. Overall it is a decent enough hidden object, nothing amazing."

76561198056223771,Recommended,403510,33952573,Posted: 1 August,all,Ninshubur,"FTM 2: The Beanstalk is a wonderful HOG.  Every scene in it is actually a hidden object scene.  You need to remember what is scattered about, as you cannot pick objects up until you have established a need for them by advancing the plot.  This is probably the toughest HOG I've played.  I've never had to hit the hint button so many times!The plot is childish and predictable, yet engaging.  Jack, magic beans, giant ... you know how this goes.  The flow of the story is smooth and the art is beautiful.  Yet another thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing offering from Artifex Mundi!"
