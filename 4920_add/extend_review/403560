,Not Recommended,403560,18268820,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,brodivh,"The permadeath sounds like a good idea...until touch a zombie, die, have to watch a game over screen that takes far too long to get through, and then start over right back at the beginning. Starting over means doing the exact same things you already did in the same order you already did them.If there were randomized elements or at least some sort of checkpoint system it would make the game enjoyable. Think of it like the movie Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray can alter the rest of the day just by making a different choice. There will be none of that in Eaten Alive, as it's straight forward mirroring what you've done and hoping you don't get within spitting distance of a zombie before you can get to that point (and a little further) all over again.As far as death, you only have to graze a zombie and it is INSTANT death. There's no trying to push it away, no kicks to topple them over - you're just 100% done.I like the idea of RPG Maker games that aren't the standard RPG, such as horror or mystery/adventure. So, with that being the point of interest for me, I went ahead and played this long enough to get a feel for it. I'll play it some more later, but I just hope the repetitiveness isn't going to keep me from getting at least a little fun.So, if you don't care about doing♥♥♥♥♥♥over, and over, and over, and over, buy it, it's otherwise decent. But my final verdict is that some changes need to be made by the developer before it's going to be a recommendable game."

I also think that if you die the save should  be erased so you cant go back, thus keeping permadeath. I dont the dev doesnt realizes is that alot of us have things to do, whether it be work, school, social life etc. and cant keep this game running all day till we're able to play again.I mean I think Ive barely cratched the surface of content this game has to offer, and props to the dev for making it so, but I had to stop playing because I had to go to work, and when I came home and booted the game up, I had to start over. And I REALLLLY dont wanna do the crap I have already done again.I mean think of a survival game, like Day Z for instance. If you log out and log back in, you have everything, but if you are killed you  have to start over. Thats how this game should be.So a TL;DR, the permadeath system adds intensity and the game itself is great! There just needs to be some way to save my progress if need be so I can come back later if I need to leave."

Only volume and ""resolution"" (fullscreen or windowed), nothing about graphics, no actual resolution options (the game was locked to 3:4 ratio on my pc with extremely low resolution, my fps counter was huge), and no mouse control options.-No mini map (or any kind of map)- the area in which i was playing was divided to many parts, most of them looked familiar to each other and so I couldn't nevigate both from area to area and inside big areas (like the sewers) because everything looked the same.-No UI- the game has no UI whatsoever, there aren't any way to see if you have missions or what items you have, you have to remember any items you picked on the way.-Many bugs:Game mouse is able to escape the screen, and leaves the normal-unusable mouse on the screen.If you click on an area you can't go to, the game gets stuck for a few seconds.Can't alt tab, doesn't work, just leaves the game on top.The mini games don't work-No progression- as far as i've seen, you have no inventory, and no lvl up system, and so there's no actual point going around the map doing anything.-Not enough things to do- you can't fight, all you can do is wonder around the place and do missions, neither of which is exceptionally fun, but there just aren't enough things to do, in the 1 hour i've played, all I did was 1 mission, because I couldn't find anything else to do.-No saving- I wouldn't mind this all that much if you could freakingalt tab-/+Text seems sort of messed up- some of the things some of the characters say is pretty messed up and ridiculous and doesn't make a whole lot of sense (at one point, on soldier asked me to find a horse to he could **** it, infront of his entire squad).+The base of the game is good- I really like the idea of the game, an open world zombie game that isn't focused about just killing the zombies, and that actually lets you move on your own (ahem, the walking dead), there aren't enough of this sort of games.Conclusion: I do think this game has a good idea behind it, but it's hidden behind many bugs and awful design choises. I choose to not refund this game just yet because I think it can be a good game with enough changes but the biggest problem I have with it is that it doesn't teach you what to do, and there is no reason to do anything, since it's not fun to wonder around.But at the moment I do not reccomend buying, I recommend keeping a track of it every few weeks and see if it got tweeked a bit and is in better state."

NOPE that's right it's a 2 button game, you click to interact, click to walk, and hold shift + click to run- the music IS SOOOOOOOOO reptitive, get ready to hear a 10second loop 1000x times- The Story is lacking, I think you are supposed to roam around and ""discover"" what's going on, butI coudn't figure out anything.- No saves / broken checkpoints?- The game feels like torture, and literally gave me a headache"

Spoilers: In order to escape the first room, your character wants a gun, you click around and find a locked door, only then can you interact with the generator (or maybe I missed it earlier because the collision box is actually one tile BELOW the generator). Once you've inspected the generator you discover you need the passcode to turn it off. Only then does the computer show up as interactable, but it's missing a  cable. Next go into the room with the door, now one of the boxes that you couldn't interact with before is clickable. You get the cable, take it to the computer, get the code, turn off the generator, zombie immediately kill your only fiend, you say ""meh"" and walk out the door.Add in the fact that the main character is an immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who could use a good spanking if her parents weren't undead, that the world is large enough to make walking around a slog yet empty enough that exploring it is boring, that the map is inexplicably constrained, that the pathing is buggy as hell,... well the whole thing is just a mess.I'd say maybe put in on follow and wait until it's been propped up a little.I bought this on sale for 15 cents and kind of wish I hadn't, but in good faith I can't really ask for a refund.

,Not Recommended,403560,18480654,"Posted: 15 October, 2015",all,foxyshadis,"An object lesson in how not to design a game: Take the worst pixel hunting features from point-and-click adventure games, permadeath without the randomness that makes it meaningful, and characters that are little more than annoying cliches with bad writing. It doesn't feel like a world at all, because you can hardly interact with anything, and the characters are so flat. And there's some random gaming blogger inserted. You just run and hope you find anything interesting, some kind of story, then give up after a while.This game is full of things randomly becoming usable and unusable, forces you to use the mouse for no good reason, the path-finding will usually take you on a route that runs you right into a zombie, the visibility circle doesn't follow you to the edge of maps, it forces you to read bad dialog over, and over, and over every death, it has no Steam integration, you can't alt-tab, and generally has a bunch of bugs all over. The patch that was supposed to fix them didn't. It's not even early access quality. I can't find anything redeeming about it."

(That's fine but when the monsters can kill you through walls and other kind of stuff, that's no good)2 - You can walk  through some of the walls (nice)3 - This is a rpg maker game with a mouse cursor function, it's imprecise and frustrating because you have to be pixel perfect plus you cannot interact with anything if you are right next to it.4 - Die once and it's GAME OVER! (Fine right? Oh yeah! You cannot save your game... not at all... )5 - I'm not joking... you cant save your game! ""I need to sleep i have work tomorrow"" too bad... turn the game off and it's a ""start all over again!"" for you.6 - Oh yea, its not a 100%  Point and Click game since you can use the arrow keys to move, 'Esc' to open a super limited menu and some times the 'Space bar' or 'Z' to interact with some of the stuff.Apparently the game developer is planning to update this game and put a check point system so you can continue from where you left off but like any rogue-like die once and you lose all your progress.It's a shame really but maybe i'm been too harsh...As it is right now... i don't recommend."

It's so bad I can't even describe itLet's see, where do I begin...I played through the tutorial because that's what I usually do, and when I got through it, the game told me to use the pause menu to leave. I thought doing quit game would take me back to the main menu, but nope, it just flat out shut the game down. Why have a tutorial if it's going to force you to quit the game?Getting into the actual part of the game, the first building,FIRSTbuilding, I find multiple problems: I had to do sort of fetch quest in order to leave, in which I was given no knowledge, or even a hint, of doing so. It literally took me a whole 8 minutes to figure out what to do. When I got that done, I encountered buggy mapping near the exit door that would let me the exit the map. Just seeing those two things along almost caused me to close out right there, but I still managed to move on with this painful thing called a ""game"".Now, these controls... Using the mouse and shift key to run? That just doesn't feel right on me. Especially since you have to click oneverytile you want to go to. I get that it's a point-and-click game, but it would make more sense to be able to run in one direction while moving with shift instead of clicking on every single tile, but that's just me and my personal experience with these types of games.But this dialogue... It's so cheesy, I wouldn't even eat it...I saw this game was on sale, and had trading cards, so I figured ""Hey, let's sit through something for a while and drop these cards"", but nope, I didn't even drop my first card, that's how far I managed to get myself before I quit.Save your 15 cents (or how ever much the game happens to be now) for something else, people.Not even the card drops are worth it."

I have to prevent others from buying this in the state it is.Most early access games are a hundred times more polished and functional then this one is!Normally I wouldn`t kick a game out of my memory after such a short period, but this game must be meant as a joke and for the purpose too ♥♥♥♥ up people.For sure nobody ever did test it ... or if somebody did, his skills in game testing are at the same niveau then the devs are in designing at least basically well designed and functional games/userinterfaces. Nearly at zero point!It will be my first game (out of nearly 1500!) that I will refund at steam.I only paid 59 cent for it, but even that was too much!Ok, perhaps I wont refund it, cause the effort for refunding is not worth the outcome. Perhaps thats why its so cheap .... for preventing ppl from refunding it!Why am I so angry?First, you cant play it in windowed mode, well, there is an option for it, but it just does nothing.Ok, wouldn`t be such a big problem ... but ... you either can´t use alt tab to minimize it to idle mode.Also not a big thing.But!You also cant save, and if you leave the game ... you have to start over from the beginning.Wow, thats really weird.I really love permadeath games, I owe tons of them, but this way of dealing with the players time is the dumbest thing a dev did in my whole carreer as a videogameplayer!And this career lasts since 40 years!At the dev:Did you expect us to do nothing else then to play your game for hours?Is it meant to be played in one session?How long is it, 30 minutes to reach the end?Or what did you think when you did it that way?Well, just if you do not know, some people have a life besides playing ... most actually.Back to review:Besides that, even in the short while I played, I did find bugs ingame. You can walk on walls. You somehow fly over the ground, nearly no animations at all. The game did crash 2 times in 15 minutes (guess cause of trying me to alt tab it), which is very funny ... if this happens after you played several hours ... with no save function, forceing you to start over, I guess you will eat your keyboard!The settings menue is the most ugly thing I ever did see in a videogame and a silly mix of mouse and keyboard controlled ... awesome!No settings for resolution, nor any other graphical settings, no keymaper at all, even no descrption of keymaping, or anything else useful.But thats not a real problem as it anyways have no effect on the game, so if you have figured outhow to use it, you just see its been for nothing.There is a tutorial, which seems to try to be funny (did a child write the dialogues? seems so ...) ... it is not at all, its just boring, I dont want to have to read 25 lines just to find out such obvious things as how to move and that there are 2 different cursors and that this is a permadeath game, I read gamedescriptions before I buy them!The things you want to know, for example how to get into your inventory or map (if there is one ... ) or how to use or craft items (if there are any ... or crafting) ... are not included at all.All in all ... looks like the first job of somebody who hardly wanted to call himself a gamedesigner ... but who was not able to think even about the most essential basics. Better would have asked somebody who did have at least a bit understanding of how to design a working framework and interface.Sorry, Mr. Dev, I think you are a nice guy, and you for sure did your best, but sorry, far far far far away from good, in this state your game is just crap.Fix the bugs, make your menues and settings work, add the most basic things to it, redo the controlls, give the game a checkpoint system, so one can leave it without having to start from the beginning and make it able to bring it to idle and windowed mode.So to say, do your job, at least the basics, you should have done that first!After that we perhaps can talk about the game ... cause AFTER that it will eventually be a nice experience, ... and perhaps your skills in designing content and a good story is much higher then your skill in creating a functional framework and a smart interface.But before that all its not even a suitable screensaver ...Ok, one can buy it for the tradingcards ,,, so if you collect them, buy.All others ... wait.To all readers, pls excuse my bad english, its not my native language."

The only update has me being banned from the forum.I got the game at launch back in September. It was in a really poor state, but I decided to give them a grace period on a review because they personally promised me and others that a big update was coming in a few weeks to a month or so, (these statements are as early as october)biggest thing they promised was achievements, but also more content.Dan, representative (and only employee?) of publisher, Back to Basics Gaming said, and I quoteOct 14, 2015 @ 6:04amIt will be a few weeks before it's ready.https://imgur.com/X0DZThWIt's March 1st, 2016. Still waiting for that update. According to their facebook page, the developers have other games being worked on.https://www.facebook.com/SpaceCatGameDev/They do not post on the steam forums, so if you don't have facebook, you aren't getting in touch with them.Interestingly, Dan@ Back to Basics Gaming insists two things. #1.  The update is new content, bug fixes, and achievements and the main game core is complete.  #2. Turbo Pug, which was released after this, was not made by Space Cat Studios. Eh? What? But that's not what Space Cat Studios says.https://imgur.com/a/aFCi3https://imgur.com/jgQBDFY<- directly from their facebook pageDan? Well, he's been silent since January. (last known post in his search history) I assume he will start posting on the games he published soon, he just got more junk greenlit this week, but its been over a month of silence, up to the day I write this. Between Space Cats and Back to Basics, nobody on the steam forum is talking to us. Dan's got an e-mail but I prefer communicating out in the open, ya know? I don't use facebook.So... This game appears to be abandoned, and those achievements are probably never coming. I'll update this review if they ever do deliver the update they promised back in October , and I will review it.This isn't the first time a Back to Basics Gaming published game has been seemingly abandoned either!You may have heard of this gem.""A New Kind of Adventure""http://store.steampowered.com/app/375510/missed its early access launch date by 6 months and counting. abandoned.I wrote a review about that story.http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/375510Before that, we had Back to Basics Gaming publisher give us ""Escape Machines"".http://store.steampowered.com/app/363490/They've been in early access since April, missed their release date by at least 7 months and counting, and is also abandoned.Around this time, Back to Basics Gaming published another game called ""Flesh Eaters"" (unrelated to Eaten Alive)http://store.steampowered.com/app/383580/This also missed its release date by at least 6 months and counting.  Meanwhile, the developer has gotten two new games greenlit in the mean time. Both published by Back to Basics Gaming. Why is someone working on 3 games at once, especially when they can't even finish the first project?Back to Basics Gaming has also published ""Lup"", more recently. In tradition with most everything early access, it has missed its release date by 2 months and counting.http://store.steampowered.com/app/412600/http://imgur.com/yTKmUpAyeah i own a majority of their entire catalogue, and this game is in many ways, not an isolated incident with them. I would recommend avoiding Back to Basics Gaming.

The music and the art style: dadgum, I was on board.Then, I started to play it.First thing that puts me off is this ""Mia"" character and the writing.

This would be fine if this wasn't a point-and-clickstory-based gamewithmultiplecampaigns.

,Not Recommended,403560,20881963,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Terallis,"So, I love zombie games. A lot. This seemed pretty interesting at first glance. Not to mention super cheap. However, there are some pretty major flaws in the game itself.-For starters, it took a LOT of player nagging for the developers to even a save function for people not wanting to play for however many hours straight.-Additionally, there's no such thing as health or anything in this game. If you happen to accidentally bump into a zombie (whether due to actual accident or due to the shoddy pathing) you have to immediately manage to succeed in clicking at the right time or... suffer permadeath. I mean, I get that it's a hardcore permadeath game, but come on.-To expand on the previous point, yeah. The pathing for the character is extremely shoddy at best. It'll often take the dumbest route to the clicked location, often passing right through a horde... or even a single zombie for that matter.-Putting mechanics aside, the main character in the only available story is a piece of crap. There is no possible way to actually empathize with this character in the slightest. I get that the game is more focused on the survival component, but seriously? If you're going to put in a story, at least try to make a character that has redeeming factors. She's akin to a soulless raider or something similar.-Another point I should add is that the fullscreen mode is rather broken. The in-game mouse cursor and out-game mouse cursor are constantly in conflict, depending on where you have your mouse on the screen.All-in-all, I'd give this game a 5/10 at absolute best. The sprites are nice, even though they look like they are just the base sprites from the zombie pack for RPG Maker or similar, at least. The idea of the game is also alright. But that's about it for the redeeming qualities. I honestly thought for a little bit that the game was early access, but there is no early access label on the page. This feels like an alpha at best. Not a full game in the slightest."

,Not Recommended,403560,19642423,"Posted: 11 December, 2015",all,Silverstream,"This game obviously has effort put into it, but it's just no fun to play. You start out in a four-room warehouse (trust me you'll be seeing this place a lot) where you angst at your adopted father. You need to go from room to room and interact with various objects and eventually get out. Once you're outside, you'll meet zombies. If you touch them and fail a quick time event, you're dead. Totally dead. Permadead.This is the most ""controversial"" aspect of the game. It definitely gives the game a unique feel and differentiates it from other RPGmaker games, but my major issue with it is how the game starts. It's extremely tedious to go through the uneventful initial cutscene and puzzle over and over when you die. I get that it's supposed to be punishingly difficult, but I wish there was a way to skip to when you get out.Once you are out, there's not much I've figured out how to do. You can head north and find Jim Sterling, a game critic, for some reason and play minigames. You can find a group of soldiers, one of whom may or may not be a stereotypical Brony. And lastly, there's a mother who wants a medkit for her hurt child. No matter how hard I've tried, I can not find any way to fight off the zombies, the medkit, or the horse that the Brony guy wants.I really want to enjoy this game, but it's far too cryptic and tedious for my tastes.Update: 5/14/10The developer has made it so that when you die, you respawn in front of the initial building as I suggested! Unfortunately, once you're outside, there's still very little to do. The outside world has expanded a bit, but the game feels empty. Almost all the doors are locked, you can't pick anything up, you can't fight the zombies, and the few quests that there are can't be finished due to the necessary items being absent. While I still feel that this could become a good game, I don't think it was ready for Steam when it was posted or even now."

In a game where a gameover is always haning over your head, is this is inexcusable, since it means dying is often not even your fault. I bet some people even got stuck on the title screen for a while. Consider this as aggravating pretty much everything else I write from now on.The minigames are annoying.The main character seems written as a parody of an edgy teenager, and acts like a psychopath even towards people showing kindness to her. But, there is no humour in this: it is in fact played completely straight.The tiling is amateurish at best, with several walkable walls where you can get stuck.The design of the game (scenario, progression, mechanics) in general is pretty obtuse.In particular, the story/progression triggers are unmarked and somewhat obscure, and finding them is made even more annoying from the control scheme.The author is very stubborn on a no-saving mechanic in particular, which makes no sense at all with the rest of the design, because the game is:-Unforgiving, as each and every enemy can instakill you.-Always the same, with no content change between different runs, not justifying having to restart from scratch over and over. Not to mention, the first sequence is extremely annoying to do over and over.-As stated above, imprecise in controls and inaccurate tiling in a game where the main survival mechanic is avoiding visible enemies-Expressed in dialogues that you really don't want to experience twice-Very vague in what exactly triggered you being where you were, so if you do even something seemingly menial (or that you might have forgotten at that point) differently, you might get stuck.Basically, this isn't a game with one or two glaring flaws: it's a trip to unfun land that you're forced to relive over and over while fighting with the UI. I don't only think it's not worth your money, even if it was free, I think it wouldn't be worth your time."

A few things about the game:-Pretty easy to run away from zombies (they are pretty slow)-would be nice if the setting would save once you exit the game. I put the game in window mode and it goes back to full screen once you restart the game.-save houses/bases would be nice. I know its a perma death game, but I hate to pull the old nintendo game break/pause trick and leave the game running and my computer on.-A few walls you can walk though. (One is in the place you start and I found another one in the alleyway, near the bulding with the ladder.So far its a pretty decent game. tweek a few things , add a save house/base and I think some more people might go for it."

You can't run, you can't skip dialogue, and there's permadeath. Permadeath works in some games, but nah, not in this. It's like watching paint dry every time you start over. This game isn't rogue like(it's not different every time you play).Idk, for a sale price of 15 cents it was worth a shot but I'm not gonna watch paint dry for 15 cents.Would benefit from a save system."

And why is the guy so insistent of not letting her go, even though he has, apparently, a lot of weapon that, for some reason, he broke. Why go to the outside world? The girl looks like a teenager, by her actions.Anyway, the graphics are ok, since it is one of those rpgmakerlike games, but the game doesn't achieve much. It is not really interesting at all, although cheap.If you want to try it, go at your risk, but wait for a good sale. Otherwise, don't touch this."
