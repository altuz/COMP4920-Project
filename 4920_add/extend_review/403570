76561198083523024,Not Recommended,403570,30088921,Posted: 21 February,all,BlueCat,"Another game from Dagestan Technology that was ""inspired"" by something else; but at the very least, this one tried to be different instead of just blatantly ripping off Meat Boy, like they did with Bloodbath Kavkaz and Hotline Miami.Sadly, it's still pretty bad. Both the controls and the hitboxes, which are the most crucial elements to this genre of games, are imprecise, to put it mildly.Combined with a level design that further pushes the fake difficulty by screwing with the player (such as moving the exit door from under your nose to the other side of the level, suddenly spawning a death trap above you or making a fake platform that you wouldn't know about unless you already died to it.)Basically, it's a rage game that you would play not for the challenge, but to punish yourself or others.And that's if you even get it to work. I tested it on 3 different computers and only on one of them I could actually play it.The other two got either a Blue Screen Error immediately after launching of the game; or it played with FPS constantly jumping between 10 to 20, making the game virtually unplayable.And I'm not the only one that had such problems, so for all intents and purposes, this game is just simply broken.Another really annoying thing is the complete absence of settings.Especially the audio ones, since the speed changes of the soundtrack during every death and restart (which happens every couple of seconds,) together with a disc scratching sound effect, will make your ears bleed after a while.But hey, who needs that when you have hats, right?"
,Not Recommended,403570,29103962,Posted: 7 January,all,Pink Dango,"it's such a frustrating game.. i only got it because I got a 90% off coupon, making it 50 cents, and i almost had that much so figured i might as well get it ! Then i read the reviews, and realized I definitely wasn't going to like the game. It's way too hard. It took over a minute just to complete the first round, which seems so simple at first. sometimes , you think you're about to win, then it just turns around on you and the end door disappears and reappears all the way across the map. yea, i raged. the game isn't that good. sometimes it lags when i'm about to win and then i die.main point is it is frustrating.you will rage.you probably should not spend $5 on this game. i don't even think it's worth, and i got it for 50 cents..."
,Not Recommended,403570,29661287,Posted: 2 February,all,Memeeoli,"I like a challenging game, but this game is not challenging: it has bad level design. It gets very repetitive very quickly and it never gives you a sense of accomplishment when finishing a level, thus not motivating you to continue."

,Not Recommended,403570,30478998,Posted: 12 March,all,VarmintLP,"This game isn't really completly supported by controller cause I can't even retry without hitting the R key on may keyboard. That's not really full controller support, so it's better been fixed or remove the full controller support flag."

,Recommended,403570,26632163,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,OrokinLonewolf,"People ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this game being too difficult and poorly designed... They obviously haven't played many Hardcore Rogue-like games, and the mechanics are perfectly fine. You just have to beVERYprecise about your landings. There's a reason there's an achievement to get 1k deaths; practice makes perfect.The only ""complaint,"" so to speak, I have is that Level 7 is EXTREMELY difficult to the point of rage quitting...It took me a few hundred deaths but It's definitely possible,especially if you take the secret path on the bottom right, past the FAKE spikes into the portal. I have little advice for level 13 except to use very very light taps for tiny jumps.The 8-bit-like music is absolutely superb; I REALLY wish I could give them another buck or two for the soundtrack.Watch out for traps!One more thing; I wouldn't recommend playing this with a controller if you have a very low-end computer like I do. I don't exactly know why, but using a controller causes respawns to take several seconds. And when you're dying every 5 seconds, the 3 second load time is very tedious.Fast computer or not, it also seems to make the music repeat itself after each death when you use a controller, proving to also be annoyingNow, if you have a decent or a fast computer, and don't care about the music, I HIGHLY recommend the controller."
