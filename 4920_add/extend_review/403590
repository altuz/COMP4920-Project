It's not a 'hmm, that's kind of odd' every once in awhile. In its current state, it could give Goat Simulator a run for its money. The controls are weird, clunky and not intuitive at all. His hand bangs against doorknobs in a really odd, gimpy and useless way, like in Surgery Simulator. You try and sprint and he runs/gallops kind of sideways, like he's taking the running man challenge.The black load screens were taking so long, I thought the game  froze. Also, when you enter a house, they are completely empty, then you wait and wait and wait for furniture and items to start spawning. This is robbing houses. Time is supposed to be of the essence.(not my pc, it's a brand new 980ti build) I really want to like this game, but I don't understand why they brought it out this early. I mean, its right on the cusp of being completely unplayable. It may end up being great, but it'll take some serious elbow grease and tlc to polish this bad boy into something people flock to. I will change my review as the game updates."

From afar it looks like a good game but as soon as you either buy it or check some reviews, it doesn't hold so strong. Believe the bad reviews, the game is a buggy mess of a concept and executed horribly. I bought me and my brother this and it kicked me out for various errors about 3 times, also on 1 of the 2 maps ONLY, there is horrible unplayable desync. I would recommend waiting until the devs either get thier crap together, or actually fix the game.+ Good concept+ Large open world- So many bugs- Desync- Executed badly- No options menu- Bad optimization- Pointless VROverall i'd say a 2/10"

I honestly am looking very forward to how this game progresses.*Gameplay*Currently the game is bugged quite a bit but it's improving and being fixed. The sensitivity is a problem with the controller for me since it's very slow but it's not game breaking. The optimisation is actually decent, runs well on 'Epic' for me. Essentially you go around breaking into houses and stealing their valuables ranging from Dishes,Microwaves to Paintings, large objects have to be carried in both hands back to your van which you can drive. You end up selling all your goods to some guy in the town. You will have to disable alarms and things to ensure when you enter someones house the cops aren't alerted immediately (Though for me it goes off regardless of if I disable it but maybe I'm doing something wrong). You can actually 'kill' the owner if you hit them but that doesn't end well for you.*Conclusion*It's a solid game, everything currently works well and the game is going in a great direction and I can't wait to see how the developer progresses! 7/10*YouTube*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCFtIPHglRs"
,Recommended,403590,24226557,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,No.,"I love the concept of this game. Steal as much as possible without getting caught. The game needs serious work though. They need to integrate jumping and climbing. The issue is constantly getting stuck on surfaces because we can't walk onto higher surfaces. There is no progress in the game as of yet. You complete one mission for no reward. You can also do as you please but as soon as you enter Oldetown then back into your van it cancels you out into the mainscreen. As soon as you hit mainscreen you lose all progress. I don't think you can even sell items yet. They fixed the issue where you run up to a house and nothing is loaded. The cars pile up after awhile if you park your van in the middle of the street. There isn't much to steal yet. Everything is ""fair"" priced. As of right now they only have a few missions you can keep redoing over and over with no payout.I still recommend this game. It has a GTA vibe, but with stealing and of course lack of $$ to make the game properly yet."

Since the game is still very early in development and the developers are paying good attention to comments on their Trello Development Roadmap as well as the reviews/blogs, this leads to a good opportunity for the players to provide raw feedback and help produce a truly fun Burglary simulator.That being said, this game still has some good ideas behind it, I encourage people to check out their roadmap and comment/vote on features you'd like to see.

76561198013311405,Recommended,403590,23972237,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,FlyInWithSilence,"Ok, so I got this game for the HTC Vive and this review is only regarding the VR play of this game. as soon as I saw this game I thought it was a great idea and I see a lot of potential. I really think it’s a fresh idea however....This game in its current state is completely unplayable... so let me explain some of the reasons...The HUD is almost completely absent which I would love in this type of game, however, the way that you have to select tools and interact makes this very frustrating to figure out what each hand is doing, couple this with poor ""depth detection"" and unresponsive controls makes this game a chore to do simple things like open a door let alone steal anything... this is especially frustration in the harder tasks such as picking a lock or a safe, making a fun task impossible.Besides the interaction issues the movement controls are honest pretty awful... but only the up and down pads move you and you must turn with the other pads... seems simple right? well with no HUD and an inability to determine which way your facing can cause you to move in a direction, what makes this worse is that when you turn it blacks out your screen for a second for each 15deg turn. so turning your character so that up on the pad is forward can take a significant time, so forget about navigating corners like anything other than a blind rhino...Honestly I could go on about the problems but, there're really to many. this is clearly a game that was released far too early. while I would still recommend this game to others because I like the premise, right now it is unplayable, however I look forward to the patches that come that will make this game start to live up to it potential."

You try and do something with no clue if it will work. Had issues with the controls as well you do what is described in the tutorial and it works sometimes most times not. I would say developers desperately need to work on some of the controls as well. I cant figure out how to use the tablet at times too.All in all this game has HUGE Potential, at this stage I say dont waste your money. Wait. See if the game is built better then buy."

It's like if San Andreas' burglary minigame had it's own standalone game! A mass variety of different houses and scenarios that ties in with the overall focus of breaking in, out, and getting away clean. You almost never know what you are up against. And your neighbors.... dont get me started on them. We got Mad Margeret, rednecks with sidearms, and... Well, I still have yet to meet them all personally! Don't be confused though, this game still is early access. Very much alpha. It is playable for sure but progression and such are all just placeholders sadly for future updates.  I very much enjoy this game and have no doubts that it'll grow to be great because not only is it original, but it's also got a team of hard working and determined people behind the scenes.-HONEST UNBIASED OPINION by community moderator of Klepto"

You'll drop it. Pick it up. Drop it again. Yes i'm holding the button, look at how he's holding it. LOOK.There's not enough coherent content here to justify buying or playing this for any reason.

I would love to return it but I can't because it was downloaded. I tried messing with the quality and even on the lowers it was running 3 fps. Either update it so there is less lag, or please give me a refund."

It has a turning button that made me sick becuase it rotates the whole world. None of the buttons would make me move forward, only side to side, and there was no warp like most VR games, so it was too nauseating for me."

As a game developer myself I know the struggles between thinking of a good game and making it a reality so I may be a bit different minded than the average gamer however I feel this game is enough fun even if it has a few bugs and issues.What this game is :FunHilarious to play with friendsFairly easy to get in toDifferent from the generic shooter or free to play mmoUnique, I haven't seen any game do this before and I probably won't see many more in my lifetimeWhat this game isn't :Bug free (they are working on the game of course)AAA (the graphics are nice but weirdly demanding)The best game ever (yet xD)Here are some reasons I would suggest buying this game for yourself and in some cases friends as well :You want a game to mess around in where you can drive like a maniac and rob houses - TickYou and a friend/friends are bored of shooting people in other games and want something different - TickYou want to play something with a more authentic lock picking system than 90% of games - Tick (I lock pick from time to time with a decent kit and some amazingly nice locks)Anyway, I hope I have given a decent review of this title and I hope to see the game completed.(Bonus points to the developers if they add a lockpick gun, cos straight up if anyone was gonna rob houses for a living they would spend the extra 5 quid to get a faster entrance xD)"

It's fun, it looks good, it has an original concept. There's really not that much else to say. Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10"
