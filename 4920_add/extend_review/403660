76561198016555066,Not Recommended,403660,18244478,"Posted: 28 September, 2015",all,Waladil,"Sadly, I did not enjoy my time with this game. I got bored around ten minutes in, lost further interest by sixty minutes, and had mostly decided to refund before I reached ninety minutes, but I played out until just shy of two hours because I wanted the game to become fun. It never did.I believe that the core problem with Omnipresent is the fact that the developer had much bigger dreams than his (it seems to be a one-man game) skills could complete. There are a lot of mechanics and interactions that COULD be really fun, but end up being really boring.The stock market: It fluctuates WILDLY from second to second. Stocks can change by hundreds of dollars in the blink of an eye. Of course, you can drop any stock to near-zero just by hacking the relevant site, buy at almost nothing, and sell for everything. The only problem is that you keep getting blocked and having to pay money to unlock your trading account -- which isn't fun or challenging (when you make 3 million per sale of stock, paying 3 million for an unlock still results in obscene profits), it's annoying.The hacking minigames: There are two. One is supposed to be timing-based, where you press the right key at the right time. Or you can spam lots of keys all the time and get 90% of the way done, without even pressing some of the right keys at all. The other is just outright spam keyboard mash. Niether of these are fun mechanics.The hacking overmap game: There are these little enemy bubbles that wander around the map. Hack when they're nearby, and you get detected. Hack when they're far away and you don't get noticed at all. This isn't fun. You can just wait for them to wander off and then hack whatever you want. Sometimes they don't wander off, and you sit there bored.The in-game browser: A neat idea, but having all the sites being ""blocked by NSO"" or otherwise redacted is no fun.The objectives are sometimes unclear (Being asked to hack CTI to get a ""special software"" with no dialogue or explanation that CTI stands for the California Institute of Technology.)The e-mail autoresponses are idiotic, where sending a mission success e-mail with required data is replied with a payment and ""So-and-so is unavailable.""There's never any overmap pressure. You're never being rushed to do things. Any time your detection risk gets a bit high you can wait for the NSO or MIHQ to **** off and the risk to drop, and in a few minutes you'll be right as rain. Never a downside.I think the final straw was when I started being able to hack the NSO and MIHQ and all of a sudden the ""fun"" mechanic of tracking viruses started. Oh no! I have to click EVERY GODDAMN SPOT OF THE INTERNET TO FIND VIRUSES, THEN CLICK REMOVE. AND THERE ARE FIFTEEN. THIS IS A WASTE OF GODDAMN TIME AND ITS NO FUN AT ALL.I'm sorry, but Uplink is simply a better hacking game, with more fun mechanics. And if the play-as-AI is your love, there's an uncompleted game titled Endgame:Singularity available for free (legally for free, it's open-source) that is just a better AI emergence simulator. That game is both free and UNFINISHED and it's still better than Omnipresent.I think the big lesson to learn from Endgame: Singularity was the overmap time pressure. In that game, any base could be detected -- and shut down -- by the humans at any time. You had to spread out, but spreading out too much would result in some bases being found (since they each had individual chances to be detected), which would raise worldwide suspicion. You were under pressure to expand to get the processing power needed to complete research and money-making tasks, but also under pressure to remain small and hidden so you didn't get destroyed. It. Was. Difficult. Omnipresent isn't difficult. It's a time-killer."

I think it should have a more informative beginning, since I have been playing for some time, and still don't know how most of it works. I will proceed to continue playing, but more info on the game would be awesome."
76561198006660007,Not Recommended,403660,18256760,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,Fengor,"For a one man job, this game is rather impressive, however, it's incredibly buggy and feels very unfinished. Progress is constantly mired down by vague objectives, or the game simply not registering that you've completed an objective. It is a perpetual uphill battle just to get it to work. I often found myself wondering if the reason I couldn't complete an objective was because I was doing something wrong, or if I'd simply hit yet another bug.Not all of  the game's problems are the result of bugs, however, as many of the mechanics for the game are lackluster, make little sense, or unblanced. Others here have gone into far better about where the game is lacking, so I won't bother repeating things.Overall this feels more like an early access title than it does a finished product, and I can't help being a little upset at that. While I have to commend this first time dev for providing support to players, and working tirelessly to fix the bugs that are present, I simply can't recommend anyone purchase this."

I'm running a very high end PC, and at I have to wait a good 10 minutes on a white screen on startup. Secondly, the game lags a LOT. Map scrolling is terrible, the UI is awful. This game is undoubtedly not worth the pricetag. The other users could not have stated it better. The mini-games are just bad. I mean one of them is literally just ""Smash every key til you get it right"", but unfortunately, the game has a major chance to crash. The other is some scrolling key press, which seems timed, but sometimes is just random as hell. I thoroughly regret this purchase."

What I really liked about the game was that although it was representing the world from an AI's perspective it has the user interface that one can easily adjust to so one does not get lost in all the code you would assume to be in an AI mechanics. The browser, search engine, and all the web sites including stock exchange are very well executed and function like the ones on the web so it is quite fun to use them.I liked the range of activities you can do as an AI, from stealing research papers to reaching bank accounts etc. And when you connect them all, there really is nothing you can not do as an AI. The really well thought touch for me was the Detection Percentage - the AI is not a program detached from the world. There are both other softwares and people that are in interaction with it.I definitely recommend Omnipresent and am looking forward to the updates and new scenarios."
,Not Recommended,403660,18251122,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,Jar of Cannibals,"*Based off of the initial release after completing the game*Play time- 6 hoursThis game left me with a hard choice on if I liked it or not.  Its has a lot of aspects that I really enjoy in a game and I really did try to like it.  It also has some very big negatives that took away from that desire.Pros:-You get to be a super computer AI-You have the choice to play sandbox at just about anytime-Some clever 'no hand holding' problemsCons:-You never really 'feel' like a super computer AI-The mini games are repetitive and boring-All you can really do in sandbox is earn more money, which is easy to get and doesn't really matter much after you finish your base building.-Very scripted linear story that feels... clunky?What I wanted in this game was a skynet simulator.  That isn't what you get.  The unscripted elements of the game are minimal and trivial.  The obstacles to your taking over the world are also very easy to get around and at most just annoying.  All advancements in the game are from scripted missions.  Outside of a few interesting scripted problems all you have is a bag of tricks that you keep using over and over, it gets quite boring.Stuff that needs fixed:-Stock market is WAY to easy-Scripted email conversations are wonky and impossible sometimes to word right, ends up feeling like you are writing a computer and not the other way around.-Moving troops around gets cumbersomeAt the end of the day I'd rather play uplink."

,Recommended,403660,18260173,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,Papa Paxter,All bugs beside i find the game realy fun to play. It takes some time before it gets going but its worth it. I only got 5 hours of Gameplay out of this Game and i could maybe squeez another 2-3 hours out of it to make some changes in my desicions which i guess changes the story and the outcome. 12 euros for this game is in my oppinion alot but if the game expands alittle bit further its a fair deal.

It's no AAA you'll be playing for months don't get me wrong, but kept me captivated for a good while.Bonus props must go to the developer who has been releasing fixes based on the communities suggestions, and is very active and helpful."

In what I'll call the tutorial right after the game starts, the first password cracking minigame is solved by mashing letters on the keyboard, and the second password cracking minigame is often not solvable even given perfect play. I ragequit the game once after repeatedly failing the larger, faster versions of the second challenge, started again, and ragequit again.  If that's the standard for engagement required and fun to be had in this game, I've no shortage of better ones."

It's a copy of uplink, with much simpler mechanics in terms of what you do.I got bored rather quickly, as things consist of ""Find this thing that you can hack, then QTE tap buttons to get passwords to hack into it""It's not a bad game per say, just very simple. After Uplink, I wouldn't recommend this."

The game in a way like ""Hacknet"" but much easier. I like the game really much. It hits my taste... just perfect.What i don't like: Bugs which prevent me from playing further. Im in chapter 2 and i cant go further. There is a problem with the save-system. I cant choose new ""Jobs"" because they are empty (i took them in an savegame erlier and now in this round they are empty).I think, this game needs a little bit more bugfixing... then it will be great. So, yes, spend some money and support this fresh idea of concer the world as AI... even if the bugs really suck hard right now."
,Recommended,403660,25992333,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,uvar,"The UI is rather janky and there are some minor bugs, but both are predictable enough to deal with. Once I got used to them I found myself entertained. It's not an incredibly deep game, and no individual part is very complex, but all the little pieces come together pretty well. At first it seemed like another game called Endgame: Singularity (not on Steam), but it's more like its opposite - there's a lot less numbers and levelling and an actual plot in this one. The plot itself is pretty linear but you have a decent amount of freedom to accomplish many of the individual tasks, even if the game doesn't always make some of the concepts involved very clear.It took me an evening or two to reach one ending, and there's a secret or two and a bunch of background filler for those who like to explore."
