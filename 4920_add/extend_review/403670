,Recommended,403670,18379332,"Posted: 7 October, 2015",all,Rainer,"Positive aspects: It is a well-made, beautifully little Indie horror game. It offers a great and diversified level design with an astonishing attention to detail. Furthermore: Creepy atmosphere with solid jumpscares and a “twisted” plot. Please be aware of: It’s very dark, no checkpoint system within a level, sometimes it is difficult to figure out your next objective and be prepared for playing hide and seek with Mr. Lumberjack with deadly outcome. ;-) So please don’t get me wrong; it’s a clear recommendation for all horror adventure fans!"

I completed the game in 3 hours. I felt the story made little sense and most of the written clues were in broken English. The apartment with the naked girl in the shower that does not acknowledge your presence was bizarre. If the two story lines were to represent a dream and cloudy reality, the creators of the game did a poor job. I really do not know what to make of it all.A couple of bugs I experienced:The game crashed when I clicked on the control menu.While running from the woodsman at the beginning of the game, I fell off the island next to my boat."

While some puzzles were really interesting and well thought out the majority of them were really hard to figure out and I ended around just clicking everything hoping to find something as there were not really much to go on from other than a few sound or visual clues on some of the puzzles, but those who did have the clues were really nice and seemed to be well thought-out.The game does also have a save decent function, and instead of restarting the game from the beginning it only takes you to the beginning of the level. The last level were pretty punishing as you needed to do certain things in a specific order or you'll get kill and restart the level from the beginning!The background music were the same 2-3 minute loop over and OVER again for the entire game, and it got really old fast and the few times there were a bit of silence or change to the music it was amazing.The main monster; while he were creepy and it did get me a few times, the hiding mechanic makes it so easy to escape it. Instead of the suspense of seeing the monster looking for you to seem to simply reset when to hide and the other ""threats"" in game were main cheap♥♥♥♥♥jump scares.I will say the game is decent and I'd probably not be this critical over it if I haven't paid 5€ for it, to be honest I've played better free horror games that had an equal 2-3 hours play time.I will however say the ending and the story the games tries to tell is pretty interesting and I've still not entirely figured out what it all means but I probably won't play the game again to find out which is a shame.Pros:Nice atmosphereInteresting plotCons:Music gets trivialBad Physics/going through wallsMonster/Jump scaresThere's better free gamesPuzzlesProbably wouldn't recommend this unless you're really running out of things to play."

The atmosphere and the background musics are awesome and creepy, there are a few jumpscares that actually made me jump, the puzzles aren't too hard, in short it was really enjoyable to play.CON: I didn't understand the story at all."

No idea where it came from or how it found me but nope, just nope. Never squealed like a pig before but I did today! Now excuse me as I change my underwear"
,Recommended,403670,18632739,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Takumas'GameGuide,This game has kept me on my toess and has challenged me to my very peak. I managed to extend my powers of puzzle solving just like in the Frictional Games ... games. I love how it turned out and i can't wait to play more.
,Recommended,403670,23385670,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Buckethead,"This is probably one of the best games you can get for 5 bucks. It is honestly just insane how good the game looks, how smooth the mechanics are, and how much detail there is. The story is fun and makes you constantly wonder what will happen next. The scares are great, and the atmosphere of the game is just downright creepy. The game took me about 6 hours to complete, and I had to look up atleast 5 youtube videos to walk me through it. You need to play this game."

Oli see mingi kaks paralleelset jooksvat lugu, või karakter lihtsalt kujutas seda ette või wtf. Üldiselt võib rahule jääda, 5 euri 2 tundi. Pakub pinget küll."

But it is a pretty bad game.  It makes no sense.  You wander around in the dark with some murderer out to get you.  If he sees you, you're dead.  You can't hide; he'll get you.  And he must have night-vision goggles.  He can see you before you ever see him coming.  And the only way to stop him is to find a couple of boots and give them to him???  WTF?  How is anybody supposed to figure that out?  Poor game design.  Poor puzzle design.  Great atmosphere.  I'm sorry I wasted money on it though.  Another game for the trash bin.  Put the 3-5 bucks toward a decent horror game like Outlast or SOMA."

Puzzles were a lot tougher then I thought. And where I thought they would be tough, they were not! To much over thinking, once again!Just loved Teddy......Ted to his friends! Probably the best thing about the game. Other than my showering girl friend/wife? Until she ate my face off, that is!"

Really unoptimised and unintuitive. Really tired of this time of game this isnt what horror is about. Game Tries to something like penumbra or outlast but really is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ slender type game."

Gameplay is lackluster and repetitive. The story I can't comment on because I gave up on trying to find the second boot lol. Give it a watch if you like.

76561198228662472,Recommended,403670,33440212,Posted: 10 July,all,ivy_l,"This game is a short little horror game whare you wake up on a island and dont know how you got there, Lumber island was once a island with rare wood that was sought after by craftsman all over the world for its oil untill it was pumped out till the last drop and became abandoned so-to-speak.. Your only real objective is to make it to the windmil and find out what happened..This game looks great there were a few lag issues for me here and there but nothing major and no crashes but with that said the one thing that left me inbetween about this review is clues are very obtuse and you spend alot of time looking around trying to figure out what in the hell is the next thing whare do i go from here.?I would say if you want to play a short indie horror game get it on sale"
