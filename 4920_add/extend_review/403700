I like Zero Punctuation as well as the next person, but the fan factor isn't enough to carry the game. It doesn't work as a game in itself or as the clever anti-game it wants to be. It's slow, it's repetitive, and nothing really feels rewarding. It's a time sink and that's about it."

,Recommended,403700,33099782,Posted: 1 July,all,Will The Kill,"There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to play this game. ""I don't like the art style,"" or ""I've seen the Escapist Arcade version - NO THANKS.""  I'm guilty of both of these myself.  But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the Escapist Arcade version is NOT Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is.  If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the Escapist Arcade content, just erase it from your mind and start fresh.  They butchered it - there's really no other way to put it.  They cut gameplay, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the game as a whole.  The mobile version has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, playing this on Steam, in its original Japanese form with subtitles, is really the way to go.As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen.  Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from a video game.  Despite that, you end up loving it.  I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the game in any way.  It didn't even take me five minutes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before.  Now, some 90 minutes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have.Especially now with Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition being played in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.Now that we've got those two points out of the way... (minor spoilers below)Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition is actually one of the best games I've ever played, PC/console or otherwise.  The plot is pretty basic at first.  You have just set out on your own to find the legendary treasure 'hat' and become a man with a hat, and you're looking for more hats to fall from the sky.  You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new hat as you find them.  They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities.  They form one very quirky collection that's always defining new fashion styles and somehow getting your character into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams.  Each main hat story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the first hat.  Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason.  Every hat has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the game.  No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Yahtzee's presence threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the game progresses.The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE.  Much of the beginning of the game is dedicated to gathering hats and letting you get to know them, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once you fall in love with Hat-Chan after an emotionally wrenching section of Wonderful Headgear Romance, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic sections you'll ever play.  The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC.  But even through the action, Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge.  The game is sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few.  There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor.Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments that I referenced earlier, which may take you by surprise!  There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and gameplay sections that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things.  I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point.  Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments.  And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your hats when they need you - of being ace pilot Jake Starbone.In a word, Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition is perfect.  And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say?  It's been on Steam for almost two years so far at time of writing this review and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end.  It is, simply put, amazing.So why should you play Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition?Because you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic gaming experience if you don't at least give it a try."
76561198153176634,Recommended,403700,29864776,Posted: 11 February,all,[YGS]Dies On Duty,"Lets take a look at hatfall. I will review the game on a pro/ con style and ending it with my own conclusion about the game.Pro:The game is simple. The premise of the game is just to move left and right to catch one falling hat per level while avoiding falling cars, stop signs, ect. It gets trickier the later levels since the other AI can closely resemble Yatzhee making it an obstical to figure out which is the actual player.The jokes. The game is full of funny moments from mini games, failure sound effects, and the level start up. They are bare bones and you will see some multiple times but it doesnt subtract from the joy of seeing them.The buyable egos. Buying these egos help make the game easier by making it easier to spot the character in the vast ammount of people in the level. Dont worry you dont need to spend actual cash to make the game easier, you just need to collect hats. They are the currency in the game.The unlockable items. For the most part the unlockable items are gained from gift drops given after a specific number of hats were caught. Some items are pretty useless like the glasses making the game a shade of pink or the beard displaying censored curse words. Other items active mini games which adds more enjoyment in the game as well helps score some easy hats.Con:Repetitive. The game is very samey but that isnt bad if you are just playing to just get through the game's somewhat existing story. If your going for all the achievements it is a slug fest of grinding away at hats. A few achievements are such a pain to get and unlocking the last few egos are a nightmare.Conclusion:Its a fun game for the fans of zero punctuation. It is very samey similar to games like bejewled. The idea of what makes the game good is how simple it is. It isnt hard to play it or learn to play it. The jokes that are in the game are pretty good and provided a few laughs here and there. The mini games were a blast to do. The only issue is how grindy the game gets and through that it kills the fun because of doing the same things over and over. I can still reccomend the game, it isnt great but it is a nice fun token and a blast to support yatzhee."
,Not Recommended,403700,19257174,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,BarthVader,"I admit, I bought that thing only because I'm a Yahtzee fanboy, and while I don't feel like rushing for a refund, I found it quite disappointing.Let's be frank - this isn't worth 5 euros. Y'see, the main gameplay gimmick, while enough for a mobile/flash game, isn't enough for a ""proper"" PC game. If I have access to Steam, I'd rather play something slightly more engaging.To add insult to injury, this isn't that different from a FREE browser version. The HGH Edition adds ONE extra minigame and an amusing (for about ten minutes) bonus when you grind to 1500 hats in total. Is there more to it? There's a 0/7 on the desk right now, but I wasted (at the time of writing) three hours getting to the 1.5k mark and cannot force myself to be arsed about it.EDIT SQUARED: It's counting the number of rocket parts you collected. How do you collect them? By grinding hats to get one of two certain minigames, and you need to get the last rocket part during a certain one out of those two, to unlock a ""finale"" minigame. It lasts about thirty seconds, and due to the PC moving like someone lubed the floor, is no fun at all.Positives? Erm, it won't date fast, I presume. While sticking to the ZP aesthetic and random humour, the game tries to stand on its own and doesn't really require you to know the series that inspired it. Also, the soundtrack (well, the ""collecting hats"" tune and the ""jRPG parody fight/finale minigame"" tune) was catchy as hell....yeah, I needed to dig deep to get that.Want to throw money at Yahtzee? Buy Consuming Shadow, it has more depth."

,Recommended,403700,27603297,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Wackerly,"I feel like people don't give this game enough time before reviewing it. That part where you put hats on (you know, the main part of the game) is just that: *part* of the game. In itself, it's simple in concept, yet challenging and silly. You run around, trying to catch a hat falling from the sky onto your head. Except there's more than one person on the screen and they all look identical to begin with. And sometimes it's not just a hat that falls from the sky, it's a refrigerator that will kill you upon impact. Or a stop sign that will kill you upon impact. Or both. Don't forget, if you get far enough, you'll catch a wizard's hat instead, causing him to curse you with a negative effect you have to deal with on the next stage. If you win that stage, you get a bonus, be it double hats or an extra life. Eventually, you can buy a gift from the gift shop. THIS reveals the true nature of this game; as you collect gifts, you play a different minigame to acquire a buttload of hats. Get enough hats, then something strange happens (I won't spoil it for you), and you must seek answers from within the minigames. Eventually you end up taking out a final boss and cueing the end credits. If you didn't realize that this game had a final boss, then it is my opinion that you had no right to review. It doesn't take long to get from start to finish; you can do it in a couple of hours. Once you realize what's really going on, the game has a very meta-game feeling to it where the hat-collecting is a small part of the whole, even though that's literally 90% of the gameplay. That's why I nominate it for the ""Game Within a Game"" Award for the 2016 Steam Awards."

Yahtzee's YouTube series ""Zero Punctuation"" has always been super entertaining but now he has brought us an equally-random experience that is now only interactive but endlessly unique every time around.  If you are a fan of his show, you will enjoy this game, definitely!You get gifts for collecting enough hats, and most of the hats offer a unique twist on the gameplay.  Some were more pointless than others but the whole game experience is affected in at least some way by each present.The gameplay is quite simple.  There is a hat falling and you have to stand under it.  With each hat you get, it gets harder and harder, with multiple objects falling at once (and you have to guess which is the hat and which is something less enjoyable like an anvil) and you advance if you guess correctly.  It can get very difficult when there are clones of yourself and you have to figure out which person you are controlling -- all in a matter of a few seconds.  If you are really bad, you will still gain presents as it retains however many points achieved.  High score is also tracked, but I love it how you will still get hats towards the ultimate prize even if you can only last through the first few stages.  I'm not entirely sure what the gift is if you get 1500 hats.  I guess I'll have to keep playing to find out!Overall, a great game, worth a buy.  It's not much more than that -- a minigames and funny commentary -- so if you are expecting something more than that maybe wait for a sale.  But for Zero Punctuation fans, it's a buy."

They even go so far as to move the same direction as you when you hit the controls.So I've got two guys with tilted faces, one imp, and three identical guys overlapping each other. Which one of the three identical guys is me? I press right really quick, two step right and one steps left. Everyone else runs randomly around at random intervals.Telling the ""pillocks"" and imps from myself isn't too hard, but it's near-impossible to tell which character is you. You have ~4 seconds to figure out which guy is you *and* get him over to the falling hat, while simultaneously discerning which shadows are hats and which are murderous objects. Again, these objects can be just slightly faster *or* slower than hats, giving you very little means of discerning them from one another.The end result is a game that tasks you with catching 1500 hats, while making the whole thing practically unplayable past the first few ""tutorial"" hats. Every so often, you'll trigger a little event, but nothing worth grinding away for.Even as someone who watched ZP from the beginning, I don't feel this game is worth my time or my money. I don't find it particularly funny, and the gameplay is so godawful I'm surprised Yahtzee agreed to put his name on it and allow it to be sold."

,Recommended,403700,19180502,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,DD [The Dignitary],"Hatfall is a great game. Combining both challenging and fun gameplay, Hatfall is sure to leave you on your toes.To explain on this a bit, let's talk about the gameplay. You play as Yahtzee (famous from Zero Punctuation) who has lost his hat. Whilst this may not sound like something interesting, believe me it's quite fun. It combines a mechanic found often in mobile games, namely short and quick reaction gameplay. Your task is to get Yahtzee his nice looking hat back. Every 25 hats you get to choose between ""gifts"" indicated by the progress bar on the sections below the level. Said gifts, when unlocked, frequently permit a minigame to be unlocked: e.g. Unlocking Hatsassin's Creed causes you to be dropped of in a clear parody of a dating sim.The game itself doesn't prefer to play nice on you. Instead it favors to downright insult the player. In-between level sections and a second before the level begins, you get a pop-up message. These message always involve doing something with a hat. If you succeed, you are greeted with another popup message, which always involves boosting Yahtzee's massive ego or make more fun about hats. But those things are insulting to the player who doesn't know what Zero Punctuation is: A webshow about reviewing Video Games on their negative points. Of course the game was going to be insulting.Although I don't know what the 1500 hat collective does yet, it will probably involve Yahtzee laughing at me for wasting my time on this great addictive game."

From standard hat-collecting to its minigames, Hatfall is recommended to those fans of Zero Puncuation, fans of fast-paced gameplay or simply just want a good time-waster for achievements."

Along the way you can collect largest useless gifts, play a series of absurd sidegames and even save the world from a giant planetoid made up of all the hats you've collected thus far. If this sounds like your kind of game then maybe you should reconsider your life choices... after playing this game for another hour."
