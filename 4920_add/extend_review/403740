,Not Recommended,403740,18195274,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,XTChrisTX,"This game is cheap, but it should have been free, and even then I'd hesitate in recommending it. It's an RPG Maker game, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but this game is a perfect example of a mediocre RPG Maker game that never should have been greenlit in the first place.As soon as the game started, warning bells started going off in my head. The intro text is partially cut off, which reeks of inadequate beta testing, and the first area looks horrible. It starts at the Valve office, which would be okay if it didn't look so terrible. After that, there's a generic elemental dungeon which is nothing but tedious and annoying filler. Then there's Aperture Science, which is actually somewhat decent and the best part of the game, but very short. The last area of the game is City 17, or rather a generic urban area that really looks nothing like City 17 or any city at all.There's no consistency in visual style at all. The graphics are either completely stock RPG Maker assets or bad Paint jobs. Inexplicably, one character portrait is the former and the other is the latter. All the inventory icons are from the standard icon set, even though they're supposed to be items from Valve's games, and I have no idea why this is the case. The tilesets are RPG Maker DLC, which is fine, but they're badly used, with most areas big, empty, and ugly. Oh, and everything is using a custom font which is almost unreadable.Custom scripts are used, and to be honest sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. The battle system is a slightly modified version of the stock one, and it's actually pretty good (but the battles themselves aren't- more on that later). It has a great look and feel. On the other hand, the menu system is eye-searingly hideous and basically impossible to use. There are a few other bits and pieces here and there but they mostly contribute without being hugely noticeable one was or the other.The gameplay is tedious, incoherent, and unbalanced. There's little in the way of exploration or free-roaming; it's more or less a linear slog through battles with no opportunity to look around. Well, there are the mazes, but you'll be so irritated you won't want to explore. Battles are either laughably easy or atrociously difficult- none strike any sort of satisfying balance. Most of the enemies are completely standard and nothing really fits into the story in a sensible way. Leveling is odd, equipment is odd, skills are odd; it all feels very much thrown together.It's ostensibly a parody, but this game fails at that, too. The plot is nonexistent- something something Illuminati and Valve characters make an appearance for no logical reason. There are a few attempts at humour, but for a supposedly funny game it's actually pretty serious most of the time. Most of the jokes are at best dated and at worst never funny to begin with.I should cover sound design, but I don't really have much to say about it. Take that as a sort of neutral statement. It wasn't bad enough to be memorable or good enough to be memorable.It's also really short, at maybe an hour and a half. I'm not sure if that's a curse or a blessing.Don't buy this game. Supposedly, Gabe Newell signed off on the use of his image, but I have a hard time believing he actually took any more than a cursory glance at this game before doing so. This is a lazy, badly made game that might be okay if it was free but shouldn't have any money spent on it. Or, if the creator had put in some more time and effort, it might actually be worth the $3 I paid for it."

It's just random enemies. The gameplay gets boring pretty quick too. The spawn rates of enemies are insane, and the game lacks a punch. You just sit there waiting for it to end. I'm really sorry but this game is not worth recommending.The ending hints the 2nd part of the game to be released. I hope it will be better next time. I wish you the best with the sequel."

Is this game really worth your money? Well depends, do you like ludicrous RPG Maker games that are more about jokes than mechanics? If not then no. If so, then yes. The gameplay is simple, use arrow keys to move, enter is your action button and combat functions like a pokemon game in simplistic turn-based fashion. The artwork is pretty much just google images put into the game so you can imagine it's all pretty bad yet mildly humourous. I also cannot stop laughing at the copy/pasted pic of GabeN in this game... so funny. All in all, this game will probably get pulled for copyright reasons but it's good for a few yucks. Honestly, I'd be more inclined to recommend it if it was .99 cents rather than almost 3 bucks.Gameplay Footage and Impressions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RZn89e7pnM"

The trailer, It is the creapest thing I have ever seen, Recorded with bandi-cam and edited with windows movie maker? Why? There are other free recording and editing programs, I can recomend open broadcaster software (for recording) and Hit Film 3 Express (for editing).Secondly, I did not enjoy this game. I feel like am just going by a storyline just set out for me, No real freedom. Just fighting this monster here and fighting that monster over there... Plain and simple its just not fun. And when you get down to the bone, games need to be fun.Last but not least, I dont think the developer took time to make the game and just wanted to make a quick buck from suckers who would puchase any old ""GabeN"" Novelty game on steam, To anyone who did not like this game... Renember, steam has got a refund policy. I dont know about you but I am getting a refund!"

I mean, judging from the screenshots and trailers, I was easily expecting GOTY material.Nah mate, even better. It's pure comedic geniussssss.But seriously, so much missed potential here. It started off good, story was simple yet interesting. However it becomes easily apparent that this could've been another one of those RPG Maker titles that you find on sites like GameJolt etc.The developer could've used actual characters from Valve's game series in terms of fodder enemies, but instead decided to go the even cheaper route by just using random fantasy monster character models and then 'recolouring' them for each different area, because that just screams variety doesn't it?Oh and don't even get me started on the villain, the developer had to resort to the 'Illuminati' as an easy way of making a villain without any actual character development, because f**k, since when did character development ever make a story interesting in the first place?!?! AMMI RIGHT?!!I have no idea why I'm judging this game so harshly, maybe it's the fact that I payed ACTUAL money for something that could've been easily released free on a indie developers website. I'm just not even surprised that something like this made it past Steam Greenlight, seeing as how much crap pours out of that place everyday.Oh and one last thing before I give my final verdict, the developer Alex Zhang has the NERVE to end this game on a cliffhanger and say ''Part II coming soon guys!'' I mean, since when was there any hint of there being an actual sequel?!? I mean at least have the initiative to put Part I in the title! Just saying.All in all, I give this game 11/10, FISHIN' FOR DAYZz m8sriously, refund as soon as you get all the trading cards."

However, the Illuminati the interferes, and Gaben (along with Mike) decide to try and get to the bottom of it. It's a story of memes and a lot of battles with fantastical creatures from... fantasy lands?This game will do a lot to try and burn your eyes with the awful background colour on the UI. You'll also find yourself getting extremely frustrated at the sheer number of encounters as the encounter rate is exceptionally high. At first, the enemies actually do make some sense. Once you get into the random encounters they start just pulling from the stock of RPGMaker assets to fill in. Despite there being several ""wings"" to the dungeon, one for each element, the enemies are just recolours. There isn't much interesting about the combat as it's usually just a matter of spam attack until you win. Bosses get a bit more strategy in that they involve actually using some skills!I can't recommend this game at all unless you really want to get into the heavy memes present. Even if you do, I still wouldn't recommend it. Other than the actual enemies that made sense at the start, there really isn't much redeeming about this title."

I will say, the amount of occurances we get with monsters are quite aggrivating, but aside from that, the developer gives us great humor and the game definatly passes the absurdity level, and that's what I like about it. Creative title."

,Recommended,403740,25847192,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,GeoffEff,"Rumor has it that this game was designed and developed by a middle schooler. Sure, he did use RPG Maker. As someone who has now played through this game twice let's be honest here. #1 buy it when it's on sale. It's worth a few dollars for a couple of hours of entertainment. #2 Before you think about lighting up this game in reviews because it's super short, lacks any real depth or level design and just randomly ends; think about where you were in middle school. Me? I was too busy crushing over Sara N who would never like me back, making a terribly weak Necromancer in Diablo 2 and thinking that using the M249 in CS 1.6 was ""cool"". So, kudos to this kid for the two hour basic game.Pro Tip: grind in Aperture Labs until you're level 70 then go fight GlaDOS. You'll have zero difficulty with the rest of the game going forward and will beat it all at level 99."
