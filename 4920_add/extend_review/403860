,Not Recommended,403860,30783810,Posted: 27 March,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Alpages: The Five Books is an indie horror arcade title by Nicolas Bernard, the same developer that created Terror Labs. SnipZ, and Showtime 2073. As its genre and store page suggests, you run around killing zombies and other supernatural creatures, all while trying to find 5 books. Each book has a unique enemy that spawns somewhere on the map after you pick it up, the kicker being that they are invincible.Let it first be said that there are absolutely no worthwhile features to this game. Everything from the poor title screen that has an abundance of spelling and grammatical errors, to the uninspired gameplay itself. Enemies spawn atrociously fast, meaning that if you actually spend your time playing the game the way that the developer intended, you would be doing nothing but fighting zombies, picking up health, and replenishing your ammo supply instead of making any progress toward finding the books. It's best to just keep on running around the needlessly large map instead; it took me about 15 minutes to find 3 of the 5 books.That being said, I had to turn my attention away from the game and in doing so I instinctively pressed ESC to pause. When I came back to my PC some two minutes later, I found out that the ESC key isn't pause at all, it actually resets the whole game. I have no idea what kind of crap that is, but the developer needs to change that, and fast. It's just the ugly corn-filled turd on the crap cake that is Alpages: The Five Books. Even the HUD is boring, and for some reason when you collect 1 life, you get two, but when you die you lose two lives as well. There are multiple instances of this type of attention to detail missing from this game.Alpages: The Five Books isn't even worth the $0.54 CAD when it's on a 50% off sale. The world and atmosphere are bland, the gameplay is tried and true but somehow even worse than most indie zombie shooters, and it's set at an unnatural and unfairly high difficulty. To put it bluntly the game just isn't fun in any aspect; unless running around a huge, empty map collecting books, lives, ammo, and health with endlessly, and frequently, spawning zombies that hit too hard is your idea of enjoyment.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,403860,23199308,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,Whiterabbit-uk,"After reading all of the negative reviews for this game I was dubious about  playing it.  Thankfully  I was  actually very  pleasantly surprised when I did finally boot up the game.  You really need to keep your wits about you  while playing because   zombies,  and other   animals will spawn  close behind you as well as in front, and  with  several different types of  zombie spawing randomly, some of which are quite challenging to  kill because they are so quick.  You will soon find yourself losing  lives rapidly.Personally I'd much rather play Alpages in third person,  because  then  I'd be able to  see  zombies and other animals spawning behind me  without having to change my viewpoint constantly; unfortunately  that  isn't an option and consequently  I died regularily  until I developed  a style of play that had me circling  virtually all of the time to keep my sixes in sight.  This did initially  give me  a little  sea sickness and was exhausting, but  once I got used to the style I was able to survive for much longer, and managed to find   three of the books  before   losing all of my lives.I've played the game  so far for  over three hours and have still to get close to   beating  this  very challenging game, that has  decent  graphics  and sound effects (for the price), with a day and night cycle (when you respwan), and  some very atmospheric and at times  spooky   environments  with the occasional maze like area's that can leave you dazed and confused (I'm now playing  my original copy of  Led Zep's first album  on my old record deck) and for the ridiculoulsy low price of £0.79/$0.99 there are enough game play  elements such as   power ups; for example, other weapons,  ammo and health plants,  and if you  die, the books you are collecting  do spawn in different places, so you never know  where they are going to be  from each play through,  making  Alpages a very replayable  game and IMO  well worth purchasing.It's not the best survival game I've played, but  really,  for the price, the time and effort I've personally put into the game has been   a very positive experience and does not deserve such a  negative  score that it has so far garnered. At least a couple of hours of game play is needed to really appreciate this game.Check out  AtypicalChuck's reviewHERE, which I think gives a good and well balanced review of this game.  What I don't understand is why     loads of negative reviews come first before you see any thumbs up.  That is bound to put a damper on  a lot of  community members before  they even check  the game out via You Tube to see for themselves what the game play entails. The following videos were not  recorded by me.  I've added them so that you can see   some game play footage.  Both are worth watching through, (one is  in French and one in English). The French guy makes me laugh  in a pleasant sort of way.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zGaVMHmv-o(43 minutes)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaBdx6dip94(9 minutes)"

It wasn'tas badas I thought it would be, was still pretty bad though.The main menu lacks any control options, no way to change your sensitivity.Graphically it's a mess, ammunition pick ups aremassiveand so are the books. The lighting, is atrocious, it's hard to see in some places, bright in others. The animations for the guns are atrocious, the textures in this game arew absolutely horrendous!Sound was very bad as well, thankfully it wasn't ear-poppingly loud, but there is no option to adjust the sound regardless. The music seemed to be all over the place, the zombie sound effects were very stock, to the point I actually heard quite of a few of them in songs I listen to.As for Gameplay, it's just Slender The Eight Pages, but with guns and zombies. Honestly, it wasn't super bad. Not great or even good, but the concept is sort of different, I guess?Overall, yes the game is very mediocre, far from the worst thing I've ever played, however.I don't suggest buying it even on sale."

In any case this is an incredibly obnoxious title that will constantly have zombies moaning in your ears and spawning in circles all around you, the zombies die in one bullet and have large hitboxes, but their constant non stop spawning is truly a force that will chip at you little by little, not your health or your ammo, those drop randomly all around you as well. But it will chip at your sanity and patience. There is no enjoyment here, only suffering a bad video game."

I believe this game is broken.  Sometimes when I continue, I have my weapon, other times, I am weaponless and run around until I die. I have not seen any weapons laying around to pick up, just a lot ammo, red plants and exploding barrels.Also, you have to stop to pick stuff up with enemies ALL around you!  That is just a stupid choice and needs to be changed! You should be albe to just run over stuff to pick it up! With so many enemies pounding on you, it makes one wonder if the game was tested or not!Suggestions:-Give us either fists, a knife, or a pistol by default.  Many times after I died and tried to continue, I ended up weaponless and just ran around searching for a weapon until I died!  Made the game unplayable and super frustrating.  Why even put extra lives and a continue button in if you don't have your weapons anymore?  I know that I still had ammo left.  This bug is random and needs to be fixed!-As frantic as the gameplay is, with enemies spawning from ALL direstions, you need to change the way items are picked up.  Having to stop to pick stuff up is certain death!  Did you even test play this game?+On the plus side, you can take more damage before dying than their other crappy game.The game runs silky smooth on my MacBook Pro:Hardware Overview:Model Name:  MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)Processor Name:  Intel Core i7Processor Speed:  2.8 GHzNumber of Processors:  1Total Number of Cores:  4L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KBL3 Cache:  6 MBMemory:  16 GB Type:  DDR3  Speed:  1600 MHzVideo Card:  AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MBOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)"

I won second try, you i advise you dont take seriously people who only play for 5 minutes. To pick stuff up, stop running and press ETHE CRIES OF THE WICHSo basically this game is a free roam ""arcade like"" game. I say arcade like because i see this no different from arcade games where you see for how long you survive but whatevs.This game consists of an OK built free roam area, with some rather well made visual scenes, if one was to take screenshots, for an indie game, it is definetelly note worthy, though some bits of the map also do confuse me. Some rocky areas do end up in you having to fight your way out in an unatural way, or a huge tree that seems to have a blocky invisible wall. There are also a few areas that are built like mazes, i like it, but i think a slight pinch of more ""realism"" to those areas, namely the military compund, would not hurt, and would actually lead to mowing down zombies on towers.I digress, we have an OK built free roam area, definetely spascious, 2 weapons, an AR (automatic rifle) and a shotgun, the rifle seems to lose the sound if you get hit whilst spraying but no big deal tbh, you will hardly notice it with the decent soundtrack, it fits, though i suspect some assets were taken from somewhere else.Your goal is to collect 5 gigant floating books (ok? lel) collecting magazines and extra lives and weird red plant thingies along the way to help you combat the Wich (biggest ♥♥♥♥ing headache) who freezes you in place for a moment and chases you, if she catches you then RIP, the crazy clown, who seems to do aboslutely nothing unless you stop moving, the Plant Beast, who obstructs your path, though, that right there can be taken to your advantage, if you get good at dodging obstacles, you can regen your health whilst slowing down other monsters and the teddy bear who will rapidly take away health but will disappear if you run enough, i recommend going down hills, the bear has one consistant speed.Upon collecting the 5 Books you must now kill all of the main beasts, mainly the witch. I dunno about the plant tbh. The barrels definetely do help, the wich? Shotgun will do it :DIt´s a good game for 99 cents (i bought for 59 cents), lacks options but it is definetely a good game to try as it keeps you on edge. It needs a new map and a new gun would be nice tbh,My thought? Check it out!"

At first I made it to the mill and some goofy voice yelled ""Give me your blood"" I thought it was funny but then the zombies appearing and attacking made it  more intense. Roaming and searching for the books knowing anytime they can appear also keeps you on your toes. Also you gotta watch your back cause they will sneak up on you. The backround music is also something thats adds to the suspense. Its early access so yes there are things to work on. I dont realy care that theres no introduction story to know how you ended up there. You just start the game. The obvious things are I want to see a health bar and ammo bar. The aiming could be improved as well. I'd prefer to start off with a double barrel shotgun, 2 rounds then you need to reload. Then work up to finding better weapons, like the M4, or maybe a semi auto RugerMini14, revolvers, pump action shotguns,  maybe even a machette.  Oh and can we get a pause button please. Thanks"

But since there isn't and the game is functional I'll bump it to a positive review only because well.. it's $1It's a very straight forward routine arena shooter. There's 5 stages, you run around an open world trying to collect a book (to progress to the next level) while random zombies and nonsense (like teddy bears) attack you.The spawn mechanics are pretty cheap, you'll get attacked from behind far too often for it to be fun. But the novelty factor of some of the enemies might earn a chuckle here and there. And the random spawns can also be non dangerous animals which makes for a few laughs as you panic attack a deer or a pig only to be jumped from a zombie that spawned behind you.If you have a high tolerance for random shooting games this can make for an interesting hour or so of gameplayIf you are looking for something longer or more in depth, look elsewhere. This is as simple and to the point as a shooter can be with minimilist design.But I've seen worse, and it's ony $1 so, there you go"
