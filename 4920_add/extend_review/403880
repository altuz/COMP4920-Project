I don't think I would pay 40 euros for the same engine based game. I would expect AAA optimized graphics, but Compact is really balanced at the price and features. If you like MotoGP, this one is to get."

I've turned off most of the help, like the guide line and steering assist, but still...In Forza that wouldn't be a problem. I usually find the guide line distracting. MotoGP 15 is a lot of fun. I appreciate the difficulty, I love motorcycle racing, the graphics are good, and I dont have anything to complain about. Especially at $10. If you want a game that's built around letting you win, skip this one. Otherwise gruel on."

This is a similar game with improvements. If you are new to bike racing, i suggest you to buy full version because this one does not have a career mode. For bike racing fanes, this game is pretty enough.Long review:I am a fan of motogp games and i have realy enjoyed this game. Motogp 15 is a bike racing simulation with realistic physics. There are real names (marquez, rossy...) and the game has enough tuning variety to include you into details.Pros:- Realistic game. Hardcore game :D- Tuning is literaly the key to win or lose a race.- There is an assistant to help you with tuning.- There is a championship mode, where you can actually be valentino rossi.Cons:- Not exactly a con but this is a compact game without a career mode. I think there is no tutorial either.You would like this game as a bike racing game. Even if you played motogp 14, this one has better graphics and optimization."

Of course there is the odd bug or two and sure the actual riding mechanics make no sense at all, but hey, thats all part of the fun."

The sound that the bikes have in this game sounds like a early 2000's rallycross game. worthless. cmon milestone, you can do better than this!"

As for the fact I couldn't make an online username/account (due to not being sent the registration email?!) I refunded and have to give it a negative review. What's the point of online scoreboards if you can't access them...?"

,Not Recommended,403880,20143749,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,Anti Cap,"Beware Newbies.After recently getting into racing games and wanting to try out a bike racing game, I picked up MotoGP 15 Compact after reading a review from another user. I was excited to try the game and was looking forward to riding a motorbike for the first time.That being said, I have to warn you. This game is not for newbies. It is not an entry into racing games by any means. This game's controls are exceptionally difficult and personally I was not willing to put the effort into learning them.The graphics are beautiful, sound is on point and everything is top notch but those controls are extremely unforgiving, even with all the assists turn on. I know some of you may simply think I'm a noob, but that's the whole point. From a newbie's prespective I would definitely recommend avoiding this one as it is clearly catered to people who have experience with racing games.I could barely keep my bike on the road and couldn't get out of last place no matter how hard I tried due to the extremely difficult learning curve. This is not a game for newbies and definitely not for people just starting out with racing games. Unfrortunately I can't really recommend any other alternatives so if you do want to put in the effort to learning the mechanics and controls in this game just understand that it will take a very long time to master."
