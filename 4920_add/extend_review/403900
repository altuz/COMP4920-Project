,Not Recommended,403900,18178483,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Solid007,"Yet another lazy mobile port. Resolution is locked at 1280 x 768. There are no rebindable keys, which if you are left handed like me, makes the game pretty much unplayable past the first few levels. Plus the game suffers from some of the worst screen tearing issues I have seen in a non-idtech game. You'd be much better off just playing this on mobile since no effort was made to make the port PC friendly."

Please don't buy this... not even for 1 penny its not worth it.Gameplay is so boring that you just run around throwing bombs at the same exact enemies over and over until u can go to the next level to do the same thing over and over again.The art style is straight up ugly!!! Normally I love art but this one is just trash for the level designs and all the characters are straight up ugly that it feels like it was made with a really old painting software... Oh ya and the music is terrible as well. The music feels like your being brainwashed into the most annoying Saturday morning cartoon show that is purposely ment to destroy your mind!!!Also there are no menus to change options with this game... ya there is no options for controls-therefore no key rebindings or controller support-no audio options to turn off the godawful music, and no graphics options to change the resolution... absolutely pathetic. Not to mention the game doesn't really tell you any of the controls when you start the game so your off to finding them out yourself.Conclusion: Stay the hell away from this disgusting garbage of a game... there is nothing of good quality here no matter what you spend for it.Rating: 1/10"

Game cannot be played as it is Out of Range for my monitor. Changing config files has no effect. Forcing window mode crashes it. Forcing scren resolution crashes it. There are no options to blindly fumble through to change it to get it to work. Black Screen Simulator the game. Didn't even bother with cards. Refund requested.

,Recommended,403900,19207799,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,Maple Walnut,"I don't know how to feel about this game. I've played the mobile version (which is free) and this game is exactly the same save the keyboard controls. I feel really cheated by the makers of the game for taking a free game and selling on steam for money. It's a huge offence. On the bright side side, the keyboard controls do amplify the game and make it far less annoying to play. Except for the fact that you still throw bombs in the direction you walk. This game needs a lot of things, a better menu, that's made for pc and you can scroll through using your arrow keys since you don't use the mouse in the game. Also, the controls aren't great. The music gets repetitive and the sound effects clash with it. The graphics are sub-par since it was taken directly from the mobile version. Controller support would be nice, along with maybe using WASD controls and the mouse to aim and fire as to improve controls. The gameplay isn't bad and is worth your 16 cents sale price, but the game does have problems that make it not worth the full price. This game needs a major update before it's worth full price, but I'm recommending it since the sale lasts for quite awhile :D"
