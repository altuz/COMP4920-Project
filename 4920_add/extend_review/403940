There's very little skill element. the progression involved hours upon hours of grinding. 17 hours in I just don't feel like any satisfaction from completing the game will justify struggling with the same repetitive gamplay any longer.Maybe the game can be salvaged with a couple of patches. More equipment to buy, shorter levels and a few more skills. It just feels that a 4 hour game had been needlessly stretched into something that requires 40 tom complete."
,Recommended,403940,21345108,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Athravan,"Casual Strategy FunDungelotwas the very first game I played on my iPad, and introduced me to the fact the casual / mobile gaming could have strategy and depth. This is a PC port of the sequel to that original iOS game, Shattered Lands. I decided to give it a purchase and see how it stands up as a full PC game, and the answer is very well!In Dungelot you are given a set of hidden tiles that make up a dungeon floor. You must click on those tiles to find the exit to proceed to the next level. Underneath the tiles can be magic, healing, traps, chests, keys and of course, monsters. You can only clear tiles that are not protected; so you need to work out which tiles you can uncover by killing the monsters with your hero, whilst taking the least amount of damage possible. If you take too much damage, it's game over and you'll have to start a new game. This is why it's compared to Minesweeper; as there's a basic level of strategy that involves working out how many tiles you'll free up with each battle and using that knowledge to pick your fights.As strategy games go, it's a casual one, but does have a surprising amount of depth and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Just as much fun as I had on the original game. Just bear in mind that it is more about the RNG, the Roguelike elements, character progression and the strategy of combat. The Minesweeper comparison is fairly superficial. It's a rogue-like-lite (that's a word right?) in that you are pretty much destined to die at first, but with each run you gain gold that you can spend on permanent upgrades that will make the next run easier and easier. Thus, you can progress ever further onwards. Some simple improvements that would make the game better in my personal opinion would be larger dungeons with a lot more tiles and a larger pool of classes with different abilities to add more depth to selection.There is a little bit of a delibately trope-filled story and tongue-in-cheek dialogue, with a world map and different kingdoms to conquer. The first zone concludes with you fighting theepic zombie cow, who has turned against the vampire Vlad and over-ran his realm, tired of years of being sucked dry. It includes such classy dialogue as""Moo-ortals!""and other excessive Moo-ing. You start with one class, but can unlock four, each of which has a different strength and weakness, and there's a small amount of strategy involved in choosing your class. Although mostly I found it was just picking the one I had the most fun with.And that's what this game comes down to - it's simple, it's casual, but it's satisfying to play and definitely fun so a thumbs up from me!P.S.If you think this level of strategy is just too casual for you to enjoy whilst sitting at the PC, check out the games on iOS, where they really are perfect for short spurts of gaming whilst away from the computer and are full, microtransaction-free games."

As the game describes, it plays like a Dungeon Crawler mixed with Minesweeper.  If you've ever looked at or played a game on Steam called Runestone Keeper, the gameplay is very similar.BRIEF DESCRIPTION:As the game begins you have one class unlocked (Paladin) and you can unlock the other 3 as you progress through the game's Acts.  In each act there is a number of stages for you to complete in order to finish the act.  Each dungeon comprises of a sort of turn-based tile exploration, which can result in finding treasure, items, or enemies to combat.  Some of the enemies have different passive and active skills, and can even interact with other monsters in the dungeon, so I find it's best to fight them 1 on 1 rather than reveal a whole bunch of nasties at once.  Your character has skills, a small inventory, and stats like Health, Armor, Charge, and Attack Power that you need to monitor and upgrade to progress.  Overall it's a fun game, and I enjoy games like this.PROS:-Cute graphics and art style-Unique items and enemies-Complex gameplay, makes you think before acting (can be a Pro or Con depending on the user)-Turn Based-Rewarding in terms of making your character better after progress through dungeons/bosses-Good amount of voice-acting (for your playable characters anyway)CONS:-The game is a tad bit expensive in my opinion, however I will have to see how much time I can actually put into this before I make that claim (will edit later if need be).-Sometimes the UI feels a bit counter-intuitive, I feel like they could make it a little smoother, but it's not horrible.-(placeholder for editing later)TL;DR:This game is a pretty good turn-based RPG dungeon crawling tile exploration game.  For $9 you can't really go wrong, and in the time I've played it so far, it's been fun and addicting.  If this is your last $9 to your name, I would suggest saving it to feed yourself, otherwise, give this game a shot.  There aren't TONS of these types of games on the market, but there's definitely a niche for them.8.5 Mouses Named Tom out of 10.SUGGESTIONS:-Maybe some kind of bank you can put gold in between dungeons that returns your money after a successfully completed dungeon + interest?-More characters please <3-Add an option to click the mouse during dialogue so that it skips to the end of their text sentence so we don't have to watch the painfully slow text fill in.-Maybe have the merchant offer 1 more item, and this final item is a super good one but really expensive?"

There is only a small amount of equipment, and most weapons have a terrible reduction to accuracy which makes them all unusable in my opinion (30% chance to miss and two handed means there's no ability to equip a shield. That's not good enough for a 10% gain in attack power).However I actually enjoy the game so much that I can let it slide. I stick with my favorite pieces of equipment, and if I have an unlucky run, I get to keep my earned gold and start again. Unlocking new heroes and spells is great. The tavern unlocks give you an extreme boost in power as well. I also really like how the enemies have a lot of unique abilities which makes the game feel fresh all the way through.All in all, I'd give this game a big thumbs up. It's also touch friendly if you have a windows tablet, and the game is locked to 30fps which is great for your battery life."

However if you don't then get it on pc, it's still worth the money.The minesweeper aspect is quite minimal, other than having squares you click and monsters that once uncovered block the squares around it. I think advertising this as a minesweeper meats dungeon crawler is fair but it's not a number based game like minesweeper.Graphics are cute, they suite the style.My worst aspect about this game is easily the item system, it's awful! You need to open your bag, select your bomb, then press use, then select the enemy you wish to attack with the bomb, it's far too many clicks, it really does detract from the game, also when I craft an item it takes ages to finish the animation before you can leave, it's a bit repeitiveand tidious, speically if you craft a few items in a row.

,Recommended,403940,21975670,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,PerfectPencil,"Just to get this out of the way: this is a mobile game port. It's not a bad port, though. There are a few moments when it feels like a mobile game, but they are few and far in between. There is a lot to talk about here so lets get at it...PROS:1) Dungelot takes an idea from Minesweeper (yes, the original windows title from 1989) and it quite gracefully builds on the long forgotten game mechanic.2) Art in Dungelot is really well polished. Extremely polished, actually. The whole game has been buffed to such an extremely bright shine that it is probably as good as you can get from a 2D game with bonebased animations.3) The game feels good in large bites or in nibbles. You can play for 10 minutes or an hour and have fun. This design in this regard is pretty clearly for the ""mobile"" market, but games like this have a home on PCs too. Not all of us have the time (or attention span) to dedicated 4-5 hours in one sitting for Dota2 or something.4) Gameplay is easy to learn and fun to play through. There is nuance and some tactical layers hidden under it's simplicity, but it isn't like Othello or Go, games that are classically ""quick to learn, slow to master"".CONS:1) As a mobile port the game is quite simplified. Perhaps too simplified for the PC, though. Clicking on everything is remeniscent of touch-screen gameplay and that at times can actually hurt the game. Complexity is not a virtue within it's own right, but just as a hammer doesn't need a wifi connection, but does well with the prybar to pull screws... Dungelot feels like a hammer without the prybar.2) Menu Navigation is clumsy at times. When trying to vew my hero, i can accidentally click back to the main menu without realising how I did so. There is some nuance lost when porting to PC.3) UI design is also...lacking. Opening up the ""backpack"" feels like a chore and simply ""adds clicks"" without adding depth. The bag only allows 4-6 slots and you can fit all 6 of them on the UI without much worry. This makes the whole ""backpack"" kind of a clumsy addition.CONCLUSION:I really like Dungelot. I am willing to say that for a PC port it is actually a fairly solid one and almost everything I see wrong with the game can be patched. I do hope that the developer cares enough about the PC community to patch the game with some PC appropriate fixes, but there is no way to know for sure. As I play the game I enjoy my experience and the little details that I may nitpick are overshadowed by what Dungelot does really well: feel fun to play. Over all it is a surprisingly well rounded game. It is a game that anyone can get into and enjoy and I think it deserves to be in the library of both casual and semi-serious gamers. Hardcore players will always have Dark Souls to enjoy, but games like Dungelot are great for everyone else. And that is the majority of gamers.Purchased this at full price and feel very content with the 9.99 USD price point."

,Recommended,403940,22373116,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,Aegeri,"This is an interesting mix of genres, with something approaching a light RPG with what amounts to a weird version of minesweeper. Each level of the Dungelot, you get a series of dungeon tiles that you need to dig out to find a key in order to exit to the next level. Sometimes under the tiles you might find items, pits or rather frequently, monsters. These monsters work like a reverse minesweeper, preventing you from uncovering the tiles they are adjacent to until they are defeated. The trick is that unlike normal RPGs, the monsters strike first and you have only a limited pool of armor and health. So there is a fine line between digging tiles, killing monsters and trying to exit to get to the next floor as soon as you can.Generally speaking, this is actually a pretty fun mix and the game has an incredibly goofy, but quite charming, sense of humor. The first boss of the game is basically a gigantic zombie cow, whose only expression is basically a zombie moo equivalent. Unfortunately, I think the game does have some flaws and one of them is in the incredibly poor feedback during combat. Sometimes things just seem to happen, resulting in you losing health/armor from a fight, but seemingly not damaging or bothering the enemy that much. Usually this is because the enemy has dodge or your weapon has a miss chance, but there isn't good feedback as to why something happens. So you can click on something and discover that you've lost quite a bit of health, because the combat animations play so indistinctly and without giving a good indication what happened.Additionally the game was recently patched adding a further complication, where some tiles can give you bonuses or (much more rarely) rewards if you dig them fast enough. A good example are the tiles that if you break, buff all the enemies in the area quite substantially for a period of turns. Similarly, there's a buff that if you reach fast enough can improve your attacks, but I will say these buffs are rare. The detrimental effects spawn much more commonly and this has greatly increased the games difficulty in places. Generally speaking, it's a bit counter intuitive, but there's not much of an incentive to engage with enemies if you can until the lowest levels of the dungeon you're on. Picking fights too early can cripple you towards the end, especially in the longer dungeons that can have 20+ floors to them.Overall I think this is an entertaining and fun little distraction that I come back to for a while when I feel like playing something fairly light."

76561198130138502,Not Recommended,403940,21381830,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,BlueSteelWheels,"I am enjoying this game, and I don't regret purchasing it.  I can't recommend it though in its current state.First the good.  The art style is fantastic.  From the characters to the bosses to the tiles everything is very detailed and beautiful.  Animations are very well done.  The level of challenge seems decently balanced.  You can make choices that really hinder your progress or that make the game relatively easy.  It's not too difficult but not too easy for the average player.The bad, however, heavily outweighs the good.  Itemization feels very unbalanced.  One of the first unlockable weapons has such powerful abilities that it will carry you through the entire game.  Halving damage and parrying are infinitely more powerful than a 1 in 20 chance of a modest effect, especially when your damage is tied more to your character itself than the weapon's damage.  Add the fact that the later weapons are two-handed, which incurs an accuracy penalty and sacrifices the ability to use shields, and they are all but worthless.  Armor is similar.  You can fight through the most difficult dungeons to obtain character specific armor that once again gives modest effects, only to discover the more easily obtainable armor is superior.  This could all change if proc chances were much higher, but as it stands be prepared for let downs on discovering new items.The quest system doesn't make sense at times.  You have 3 quests active at a time, and those quests change depending on the area you are in.  When you complete a quest a new one takes its place until all quests are exhausted.  It can be confusing and annoying to kill 30 goblins and have a quest pop up to kill 30 kobolds, only to find out that the kobolds you already killed don't count.  The kobolds in the next act won't count either, as quests are not global.  The quests do not have a counter, so you have to count them yourself or just be surprised.    Global quests or simply listing all of the areas' quests from the start would go a long way toward alleviating this issue.  Of course there's also the bug of some quest achievements not registering at all once you've completed them.The game is simply riddled with bugs.  None that I have encountered have been game breaking, ie corrupting, but they are enough to make the average player move on.  Some bugs are benign, such as bomb upgrades not working until you restart the game.  Others range from confusing to very annoying.  If you are fast clicker you may find yourself frequently exiting dungeons or restarting when bugs won't let you click tiles or your dungeon is a solid black screen.  Maybe you'll get lucky though and recreate the infinite crafting bug or the bug that allows your Paladin to have first strike and infinite spells for the entire dungeon.Sadly this game has all the signs of a money grab iport.  If you have a lot patience, then this game can be very enjoyable.  Otherwise give it a pass or watch to see if the devs fix the problems."

Way too many clicks to perform an action. For the first hour or two, you don't really mind but afterwards it's very annoying.2-The progression in the game is also problematic, the availability of new Armors and Weapons  has no logic. I've been playing for hours and I'm still ONLY at the second Armor, all of the other Armor are still unavailable. On the weapons side, I'm offered the last weapon of the list but not some of the ones before ??? Why ?3-It gets very difficult very fast.4-Getting Gold takes way too much time. And at the end, I was going into the mazes clicking whatever only to get gold, I didn't mind about dying, I just wanted to get gold to get better weapons (and other options) just to get by some of the difficult mazes.Overall, the game has a lot of potential but a lot of problems needs to get fix. The game is unpolished and I'm already tired of not progreesing (because it's too hard).I suggest to buy this game in a few months when they'll have fixed all these issues. (The game is not well balanced but you figure this out only after a few hours into the game)"

It's a fun RPG with some roguelike qualities, similar to Desktop Dungeons in terms of actual combat. You can level up your character, unlock different weapons and armor, plus 3 other characters, making a total of 4 characters.There's 3 different ""Acts"", each with it's own theme, giving the game variety, and completing all the acts will give you an overall score for that character you beat it as. So there's replayability in beating your on score.Also, it's a great Coffee Break Game too, and you can save your progress mid dungeon, so you don't have to do it all in one sitting. Still gotta restart the dungeon if you die though.I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes roguelikes, lite RPG's, Coffee Break games, or any combination of the 3."

It's way too grindy for my tastes, and while I don't mind RNG games (I adore the XCom series and Rogue Legacy), Dungelot just doesn't pull it off. Very little gain most of the time through the levels combined with bad RNG and extremely linear play (you don't really have multiple options of levels you could feasibly take on) makes the game extremely dull and boring.I've seen a bunch of reviews with bugs, and I haven't encountered any as of yet, so that's not taken into account in my review.If you enjoy games that are very grindy and RNG heavy, I'd wait for it to be on sale, then the price might offset the negatives. Until then I'd stay away."

If you dont let the animations play out more often than not the game will not realise the action/crafting/item use has occured and occasionally will just completely put the game in an alt+f4 required standstill.The bosses of the normal dungeons are an extremely big let down as more often than not normal mobs in the dungeon will be stronger than the bosses, for example in act 2 one of the dungeons was 25 floors and contained some things including a 2/11 big orc fellow with a few abilitys and effects. Whereas the ""boss"" at the end of the dungeon was a bat with 2/7 with nothing special about it at all.The inventory also annoyed me fairly signigicantly. The game has basic hotkeys eg 1-4 for the 4 abilitys. However the inventory items are hidden in your pack, and require opening and selecting via the mouse to use. Alot of the screen is wasted as black space and could be well utilized to keep your inventory constantly on your screen, however since this game seems very IOS designed I believe that is probably the reason why it was done this way.The crafting as well could do with a way to skip the animation or the capability to craft multiple of the same thing at once as it is quite time consuming sometimes and also frequently broke the game because I accidently left the crafting screen ""early""Aside from the problems above, I do however recommend this game wholeheartedly."
