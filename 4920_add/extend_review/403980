It's not perfect but it's a thousand times better than this.This is bad in every sense possible.Graphically it's well below the standard we should be expecting these days.The controls are difficult to figure out and to programme, mainly because of poor instruction and appalling screen guidance. What's with the timeouts on programming a button? Seriously. Why? What's the rush?The ""on the water"" tutorial is poor and the graphics no better than ""average"" and then there's the harbour.Goodness knows what you can do in the harbour because when I moor/dock and go ""inside the harbour building"" the game slows to a crawl in a way I haven't seen a PC game do in about 15 years. It becomes totally unplayable and even altering graphic settings has no effect whatsoever. Not that I should have to. I have a pretty decent spec PC.However, I can see the graphics in the harbour building are as poor as those outside on the water. Quite possibly worse with badly animated characters walking about. Well I say characters but it is actually the same 3 or 4 lazily cloned people appearing time and time again.Quite simply as so many others have said here its an appallingly made game, it's getting no support whatsoever from the developers.To be honest I think when a full piece of unplayable rubbish such as this is on Steam I think Steam should not only pull the product from sale but should also refund every single sucker who decided to buy it.If World Ship Simulator was a ship it would be the Titanic and we all know what happened to that !!Odin Game Studio you should be ashamed of yourselves  for releasing such a poor, non functioning, badly optimized game. It's a disgrace"

I started with VSTEP's Ship Simulator 2008 which looked like it was heading into the right direction. Then Ship Simulator EXTREME's came about which resulted into a tottal disaster so I gave up on VSTEP. Next I checked out Sail Simulator which is not bad acually just a bit outdated textures and  graphics. WSS looked great at the start but I don't think it's complete yet. It's got alot of work to be done on it especially optimization and I am very confused about how to play. You have to look in another place for a Ship Simulator

I honestly think my grandmother could do a better job using MS paint and she can't even use a Nokia 3310!- Land bird noises out at sea- I know this may sound petty, but really, whenever I have been out at sea (7 ferry journeys this year) I have not seen a single land bird. I understand they migrate twice a year, however, definitely see a lot more Gulls than I see Robins this is for sure- Water coming through the front of the boat- This just feels unfinished as of yet so not overly concerned, however, realistic boat through water effects would be amazing.-Very small world- I hope this will be increased in size massively, I am sorry but 3 or 4 ports will not cut it. In a Sim/Arcade game, size will mean everything, a great example is Euro Truck Simulator, dozens of unique townsWorking lighthouses- I dont think Ive seen a single Sim with a working lighthouse-The lock/unlock function- whereas this may have its uses, I feel that you also need a semi-lock where the throttle will lock after pressing w/s and not have to use the mouse.-Things I'd love to see implemented- buoys, realistic shore lighting, more boat animationsAnd now for the good...-This game has playability potential- yes the missions may be missing depth, but it has missions, and a career structure, and I am not aware of any career structure in a ship sim to date.-The water and boat lighting- the water looks pretty good, and at night with the light shining on it, I think looks even better-The potential this game has, with the right additions, and ensuring the additions have quality, rather than throwing in rubbish, speedily created additions would help add to the games immersability.I look forward to regular updates, and I actually believe with the right care and attention this will be a great sim. After playing for the short time I have, it feels very much like an early Euro Truck Simulator, and that is now probably one of the best sims out there. Keep up the good work devs, and I look forward to giving you more feedback!"

I found it fairly easy to control, and a bit slow, but then? This sort of game should be slower, right?Given the point it is at now as the starting place? I look forward to what it has coming.Water and other graphics looked good to me until going to the Tourism port by Fast Travel. Then the water disappeared or showed my port boat as more of a submarine. Outside that (which didn't crash it, as I could still moor the boat to go into the harbor offices), it looked beautiful on Ultra settings."

I will say as the game is an alfa and is only on its first verison, the game is very far from being a game that is worth buying. The water is not the best looking, when moring it is hard to see the points of conections though the orange bubble, and the graphics on the highest setting looks very poor. I also had a glitch after leaving the game and coming back to it a few hours later a screen came up saying my boat is damaged and is needing repairs. I found this strange because I had not hit anything before hand and then to be charged $1000 in game money was not fun.  Another thing that I think is bad is that when you are in the harbor office it still sounds like you are on the boat. There is no music or any back ground noise while in the office other than the sea.  People in the office are weird and don't interact well. Missions are boaring and sometimes confusing to know what to do. They need to have a thing saying what the diffrent colors mean out side of the totorial. The money system is not very good as it would take many missions to buy any of the ships. The game is very hard to control while fast fowarding time, as it is very laggy and skips a lot.Hope this helps people looking at the game. currently I would wait till further updates and more reviews to buy this game unless you are really into alphas or ships."

,Not Recommended,403980,22388437,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,Dave 2003,"This game is highly inaccurate. I've been the captain of many boats in real life, so I've gotten to know the inside and outside of these vessels. That being said, whenever a boat even emits the slightest whimper, I can identify the make and model of said boat. For example, I spend my leisure time in real life on  my 2009 Yahama 190 FSH, an aquatic vessel with a delightful purr that brings even the most hydrophobic lasses crawling the dock. This game has the NERVE to introduce a sport boat, yet the boat itself sounds more like a Scarab jet boat than my precious Yahama. Stuff like that honestly just makes me want to arm myself with a cartoonish hammer and bonk the devs of this game.Now as far as commercial boating goes, the crimes here are even more pernicious. The Hammerschmidt Shrimpmaster 320 is the standard for fishing boats, obviously. Yet the Hammerschmidt sounds similar to a sustained rhinoceros grunt, echoing through an aluminum tube. If these devs were fisherman, they'd know that. Instead this fishing boat sounds like a baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into an aluminum can. I can't listen to this and not be angry. This horrible mistake could only go unnoticed by the most oblivious of grass men, whose ears are so small that sounds are simply monotone beeps and purrs.Second point, don't even bother me with a tutorial, I know how to pilot a ship. I've been on boats my entire life. My father was the captain of a large skiff, which he used to fish for crab in the Alaskan Sea. Unfortunately fishing regulations caused him to go broke. I think if the liberal up north are so concerned about the life of freaking fish they should just dive into the sea and life among the crabs, sea snails, and aquatic creatures like Aquaman.TLDR this is BULLCRAP.Any real fisherman knows this game is trash created by the aeronautics industry to bring a crappy name to all boating men throughout the world (including the oceans)."

,Not Recommended,403980,23258643,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,Fitzy467,"This is an early access game and nowhere near finished.  Fair enough.  The devs are promising more ships, missions, career mode and possibly free roam.However, the game needs some very fundamental changes to the core.  The graphics are very amateurish and, in the case of the scenes at port where one is trying to choose a mission, the whole thing looks like something from the 1990's.  The NPC's look like something a child would create, the colours are all wrong and are too vibrant.  The port area is excrutiating to look at.The ships exteriors are not too bad, but utter rubbish compared with European Ship Simulator (ESS) which this game is supposed to be replacing!  The bridges are nowhere near as good as ESS either and equally lacking in any interactivity with most of the controls not working.  The UI controls are too small and are tricky to grab with the mouse, especially the throttles.  The sea is not as good as ESS either and the water breaking over the bow looks rather like a poorly done snow storm.  The background pictures on the horizon are very poor as well.  It is nice that you can walk out of the bridge and around the ship, but why would you want to as there is nothing as yet to do, though this could be changed in the future as could interactive radio comms with the port authorities and other ships or interactive fully detailed bridge controls.  More ports are also promised.However, I fear that all such improvements will come to nought if the devs do not do something drastic to change the quality of the graphics.  Ship sims, like non-combat flight sims should be all about beauty and something to behold.  If the graphics are not improved at least to the standard of say, ESS or Silent Hunter 5, then this game is going to be a flop.Personally, I would dearly love to see this game developed to the standard of FSX with a full world to roam about (or time skip if the distances are too far on a particular voyage).  fully interactive bridges, interactive comms with ports and other ships.  Radio traffic from other ships and, like FSX, a system in place where other publishers can produce high quality detailed accurate real world ships and ports as addons whilst paying a percentage towards this game's publishers/devs.However, such developments may eventually be achieved, but are pointless unless the graphics, colours, textures and animations are not significantly improved.  I will soldier on with this game and will be happy to revise this review in the future if things improve."
