The game is basically Heroes of Might and Magic except a bit more tactical on the combat side.  When this game popped up on Steam, I knew I had to buy this game out of pure nostalgia.  While I still have the original disc, I wanted this version to play on Steam.  To this day, I still rate this game pretty high.  If you don't mind the game being wide screen and the graphics to be a bit grainy, get this game especially if you like strategy games."

I have way over 500+ hours spent on this outside Steam. Though MoM has more depth with the spells and different dimensions what LoM brings you is a world that feels more alive with a main powerfull antagonist for that ultimate last battle, monster denizens that at higher levels are unique hard challanges with great rewards, you will come to cherish all your heroes because there is no ressurection and they really make the difference in battle, the espionage system is very fun with taking of hostages, stealth, diplomacy has lots of options but can be exploited, interesting city management based on Fame and Followers, magic research that requires hard work in order to get powerfull enough sorcerors to research at optimal rates, terraforming that can change world into your domain and give you a tremendous edge and Real Time Tactical Combat that is way more intense than the normal 4x Fantasy turn based system. To make replayability interesting after defeating the main antagonist you can play as him and really set terror into the world of Urak.Additonally the soundtrack, voice acting and scenarios are also wonderfull. This game is an integral part of my childhood like many other great games but this is a game I still revisit once every two or three years and lose myself in the world of Urak.If you have the friends I also highly recommend playing it multiplayer, it is a very cozy and competitive.Urak is Mine!"

76561198033052111,Recommended,404040,29542977,Posted: 28 January,all,Mangs,"I am writing this review to showcase my Let’s Play of this game, which I recently released on my YouTube channel named; Mangs.Lords of Magic was the first game I ever played as a child. Gifted to me on Christmas eve when I had just turned 9 years old, it was a game that stirred my interest for turn-based strategy.  I did not even understand the language, but I loved the graphics, sounds and especially the music. I played this game so much I ended up having to re-buy it twice due to breaking two of my CD’s.Looking back at it 20 years later, I am amazed how far this game was ahead of its time compared to other games. While it may be clunky, slow and outdated by today’s standards, it poses a real challenge to even the most hardened veteran, and it’s systems are still complex and tricky to figure out. The game’s diplomacy system, while not terribly advanced, still allows you to be somewhat tactical by befriending other nations via the use of gifts and trades. The magic is very tricky, requiring you to research your spells before using them, but once you get going, magic becomes a terribly force on the battlefield, allowing you to wipe out entire armies with your wizard alone. This would be a problem if the game was named anything else than “Lords of Magic”, but with magic being such a central theme of the game, I am okay with it being as devastating as it is.For all the love I have for this game, it can be terribly frustrating at times though. Even your toughest  units die so incredibly fast in battle. Saving them feels like a hopeless and sometimes monotonous task, and in order to succeed you HAVE to babysit your units like crazy until they start leveling up. Even at max level however, they usually do not last very long on the battlefield, but at least they have a fighting chance.I also heavily dislike the auto-calculate feature that allows you to resolve battles with the click of a button, as it goes way too easy on the player, often tempting you to auto-calculate simply because the result is more desirable. I suggest not using this feature at all if you want to have a good experience with this game, unless it is to quickly get rid of a small, meaningless army that would otherwise not pose a threat to you.20 years later, this game continues to captivate and amaze me. The music, graphics and sounds are timeless to me, and completely one-of-a-kind. If you enjoyed games like Heroes of Might and Magic as a kid, you will absolutely love Lords of Magic. I seriously recommend it!Mangs"

Once you have chosen you will appear on the main game map where you can see various buildings and places to interact with, where you will find monsters to defeat, giving you the ability to summon creatures to aid you, hire more troops that can gain experience with you, wizard towars research new spells, towns where you can direct the locals to work in certain industries to increase your income of the various resources in the game (fame, gems, ale, etc), so you can support larger and better armies, and also other heroes to aid you in your quest.You can also find a number of artifacts which give many different bonuses to your heroes (or not as some you will find will only be useful for classes/elements you can't currently recruit). You can conquer the town/temple of other elements which will allow you to hire more heroes of that element to aid you in your quest.The one area I always found weakest in the game is the combat - it is played in pausable real time (one of the main ways it differs from early Heroes of Might and Magic titles), and while okay it largely reduces to just everyone attacking each other in a big blob (apart from the missile/spell casters). It never felt very strategic or interesting, and I always tend to autocalc whenever I can get away with it, as you end up having a lot of fights during a campaign.Overall this is a fun title, if very old and creaky, but it does guide you along a bit at the start of the game, although there isn't a huge amount of hand holding here unlike most modern titles. The user interface is okay if a bit cryptic, but it flows fairly well if you are willing to work with it, so overall I would recommend even to people new to it if the overall theme interests them, and the feel and flow of the game are different enough to HoMaM that fans of that series will probably like it, as it is different enough to not feel like an older and harder to use entry in that series, while still being in the same ballpark in terms of overall gameplay."

I was 12 then and I still think the gfx are pretty good. That was the main reason why I shelled out $40 at the time, not knowing that it would end up being one of my favorite games of all times for other reasons too. Namely the excellent soundtrack, 3D world map that makes for interesting exploration (even though originally there was only 1 map in the game), immersive diplomacy, good thief abilities for spying on or stealing from the enemy (also it's fun decimating weaker enemies with just 1 thief as they can ""hide in the shadows"") and a ton of spells that I never even got around to trying most of. Many artifacts to find for the champions, although it's often annoying to not be able to use them as they are often faith dependent. The combat system is clunky and somewhat tedious but basically strategic with missile units and mages usually doing most of the damage. It is often simple to trick the computer by having it chase one of your melee units around while you fire on them with missiles, and the enemy doesn't evade well if at all. I suppose you could have an army of mostly melee units, but you'd better find the best ones in the game because most of them are pretty weak. The redeeming aspect of battles is the rpg-like element of experience points that levels most units (not all) up to 5, and champions much higher.I always preferred playing as the Life faith, and it may be the easiest one to start with as they have the best missile units (archers) in the game. A tip would be to free your great temple as soon as possible (before the first 7th day) in order to start gaining followers for gathering resources and creating new units. New followers arrive to your empire every 7 days, depending on how much ""Fame"" you have gained.I really hope they fix the ""Pegasus bug"" as I have already run across 3 of these level 8 creatures and it takes an entire army with my best champions to take one down, usually losing a couple units in the process. Not neccesarily a bad thing as it adds challenge, but I really don't think a level 2 hamlet is supposed to spawn this creature.I really really hope they make a Lords of Magic II, or at least an HD update for this game!"

76561198141787035,Recommended,404040,33355185,Posted: 7 July,all,saveclementine,"This game deserves to be so much better known than it is! My dad bought it on release with our first computer back in the late 90s and it is still his absolute favorite game now in 2017. I used to spend hours watching him play it, and even now it's still a ton of fun.I think what really makes it is the level of detail. The developers clearly spent a lot of time working on the lore. Each of its faiths has a great, distinctive feel. Every unit has their own separate portrait and voice prompt (these get repetitive but really add depth). The combat is really clunky and can be very challenging and seemingly random (I tend to just autocalc everything if I'm being honest), but there's just something so satisfying about building up your awesome army and conquering your neighbors.Although it can be kinda easy to get stuck in a gameplay rut, there's a decent amount of variation to be found through the various faiths and lords, the map editor (completely change up the map or even build your own... it adds way more variety than you'd expect), and the story mode expansion. That being said, I really wish this game had gained the popularity needed to get a sequel (or two or three). It would be awesome to see a more modern take on this. One thing I'd really like to see added is more expansion to the economy. A more robust trading system and financial management would really help the endgame (at which point your only options are really to kill off all of your allies, wander around fighting random dungeons, or just quit your hard-earned game. Boo!).If you like strategy, fantasy, or especially both, this is definitely worth a try."

It is a mix of strategy and RPG - you create armies that explore the world map, collecting resources, traversing dungeons and fighting neutral monsters/enemy factions to level up.The game takes place in the high fantasy realm of Urak. Balkoth, the loyal discple of Golgoth, the god of Death, has gone on a rampage throughoutt the world, ravaging the kingdoms of the other seven faiths - Life, Order, Chaos, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. You pick one of the seven mentioned faiths and choose what role your Lord will be - Warrior, Thief or Mage.When you enter the world, you will discover that you only have your Lord and a small army accompanying him/her. Every faith starts off in a weakened state, except for death and the faith ""opposite"" to yours (for example, Order's opposite is Chaos). Your first objective is to explore the area around your faith's capital, fighting neutral enemies and gaining strength. Once you are strong enough, you will need to take your faith's ""Great Temple"", which has been overrun with monsters. After you do that, your capital will swear fealty to you, and you will begin your quest to kill Balkoth.Each faith has its own unique units, and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Life has some of the best ranged units in the game, with strong magical flying units. However, they have weaker melee units. Fire has units with very high attack, but low defense, and many of their units have low movement points.The game does have some flaws, however. Combat has a tendency to be a bit clunky at times. The learning curve for the game, in my opinion, is very high. Finally, computer players will act oddly. For starters, they will often split their armies into tiny, easily defeatable groups. Secondly, there's diplomacy - the AI doesn't understand what a fair bargain is. Playing as Air, I once had Order ask me to give them my Air Drake (the legendary creature for Air) in exchange for a hound (an Order scouting unit). When I declined, my relations with them DROPPED because they were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with me.All in all, I find this to be a very enjoyable game, albeit with a few flaws. It is a solid 8/10."

You're done looking for the dragon you've been chasing since 2001. This game is it. It's the ultimate piece of art that belongs next to Dwarf Fortress and Pablo Picasso's wooden sculptures in the Modern Art Museum. Here we have a RPG strategy with RTS elements staring us in the face, and it has been staring us in the face since 1996. The DOOM players overlooked it and the Diablo players were so blinded by Blizzard's genius that Lords of Magic was thrown to the wayside, never looked upon again until now.Here we have one of the greatest video games in the past hundred years.

76561197962078610,Recommended,404040,31789995,Posted: 16 May,all,Skynet,"Good game, but has a few flaws.My main annoyance is the game is very oriented towards save-reload gaming. Why:- Death of your character = lose game.- Enemy units pop out of fog of war and kill you the same turn. Much farther sight range would have been useful.- Game loves spawning ""marauders"" (neutral units) that kill you randomly for above reason.- Loss of any regular unit is very devastating early and mid game, so you end up replaying battles a lot until there are no losses (generous auto-calc also encourages this).- Early game quest to free Great Temple doesn't permit any mistakes for harder factions.- Stats are rarely explained by the user interface (e.g. spell effects) and so a trial and error approach is necessary.There are all these cool things to research and build but you're not going to be able to afford them unless you expand wide and subjugate AI factions; i.e. there's limited opportunity to expand on neutrals without conquest. This is basically fine, but game would have retained more flavor if keeping other factions alive longer.Tactical combat is generally hard to control, you need to be paused so much to issue orders that it's pretty similar to turn based combat regardless. If you want a modern game that is pretty similar and IMO has better tactical combat, have a look at Age of Wonders 3.Factions are very asymmetrically balanced in the unmodded game, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also, the AI probably cheats a lot but it doesn't really matter that much due to the focus being on less on pure strategy and more on the overall role playing experience. Only persistent annoyance with AI is its diplomacy which again is inadequately explained in the user interface leading to frustrating experiences.Most of my play time with this game comes from a decade ago (before Steam release). If you can live with the low resolution graphics, I recommend it if you're a fan of Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic, and similar game series."
,Recommended,404040,27555751,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,evan.dagg,"Straight to it, Lords of Magic is one of the best. I cannot do it justice, it's really a diamond.I've played it since the demo came out 19 years ago, and I played it yesterday.Overall: 9/10Game Length: HoursComplexity: ModerateReplay: InfiniteThe music has that rare perfection, it is atmospheric, beautiful, and yet blends into the background and doesn't annoy on repeat (unlike say, Civilization I and II). The gameplay itself is fun, sensible, and keeps getting deeper the more one plays. While the rules are simple, they mingle to form complex situations. The AI is unexpected, good even by today's standards. There's tons of customization without it being overwhelming or senseless. It's endlessly replayable, every New Game plays out differently. Of course, you can always play as the main villain instead for a completely different experience, or one of the expansion Quests. There's even a complete map creator if you want more. You literally cannot run out of game to play.Everything matters, from terrain, to spells, to flanking, to army movement, and so on, there is no aspect of the game that is 'useless' or ignorable. Now it is also likewise quite unforgiving, rarely is there a chance to take back a bad decision, it's not that any mistake will spell your doom, it's that one could. Getting yourself stuck in the zipper of imperial overreach is very much a possibility. This is a challenging game, and it does not have much tolerance for tactless blind charges, dumb is dead. It is however true, just as in real war, that sometimes a misstep could not be foreseen, or luck sides against you, and in a close battle that can be the difference that causes utter defeat. The game is only <mostly> fair, not completely fair. Even a solid victory can be Pyrrhic.I've seen it said that the game is well balanced, or not at all. I disagree, I think it has that always-sought after and rare perfect imbalance. Yes, some Faiths are easier or harder for beginners, because their strengths are intuitive or obvious to implement. But each one can win consistently, they just use unconventional tactics, and come into their pinnacle at different stages. Like, Life infantry may be weak, but that's because they're not meant to fight, they're meant to Parry in full defense, holding the line while your archers eat up the enemy. The Air infantry make terrible infantry, because you should use them like cavalry instead. The best Fire spell harms all units on the battlefield, but Fire Mages and Elementals are resistant, making them the ideal sacrificial mercenary strike team to soften a powerful enemy army at low cost. Chaos Stickthrowers are generally mistaken to be the worst ranged units, but their attack speed is the quickest, so they lock down powerful enemy melee units if targeting it together as a group. There's always a useful method to be found. Not every Faith fights best in a traditional style, and often their true strengths are meta - such as economics, mobility, recovery, or synergy. However, the balance between preparation and tactics, skill and luck, quality vs quantity, those factors are superbly arranged.Lords of Magic did have troubled development, it was a buggy mess that was beloved despite that, and the game wasn't completely fixed until support was discontinued. Steam offers the 3.01 version, however it retains one significant Unit ID bug that replaces Brownies (tiny weak scouts) in some low level battles with Pegasus Riders (absurdly strong late game tank). To that end I completely recommend the unofficial 3.02 patch, dedicated fans took development to the finish line, removing the last bugs and improving the menu and game interface. As always, use at your own discretion.That said, the game shines, not for it's functional but dated graphics, but the fluff. Each and every of the 160+ spells has it's own story text, revealing the culture, legends, and life of the people of each Faith. Every dungeon has a serviceable description, that unveils a deeper moral ambiguity than you'd expect. Sure, some Paladin Lord of Order is expected to liberate a sacred statue from miscreants, but what of robbing and pillaging the estate of a wealthy ex-thief? It makes no difference mechanically, but it highlights that victory is at all costs. It clearly takes influence from the Lord of the Rings, but it absolutely makes up itself. Even the building quotes hint at a rich and full culture and history for each Faith. When it's cheesy it's homage to Conan the Barbarian, Tolkien, Beowulf, King Arthur, and other classics. Even the hefty manual is more narrative than tutorial. In short, more than anything, it's voluntarily immersive. It lets you care. It brings you in and makes it believable that there's a whole world.The story, the music, the atmosphere, the strategy, all are crafted together masterfully to create a cohesive and fulfilling fantasy 5x - explore, expand, exploit, exterminate, and experience."

Most each faith also has its own race but multiple faiths have humans, elves and giants to name a few. The main game consist of a sprawling map of land divided into 8 kingdoms with numerous neutral castles, fortresses, villages and simple caves to conquer for XP and resources. In addition each faith has a whole library of spells unique to them.

It was originally created in 1997, and it shows. The voice acting and soundtrack is pretty nice though.That being said, it's actually a really fun game. It's a turn-based strategy game with real-time combat that actually requires you to strategize on a global scale rather than over a small map like most strategy games. It also gives you a variety of ways to achieve your objectives. Do you want to develop allies? or go it alone?

I remember trying my hardest to win and when I won for the first time I remember jumping up in my chair shouting, ""I won!"" Fun fact, I did that in a rolling chair, and I advise none of you to do that....lesson learned, but doesn't matter. I won!Anyways, now that it is on steam I had to pick it up and play it again...oh where did the hours go?This is a game that I highly reccomend. Do not let the dated graphics fool you, this is a great game for those that understand the differences this game brings.That said allow me to explain what makes this game different from other strategy games.First off, you pick a leader type - warrior, mage, or thief(ranged/stealth unit) and then your goal is to first liberate your faith's great temple. Once you do that your people build a stronghold in your capital and followers join your cause. You use these followers to work for you to produce resources in capital city, upgrade buildings or build new ones (at a conquered village) or join your army. You then adventure accross the map encountering other places to explore for treasure and loot and eventually find other faiths that you can either fight or parley with, but your ultimate goal is to kill the lord of death. This is not easy as he no pushover.However, you can unite the other faiths in the land to serve you against the lord of death. If you liberate the great temple of another faith they will join you. Another feature I have to mention is that your champions, (the warrior, mage, and thief) can use their xp to train new troops. This means if you have, for example, a high level warrior you can leave them in a barracks and every turn it will share its knowledge with new recruits, and if the champion has enough experience to fully train new troops you can then train brand new soldiers to start at max level. Not only does this mean in late game you do not have to worry about leveling up all your troops, but if your warrior shared enough knowledge at the barracks to train up future warriors to start at lvl 7, it makes loosing that warrior in battle less of a loss because you do not have to get another one fresh at level 1. It is a great system.All in all, the game runs very well still on my windows 8 os. There is major framerate loss and slowing down when the map is zoomed all the way out.Sound and music still sounds beautiful and the gameplay is still great.For the current price you are getting a lot of content. There are eight playable faiths, that each play very differently with different units and spells, and advantages. This is a game where I would not say there are weak factions/faiths. They are all really powerful in their own right. For example it is said if you enrage the worshippers of water you better travel by land or air... The water faiths has the best ships and can summon serpants and krakens, but lack extremly powerful land units. The fire faith on the other hand has some really powerful and destructive magic spells, but....well lets just say their naval ships suck...like a lot. That is what I got to love about the game, every faith you can play as has an amazing pick of advantages, but all come with a huge negative you have to overcome and work around.There are only a few large maps to play on, but don't worry, it is kind of like a football game or a game of league of legands. You can keep playing on the same map and it is still be fun. Honestly, having played the game so much as a kid and a lot lately I am still, just now, letting myself finially try another map that came with the game. These maps are large. If you do desire more maps don't worry. A map editor is also included and you get to play the legends of Urak which allows you to pick a faith and go on a legendary adventure. These change the rules of the game and make it more like an rpg adventure as opposed to grand strategy. These are story-rich with a fair bit of voice acting and videos.Again, a wealth of content and replayablity for the price.Furthermore the higher difficulty settings still feel fair. I have played my last several games at the hardest difficulty setting and I feel and enjoy that wonderful sense of challange while having never felt like the enemy is cheating. This isn't a game that just simply has the enemy cheating, but rather makes them play smarter. As a vetern of this game every smart move the enemy made, or the amount of resources and units they had seemed, to me, easy to understand how they achieved that. It is wonderful when a game makes the higher difficulties fun without having the AI cheat. Again, every massive army of the enemy or amount of area they control has never felt unreasonable to me, as a veteran, and I could tell myself how they were able to achieve that. It is hard, but a fair hard if that makes any sense.In closing, this was and still is, one of my favorite strategy games and I am so pleased to see it brought to steam where it will once again work on my pc. I love it and couldn't reccomend it more. If you are okay with the differences this game has that I described, give it a go. It holds up really well for a game released many years ago."

,Recommended,404040,29281075,Posted: 15 January,all,Atratzu,"-Quick Review-Lords of Magic: Special Edition is a Turn Based strategy game with RPG elements (and an RPG type game mode),  developed by Impressions Games and released Nov 19, 1997http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839651617-Detailed breakdown review-Story:The story of Lords of magic takes place in the land of Urak the whole land has been laid to ash by the sorcerer Balkoth. The rest of the explanation is left up to interpretation... You choose your class, and faction/faith and set out to save your people... or die again and again because there's so much in this game you didn't know about before, but each time you come back a little more prepared and understanding a bit more then before.(Did we get a bit too real? Let me explain...)Truth be told, I don't know that I'm really qualified to speak about Lords of Magic because I didn't play it as a kid. and even now, I'll need to spend many more hours before I'm familiar enough that I might actually stand a chance while playing.However, I did play the heck out of Lords of the Realm 2. So how different could a game made by the same developers be? ...turns out the difference could be astronomical. To me the only similarity is the music (A+ music btw, absolutely love it) and the battles.Gameplay:Lets just start with the basic set up for a Lords of Magic Game(not a Legends of Urak, because that's basically a story of King Arthur)You first chose between three classes: Warrior, Mage, and Thief. Each class has it's own strengths weaknesses and class abilities.Then you choose your faction or ""faith"". There are eight faiths; Life Death, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Order, and Chaos.(you can't choose death until you beat the game by the way.)Again, each faith is specialized in a certain ways and with certain types of units.Then you jump into the game and let the complexity begin!It's not actually THAT bad when you're first learning how to play. As long as you just accept that things are going to end badly for you. You don't even need to battle, you can just let the computer Auto Calculate the battle for you.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839650657You have several different resources which are used for upgrading, hiring mercenaries, recruiting new troops, and paying your troops wages. There's Fame (You can beg for gold, in exchange for fame, or horde fame and get more people who join your cause!), Followers (followers can be put to work, or used to recruit troops), Gold, Gem's (Gem's are a bit tricky, they're used for magic, be it healing your troops in the capital city, or summoning creatures and magic users, and lastly pints of ale (Just another currently, and if I learned anything in Lords of the Realm 2, it's one of the most important! who doesn't love a good 'ol drunk  jk).Everything is turn based, so you can move a certain distance with your army, and then end turn to receive new resources. The battles are real time though. (So very similar to Lords of the Realm mechanically speaking)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839652355Conclusion:I don't know if I can articulate this very well, but at times I felt more like an ""Adventuring party"" which is going out exploring and hero journeying.. rather then a king protecting a country. Someone who has played longer and more might be able to articulate it better, but hopefully this review helps. Lords of Magic is a solid game, and highly recommended if you're interested in strategy games."

It's been years now and you're just as I remember you; ugly, brutal, and awesome.Pros:+ Excellent blend of real time strategy, tactics rpg, and good old 4X empire building. If you like Civilization, Total War, or X-COM, this should float your boat.+ The soundtrack is as classy and ambient as anything. You won't exactly be humming the tunes, but it's immersive and enchanting all the same and never makes you want to turn it off.+ Each faction feels unique in some way with different strengths and weaknesses, but you're never really locked in to the faction you choose in the begining. Taking over villages and great temples gets you access to buldings, units, and abilities from other factions and you can mix and match them to suit your own strategy.Cons:- The game is locked into a really low resolution and would benefit from an HD release like Age of Empires 2 did.- There's not so much a learning curve as there is a learning cliff that you must hurl yourself off of and build your wings before you hit the ground. You will lose your first few games and to people who only started playing games after 2001 or so, that may be a tad frustrating. This is a very old school game with a less than helpful tutorial system in the form of in-game pop-ups so the only way to learn how to play is by actually playing.Overall, Lords of Magic is worth your time if you don't mind the low resolution and have a lot of patience. This game is not pretty and it is not easy, but it is fun and that's what should count."

LOMSE got the formula right so many years ago, and so many strategy RPGs that have followed have failed to live up to my expectations due to the standard this game set. Despite the outdated graphics, this game is still very fun and has a great deal of depth. Play as Life, Order, Chaos, Water, Fire, Earth or Air as you attempt to defeat the evil Balkoth and ensure the continuation of your people. You are a lord of magic, leading your faith in this challenging game. Once you win one game, you can play as Balkoth and destroy the world if you want.The game is filled with all manner of creative artifacts (weapons, armor, rings, amulets, scrolls, and potions) for your Lord and Champions to utilize. There are all manner of dungeons to explore. Battles take place on a tactical map, whereby you can utilize your horsemen, archers, mages, and ground units strategically to help win the battle. Battles are real time, but the primary map is turn based. Production of units is instantaneous if you have the resources, but resource production is turn based. The resources in this game are gold, ale, magic crystals, and fame. Gold is primarily used for ranged units, ale for melee units, and crystals for magic units, of which there are all manner of magic creatures to call to your aid depending on your faith.Beyond the base game, there are also several scenario games you can play. For example, play as the wizard Merlin looking for hte next king of camelot.If you are a fan of either RPGs or strategy games, I can say with confidence that you will love this game. That is, supposing you are not one of those that has to see sweet graphics in order to be interested. I can tell you that the graphics actually were pretty sweet at the time this game came out. I've kept coming back to this game since I first got it in the late 90s, but now I finaly have a version that works better with new operating systems. Maybe if we get lucky, they will come out with a sequel someday.Impressions Games no longer exists, and Sierra, who first published this game, later was bought and became a subsidary of Vivendi, from which rebellion bought the rights to Lords of Magic prior to the Vivendi buyout by activision. So the chances are slim, but who knows, maybe rebellion will take some time away from sniper elite, or the newly made Sierra (re-established in 2014 by Activision) buys back the rights and makes one? Long time fans can only hope. And as for my hope, it is only that you enjoy this awesome game."

,Recommended,404040,28263338,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Andronikos,"This review is coming through a heavily nostalgic tint, but Lords of Magic is probably THE defining game of its genre. . . whatever genre that is.  A bit like Masters of Magic, this is a dudes-on-a-map strategy game, where you balance realtime combat with resource management. You play one of seven faiths fighting against the forces of Death.  You recruit heroes (Warriors, Mages, and Thieves) which lead armies of fighters, archers, and magical creatures.  I had this game on CD-ROM so my steam hours don't reflect it, but you will get tons of hours out of this game.  One of the best parts:  once you master one particular faith (Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Life, Death, Order, or Chaos), playing another one is a whole different experience.  Once you beat the game once, it unlocks Death as a playable faith, which is a great challenge in itself. The Special Edition shipped with pre-rendered quest games (one hidden), which are a delight to play.  You also get more maps to play once you master the main one, and a map editor that allows you to create your own.It's not without its flaws though.  The graphics did not age well, though the characters do have their charm.  The combat is wonky, and you have to really learn the system. . . at the beginning it will be overwhelming.  The AI isn't that bright, and I am not sure if the steam version ships with a very game breaking difficulty bug. . . but it hasn't showed up for me yet.  There are some ways you can really game the system too. If you're having alot of trouble pick Order, Water, or Life, and tinker with the hero editor.  If all else fails, play a Water mage with the Staff of Drowning, which is essentially a hidden 'very easy' mode.If you like strategy games or fantasy games, give this piece of gaming history a try."

Hot damn does it feel good.Alright, so way back when I was a wee tadpole, my mom got me a Sierra Strategy Triple Pack for Christmas. Cyberstorm, Caesar II, and Rise of Rule of Empires was on it. It also had a demo for LoM and I wound up playing that far more than the other games. Problem was, I was 11 and couldn't just go out and buy my own games. My mom wasn't any help either. And thus, for all these years past, I was never able to sit down and give LoM a real try. So thank you Steam for giving me this.LoM is a strategy game where the goal is to defeat Balkoth, the evil Lord of Death who is attempting at sinking the land of Urak into the dark clutches of a death god. To do this you must build your army, liberate your Great Temple from enemy clutches, and forge various alliances with the other elemental factions in the game (Air, Water, Order, Chaos, Fire, Light, Earth, and Death.) Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses so there's a ton of replayability depending on which you choose. Do you begin with a sturdy Warrior based Earth faction, strong in melee offense or do you start with a Thief based Light faction, excelling in ranged archery?LoM seems a little overwhelming at first but it's actually quite simple as there are only so many variables to pay attention to. Your resources are limited to Crystals, Ale, Gold, and Fame, with each Faction having their own dependencies on one more than the other. These resources are used to fuel upkeep costs of units and for creating them. Liberating various locations such as gold mines, crystal mines, and breweries provide these resources each round. It's that simple. Once you learn the pacing for each faction, playing through the game is largely up to you. LoM can be incredibly short or incredibly long, depending on how effective you are and how much RNG loves you during your attempts. This is a game that is meant to be played many, many times so never feel like you're enbroiling yourself into a 100 hour campaign every time you start.The downsides to the game lie mostly with the RNG: some attempts the AI takes a more even pace; others its on the juice, plowing straight through you. Nothing felt better than having Balkoth roll up into my capital within the first 30 turns. I died very quickly. Sometimes enemy units move in a logical fashion; another time, Balkoth sat over the ocean, mere pixels out of my range, for nearly 20 rounds just to spite me, unmoving. If the AI is feeling cruel, you can get steamrolled very quickly in this game. Just gotta hit New Game and start again...I cannot express how happy I am that this game has held up after all of these years. A chapter of my life has finally been completed. If you're a fan of classic strategy, you'll find an immense amount of fun with LoM."

I get that in its Hayday it may have been a gem. but today my 22 year old brain simply cannot wrap itself around this game. i think i read somewhere that Life was the easiest to start with, and i even chose easy mode ( and sweet god if this is considered noob P***y level i dont want to see hard mode) but even still i find myself getting ruined.the game tutorials state that the further you travel from your capital the harder the enemies, but Sh*t son i fought a level 5 hamlet that was basically my neighbor and was greeted with a Defeat screen 10 turns in ( was really 40 lol)You can station followers (obtained at a fixed period and their number depends on your fame. And you need your great temple first, found that out the hard way.) to different buildings in your base to generate resources. But you can only have a max of 8. meaning you can only generate 8 gold, or ale, or crystal or fame, or all 4 if you have 32 followers, per turn. upgrading your Base requires a seemingly large amount of resources as well. resources that if you choose to sit in your base and cower in fear of all the big mean baddies that want your booty like it did, will take forever to accumulate.Again i dont understand the game. As i autocalc'd a level 2 hamlet, and recieved 38 gold and a fair sum of other resources, but did the same to a level 4 hamlet and was rewarded with practically pennies. i actually left my base, decided on a gamble and spent alot of money on cost effective swarms of units. only to find them all kick the bucket in one fight, and i recieved less than the cost of one for a reward.The lack of unit and item descriptions outside pictures with numbers is fairly standard for the time. sometimes it worked, sometimes you had people playing pictionary to figure out what stats they were looking at. this game, is the latter.The artifacts too, have nothing but names ( or perhaps not. but i couldnt find the button to know) and they all have different costs at the setup before you play. I believe i heard someone say specific artifacts work better with specific factions but i dont know how you can possibly tell. hell, i dont even know what they do!I'm not saying its a bad game. Alot of people like it, i may be a total idiot who doesnt understand. but i do see alot of poeple who like it, enjoyed it during its prime. and i just wasnt one of them. Unless you're familiar with the game, i honestly cant recommend it without feeling like a jackass. Its Gameplay and mechanics have just aged like milk."

It is truly not very good.Problems with this game pop up at the very beginning, when you are selecting a type of Lord to rule your people.  This Lord takes the form of a powerful hero, but sadly not all are created equal.  As a matter of fact some are completely unviable, such as Fire and Air Warrior Lords.  These two in particular have such long parrying animations that if they become engaged with three or more enemies (which will happen often) they will spend all their time stuck in the parrying animation and be unable to strike back.  This results in their eventual death, regardless of how feeble the enemy is.Combat itself is awkward, and usually quite boring.  The most exciting combat comes when you take a lone thief lord and spend the fight stealthing around to gradually kill off all your opponents.  Otherwise you can expect a slug-fest that will eventually resolve itself with little input needed from the player aside from perhaps sending your melee fighters to a choke point.  Note that managing units is generally unnecessary, as many Lords are sufficient to carry the game solo until the final battle.There are cities which you can manage to a very shallow degree.  There are other ""Lords"", though they provide little challenge.  Most of the game revolves around delving into enemy infested lairs to gain valuable experience for the final confrontation with the Death Lord.  It is only at this point you will actually need an army, since the Death Lord uses an instant kill attack which has several charges.  You must keep your Lord away (death of your Lord is an instant game over unless you have recruited other Lords by freeing their temples before they were able to) and send an army in his stead... rather dissappointing for the climax.  I'd prefer being able to have my Lord lead my army for the final battle.There are a few special scenarios you can play based on old legends, such as King Arthur or Beowulf.  These tend to be irritating rather than enjoyable, and ask you to jump through silly hoops to complete them.Avoid this one.  It is nothing short of infuriating by today's standards."

,Recommended,404040,20023774,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,The Watching Shadow,"I only have a half hour of game play at time of this review, but have plenty logged on this title before it was brought on Steam.  Lords of Magic is a turn based strategy game that has an interesting mix of real time strategy for the battle environment.  There are 8 Faiths (ie races) in the game, and you pick to play as lord of one of them.  At the start, your main objective is to stop the Lord of Death as he seeks to subjugate (or just destroy) all else that will not obey him.  You can choose to be that of the Elves of Life with essentially the best archer units, or perhaps those of Order who are essentially the heroes of Arthurian legends, or any other Faith.I've liked this game a lot because of how you can work with the other Faiths.  Say you're leading Life and liberate the Great Temple of Water (each Faith has one), they'll agree to join you (provided you're still on good relations) and their Lord will be come your heir.  So you essentially have two ""lives"" to work with while building up both regions.  You can still trade for resources, units, or research in other games but I always found that kind of alliance interesting about this game.The RTS battles are more fun for me than the mass army battles.  In this game your army has a max of 12 ""units"" in 3 squads.  Each squad is composed of a hero/champion/unique unit and 3 generic units (footman, archer, calvary, scout, or summoned creature) and you can mix and match these as you like.  In battle, instead of having a host of units to macromanage you only have that small squad to micromanage long set paths in the various maps (some are open areas while others have corridors to bottleneck).  I've found that to be far more engaging.The research aspect is only about the spells you have at your disposal.  If you don't use mages at all, then you actually don't even need to worry about the research (which is composed entirely of having a few mages in a building and waiting the number of turns needed based on the levels of the mages).The other interesting part of this title (that they fortunately included) is the Legends of Urak quest pack.  Ever wanted to play out the story of King Arthur?  They have one for that.  What about Beowulf?  They have one for that too.  There are a couple other legends you play out the story off and it's adapted to the units and systems they have ingame which puts an interesting twist to it.I'll definitely be putting more time into this now othat I have it again.  Who knows...maybe I'll crush everything as Balkoth as I unlocked him with a bit of a speedrun I developed (check my guide if you're interested).  Or perhaps I'll slowplay it again as Life like I did when I first played the game.  Then again, playing out as King Arthur would be fun again too.  I remember that took me awhile, but perhaps I can do it quicker this time too.I realize this is a long review/diatribe but if you're a fan of simplistic land management blended with squad based real time strategy combat then I think this would be a title for you!EDIT: The only bad thing I guess is that they didn't add an ability to play windowed, or work in the Steam overlay.  It plays just like it did when I first enjoyed it though...so there is that. ;)"
76561198065414556,Recommended,404040,21095945,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Finedaible,"A great oldschool turn-based fantasy RPG that draws inspiration from Tolkien, Beowulf, Dungeons & Dragons, and Arthurian legends; A definite recommend if you like any of those things. Know that the graphics are very dated (it was made for Windows 95/98) but it works flawlessly on my Win 7 x64 machine after turning down the game's scroll speed. If you get it, I highly recommend downloading this patch here for a broken quest fix and a more comprehensive UI:Website linkSmall glimpse of the gameplay:The gameplay actually has a ton of depth to it, with each of the 8 Faiths (the game's factions) having their own unique advantages and playstyle. The game does a very good job of explaining things as you go too. Strategy and management of resources and followers is key, but is simple and straightforward. One aspect I loved about this is that the amount of followers you gain is influenced by how much  positive Fame your actions have brought, and how many monuments you liberated from faithless Marauders. You can try to barter with other Faiths. The Thief champions can stealth, try to steal from other parties, spy on other Faiths, or even kidnap and interrogate other champions, Mages can research spells, and experienced champions can even “instruct” newly produced units so that they start out at a higher level… There's just sooo many things I could list but this review is already getting too long. :)"

My brother and I played this game so much as kids, and I saw very little wrong at the time. Now things are a tad different.For the good things, it's still Lords of Freakin' Magic. The soundtrack is worth purchasing this game by itself. The world is so well fleshed out for such a small game. The graphics are unmistakably late 90's Sierra, and the gameplay requires just the right level of thought and strategy.But, I see now that this game could be so much better. If Age of Empires II can get a huge graphics upgrade yet maintain its style, so can LOM. Honestly I would love a remake using the same gameplay mechanics, but with more diversity in what each unit can do and improve what thieves are capable of. And more LEGENDS OF URAK.Is this game for you? Did you like the 90's? Did you like Sierra Games? Did you like that the sound of a Death thief dying is also in Caesar III?"

The graphics are well done and the combat system is easily learnable. I have been having some trouble with the latest incrnation as the game insists on putting level 8 foes in level 1 and up dongeons even with the game set for easy (easy for the computer maybe?). But even with this trouble I say it's as enjoyable a waste of time as any game.
,Recommended,404040,20618398,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,twitch.tv/TheBrownieMaker,"TL:DRPros: Extremely fun, a bit complex at first but easy to undersand with basic RPG/RTS knowledge.Cons: The game crashes every now and then, reccomend saving every few turns.Conclusion: Totally worth it.------Extended Review:Starting off this game gives you two options: The standard gameplay and the campaign.In the standard mode, you are given the choice of playing as a warrior, thief or mage as a main hero.Then you are given 8 factions to choose from: Death, Air, Order, Fire, Light, Earth, Chaos and Water.Initially, you can only choose 7 untill you kill balkoth who is the leader of death.Once you pick a faction, you get to choose the difficulty, name your hero and customize further if you want.Each faction has a total of 6 buildings.1. The Capitol, where you trade resources and put your followers to work.2. Wizard building- you get to train mage heros and typically magic units.3.Wizard tower- Here you can place mages to research spells.4. Thief building- Here you can train thief heroes and ranged units.5, Warrior building- Here you can train warrior heroes and similar units.6. Faction type building *IMPORTANT*- Capturing this will give you control of your capitol, increase your benefit in trading and let you assign followers. After capturing this, you will receive followers every 7 turns.  This building also lets you build another building next to it with various effects across factions.  This also lets you build one legendary unit.Here are your resources1. Fame2. Ale3. Followers -Important if you want to train a unit instead of hiring a mercenary/ used to produce resources at capitol4. Crystals - Important for healing units, in the capitol, click on the temple to do so.5. GoldThere are a bunch of random places you can travel to on the map.  This can be anywhere from a hut, to a brewery, to a crystal place, to a mine and much more.Usually a level 2 Brewery will provide 2 ale/turn, lv 3 brewery 3 ale/turn so long as you control it.The goal is to kill balkoth or rule the world, whichever you decide.You get to make allies and trade buildings/units/rescourcesYou level up your units, they can die permanently. You get relics that you can equipt on heroes. IF YOUR STARTING HERO DIES YOU LOSE.Cons-It's an old game, the graphics are terrible.It crashes every now and then so save often!Conclusion-It's a very good game, alot of fun, definitely made in a time where the gameplay was more important than the visuals itself. Although the game does tend to crash and that does destroy the immersion.. The gameplay is far superior and helps shed a blind eye towards it.  For $2.50/ $5.00 Its totally worth it.  I would totally reccomend this game any day regardless of its cons.I'm too tired to keep writing/reviewing.  Just buy the game and enjoy :) I'll update this eventually."

The narrator, especially draws you in, just from the menu and selecting your very first choices in the game.This game is easily worth anyones time, ESPECIALLY with the GS5 mod, which basically gives you a new approach to how you play each faith, as it balances, adds new dungeons and possibilities, and makes the custom map sharing even much more varied and fun!I'll admit, without the mod, it is clear which factions sucks completely and not very fun to play; however the mod basically balances it, adds new features to every unit, new artifacts and additional effects/tweaks to existing ones, making it much more viable to start with any champion you want on any difficulty.Something about this game keeps me drawn in and coming back even to this day, where I have countless other RPG's to start, finish. It's not in particular that those games aren't fun or even equally as beautiful to look at or listen to; it's just something about LoM's world; the ambience just keeps me in. I'm sure you'll see if you check the game out too~"
76561198058111756,Recommended,404040,28874576,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Starcomet1,This turn based strategy RPG is a classic in my mind! I had the original cd of the special edition first back in 2000/01 and I loved the game back then like I do now. The game is very difficult though and some faiths are stronger than others and not properly balanced. Downloading Manerva's GS5 mod greatly improves the game and fixes balance issues and resolves most bugs. I recommend it to any fan of RPG's and strategy games.

My only complaint is that it does not remind you that your units have unspent movement points (not a huge deal) which, for someone as forgetful as me, will mean that many times you have scouts sitting in the middle of nowhere for 3-4 turns at a time. Age of Wonders is basically a modern version of this, with a few fancy features and much nicer graphics, but this is still a great game."
