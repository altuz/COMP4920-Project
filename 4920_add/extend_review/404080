That is the reason I picked this game up. The length of the game does not justify the price, as you don't get a sence of a completed story, nor are you left with any kind of overall message. Avoid this title, you *will* feel like you wasted your money.My scores+Artwork is pleasant to look at+Soundtrack is well done+Cyberpunk balcony overlook scene-The voice acting (minus the main character) is awful-The game is over before it even begins-The story makes no sense"

There is the start of a potentially interesting story (trust me, it doesn't go anywhere. It's the same tired cyberpunk story you've heard about AI rights and the nature of sentience a million times before,) and then the entire second half (that is to say, the next 5 minutes) is a repeat of the same scenes as before, but with a navelgazing monologue about the relationship between player and creator.There is simply not enough here to justify a purchase, even at the price offered here. There is no gameplay, which would be fine if there were an interesting story to be told, but there just isn't.The art was pretty neat, and the music was good, though."

I venture to say its not an art project worth its asking price either. The ""substance"" of the story is a paragraph of a sci-fi *premise*. It goes nowhere. The premise alone does not make a complete narrative, and what is there isn't thought-provoking in the slightest. Maybe 30 years ago, but not today. The visuals are very nice, but don't waste your money. I make this suggestion as an avid supporter of games as art pieces; there is nothing here but atmospherics. Games, or interactive fiction, or what have you, can't survive such bad writing even with good art. There is no better example of this than this piece. It smacks of pretention that achieves nothing. I hope the artists go on to work on better projects that have actual writing in them. Maybe this dev will turn out something that is complete it its elements in the future, but this isn't it."

There is some amazing art direction and pixel graphics, the music is on point, the voice acting is okay (the police chief is a bit David Hayter), but the whole thing is just a polished vessle for a story, and that story just failed to satisfy my interest.I was so into the opening, the very original use of establishing shots and the pace was lovely, but then the game reaches a climax and just ends.*SPOILERS*There was a glitched-out post-credits sequence I got which revisited the game's environments, before remixing the final conversation with the droid, but this just raised more questions.I thought perhaps more would be revealed through successive playthroughs, but it was the same.Ultimatly, the game left me with the feeling that the designer/writer had a vision for a setting and a setup, but didn't have a strong enough statement to make, and thus the final product came off as a bit wishy-washy and vague."

I mean I know this is a point and click walking simulator and Im fine with that, I knew that going in, but if you want your walking sim to be worth the money you need to have a longer play time then 25 minutes, and you know, an actual plot arch with some kind of resolution. Even if you explore the environment for the optional stuff the games pretty much over before it even begins. There is an after credits sequence that just raises even more questions and doesnt really help anything and thats it. It feels like the prologue to a bigger more complete game except its not a prologue, thats it.All in all, really not worth charging for, I would have liked this if it was a free game or some kind of entry for a gamejam of some kind but as it is it really just feels like ""wasted potential"" the game.Had nice music too."

Unfortunately, all the player ends up with is a short (15 minutes at best) retelling of Blade Runner. The gameplay is uninspired, apparently needing a 3 minute tutorial on how to play a point-and-click game (hint; you point and click on things). The characters are either bland, or serve purely to illustrate the point of ""boo humans are bad for enslaving AI"".The most ludicrous example of the terrible writing is near the end of the ""game"", where a robot bemoans the fact that the main character shot him, attempting to give the player some kind of guilt. EXCEPT THE ROBOT WAS POINTING A GUN AT THE MAIN CHARACTER.Literally the only thing good about this game is the artwork, which unsurprisingly isn't done by Moorhead.Additionally, Peter Moorhead (""developer"" and auteur) is just an all-around unlikable person. He railed against the Steam refund policy, probably because of the fact that both of his ""games"" can be played in the time it takes to make lunch.Good thing he didn't get what he wanted, and I can still refund this tripe."
,Not Recommended,404080,31482151,Posted: 1 May,all,RipWitch,"You play as Lieutenant Motomeru Minori living in Tokyo who dreams of her death in the hands of a robot. It so happens a human was killed in the same area and it spirals from there. Is it fine killing robots or not? Is robots so sentient that they should have the same rights as humans? Should people leave robots stranded as they break down waiting for their owner? Sadly, Murder barely looks into this. Sure robot sentience has been done, a lot, but there was some interesting aspects. I will also certainly give them that the art was stricking, the soundtrack was great, and some of the voice acting was good.There is potential, but it is just too short. It is basically a demo for $3 and by extension an unfinished game as there was talk about more chapters a few years back. By the amount of time and how this was to stick it up to the gamers, this must be another way they are doing it (who else hates devs saying more is coming and it never happens). Interacting and reading everything (including the hidden credits scene) will take less than 7 minutes only doing the necessary interactions. By the time the game hooks you in, the credits roll. If you want to go through the game yourself, I recommend getting this during a sale."

I couldn't believe the ending came as quick as it did, and not for lack of an engaging experience (even if it's basically just clicking to advance dialogue), but rather that the writer really had nothing more to say than, ""I'm a robot, don't enslave us, I don''t want to die""?

Just as I was getting into this, it just ended. I'd recommend watching a play through or just looking at the still images on the store page...as that is pretty much all the scenes anyway.I want to see more work by the people that did this, but I can't recommend that anyone actually buy this particular title, despite it showing such wonderful promise.

Rap? wat. Who thought this was a good idea seriously.+ Voice acting is good, even though...- The writting is bad.- The plot is bad. Well, there's no plot really. Not one that goes anywhere. At all.- The game offers no challenge or interactivity, you just wander to the next screen. On about 3 screens you can do more than just the main action, which either results in an action you can't really do because the NPC doesn't want to interact you, some completely pointless and obvious backstory, or the only bit of ""plot"" you'll find in the game, which is like 5-6 sentences. After those 3 screens it literally turns into screens where you can only click on 1 thing to continue for the whole second ""half"" of the game. Oh, and during that half...- A mysterious dude or something (story/game goes nowhere, so we really dunno who that is) tells you that basically you're an idiot if you expected to be told a story or want answers.The tutorial was like 1/4 of the whole game too.I hope Moorhead wasn't looking forward to making money.Edit: I forgot to mention, the player's character is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ for what little she says to a robot, & that along with, well, basically the rest of the game as the game is, made it completely unrelatable.

You can spend 30 minutes in a shmup or 10 hours in an RPG and in both cases feel satisfied.However there's the case of Murder, a game so criminally short it barely hits the mark of existing. Yes, all of the three screens are beautiful and it has atmosphere, but when you take into consideration that you can get equally beautiful and atmospheric games that will satisfy you for hours for the same price or even for free, then any sane being (human or cat) can't possibly recommend Murder.

There's optional and mandatory hotspots to click, but there are no puzzles, inventory, or any real interactivity whatsoever. I'm fine with that, but you may or may not be.The story it tells is somewhat interesting, but feels underdeveloped. There's a post in the discussion forums by the developer indicating that this is the start of a larger tale, which he'd be willing to expand upon if the game in its current state sells well. Sadly, it's doubtful that we'll ever see the rest since the developer has since posted to Twitter that he's ""leaving games"" for a while.What we're left with, then, is an intriguing experience that could have been (and should have been) something much bigger and better.

I did read a few reviews too, and visited the Discussion section in its Community. Seeing how this game is, I guess it does deserve to get a lot of negative feedback. Savant Ascent is just $1.99 yet it still offered more than its price, but I'm not gonna compare any more games with this.This game also deserves some praise too. I'll start with a few simple questions.Is this a good game?If you could even call it a game. No, it's not worth your time if you're looking for something thought-provoking.How about the graphics and the music?Like I said, I bought this and Stranded for their graphics appeal. I really do enjoy cyberpunk, so of course the scenery and the pixel art in this one really do got me captivated.As for the music, they're pretty nice. Though, there are chances that you'll get a rap song in the title screen, which people seem to hate. KubrixXx is the guy who made the awesome music for this game. Go check hisbandcampand show some him love.Should I buy this game now or during sale?If you're a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sure go buy it now. Some people even complained that it's still not worth the price, even during sale. To be honest, if you're like me, getting this game for a certain reason like graphic appeal, then why not? I bought this to screenshot some scene and put them on my showcase.Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk a bit about the game.The game is pretty short, just a few screens and you're done. There are a few objects to interact, but it's not that fun to do. There's also a few NPCs that you can interact, but they seem uninterested in you too. Even the writing is kinda bad as with the plot. The plot is not that interesting and I somehow find it to be cliche. Although, some user suggests that the game is a just a metaphor on Moorhead's view on gamers. Interesting read, you can check it outhere.Although the Store page mentioned this game as a short story, I honestly think he should emphasize more on the word 'short'. About 15 minutes and you're done. In my opinion though, this game doesn't isn't the kind to tell its tale or to make you think about humans. I honestly think this game boasts a great visuals and nice soundtracks only.Maybe people expected an excellent story from this game and unknowingly ignored the backgrounds.Why do I recommend this game? Because I wanted to show this game some love. I bought this expecting its gorgeous visual and I'm satisfied. I never expected much from the story anyway. If you're thinking of getting this game, ask yourself for what purpose.Then again these are just my opinions so meh.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I am loving the soundtracks!"

This game would frankly have benefited from the same kind of silent storytelling that focused on interaction with the beautiful pixel environments. Instead the voiceacting is bad enough I looked for an option to turn it off, and the plot points feel roughly thrown together. With a few hours of playtime, there might have been enough time for the story to at least have some kind of impact instead of rushing through what was clearly the outline to a larger narrative. But really, if this game had just been a Bernband-style walking simulation around the gorgeous cyberpunk city, doing things like smoking on the balcony and listening to the water drip in alleyways, I would have enjoyed it much more."

It's a wonderful peice of work with a narrative that really fits in well with its cyberpunk setting.  Despite feeling like I should have been able to point-click and walk to an a spot in an area like a classical point and click adventure, the point-of-interest mechanic driving the game really does a good job of guiding the player through the narrative the author wishes to tell, but also provides sufficient non-critical interest points that add a nice touch to the overall experience of the game."

I can see the amount of work and dedication that went into making this, between the detailed and animated pixel art along with the story writing. Unfortunately, like most other players, I was disappointed with the length and linear gameplay. I also found the voice acting to be extremely bland and void of any emotion. Though I am encouraged by the effort of adding voices, it may have been better left to text only. Additionally, the story had no clear resolution which makes me feel like I went through the entire experience for nothing. I did not get any '""why"" behind what was going on and that seems like a key element in a story about murder with a grand venture buried behind it. I guess I'll never know why these events transpired and I'll just enjoy the fancy pixel art."

Murder is a beautifully crafted, visually stunning game with obvious care and attention to detail jumping out from the screen. This is an experience intended to be revisited and appreciated again and again. Atmospherically this game is second to none. Albeit a short experience (25 minutes for me personally) this is in no way a hindrance, considering the extremely low price. Murder delivers a thoughtful and stylised experience that will stay with the player and most definately will be the subject of reflection and discussion after playing.Murder is most definately a testament to the idea that video games are an artform.Highly reccomended by myself. An experience not to be missed out on.EDIT: Trigger Warning - Friend of the Dev"
,Recommended,404080,18630577,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Drake,"Peter Moorehead continues to refine his micro-minimalist approach to adventure games and environmental storytelling. In half an hour Murder packs in a ton of big ideas and folds them neatly into references to important sci fi and cyberpunk settings and characters. You'll find Stanley Kubrick and Isaac Asimov standing by PKD and Ridley Scott, while droids from Shirow Masamune's works scurry about crime scenes. Departing from Stranded's silent approach, Murder introduces a voiced cast of characters, adding a new layer to the environmental story telling. Also the soundtrack is a dead-on collection of glitched out electronic styles that successfully informs the visuals and situations.If you are interested in concise atmospheric storytelling in a light, minimalist adventure game format this is definitely worth your time. If you are a fan of cyberpunk and the idea of a short, minimally interactive game doesn't bother you then you may find this intriguing as well."

The entire thing is over in 22 minutes, and most of that will be watching the character walking, waiting for the elevator, or waiting for a train to arrive.The prologue (the first ten minutes of the game) involves diving into a damaged robot's brain and setting up the second part, then the credits roll once. The credits are interrupted by waking up again and walking through the same three locations as the prologue. This time, the people are replaced with a glitchy man speaking in Matrix Architect technobabble. The experience ends by doing the exact same thing, diving into the damaged robot's brain and hearing the same lines of dialogue. The end. No closure, no development, just hints that a plot might have happened in ten minutes if the second credits roll had not interfered.The voice acting is serviceable, the pixel art is very evocative of classic cyberpunk movies, and the ambient music fits the scenes. There are no puzzles, just clicking on an object to walk to it or change scenes. This was a big disappointment, all style and no substance."

The game has some of the best pixel art I've seen in a while and the sound design is superb. The voice acting is solid overall but some of the police agents could have been better. People aren't wrong when they say you can run through this in about 30 minutes, but there's also a few side things you could miss if you just cruise through it. For example, in your apartment building there is a droid that has fallen into disrepair and if you talk to it you can learn a pretty fascinating backstory.My biggest complaint would be how the game handles fullscreen. It doesn't render the pixel graphics to nearest neighbor, so in full screen it looks pretty blurred out.
