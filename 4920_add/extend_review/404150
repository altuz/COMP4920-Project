76561198041456493,Not Recommended,404150,19024770,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Borjas,"It remains a concept rather than a finished product and I don't regret having quenched my curiosity but the question is : Do you recommend this game? The answer is an honest ""no"". It lacks substance, objectives, there is very limited exploration and an overly confined world even if the weather concept is interesting (albeit not extremely new). I found a way to jump across the fence behind the backyard into the ""Void"" and I thought to myself that there might be something more to this game than I originally thought! I will probably fall into a fantastic alternate world beyond The Void, maybe another part of the Earth with a different weather, maybe even another planet with its corresponding atmosphere! But no, it's just a bug where if you jump across the fence into the The Void, you don't respawn or anything. The screen just stays white. Thought the devs should know."

It could have, after all, been from the heart.I get that it's only what it is. A decoration. Amusement. But it seems to lack something of a thematic foundation. It's about going outside. So what?It's not obscure enough to qualify as intriguing outsider art. The quirkiness is too forced to leave an impression of genuinity.The presentation is unpolished and the concept feels like a stump."

Maybe if you're uncontrollably curious about extremely minor aesthetic details, you'll love this game. Every time you boot this game up will feel like Christmas morning.For the rest of us, you could get a better experience by just going outside and talking to your weird neighbor in real life."
,Not Recommended,404150,25639827,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,tenshi_a,"This game just doesn't have enough content.You can walk about and not really interact meaningfully with anything. You can't interact with your dog that follows you about. There's a bicycle which you can walk into, some rocks and things which make interesting noises when you walk on them. A hilltop to walk up, so you can walk along rooftops. It doesn't lead you anywhere interesting.There are NPCs who will say about 2 lines of dialogue to you. Then you turn around and talk to them again, and they say something else. But in total, it seemed like there were about 4 things they would say, each. Maybe it was due to the weather that they hardly had anything interesting to say. It was sunny and cloudy, early evening.One NPC gave me an idea of something I could do... and I did try.... but I don't think it's really possible to jump. All you can do is walk off things.The in-game map is very small.After 8 minutes I felt like I had exhausted all the content in this game. After 19 minutes, I felt certain of it, so I resorted to the super secret cheat code.In the instruction manual (YES! Games still have those!) there is a super-secret code that lets you toggle debug things. I would not normally touch such a thing, but... to be honest, it makes the game a lot better. It lets you zoom the camera out, and walk faster.You can also ruin the ""exploratory"" experience and alter the temperature, time of day, and weather, to see how the game changes, meet different NPCs, see a few different things to run into.After 26 minutes I felt like I'd seen everything the game has to offer.I really wanted to like this game. It has the potential to be something like a micro Animal Crossing - but without the hurtfully judgemental neighbours. (Or the fashion, or collecting, or money... but mostly this was the potential I thought this game could offer). But.... it all just feels too shallow for me. It needs more content.All this game did was make me want to play Noby Noby Boy on PS3, which has a very similar art style, and is also more-or-less goal-free... but has more interesting content to see every time you come to play it (though no dialogue), and gameplay which involves eating and stretching, which are two of my favourite pastimes."

Naturally, those who are opposed to 'walking simulators' will find nothing of interest here, however, it did seem to have more to it when compared to other walking sims that are available.  That said, the world was very small (or maybe I just never found the rest of it).The weather, supposedly, correlates with your local weather. If that's the case then I don't know where it thought I was because it was hazy and foggy in game whilst the sun blazed away outside my window without a cloud in sight.The artstyle is fun and light. It has a claymation sort of vibe to it.  Also, the various characters that inhabit the world are quirky and, for some reason, remind me a little of Adventure Time characters.  That said, they lacked any real substance and conversations were awkwardly stilted.In short, the game is not objectively bad but is unlikely to sustain a player's interest for more than an hour or so.  As a result, I can't recommend it."

There is a bike that you can't ride, you can't sit or swim in the water. Art style is interesting but definitely not worth the 5£ for 2 minutes of entertainment."

76561198173606567,Not Recommended,404150,34847606,Posted: 9 September,all,KeinSchiesse,"I want to love this game, for its quirkiness and unique setting (something reminding me of 1980s / 90s children's shows, Where the Wild Things Are, and a Spongebob-ish universe...) but beyond Lovely Weather We're Having providing for a few laughs at its strange settings, funny character designs (the dog that follows you around inparticular, with his goofy smile...) and some amusing dialog (including a character lamenting / loving being kicked in the face and asking you to do so again as it's the only thing he has in life, more or less..) the game does little to provide any direction where you are to go, which fits the game's somewhat nitrous oxide/innocuous feeling atmosphere, but doesn't make for a very engaging game experience overall.This game's retail price of 7.99 is very high, once you realize that there isn't anything to the gameplay beyond wandering through the forests, fields, and neighborhoods and occassionally exchanging a few lines of dialog with one of a handful of NPCs. In the game's description it mentions the weather in the game reflecting your actual location, which I never saw much variety in, whether as a result of it being clear days here, having some kind of location service/recognition switched off (??) or just having not tried to ""play"" the game enough. All of that aside, as a feature, if that doesn't affect the gameplay beyond only an aesthetic change, I don't see it adding much value to the title overall, beyond a kind of cool visual 'app'/technology.If the game at least made an effort to conveying some kind of narrative or sense of progression and wasn't quite so experimental / abstract of an experience (and had a lower price point in lieu of that..) then I might recommend it, but as-is, on sale, all-in-all it amounted to what I expected of it: Some funny / nice / weird settings, without much to do."

It's whimsical and simple and definitely right on when it says it's made to please introverts.I loved wandering around the first time, but honestly, it's only gotten better each time I've checked in (in little 10-15 minute sessions). The characters are charming and funny, the environment is goofy and satisfying to kick, and the sound effects are calming. A+. :-)"
,Not Recommended,404150,19180929,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Phailberry,"Excellent concept.I wish there was music on occasion like the one in the steam trailer included.Not much in depth except for talking to NPC's for some minutes.Some other's have found ways out of the map. If you like that type of exploration, give it a shot, but still short lived so far.Rating: 2 out of 5, for not seeming to be complete. Doesn't seem to be enough to call this even a minigame.Otherwise, it's peaceful ^__^"

The akward clay-like figures glisten in the rain, and all leave me smiling at any new phrase they say. Speaking of said phrases, they change (along with the color scheme and effects) to fit your local weather. This gives you a sort of goal to hear everything possible out of the dorks that surround you by starting up the game whenever for 15 minutes or so.Final statement: the cold never boggled me anyway"
