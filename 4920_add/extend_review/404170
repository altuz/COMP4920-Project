76561198006413390,Recommended,404170,33701747,Posted: 21 July,all,woosk,"This 16th short visual novel from Dharker Studios(my my, I only played through 9 of them and still have another 6 to complete in my backlog. xD) feature a male protagonist Takiro who enlisted in a mech training academy and battle ground where members of the military in various countries participate in the New Wars to compete for a larger role in decision making and trade deals for their country amidst the backdrop of an economic recession. With his female co-pilots Shien, Maika and Akiko, academy instructor and mech repair girl Kariko and academy director Ascencia, Takiro is given a mech to pilot together with co-pilot(s) of his choice as well as time off together with action, comedy, romance and fanservice.Soundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are good after factoring in appropriate background music for the futuristic action, victory and defeat and romance themes in the story and animated sprites for each of the main characters. Recommended when game with soundtrack, avatar, wallpaper DLC or Deluxe edition (Note that the dakimakura DLC contain adult NSFW content) are at discount or in bundle offer as all endings and the entire game's unlockable CG at gallery can be completed in less than 10 hours. The guide DLC or published Steam community guides will help in reaching all endings in the minimum number of playthroughs."
,Recommended,404170,33339719,Posted: 7 July,all,Nightwing,"Battle Girls is a Sci-Fi/Ecchi visual novel by Dharker Studios. It's a pretty short game if you read fast and can be completed in under 4 hours if you skip all of the dialogue and just want to complete the games based on achievements.PROS- Art: The art in this game is appealing, it's stylish on its own and keeps the eyes glue to the screen. The characters are well drawn and is great fanservice material.- Characters: Each character in this game is unique and offers different dialogues and options when you are interacting with them. These characters will appeal to many players who may prefer one certain type of girl over the other.- Routes: There are 3 main routes, 2 secret routes, and 1 harem route. With this many routes included in the game, it should keep you entertained for awhile.- Adult patch: This will always be a plus in my opinion, not only does it offer sexual scenes for the players to enjoy, it also offers a deeper look into the relationship the player will build with the characters. It's like a sense of accomplishment after building a relationship with a character and then consummating it on a romantic level.- Endings: There are multiple endings and I think they all are very satisfying. All of the endings truly depends on the choices and decisions you make in the game.CONS- Story: Although the game is decent, the story is a little cliche and bland. It's a story about how the protagonist must win the tournament in order to bring glory to his country and help shift some power to his country. It also has that common anime sterotype where he's ""special"" and is the reason why he has 3 co-pilots (the 3 main girls) instead of the normal 1 or 2 co-pilots.- Music: The music wasn't memorable at all and I didn't really feel the need to have the volume all the way up in order to listen to it.- Length: It's not very short, but it's not very long either. I think it's a decent length visual novel (although I kind of read through it pretty fast).Overall, this game is pretty decent for the price you're paying. It's the type of game that will keep you entertained and certainly fulfill your ecchi needs. The uncensored adult patch is a blessing and I thank Dharker Studios for making it available for free for the public. There are elements of Sci-Fi and Mech action in the visual novel, if you're a fan of those genres, I highly recommend that you check out this visual novel and form your own bonds with these girls and bring glory to your country!"

76561198089415553,Recommended,404170,33333485,Posted: 6 July,all,WizardWorgen,"I really enjoyed this Dharker Studios game, in fact it's probably my favorite one so far.Very well made. Exactly what i expected from them.-Three very well done routes, with nice relationship development as you continue on, and a satifiying conclusion for each.-Not one, but two secret routes, which also had satisfying conclusions.Conclusion: Buy it, Patch it, Enjoy.After there amazing game Negligee they staggered a bit with that magi school sequel, and I didn't enjoy army gals as much because of the darker story, and complicated routes, but this was an amazing return to form, and i can't wait for there next game.Well done Dharker Studios."
,Recommended,404170,34411030,Posted: 22 August,all,Rubigasm,"This game is leagues better than Army Gals. The art is better, the story makes more sense, the routes don't feel nearly as forced. Overall a satisfying experience. I will say that the inter-chemestry of the girls in Army Gals was higher, and some of the characters in that game seemed deeper.In Battle Girls though, there's a lot to make the difference. It's way more lighthearted and the plot is more open and obvious, in a good way. I really like how getting to know the girls actually helps in fights, playing to their strenghts increases your chances of winning, it's great and it makes you feel like those descisions aren't random, but actually meaningful. I also like that even the side girls, the super-hot mechanic and the principal woman, have good endings too (unlike poor Cheryl). The art in this game is stunning, really well done. No complaints in that department, at least stylisticly.Downsides? Well, the H-scenes! I was unhappy about their absence in Army Gals, but then I learned about the patch. Now, in this game I realized there's still an issue! Look, if all I wanted to do was read hot sentences, I would have bought an erotica novel. I got an anthology once, and I know what good and bad sex writing looks like, because the book had both. The writing in Battle Gals is decent, 7/10 kind of stuff. The nudes are great, don't get me wrong, but can we actually get some of the action drawn out? Why do I have to imagine all of the paizuri and penetration? Come on!The characters and story both lack depth. They are interesting enought that this isn't issue, but I came away wishing for more. Akiko seemed to be the most interesting and fleshed out character, which is great, because I liked her best! It's wierd and pointless to choose where you ejaculate, but the game lets you do it. I say pointless because it changes the place where the artist put the fluids, but nothing, not even the dialogue is changed. Like, if I'm trying to make babies, wouldn't the potential mother be concerned? Perhaps delighted? Nope.Overall: If you like non-Japanese visual novels, and you think the girls are pretty hot and want to see them naked, then this game is pretty good for that, grab it. If you want to see a male organ do anything at all ever, or like depth, then you might have to skip this one. Check the screenshots."
76561198013020221,Recommended,404170,33468112,Posted: 11 July,all,Kjas,If your main reason to buy visual novels is the pictures then this is the game for you. Lots of pictures that are well done. The story for me was less engageing than Army gals and less erotic than Sakura Swimclub. While the game claims the battles are to settle disputes (with out total war) this does not fit well with the grand melee at the end. Good stories can have loose ends but I wish this had been spelled out how winning a grand melee helps a country. In Army Gals the pictures are the frosting on the cake but here they are the cake and the story is an excuse for the pictures. I liked the mech-warrior type story and it is head and shoulders better than the Bounce series (imho). So if you are looking for something lighter than Army Gals but heavier than Bounce with alot of pictures this game is perfect for you.

It was enjoyable and actually a pretty interesting concept, even though it stayed surface-level plot and character development-wise.This story would make a great anime by the way, with the whole, mecha tournaments for status in the world economy etc.(could take a really dark direction in the story with some messed up and desperate characters fighting for literal survival for their country), and a co-pilot that's more exposed than the actual pilot because they're not as valuable(kind of dark tbh, the game doesn't get much in to that though, mostly used to show some skin in the game). The story is simple and straight-forward but it definitely only scratches the surface of what it could be..Easyer on the ecchi stuff and heavier on the plot and some damn good animation and we've got a good ♥♥♥♥ing anime right here, I'm impressed.The only con I can think of is there might be a slight lack of choice, almost all the choices you made were in battle and not so many outside of that, it didn't really bother me personally though..."

76561198069159152,Recommended,404170,33473725,Posted: 12 July,all,wrb41977,"So, this game is another Dharker Studio effort. Which means lots of girls that may be willing to sleep with you alongside another story. In this case, a BattleMech tournament to settle warfare without as much bloodshed. There are three main girls who serve as your co-pilots... and can end up being a bit closer than that... There are also two other girls that are unlocked later, and a harem route...While there is enough plot to be interesting, this game is a bit lighter on it than I tend to enjoy.There is a free Uncensored patch which adds a few more scenes, removes some clothing on some pictures, and gives you a bit more of the romance building... or maybe just the having fun..."

The choices you ahve matter somewhat and influence the story line.But if you are into mechs, mutiple girls and a good story line with bad♥♥♥♥♥jokes and spicy stuff I'd recommend ""ACE Academy"" by Pixelfade Studio which is far superiour in every way in my opinion.If you have too much money to spend go for it, if you want more quality stuff, try out my recommendation instead."

It is still a VN so don't expect fancy mech fighting, just choices during the fights over strategy.It took about 7-8 hours to unlock all achievements and only cost about 8-9 USD, so to me worth it! To those claiming it was short please remember that VNs are about multiple playthroughs, not just one."

It is just how they flow and how short they truly are but I was surprised with how good this one is and I highly suggest trying it.I passed on the ""Army Gals"" one but I think I may pick it up later on.

I could have believed this was a demo, but a full game, really.OK, I haven't tried to find love with all the girls, but a single play through shouldn't take me less then 90 minutes to complete. Check my achievements if you don't believe I've completed the game at least once.The story is almost non-existent, the mech battles, aren't really battles, just story fillers, this full game should have been chapter 1, not an entire book."

76561197994273865,Recommended,404170,35169274,Posted: 23 September,all,Requiem,"One of the better games from Dharker studios.  Their software is solid as always and support all the desirable features.  The story is simple but servicable and it works.  The characters are decently written and really different.  Get the uncensor patch, obviously, and bravo to the developper for making it easily and reliably available for their products.  On the art side, it's the usual nice quality art from that developper but this game (finally!) delivers a good amount (30+) of nude CGs with some variety.  It's a bit wierd that Kariko doesn't have a rear hole but kudos to Dharker for involving Akiko's and finally doing something other than vanilla intercourse.A few suggestions for the developpers:- Try to find a way to differentiate the girls body, they all mostly look the same from the neck down.  Tatoo?  Beauty marks?  Different body shapes? Etc.- It would be nice to have an additionnal CG declination per scene showing the actual intsertion instead of relying on text with solo pics of the girls.- More kink & non-vanilla acts!  Akiko's route was going in the right direction.Anyway, I enjoyed that one.  It's a bit simple but well made, has lots of eye candy, variety and it's not tedious."
