,Recommended,404180,25235857,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This might be one of the best new releases from these developers lately. The story is simple, but as soon as you get to meet the girls better, it gets more content. I was expecting just the usual lifeless “hot girls” that without a good reason wanted to f*ck the MC. Well, it’s still like that but with a bit more of background story that actually makes sense. Kylie is my favorite character, I loved her weird behavior and ideas. I also enjoyed that some achievements were a bit tricky to get, which made me play this game over and over. The only problem is that this VN is a bit expensive, so I recommend getting it on a good sale. Oh, and this game has some funny scenes. Some dialogues (most with Kylie) made me laugh for real. For last, I liked this MC. He felt less creepy than the others from previous games.7/10."

76561198069159152,Recommended,404180,31174052,Posted: 16 April,all,wrb41977,"This is a fun little visual novel. It stars Sean as a senior trying to get through the year and into college. Unfortunately, his advisor wants him to broaden his horizons, and makes him join two clubs in order to gain a recommendation. Depending on which path you choose, you can meet three girls. Melissa and Janet are in the athletic clubs, while Kylie is in the newspaper club. Depending on how serious you are in those clubs, you can end up being able to ask one of the girls to prom. And if you have done the right thing, they might even accept and begin a relationship with you. There is also a chance that the teacher advising you, Ms. Raven might... be interested in you, too.There is an explicit patch, but most content is at the end of the paths (there is one CG on one path that might also be affected). I'm not really sure it adds anything to the story (though being a visual novel, and the most explicit content is after the final choice... I guess it is a guarantee that you will live happily ever after with your chosen girl)."

I felt like I was able to make up some of those loss opportunities by playing this VN. I was surprised the game focused on a Swimming Club and Tennis Club as those were the two clubs I would have joined if I were able to go back to High School again. Anyways, 10/10 lots of fap material, get to sleep with hot girls and bang the teacher, best game ever. The developers have got me interested in their other products."
76561198174053214,Recommended,404180,29708962,Posted: 4 February,all,vicdinnen,"This is definitely not worth full price, definitely pick this one up at a sale.  This would be a 'sideways thumb' if possible, but I'll recommend it with the 'get it on sale' disclaimer.It's a quick, casual VN.  It's kind of fun.  It was enjoyable.  Not groundbreaking or super fantastic, but not bad either.  In two hours, I managed to do everything this game has to offer (maybe it gets stretched to three or four hours if you read slower)... and so, I cannot recommend this at it's (currently) 12.99 price tag.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible game, but not enough value for that price.It also has an 18+ patch available, for those looking for that kind of content.So, if you like Visual Novels, wait for this to go on sale before deciding if you want it."
76561198013020221,Recommended,404180,32693564,Posted: 23 June,all,Kjas,It is short. Good art. X patch adds a few pictures. Story is H.S. drama.  Spoiler---if you get to the good ending with Mellisa she points out his problems are his own damn fault. That I really liked as I had been thinking it through out  the other endings. Not as erotic as Sakura Swim Club or as dark as Army Gals but still worth the money for the story.

It plays a great deal life the 'Hischool' line of games but I had a great deal more fun with this game than those ones even.  It is truly nice to play a VN which is based upon realistic thinking and an outstanding cast of characters to back up the already good story.I highly suggest getting this game.  I didn't even have to say that all of the names are in native English and not a completely foreign and never used in the United States name that proves that this game is, yet another, cheap foreign knockoff.I would give this game 4.5 out of 5 stars."

Spend every chance I get ignoring or being mean to her.>Spend all the time with newspaper-girl and all her wacky, loveable randomness>Has tons of fun and laughs with newspaper-girl>Thinking that everything was done right, asks newspaper girl to prom>Doesn't even process how fast she shoots me down until a minute later. Avoids prom and resigns to being an outcast.>Gets an ending with a clever reference name.10/10 for realism and making me relive my highschool life.Besides the soul-crushing realism, it's an enjoyable VN for sure. Main-character is very relatable, music is nice, art style is not bad, though I would have liked it more if it was more drawn out. Some things that felt like they could've had scenes (like a few holidays), or a longer scene, didn't.(Now excuse me while I clean my screen, kylie's rejection caught me off guard so much I spat all over my screen)"

It also shows that participation and confidence can go a long way. That being considerate is nice but being a push over is, well, just play the game to see the results. Fun little visual novel."
,Recommended,404180,24731799,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Groovehshoes,Although it is a short visual novel it is most certainly worth buying. Although the steam version is censored there is a patch available from the forums on the developer's website which switches it to uncensored. There are a number of different endings  and there isn't a single route whichi found to be disappointing or lacking in any way.I enjoyed it enough to play through all endings in one sitting which took me around 7 hours (this was by using skip mode to skip text I have read before)

The characters are designed really well. The plot of the story is good(im talking about the actually story). And the Plot of the story is good( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). You'd have to download the nude patch for extra gameplay, but its worth it. I'd suggest this game to anyone who likes visual novels! And im slowly waiting for the next one to come out :D"
,Recommended,404180,29256488,Posted: 14 January,all,Taebrythn,this Dharker studio release was better then summer fling. there was a little more involvment in this vn and the artwork seemed to be better quality. i do like there were a few more options as to what way the story could go compared to some of the other ones. having a few more characters sometimes does seem a little better. just my opinion there.
76561197994273865,Not Recommended,404180,35088938,Posted: 20 September,all,Requiem,"Not offensively bad, but I prefered Beach Bounce and Army Gals from the same publisher. The software is solid, supporting all the usual options.  The story is short but decent, with some development and mildly interesting but classical twists.  In the end, it's fairly short and there's not tons of content in there.  Basically only 1 real still CG per girl, 4 girls, 6 'endings', everything super tame & vanilla. The women are cute and the art is very enjoyable but Dharker needs to ratchet up the H and kink a bit if they want to keep people interested. So don't get this for the H (or even for the Ecchi).  This only leaves the story as a motivation to buy, IF, somehow, the tropes of japanese school life & activity club fiction is enough of a pull for you."
