I can see this game growing, and the toybox expanding  with cards, items, factions, heroes, classes, maps (dioramap's?), etc.Yep, a positive first impression."
,Not Recommended,404200,32822484,Posted: 26 June,all,IofTheBunny,"Sadly, I can't give the game a positive review even taking into account the early access. There are few negative elements that can be forgiven or ignored because of it - such as the really eye-straining font and rather spartan gui in general.But, the core gameplay is simply not interesting enough, especially since it basically boils down to - high ground. Furthermore, the unit acquisition and progression hints heavily that the game will likely have microtransactions and/or go f2p at some point in time.The grind is strong in the game, and the fact that you need to 'unlock' the multiplayer is the final nail in the coffin."
76561197976007910,Recommended,404200,30590985,Posted: 18 March,all,AngelEyes,"The very first line in ""Why Early Access"" reads ""“With Wartile we are trying to do something very new and different""I applaud the dev team for sticking their necks out there and going outside the comfort zone bringing fresh perspective to the scene. I hope they stick to their guns amidst traditional zealots who want the game to be what it was not marketed to be."
76561198024141258,Recommended,404200,30603951,Posted: 18 March,all,Stormtrooper,"Wartile an epic battle of your strategic ability against an AI, one that like the Terminators are out to destroy you mercilessly.First the bad. There really isn't much ""bad"" about the game. If we apply the basic ""it's early access"" mentality to it we can ignore a few of the minor annoyences. In fact, it's been twenty-four hours since the release and they have already patched some critical errors. That being said one major issue I see is that we can in fact just ignore most of the mobs and rush to the objectives. If we complete the final objective we win the battle.The good. If we ignore the fact that we can just run past the mobs and complete MOST missions and instead focus on playing it to the fullest, we then realize that it's a great game. At times the action moves so quickly as I try to move my pieces up to the enemies that I have to slow it down (Space bar) just to get all the move actions in before the enemies fill my ""tank"" with arrows.All things considered and based on this being a review written just after the 24 hour mark, I consider this an amazing game with so much potential to be a game that I won't put down for quite some time (much like Banner Saga - but with the potential of being better. WAY better).Definitely buy this game. Just do it."

I really like the hybrid of real time and turn based gameplay and the polish is solid.That being said, in it's current early release state it is the equivalent of a demo. There are only 4  relatively short levels and 4 units to unlock, with the vikings being the only playable faction. Only a couple of hours of gameplay to be had so far.I'm happy to have spent my money on this game in the hope it realises it's potential. However if you want $20 worth of game right now, best wait until the full release."

,Recommended,404200,31135751,Posted: 14 April,all,Atomic Gandhi,"This game is just awesome. It has so much charm, and a great real time strategy layer, than can be slowed down if you need it. It has the dnd feel of holding your breath as you hope your tank can parry all the hits so your spearman can skewer them."
,Recommended,404200,30576921,Posted: 17 March,all,Schweetness101,"Very enjoyable, even in early access.To get right to the heart of it, Wartile takes a unique approach to table-top style board games where it is quasi real time. Your units move in turns to discrete tiles, but after a few seconds rest they are ready to move again, and the enemy will move on you and not wait. There's enough time to make decisions without being overwhelmed, but not so much that it breaks the flow. On the whole, the core mechanic of the gameplay is excellent, and the balance between ranged, axe/shield, spear, 2-handers etc...unit types works well, with each type occupying its own tactical niche with none seeming OP or obsolete.The AI is pretty good, and will actually retreat to stay under cover of their own archers, or to get an uphill advantage, and you have to think and act with some degree of haste to avoid being surrounded. Different enemy factions seem to have appropriate AI, like enemy humans who use the aforementioned tactics, or nord zombies who rush with numbers into the melee with no regard for their own safety.There are a lot of cards that let you heal units, deploy traps, and so on, and individual units have abilities that are well selected to complemented their particular role. For example, you can put your sword/shield man in a shield wall to tank in front of an enemy, while your spearmen, who gets an extra tile of range, can hit him with impunity, especially if you use the spearman's 'immobalize' ability to prevent the opponent from moving in on the spearman. My point is that the abilities are well designed to complement one another, and emphasize the roles of the various unit types, rather than just being boring stat bonuses. A lot of thought went into the design, and they chose the small number of elegant, balanced, interesting decisions approach, rather than the mass of crazy nonsense and see what sticks approach of so many other games.The Viking theme works, and the graphics and boards are beautiful, and you can zoom in pretty close to appreciate the artwork. The animations are good as well. The menu UI is functional but unattractive, but I don't really care too much about that. The in-game UI is a little better (what you see in the screenshots). For the most part the controls are intuitive, responsive, and fluid. I had some difficulty sometimes getting some cards to drop on the unit I meant to drop them on, and I'd like a little more feedback letting me know that a card has actually been deployed. There were some things that seemed to go unexplained, like stats on weapons, and randomly appearing friendly nord zombies, but maybe that's in the lore somehwhere. Overall, those are very small nitpicks, and the sort of thing you would expect to be fixed before release.I not only recommend that you pick it up eventually, but that you actually get it now, in early access. The value is already there."

(Like SFX & BMX sound settings)- Item names- Rare items that you can find? (not TOO hard to get.. but it will give you something extra to grind)"

This game reminds me of the sort of combat-heavy dungeons and dragons type games I'd play with my friends back in high school, and by doing that it hits me right in the nostalgia.  The mechanics are relatively simple, and at the time I write this the content fairly limited.  There's every sign that this state of affairs will change, and that additional material will be added on.  I look forward to this possibility, and will definitely revisit this game a few months from now to see how it's developed.At this stage, I've spent about eight hours playing and I'd imagine I'll put in another four or five before moving on until it's more developed.  I got it on sale, but even at full price ($20) I'd consider it a worthwhile purchase.  I'm a former tabletop gamer with a full time job and a full set of adult commitments - I'm probably never going to paint another minature, but I can still find some time for Wartile on my PC, and that's nice.Recommended for nostalgic gamers like me, or anyone who likes the idea of a tabletop minatures game recreated (rather beautifully) on their computer."

I got my helmet handed to me on the harder difficulties- Item pick-ups - allows for multiple playthroughs of the same level to grab new gear to adjust loadout to suit your playstyleCons:Limited content - it's early access so no surprises hereMetagame - through the first few levels anyway, the over all stragegy looks like you max out your attack damage to slay foes ASAP since healing abilities are limited and the longer you stay in a fight, the more damage you take making it more likely you wont survive the next fight. It would be interesting to see what happens if ranged, stealth, or healer characters become available.Overall:Worth $20 if you want to support the developement of what could be a fantastic game."

Upon the completion of each mission there's a new player piece unlocked that you can purchase with gold earned during the previous mission.

Overall, one of the games that I wait for to be perfect :) As it is already very good. Tutorial in its own way is I think, creative also. This is really something new(!) with some familiar things, mostly the movement, in it. Works in real time, though I don't think the enemies move ""that much"".. like in rts. There is a slow motion available which at least so far, looks quite nice in action, during the battles especially. The graphics, especially when zooming in, could be better but it is quite good still.If you like figurines and Powermonger / Populous (yes they are old games:) style maps.. or at least a bit similar, with cards and nice details, very good sounds and more... you could like this a lot.Very minor spoiler alert ahead:No idea why they chose the need to click Continue on two different positions and why no ""Quit the game"" option ;) I guess it is either an early access ""thing"" and explained somewhere or a decision made because, you do not want this game to end.PS.

,Recommended,404200,30695996,Posted: 23 March,all,Lane,"Have you ever played a strategy game where it takes 5+ minutes for a single turn to take place? Apparently that's what a lot of people want... as comment sections are flooded with ""this game should have been turn-based garbage!"" Which is funny since steam has a wide selection of garbage that you can sift through and find what your looking for. It's like someone who drives a pickup truck being dissapointed when presented with a brand new Hybrid... ""It would be so much better if this prius had a hemi in it! Toyota is ignoring an entire demographic!!!"" That's all I'm hearing when I read people's complaints that this isn't a turnbased game, move on and allow players who enjoy this type of game to help nurture and grow this game.That said this is early access... I can see some tweaks with UI and menus and what-not, but overall I'm having a lot of fun just sitting down and playing the game as is.Seldom does a game change up a given formula this much and gets away with it, the core experience is something new and refreshing, and it's nice to be able to say that. Getting rid of the turn based aspect immediately remedies my frustration with those types of games, and while doing so it opens up an entirely new meta in the game that I'm still coming to terms with. If this game is supposed to cater to a specific group much like MOBAs do to their own players... then I suppose I'm a part of it.As someone who like Civilization, Pit People, Blackgaurds, XCOM, and whatever... I never felt more pleased with a particular strategy up until now."

It looks like there's a lot more fleshing out to do and I feel it has great potential to be something more. I'd love to see more customization and more of a menu in the start screen.  It is an early access game, I understand, but I would not say it is ""polished"".There's just not enough going on and the missions to me aren't all that exciting.  Sure you have to move around your men and they fight in real time, but the strategy is pretty straight forward - get to the high ground and have your spearmen fend off the others.  In the beginning there's not much to do with armor and gear and I hope they add a store or a way you can customize and find other items.  The multiplayer seems like it might be fun, but with the few limited figures currently available, I don't expect too much.In any case, I will keep this game and watch for future updates - hopefully as the team continues to build it they will add in what a lot of wargamers like the most - more unit customizaiton, more variety in unit types and abilities, and more interaction and challenge while playing."

I'm not much of one for multiplayer, and so I have three maps and four missions and that's it (though you can up the difficulty). Devs are active on the boardsIt can be a little frustrating at times when you have to plan tactically but don't know the pros and cons of the various bits and pieces you can wear.It really is beautifully presented, and it'll be awesome when they have more content."

Phony card system. Hard to pickup much less actually play. Half of the time where you want to play the card won't highlight. High ground advantage only seems to work for the AI. If the you have the high ground the AI seems to always get crits on you. Want to play through a scenario you already beat with a different figure well too bad you will have to face double the opponents. Next time triple. Did you have 2 heal cards in your hand well don't count on them still being there when you need them. Poof gone. Want to run more figures hope you can do it with fewer cards. This does not resemble any miniture rules from the dark ages of pre computer table top games I ever played. My experience goes back to Chainmai and minifigs in 74'. This game can be fun if you don't mind playing the same board over ,and over till you get lucky or figure out a defensive spot then lure the enemy into a trap but most of the areas don't have such a spot. They all seem to be set up so your easily overwhelm by numbers. I like how the game will change who you are attacking always so that the one you are about to kill lives. and how it rearranges you figures placement to the worst possible when you go through a door. Must be thier Idea of making the game more difficult. But back in the day we just called it cheating. Another good idea ruined by computer game programers."

Its great customizing your heroes, like disgning your own miniature and by the way specialising it. Its awesome. The gameplay might be a concern.At the moment, you put your heroes in strategic position and use there special ability or play a card from your deck, while they fight in realt time. It suprisingly satisfing, like a real board and card game, but I am a little bit concerned, if it get repitiv at some point.But I am confident that the developers got a plan. If your a in to tabletop games, I totally recommend this game and buy it right now, supporting this great game."

76561198013209687,Recommended,404200,30603321,Posted: 18 March,all,MuNgLo,"First off understand this is really an early access title. The game lacks a lot in way of polish and some comfort of life things. As the game is right now I would honestly say it is a matter of 'buy to support'. I expect this game to grow into a good game. Right now though it is mediocre.The graphics of the maps are gorgeous. The same can't be said of UI and main menu screen.The main core gameloop is solid tactics if a bit fiddly. It's a bit easy to miss the intended tile.Using the special ability of a unit needs work. No reason really why you have to mark a unit. Also there is no feedback on ability cooldown. Both could be solved with having the cards up all the time with cooldown indicator.The items and feedback of stats gain/loss if equipping them also needs work. It is usable but only just.So TL:DR.A solid tactical miniature simulator with great potential. Right now it is very rough around the edges and lacking in content.Only recommended if you want to support the future and have some patience. If you expect a full game, stay away for now.(Haven't tried multiplayer yet. Might come back and edit when and if I do. Personally I hope more for coop to get some love :D)"

The game just doesn't click for me, after 3 missions I was bored.  The issue with turning a table based game into a computer game is that it has lost the table talk and interaction that makes these games great.  I would say give this a miss, it's ok but I can't see anyone getting more than a few hours out of it."

The time slow down and battles are very well doable. It's not like playing Red Alert or Warcraft 3 where you continuesly have to press 1000s of things to win. The cards bring much tactics to the game so you can try to overcome scenarios with different cards and or units. Thumbs up so far, I'm glad I bought this game."

Some days ago I found it in a low price and I bought it.. It lacks in some issues for example there is no intro , no introduction screen , the multiplayer is off , you can compare items from the store with the items you already have etc and it makes you feel its kind of uncompleted but i can say for sure that after playing it a while I feel it worth the money and I have fun with it.. I hope they add more missions later cause now there are not many yet."
