I honestly love this game, but it took me an hour to figure out how to actually play it because the tutorial is practically non-existant. But once you figure out how to use everything, it is really fun.Controls hint:tab = shootarrow keys = moveL = landM = map (click places on the map to choose where to hyperspace jump to)J = hyperspace jumpOther tips:*Land your ship on a planet to replenish hyperspace jumps*Take jobs to earn moneyThose are not all of the controls. They are just some of the controls that you will use more often."

I prefer to opt out of combat missions like escorting science ships and luxury liners and prefer to stick with one ship as opposed to building up an entire fleet, and my list only includes the last few things I did to get to the point at which I could pass that up as an option. Oh, and there's WAY more planets and ships than Smugglers, it's not even comparable in that respect.I got it for free, so yes, definitely worth it, but I would have paid whatever I paid for Smugglers V AND its expansion and have been perfectly satisfied. And it's still in development, but perfectly stable for me, easy to mod, and it's possible to overcome the somewhat wonky combat controls that some complain about, or at least become familiar enough to where I can fight off several (very weak) raiders (that had no business preying on almost defenseless victims) in a transport ship.Tonight I will dream about transporting families of miners and farmers and desperate immigrants hoping to find a better life on a different alien world."
,Recommended,404410,29735883,Posted: 5 February,all,TheDarkJediKnight,"This game, where to start...As of the Coalition's update (0.9.5 unstable beta) there's the depreciation of modules and ships to contend with. If you like the previous version, just go to the github and get a previous version.1. Anyways: the map is big, still expanding, and has plenty as-is to offer. There's aliens, civil wars, and planets to conquer.You can be a humble merchant, trading and hauling for steady pay. There's also passenger courier work which require the safe-keeping of those aboard to arrive at their destination. Escort duties involves distracting and attacking pirates then escaping before your objective gets destroyed. Bounty-hunting requires combat reputation, so getting a bigger, stronger ship and going pirate hunting will build up your rep to be given those high paying contracts. Or even do some of each just to make end's-met.2. When starting out, even if you want to get a feel for the game on your own: TAKE THE TUTORIAL!!! It pays, it gets you going in a definative path, and you can buy some local maps (which it's highly recommended to just buy maps early on). Once you open up the sky with areas you have explored, do some jobs for a while within them. There are two time markers early in that you can use as reference points to gauge off of. If you manage to pay off your loan before Rememberance Day, you did awesome. If you pay it off before the Civil War, great. If you can't pay it off until after then, you may need to rethink your career choice.3. Don't worry about goofing off and exploring or anything until AFTER you pay off your first debt (like I said before, buy some maps so you don't go stumbling about early on). If you are having problem with the Pirates, stick to the middle and 'north-west' part of the map and do trading. If you are in the mood for salvaging or capturing ships, aim for the 'south-west' area around Aldhibain (five jumps 'south south-west of Rutilicus/home-planet) since there is both a strong merchant & local milita and Pirate raids. Also, the planet within the Aldhibain has both an Outfitter & Shipyard along with the trader, so you can not only sell the parts you get, you can sell any captured ships, equipt any modules you aquire or buy new ones when you get the money for them.4. Lastly, once you upgrade your ship (anything over $million should do) go explore and visit each unexplored spot. Can't reach there? No worries, you will soon enough. If you prefer a more peaceful venture (aside from Pirates) visit the 'north north-east' area. Want to fight some tough enemies? Visist the 'east' area and say 'hello' to the new-comers (with several salvos of cannons). Once you unlock advanced flight, throw yourself to the far corners of the galaxy and discover all there is to this game.5. ...then finally, once you do everything this game has to offer: quit it. Yes, quit... for a few months, go play something else,  do real-life things.6. Then come back and find new contents has updated... then you can start a new save and play through the whole thing in record time.7. See 5, 6 & 7 for further instructions."

,Recommended,404410,30025051,Posted: 18 February,all,Long Potato,"For a free game, this is golden.The controls take a bit of time time to get used to. Personally I have rebinded practically every key to make maneuvering easier since the original binds are all over the place. The tutorial is extremely basic so you'll need to do a lot of experiments to figure out the best way for you to play. You will not become a galactic emperor on your first try.Other than that it's really fun to get into. Lots of ships with differing strengths. Lots of outfits to try out. Many many many jobs to take. Thereisa storyline but it's mostly in the background and you're not even a main protagonist if anything just a little helper minion with selfish standards. A little tip, check the space port every time you land if you want to see what's on in the galactic affairs.The developer seems to pump out updates every few months or so with new content in each one so even if you get bored you could check back later to see if it's worth it to jump in again.8/10 for now"

Could easily be worth $20 or more.One of the greatest aspects of this game is its ease of organization and navigation. There are so many ships, weapons and stars that you could very easily get lost and frustrated trying to remember where everything is had the developers not taken that into consideration. You can see the prices of everything in every system and where every piece of equipment you've discovered is sold. You can access everything's stats to plan out trips."

The overall gameplay reminded me of many hours lost to starport GE and I almost stopped playing because of that. All I can say is keep playing, you will be hooked by the first hour.Being able to have your own fleet, or be the best space bus ever, or being a glorified long haul space trucker, or being a quest monkey, anything you do, the game let's you.

,Not Recommended,404410,29517356,Posted: 27 January,all,MechPilot524,"I recommend this game only if you have literally nothing better to do, either because you have WAY too much time on your hands AND you don't have enough money to buy an actual game. Assuming most people don't meet both conditions, I can't recommend this game. At least it's free, so only my time has been wasted on this game, and at least I have a decent chunk of time to waste right now. Otherwise I would have stopped at 2 hours.If you're the kind of person who doesn't want to binge this game, I just say don't get it. You probably don't even need to read this rant. But if you do, maybe you'll get a few ideas on how to make a better game than this. It's not that hard and you could probably justify charging money for it - these guys certainly wouldn't get my penny for this one if they did.- The graphics are terrible, underwhelming. Free game, so easily forgivable. Stock footage images in the places where you land and each one doesn't feel alien or outer-spacey at all. Annoying, but again, it's free. Just proceed with that in mind. I'd like to think more effort on the devs' part would have produced better results, but it's free, so perhaps the one critique I have that can be addressed properly.- This game is absolutely HORRIBLE at telling you things. How does the game work? There's no guides. Did my escort get disabled? No idea, just spam shift+N until you find the right one. Aside from the retired guy you taxi around early on, nobody teaches you anything. I'm not saying this game needs a tutorial, but come on! In the wide universe, there are almost no resources to explain how equipment, much of which has been heavily used for CENTURIES, works? There's no owner's manual that comes with my 1-million credit ship, not even a downloadable PDF? Okay, so there's this ""scram drive"" that I can use instead of my standard hyperdrive. It activates at a higher max speed, at the cost of fuel. How much fuel???I recognize there are wiki resources online but those frequently ruin the experience. It feels like cheating, and sometimes when spoilers are unwittingly given in their zeal to inform the public, it is.- Ship controls are terrible. Maybe, just maybe, it's forgivable if they're trying to copy+paste the old series they claim to be paying homage to. But I think the control system is terrible. There aren't any inertial dampeners!? There aren't any forward-facing thrusters!? Come on! Your ship has to turn 180 degrees and use its main thrusters just to slow down!! And you can't strafe either! Dogfighting is a pain in anything other than a tiny fighter that can't even hyperdrive to other sectors, seriously, and doubly so if your ship can't turn quickly. Copy off a classic or not, it sucks - humanity could probably do better a hundred years from now, let alone a thousand years from now when the game takes place!- I sort of appreciate the devs' efforts to throw in something innovative - financing. Sure, it had me in a hurry to pay off my loan at first ASAP, but at the same time balance payments between saving my earnings to get a good ship. They get points for that. I sense some people might also want to make use of the credit score and take out a loan at some point to help boost their progress. I actually liked the mechanic.But... refer to my next point about capturing ships.- Life's hard if you're not a spaceliner captain or tramp hauler. For combat ships, there are only two ways to make money if your fleet's worth less than 2 million credits. You can perform ""escort missions"", which don't pay so badly at first and pay quite nicely as the game progresses. You can also board disabled pirate ships and either strip them of parts, or board them and capture the ship as a prize.Now here come the problems: The devs did a terrible job of the enemies who appear on escort missions. Far too often do I barely enter orbit as I leave a planet when I get swarmed with three pirate ships with some sort of high-tier lasers that shred my light warship in barely a second. I don't have any time to react. I can't deal enough damage to any of them to buy myself more time, let alone fight my way out. This brutal cycle continues for a few more loads until I get lucky and local law enforcement shows up in time, I somehow manage to get enough asteroids between me and the banhammers to escape, or the game miraculously sends me one lone pirate who is ridiculously weak and far too easy to kill. Never a fair fight, be it one way or (usually) the other. What's more, the pay doesn't usually increase. It's all based on the ship you're flying, which isn't directly proportional to the pay you get.Okay, so the other method: disabling pirates and looting them. Ahahahaha. That's even worse. 4 out of 10 times, your hyper-aggressive law enforcement will brutally annihilate any pirates around. Out of the remaining 7 times, they will, one way or another, attack the vessel again after it's been disabled, destroying it, almost every time. Adding insult to injury, they wait for you to fly towards the target, then they shoot at it, killing it. Result? Only very rarely do you reach a ship to board it. Once you've boarded it, you can either strip what you can carry, or you can attempt a capture. Great stuff. You should expect to lose a crewman or two, but you can sell a captured ship for a lot (that's what let me get rid of the starter fighter, and also what paid off my starting loan) or put it to use carrying cargo and making your fleet look menacing. Not that the AI's that great at fighting.So I captured a nice interceptor. Lost one or two guys doing it. WITHOUT TELLING ME, the game applied a 550k ""death benefits"" charge. For some reason, it started charging me 10k credits a day, and when I finally made it to a bank, I was given a nasty surprise. Remember that financing? Yeah, you have to pay interest on the exorbitant death fees too, and what's more, you have to pay it off in 60 days. I had to work my♥♥♥♥♥off to pay it off in time - the fact that I was losing 10k a day to a big black hole. So I'm gonna think twice before capturing ships from now on. Nobody's worth 700k in principal and interest. My entire spaceship and its equipment almost cost that much!I don't know about the rest of the playerbase, but I got this game to have fun by blasting stuff. Not by being a galactic door-to-door salesman or glorified bus driver. The way it works for the first several hours of the game, it seems the devs want to discourage that.- This game's supposed to be really moddable. It really should be, looking at how basic it is, the fact that its source is on GitHub or something. I really wish this had Steam Workshop, but my gut tells me it won't happen. There's no central source for mods, so the chances of you finding a good one - or even a variety of them - are kinda slim. I could also be completely mistaken and there are virtually no mods for this game. The site the devs link you to has only like six mods, and too many ""ship mods"" are just pictures of ships. I don't have time to code their implementation because of the time I absolutely need to put into the game if I'm playing it due to aforementioned reasons.So yeah. I don't really like this game but I have nothing better to do. I'm in that bad a situation hahahahaha. Someone save me"

Small craft are kind of useless and weak right now, though the issue is being considered; work your way up to a capital ship if you want to live. I didn't note a lot of room for player skill here really, it's mostly a game about building and customizing your fleet to smash the opposition - but there's a lot of customization on offer and I was constantly surprised that there was still more to discover. I still haven't seen everything or completed the currently available main quest line. The writing is very well done. At one point I rescued some kids from a pirate base and eventually found them a new home. They promised to repay me some day and I figured that was just the end of it and I smiled at the end of a satisfying 'good deed' quest. I came back an in-game year later, having completely forgotton about the quest, and when I landed I discovered a note explaining how those two kids had worked hard and made a place for themselves here - had a child, bought a home - and they put together all the money they owed and left it for me.

Its almost like a 2d Galaxy on fire. Which is grand considering how much detail was put in.Those who are working on this from github or otherwise, please do a steam workshop for this...It would make the replay value soar."

It's...minimalist with a punch. Basically the dev sat back, asked what is important in a spacey-tradey game and did that... and skimped on the rest. It's two D, top down and completely amazing."

Not for most people, but it is enjoyable. The only problem I have with this game is that it advertises itself as Multiplayer when it isn't."
76561198144592545,Recommended,404410,30183668,Posted: 25 February,all,recneps,"This game is enjoyable and has lots of replayability. Today, after not playing it for a few months, I thought about it again. I kept telling myself that it'd be boring since I've already played through it 3 or 4 times.. I'm now halfway through the 'main' storyline and still not bored."
76561198182500493,Recommended,404410,30214141,Posted: 26 February,all,kieransaulis,"Okay, well I've only been playing for 8 hours now, but I can confidently say that a lot of work and creativity was put into this game. It's a bit grind-ey, though I'm saying that from a merchant's point of view, but exploring and reading the descriptions for planets is fun. I do, however, get to enjoy the fruits of my labour; I am now a millionaire and the proud owner of my very own fleet, comprising of a grand total of TWO ships. (Hey, I'm pretty sure that it still counts as a fleet.) I might end up getting bored and turning to a life of danger and excitement, but my current playstyle is so lucrative that I'm probably going to stick to it until I can buy myself a halfway decent ship/fleet. Anyways, it's free, so try it out. If you're a sci-fi nerd, then you'll enjoy the lasers, futurism, and space-stuff; and if you're into finance, capitalism, or accounting, (or you just want to experience the joys of paying off a virtual mortgage) then you'll enjoy basically everything else! Also, did I mention that it's really addictive? I just wanted to try it out and now it's 1:18 in the morning. Completely replaced my heroin addiction; though I've hardly ate, drank or gone to the washroom since I started so I'm not sure if it's all that healthier."
