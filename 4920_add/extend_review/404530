Honestly this game is incredible and difficult even on easy! Its like minecraft and gta had a baby and voxel turf came out. I don't leave alot of reviews infact I think this is my first but I felt this needed to be said and wouldn't want people missing out on this gem.
,Recommended,404530,35026539,Posted: 17 September,all,Gabeux,"Very neat game from a one-man team. It's a concept I've been wanting to see implemented: GTAV and Minecraft elements.Of course, as the game is indie to the max, you shouldn't go in expecting the complexity and dev time those multi-million (and -billion) games have.Being able to build a city, run missions that will wreck havok on it, and then rebuild (or leave it looking like a warzone) is pretty cool.It's nice to see the care applied to building each of the game's buildings, especially on Special, unlockable buildings.It's also great that the game has multiplayer from the get-go. You click it and it just works. It's a surprise, given the hell I usually go through to get servers up for indie games.Going from struggling to make a few bucks, to making thousands of money per minute is really satisfying.With workshop integration, patches and modding, the game has potential to live on, past its release capabilities.For the price, there's definitely enough content to be enjoyed!As always do watch a few videos to see if it's your thing.Thanks for reading! :)"
,Recommended,404530,34963765,Posted: 14 September,all,Mazzle Dazzle,"Conceptually this game is amazing.  You take the best aspects of GTA: San Andres, Sim City, and Minecraft and combine their mechanics to form a game where you can progress in skill, progress in monetary value, create custom buildings and fight over turf or just make money.  In practice, its actually pretty good.  It takes a bit to get into the game, and it feels like everything is overpriced and a horrible grind at first and every enemy one shots you.  This goes away once you learn the game and understand the mechanics and combat.   The zoning, the protection money, the stealing cars, the cops, the enemy bases, the turf wars, and the random missions. It all adds up to be pretty awesome.Probably the best aspect is being able to custom create your own buildings as in multiplayer, you can load up a town with all your own buildings."

I don't see a way to plan raids on other bases, however, I'm probably just missing something - tell me if I am :)Great experience for such a simple-looking yet complex game, amazing job! :3"

,Recommended,404530,35008223,Posted: 16 September,all,Identify,"After playing this game for a few hours I can confidently say that this game is worth the money. After playing the game for around an hour or two on singleplayer I learned the basics and then brought up an online server with my dedicated machine. I've met quite a few players and gotten in contact with the developer he responds very quickly to any questions and bugs that are brought up. Anyways lets bring up the pros and cons.Pros+- Open World that is always changing- Co-Op missions- Fast paced combat- Base building- City management- Active developerCons-- Early Access, bugs are to be expected- Not very many players yet- Repetitive missionsNotes:The way the game is set up I am sure that someone can create script custom missions and place them in workshop. I also think as time goes on the game will get a lot more players. In the future the game will definitely get more players. My server is one of the most popular servers currently and we are averaging about 20 players+ a day.Conclusion:If you like GTA, City Building, Gang PVP, etc. This game is perfect for you."

Great value for your entertainment dollar.Update 1: (60+ hours)This game is spectacular. It has everything.  You can build cities via the mapmode.  The cities are functional in the sense that it is the world you are playing.  Building placement is about what works best for you.The economic design is solid.  Vanilla settings permit you a healthy set of options in the beginning.  Complete a few early missions to boost your progress.  You can make an impact on the game if you have a focus.Earn some money.  Build some things.  Balance the RICO and perk buildings. Use the money to do more.  Build bigger.  You could spend all day making the ultimate apartment building.  Or, you could create a meat grinder of enemy AI vs your AI.  Turn the local area into a pot marked hellscape.  FUN!Combat.  This game is about management.  You are managing simple soldiers fighting simple enemies.  They won't get all ""tactical"" on you and execute complicated maneuvers.  Enemies charge and shoot until you or they are dead.  Simple.  Yet, the management aspect of the game is where the strategy lies.  Want to conquer a base?  Sure, you can be all stealthy and tactical if you want to play John Wayne and take the world on by yourself.  But... it is more fun, IMO, to surround the enemy base with a few of your own bases, fully fortified.  Use some rockets to shell their compound while your AI minions fight them.  Numbers.  Have two bases or more.  Maybe three or four for those big bases populated with missile soldiers.While they do that, go jack a car.  Get the missile spawning perk.  Charge the base and strafe it with missiles.  I do this for hours, laughing maniacally.  I don't know if they have a name for what's wrong with me."

,Recommended,404530,34951795,Posted: 14 September,all,BEGONE THOT,Its like an open world RPG of GTA mixed with minecraft its really good and im enjoying it with my friend.
,Not Recommended,404530,35036470,Posted: 17 September,all,DukeVonC,"I get it. It's a one-man made game. It's cool. Yeah.But no.I hadn't much hope for the game, i didn't expect much. But the idea of a game with the Building aspect of Minecraft, city making of the sims and GTA gameplay, really catched my eye. The thing is: The game looks bad, it plays bad and it feels bad.Gunplay isn't fun, the gun sounds are generic and boring and even using a shtogun/rocket launcher doesn't make you feel ""powerful"". All the weapons feel the same: Boring pea-shooters.Its just visually unnatractive. I usually don't care if the game looks bad as long as it's gameplay is good. Sadly, right before i started playing, i let out a huge sigh. Textures are hideous, people are stiff. weapons look terrible. There are almost no animations, when npc's die the explode (not in a cool way), cars look WAY out of place being the only non-blocky things.FOV is crazy high, it almost feels claustrophobicGame is kind of confusing even after playing through the tutorialControls feel wanky, but are bareable, however, controlling the helicopter is a nightmare. Cars feel nice, walking/running feels kinda weird, but flying the helicopter has been by far the worst thing about the game.My computer has more than the recommended specs, and the fact that it takes about the same amount of time to load Fallout 4 and to load this game (from startup to spawning in) is outrageous! I get its a procedural generated world with ""over 1300 blocks"", but it takes forever for the game to startup and to load my save file.Camera is crazy. Its ridiculousy fast and if you even think of moving your mouse while talking to an NPC, you're gonna be flying when you end the conversation.However, there are some great things that this game does have:The soundtrack is amazing. I really enjoyed my 30 minutes of soundtrack.Exploring the city and bringing chaos to the innocent is also kind of fun (without the things i mentioned before). I got in my game, i bought a gun, and i went on a killing spree in the buildings next to the gun store. I shot down a full business building and made about 5k with all the money the people dropped. Even though the guns don't feel nice and the way npc's die is just laughable, its actually kind of fun to go around and f*cking sh*t upThe car-play is also pretty good. I enjoyed the controls the game has for the cars. It feels right, fast and fun. You can't run people over though... they just kinda float over your car, and it's kind of disappointingThe core idea of the game is great. It's just about giving the game and the dev more time to improve his work, and this will be a great game. It just needs to work in its graphics and some other small things.I think i'm being too harsh on a one-man made game that has been out for about a week. Maybe i should play a little bit more and then make my review, but i honestly don't like how the game feels and plays. Even though my review is negative and i've listed a nice amount of not-so-good things, i kinda do recommend this game. The only thing i think it should do, its to change it's aesthetics. People like the gameplay and i think i could enjoy it too if i got a little bit deeper, but its mostly the graphics what's making this game a bit of a pain for me. I say you should give it a try, buy it. It's not that expensive and if you can ignore the graphics, you might be in for a great time."

,Recommended,404530,35077399,Posted: 19 September,all,Rail♫,***At the time of writting this only 2 out of 13 negative reviews for this game are inelligble for a refund... What do you have to lose? One hour and fifty-nine minutes of your time?So i actually have been enjoying this game quite a bit. Public MP is a waste of time right now without 24/7 server's. Coop MP is awesome. SP is what I got my hours in.Pros------------------------The real-estate/racketeering system is pretty amazing.-Tons of default building/decor/base designs.-Ability to save your own custom designs and build them instantly at the material cost price.-Minecraft build style with more block types.-Some blocks are worth more depending on the material allowing you to increase a designs worth/profit.-Every building is enterable and NPC's are spawned inside.-Tons of GTA styled missions to gain XP/reputation while you await your real-estate profits.-You can rob/heist most of the comercial buildings in the game. They will have safes in the back.-RPG Perk/Stat system. Progression is felt for sure.-Honestly the music is pretty catchy at times.-A vast array of vehicles which actually feel pretty good. Races are suprizingly fun.-The abillity to develop land and expand the city limits and population.-Sim city style residential/comercial/office/industry supply and demand system.-Steam Workshop support.Cons------------------------Performance/optimization sucks atm. Easy to improve game just came out.-Cop/enemy combatant AI sucks atm. Very predictable pathfinding/reactions.-Guns lack weight. Better sound effects+blood particles would improve this ten fold.-No ramps for cars means your city is flat. Adding ramps for road height changes and vehicle jumps would be awesome.-Car damage is generic. Adding hitboxes to vehicles(engine/wheel) would drastically improve this.-No way to fish-tail a car. Add a handbreak.-Where is my vehicles radio? Lets get some different radio stations too!-Lack of enemy types. Armored swat members could be cool. Maybe attack dogs.-No melee weapons/enemies.-No drug dealing. If he added a drug wars buying/selling system mixed with Crazy Taxi delivery system.. OHMAGaWD! GOTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-Lack of voice overs. 25% of the GTA atmosphere is all of the vocal chatter. This would make this game like 1000x bettter.-Navigating the city can be a little bit difficult. Better GPS system would be nice.So there you have it. Most of the cons can be easily improved and the pros are pretty awesome/groundbreaking! Even if this game never gets improved its still worth a purchase because the concept and game design is so freaking slick. If the game is popular L Twigger will be forced to improve it or someone will steal his idea and make millions. Both these outcomes are in your favor ;D.

It reminds me of Garry's Mod Fort/Base Wars. This game also has a potential for roleplaying which is always great in my books. So currently there is 3 different gamemodes: first, is a simple generated city and you start your life and buy land and make a gang or buy a business. This is the basic gamemode. Second, You scavange and collect money to build a city then proceed to run it. Third, There is already a city and lots of AI factions and you use diplomacy to control the city. I have only tried the first gamemode at the time of writing this and will update it in the future.Pros3 different ways of playing.Multiplayer and Coop.Runs clean and smooth.ConsLacking sounds in some spots.Lacking variety of weapons and loot.My OpinionI think its interesting and has potential to grow into something great. So for only 8$ why not give it a try. I recommend this."

,Recommended,404530,35066805,Posted: 19 September,all,The Hermit Spycrab,"A few years back I used to play a game called Ace of Spades with my friends. Two teams would spawn into the world and had to defend their flag from the other team by building a base and fighting it out. That game quickly bored me, as it had a very limited building system, no vehicles, etc.This game seems to be exactly what I wanted Ace of Spades to be. More blocks, decals, wiring, more detailed combat, vehicles, and so on. From the bit I played, it's still VERY rough around the edges, but with constant updates and additions, I have no doubt that this game has the potential to be the next big sandbox game.There are a few issues. A lot of it's indie-ness I find to be charming and nostalgic, but there are some things (such as chat text overlapping with HUD text and taking up a third of the screen if someone spams the chat) that really do need to be fixed.Seeing as it just came out, it's still fairly impressive. If by the end of the year nothing has changed, however, I will have to edit my review, as it would be a waste for such a great concept to go unupdated."

If you dont feel like that how about designing your own commercial buildings, factories or any other building type.  You could design your own chain stores for example.

76561198027212551,Recommended,404530,35009388,Posted: 16 September,all,thebobster,"Accidentally cancelled out of my own review, so I'll just put the short version up for now :xSo far it's really neat, and while no one part (combat, driving, property management, UI design) is spectacular, it's neat to see all of these ideas coming together and interacting. As a criminal, you get to see the damages and other effects of your criminal empire on the world itself, and as a property investor/developer you get to explore your city and see/interact/build with the interiors and people in each buildings. After doing some missions eliminating bandits and doing some experimentation in my own base, I was able to purchase and customize my own office building, and it's fun to work on that while being able to see people and cars moving around in the streets below (and sometimes going to the nearby skyscrapers for rooftop sniper battles when the bandits cause a ruckus).The price is cheap for how ambitious the project is, and the devs have been active so far in fixing up game issues, and they even created templetes for various types of gamemods for the steam workshop. If the idea of being able to explore and mess with a world with a lot of moving parts, or anything else I've mentioned above, sounds interesting to you, I would definitely check it out. If you're like me and want to learn more about what you can do in the game, the devs set up about 12 or so articles on indiedb (I think you can access them from the updates list, but I don't want to accidentally delete my review again while checking) explaining all of the various mechanics.Also I couldn't find a place to put this in my review, so I'll just mention here that the music is pretty amazing. It shows up sparsely, but when it does (usually when building or in combat) it's a real treat."

,Not Recommended,404530,35037098,Posted: 17 September,all,Randy Farmskins.com,its not very in depth. Might repurchase later if new stuff and mechanics are addedEDIT: so pretty much the thing that got me the most was combat. It is way to blan and just overall not good. Some other things I would like to see is gravity. so when you blow up the bottom of a building it collapses or something to that extent. Overall driving i feel needs to be re looked at. The camera is at a really bad angle even when adjusting FOV. Lastly I think it just needs bug improvements and just fixed in general. Maybe they should have launced into eary access before full release :|

,Recommended,404530,35020735,Posted: 17 September,all,Shipreck,"This game will be amazing when players start creating more content for the workshop(custom buildings, race tracks, mods, etc). My biggest fault with this game is that it is very hard for a new player to get into the game due to the tutorial skipping over most of the city building mechanics, cop chase mechanics, economy mechanics, and most importantly it doesn't tell you anything about the diplomacy in the game. The diplomacy is the most important part of the game, because that's how you win essentially, by beating all the other factions and annexing their bases, but to do that you have to know how to use diplomacy.  If you want to understand the mechanics of the game, you will have to watch the developers videos on his youtube channel, which is frustrating."

76561197977820099,Not Recommended,404530,34963375,Posted: 14 September,all,Lizzard,"I feel bad being the first negative review and this game doesn’t really deserve a full thumbs down… but it doesn’t really deserve an entirely positive rating. There’s one simple reason for this - “Broke Protocol”.The above-mentioned game features many of the core elements as this one, minus the city-building portion. I only use it as a comparison because it’s entirely free to play vs. the $7 tag this game has.When you take the difference between the two games, what you essentially get is a $7 voxel city building game, minus the management aspects of Sim City, for your money with this purchase. And even though $7 isn’t much, it’s hard to really justify spending that much on a game that only has one difference from a free to play game of the same genre.Pros: ability to create your own city; ability to play in the world of your city, interact with residents, purchase land, etc.; freedom to act however you like in said city - rob a bank, build a house, own a business, blow holes in office buildings, etc.Cons: The destruction advertised feels more like accidentally hitting the delete key when you build something in Minecraft - the blocks vanish and that’s about it; cars don’t respond to any damage and just keep driving like nothing happened (minus falling in a pothole your grenade created); driving is ultra-unrealistic and the controls feel more like playing a 3d game of PacMan, than driving an actual car; cars also lack anything but the most basic of physics relating to being hit by other cars, other than swerving a bit - don’t expect any pin maneuvers or noteworthy crashes; gun fire sounds, looks and feels more like shooting a pellet gun; targets are ridiculously hard to hit, as people just go flailing around wildly when you shoot and they take an insane amount of damage to kill; AI police are also a special level of stupid, failing to go looking for you inside of buildings, even if you never leave the scene of the crime.Even for an EA game, the list of cons combined with the lack of original features of similar games so far, leaves this game coming up short of what you’d probably expect.."
