,Recommended,404550,31830129,Posted: 18 May,all,Hiræther Harbinger de Behçet,"Voxel style Tower Defense with building elements quite pleasing to the Maze designer style player.  Dead Acres provides oppertunities for creative strategies and it makes the game quite interesting, very replayable.  It is hard for me to believe that this is one of the first Minecraftian style builders to incorporate solid TD 1st person such as this, like Block Fortress on iPhone or some of the players mods out there.Fun atmosphere with comical zombie design makes for light hearted humor when the blood goes everywhere.  Musicly is is short and sweet, fun and appropriate.  The placement controls take a little getting used to but make sense.  Being able to raise turrets so their sight of range is aligned is crucial to survival.  One can play more towards FPS or TD but you will always need to do a bit of both unless you Camper is well bunkered.  This is an Early Access sure to please as the game works well with minimal bugs.  I did have a generator dissapear on me somehow!  So there are still some things to work out.  In the 1st hour and a half that's not too bad for glitches in EA.  This game is ready for good testers.Dead Acres is the place to be, folks.  The only thing missing is  Eva Gabor in a mink stole."

I don't have a bad computer)- Needs upgrades for different turrets such as: Damage increase, range increase or spread decrease for shotgun turret"

Now dig this: During the day you'll do your farming, working the earth with your hands and tools like your pappy always taught you, but at night you need to make sure you've spent ample time building up defensive walls and turrets to stave off the undead looking to ruin your organic kale operation. Talk around the countryside is theres one o' them undead, big as a mountain. So brother, you best get to work."

,Recommended,404550,31999498,Posted: 27 May,all,humpers,"Great indie tower defense game. It's definitely got a nice colorful derpy athestetic and the gameplay is pretty fun with a bit of a sandbox feel. Apparently the full release is coming for the summer sale, but I can't really speak to the newer content cause I haven't played it.  In its current state, there is no multiplayer and there are some fps issues,  but those are pretty much limited to when you spawn a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of animals or turrents (which is pretty hilarious tbh). It took me about 8 hours to finish the current content which I had a lot of fun playing, and for 5 bucks thats pretty reasonable. The full release might cost more but it looks like there will be 6 or so new maps (currently 2) and multiplayer.I will update this for the full release which im pretty excited for :D"
,Recommended,404550,21404449,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,Morally Bankrupt,"Actually a really fun little game.  For $2.50 it's really worth it.  I would've spent the whole amount on this game but I got it on sale.There's enough upgrading to keep it interesting so far.   It's like tower defense, where you're invaded by zombies each night and then during the day, you farm to make money.  Sell your crops and buy more seeds, or turrets, UZIs or cows, makes perfect sense."

76561198116122756,Recommended,404550,19259141,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,Jerry Seinfeld,"Dead Acres is a cute and silly ""Strategy,"" and ""Action"" game. I can't say it takes place in a certain location, as there are several to choose from once unlocked. The story... Well you're a farmer trying to survive in zombie infested locations-don't ask me why and how he ended up farming in locations like these.Dead Acres provides you with so many in-game items to choose from, and a plethora of pesky zombies to deal with. It has turrets, an assorted array of crops for you to plant and harvest, primary weapons, tools, decorations and traps for you to lay in the battlefield.As you can see this game has plenty to offer. With a low price tag like that, I'd say it's a great buy."

While this game is very fun it does have one flaw. And that is when ever a night starts and when ever a day start there is a loud noise so you have to turn down your volume. Other then that the game is perfect
,Recommended,404550,22570003,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Partypants_,"If you are looking for a game that is a great time passer and very enjoyable, this is the game for you. It offers a wide variety of fun and it doesn't get old. You get to play as a dank farmer that shoots up zombies at night with unlimited ammo, what more could you ask? At the same time you are playing a farm simulator (dank simulator) which everyone can enjoy and you don't have to wait like a month for food to grow like in the real world. It is a game very worth the 5 buckorinoes $$ and if you don't buy it now you may have to pay more in the future when it is finished. Also saying that it is an early release, I was very surprised how amazing the game was. People will say it is like Minecraft but don't listen to them. It's NOTHING like Minecraft at all, and that was what made me unsure of buying it since I wasn't sure to believe them or not. But good game, looking forward to playing it a lot in the future, and hope you feel the same about it as I do if you buy it.Pros- GUNS- ZOMBIES- FARMINGGGGGGGG- BUILDING A SICK BASE WITH GUNS- Only $5Cons- I bit hard to understand in the beginning, but very easy to catch on- Kinda glitchy but not so much, just here and there (understanding that it is a early release though)- Can make you rage quit sometimes"
,Not Recommended,404550,29288295,Posted: 15 January,all,Ikrani,"Too slow for my liking.Make no mistake: the potential is definitely there. Minecraft comparisons aside, there's something alluring about this strange cross between Minecraft and whatever game first comes to mind when you hear the phrase ""farming simulator"" (for me, it's Slime Rancher).I was really sold on the idea and the demos where I saw chainsaw turrets around walls (and kind of like the idea of being able to build walls but not gates). As I played, I liked the idea of the livestock being turned into zombies, for their commodities are far more valuable than the crops on a one-to-one basis. The turrets I liked, even though no one told me the grenade turret can't shoot OVER my makeshift parapet and thus blew up both itself and the lowered wall I'd placed it near.But, alas, this game moves like an arthritic double-amputee and it drags everything down with it. The slowness does not limit itself to the pacing. EVERYTHING in this game moves like it's wading through molasses: the zombies, the livestock, you, the crops' growth, everything. The crops I can understand, and even get why the livestock might wander around aimlessly (though that feature where everything gets blurry when I pick something up is bloody aggravating). But the zombies move slow and can take about 2 full clips of ammo from both the pistol and the uzi before they go down, making them a chore to kill. The shotgun speeds things up, but the constant need to reload (and the game doesn't let you switch weapons until your spent weapon has bullets in the chamber again) is also aggravating.There are other things, too: the generators only provide power within a small radius, so I don't feel safe placing them near openings where the chainsaw turrets would go. There's this strange crypt on the first level which spawned a spitter every time I clicked on it, and I'm pretty sure those things can eat more bullets than their Behemoth brethren. On their own, they'd be nitpicks, but collectively each little problem adds to the irritation until it becomes duly noticeable.Most annoying, and the one thing I refuse to forgive, is the placement mechanic. The object in question is not placed until AFTER the animation is done, and because this game tricks me into thinking it's Minecraft, I'll often place things down because daylight hours are limited and you can't build things at night for some arbitrary reason.So, yeah, Dead Acres. Loads of potential, but the game needs to move faster and the daylight timer needs to slow down a little. I really, REALLY wish I could recommend this game, but I simply can't. The flaws are too many and too glaring, and that snail's pacing killed it for me."

Their are a few issues but considering its just came out in Early Acccess I am hoping much is going to get corrected. Anyhow I recommend this game."

,Recommended,404550,20597753,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Woke Santa,"I am going to start out by saying that this game has an amazing concept, good gameplay and fun game mechanics. And The graphics are pretty basic, but good for what they are. It still needs some streamlining, but  Overall, this game is definately worth buying, especially considering that it will be updated and improved from here.There are some issues i would like to go over to help the developer(s?) improve the game.First of all, very occasionally (i think it happened to me about twice in almost 4 hours of gameplay) jack will simply not appear. And while we are on the issue of bugs i found that after i used the tractor about half the time i wouldn't find all of the food in my inventory when going to trade with jack. Closing and then re-opening trade with jack seemed to fix this. I didn't check in my inventory before going to trade though.Second of all i understand that there are tools you can buy to collect natural resources (mining rock ect.) but even with the tractor i just couldn't find the time to do this with all the improving defences and whatnot to be done.Third of all, i had some issues with the hammer. I bought it because i made some mistakes in my defence plan but i found that it just took to long to destroy objects. Especially if you've started building with stronger materials. So rather than help improve my defences i just wasted a bunch of time and then gave up on trying. So i think that it definately needs to destroy things faster.Lastly, i think that the whole turret system could use some streamlining. Maybe it's just me but i found i had to fiddle around with them alot. Maybe you could do something to make the whole generator thing easier?As for ideas of things to put in the game, i think it would be cool to see something like a slime shooter that shoots a huge spray of slime that slows down any zombie it hits, and traps with a limited number of uses would be cool too. Like a pit trap, landmines, fire trap ect.And one more thing, i didn't do alot of testing for the shotgun but i found it to be pretty useless. I also just didn't use the grenade launcher at all because i heard that was useless too but i think thats going to be fixed. So yeah.also, just something i wanted to share with you all, i saw a guide to the game but it turned out to be a russian sausage recipe with an english translation. So, thats pretty wierd."

,Recommended,404550,20212351,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,kirabigpond.com,"This game has great potential but, there are a few things that could make this gaming experience a whole lot more enjoyable. Firstly the day should be twice as long for the players to perform the actions provided; mining rocks, chopping trees, placing defenses and more. One more thing i think this game could benefit from is more rounds that slowly become more difficult so the player has more time to adjust. Playing the game for myself I had these issues and it less fun then it could have been. This is just my opinion but, it would be great if an update could become available."

Cute idea, intuitive controls, and just enough mayhem to be really engaging.In future updates/releases I'd like to see much slower day/night cycles (or an option to adjust it, like difficulty), some sort of radar since its impossible to tell where the zombies are coming from without directional sound, and maybe a cursor highlight-object option so you can tell where your hoe/see/gun is pointed easier.  The crosshairs get lost easily.Buy the game!  Give them money!  Kill zombies and protect your chickens!"
,Recommended,404550,20260015,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Particle,"I have one word to describe this game: ADDICTIVE!As I write this review, I am exactly 100 minutes into the game, and this was all in one sitting. I thought I would stick around for half an hour, but i just got so involved straight away! There are so many features, and considering it is in early access I really want to see where it goes.The main way to describe the game would probably be a first person zombie shooter farming sim tower defense. At least, that's what i've got from it so far. The game just seems to have a perfect balance, meaning you feel like you have lived through hell when you survive a night. This is a true survival game. You always seem to have just enough money to build a decent wall, only to have it torn down by some zombie that wants your brain. It requires strategy, as you need to even your budget out between replacing plants that will inevitably have been devoured and destroyed by zeds at some point in the night. It is a great game.The art style is nice too. Like lots of games, they have gone for the blocky, Minecraft-esque aesthetic, but instead of being a carbon copy like other titles, they have created a unique environment of play. The days feel warm and bright in stark contrast to the nights which are dark and deadly. The zombies may not look intimidating from a distance, but when they are tearing at your flesh and your base is overrun, you learn to fear them pretty quick.Overall, the game is a good challenge and very enjoyable and addictive. I can't wait to see how the developers add to it in the future."
