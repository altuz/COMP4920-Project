If Stardock doesn't want to add more content, why not let the community?-Third Party system.-More customization parts. Seriously, this game doesn't have ANY new parts to make your characters!-Third Party system.-Some form of map editor maybe? Why not make a way to customize the money, population, electorial votes, ect, of all the states?-Third Party system.-Debates. How about a Debate system where every few turns or so, you and other candidates take turns not just making statements about different issues, but also engaging with each other on the issues? Perhaps each candidate could have another stat determining how well they can do in the debates.-Third Party system.-Primary elections anyone?-WHERE THE HECK IS THE THIRD PARTY SYSTEM?! The community has been asking for YEARS to add a way to make your own party, or just go independent, or something!Please Stardock hear our cries...EDIT 3/1/2016: I'd like to point out that none of my criticisms are a reflection of my political views. I'm purely saying what I think can improve this game."

Same *everything*. Stardock slapped a 2016 sticker on the previous game and decided to charge people $10 for it.A bit of history: TPM2008 was notable for bringing the series into 3D. It featured a mode where you'd face former presidents (from Nixon and Kennedy to Lincoln and Washington) to unlock more playable characters. It even had different election year scenarios, allowing players to run for President during the Civil War (among others) and to formulate a campaign to win voters during that time period. It was educational and fun. TPM2012 stripped away these modes, and only allowed players to run the 2012 campaign.TPM2016 is literally the same exact game as 2012. Swap out a few uneletectable presidential candidates and a few issues (instead of running on a platform based on reforming the economy, you'll be basing it on national security, the environment, or Black Lives Matter) and you have TPM2016.The same glitches are still there from previous versions. Every few games, I'm randomly blocked from using Political Capital (to hire more staffers). When attempting to select my veep, constant pop-up messages come up telling me that my opponent got endorsed by a political group. After a campaign is over and I'm reviewing the map one final time, music from the “results” screen and the “map” screen play at the same time. Bottom line: Glitches are fine and are to be expected, but not when the SAME glitches have been in your game series for over *eight years*. It's clear that the game hasn't been tested, or that Stardock just doesn't care.The voter demographics are still wonky too. Republicans can easily win Vermont, Connecticut, and Oregon (Dem strongholds), but rarely win New Hampshire (tossup state). Democrats can easily win Tennessee and West Virginia (GOP strongholds). Little things like that, turn what could be a (somewhat) educational game into a free-for-all with no redeeming values.As I previously said, this game is the same game as TPM2012, right down to the main menu and graphics. I couldn't imagine another strategy game (like Civilization) repackaging the same game every four years, changing a spreadsheet or two, and tossing it out into the market. Don't support Stardock and this lazy money grab.TL;DR: Avoid this game. If you are a political junkie, pick up TPM2008 off Amazon or eBay for a few bucks. There are guides online on how to mod the game to your liking. It's really easy to add more characters and modify the current-day issues. You'll get twice the game for half the price."

,Recommended,404620,19154873,"Posted: 18 November, 2015",all,Richard Nixon,"Pretty much the same as the last two, with updated candidates and an improved user interface. However, it's a pretty good game. It's much simpler than 270soft’s President Forever, which is now called President Infinity, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. President Infinity can feel bogged down; the game can sometimes feel like a chore, and little mistakes like barnstorming with low stamina in a key state can ruin you instantly (I’m looking at you, Ohio and Florida). TPM is quick and fun, but there are certain strategies which will assure victory on all but the highest of difficulty settings. After TPM 2012 came out, I was really hoping they would include primaries in this one, but I guess not. Where President Infinity is more realistic, TPM can be more fun. There’s no happy medium.If you’re a political junkie or *gasp* want an insight into how elections break down, I’d say that this game is definitely worth the asking price. The past version saw a small free expansion pack released partway through its lifecycle which added in historical candidates like Richard Nixon… I mean… me. Whereas that hasn’t been confirmed for this release, I have seen Marco Rubio pick Abraham Lincoln (an unplayable character right now) as his running mate, so I assume it’s coming.Pick it up and give it shot."

On top of that the game does not have primary debates, or presidential debates, the most exciting/significant aspect of the political season is simply omitted. Basically this game amounts to a low effort money generator for the developers."

There are some UI differences and the issues and candidates have changed, but its still not recommendable at this point (particularly if you've played the previous games). One area its weakest on is on the answers republican candidates have during interviews. Republicans have plenty of talking points they could be repeating (however correct those points are) but instead they get stuck with answers that don't fit the candidate at all. Answers need to be written so that they fit the candidate saying them (even if they are stupid answers).Other areas they could have improved (but didn't) from the previous game include- Your Running Mate: Your running mate is still useless. They can't hold any rallies or do anything more than what they did in the last game (give you more awareness in their state).- Radio: They've actually outright removed this. But didn't bother to replace it with anything so now you just have ""the ground game"" (very cheap with limited outreach) and TV.- Internet/Social Media: There is no internet/social media component to the game. Even though this has played a huge part in this election.Overall it seems like Stardock only put the absolute minimum amount of effort required into this release.Update: I just tried this game again. Apparently in March (many months after I had purchased this) they started offering old customers of the 2012 game with the much cheaper option to upgrade. Well great guys, only months late on that one.Then the company released a DLC that basically provides a minor number of improvements that frankly should have been in the base game.So basically its really disappointing to see Stardock drop the ball here.Update #2: Got an update today. The game still is very disappointing.

I'm not here to criticize this, as in my almost 20 hours this week of this game I have only found one pressing issue. I just want to give some suggestions to potentially better the game. Pretty fantastic idea, having custom characters btw.1. Add the option for a third-party candidate.Maybe create a conglomeration of parties for this? Libertarian, Green, and normal Independent. This could add an interesting and fun alternative to the normal process.2. Add debates! This would add such a fun and potentially game-changing aspect to the election cycle. You could put the option on the game setup screen, where you could set the number of debates from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of say, 6?3. I don't know how practical it would be so this is a tentative suggestion. Maybe add an option for a three-way election? Pit all three parties (assuming you add a third party) against each other! Or two of one party against one of another! Or three people from the same party! Just a cool thought, if you couldn't implement it that's understandable.4. Make the point system for issues better. This is my one issue with the game. When creating a custom character, there are 20+ issues that you only have 100 points to spread over. Maybe lessen issues, or add more points, or make it require less points to strongly be for or against an issue. It's not game-ruining, but it can get a bit frustrating when trying to truly customize a character.5. This is to potentially help diversify gameplay even more. Maybe, when you get the option to randomize issue importance, have a customize option? I'd understand if you don't allow games with customized issue importance to go on leaderboards or something (too easy to tailor issues for you to win) but I think it would add a cool element to elections. For example, I made an Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis character and have been trying to randomize issues to include Ending Human Trafficking, BlackLivesMatter, and Confederate Flag Display, or issues related to the civil war. Obviously, with the depth of issues in the game it's nearly impossible to get the election centered around exactly what I want, and it made me think of adding that kind of option.So that's it. I think this is an amazing game, and I'll be playing it a lot in the months to come. Hope my review and suggestions helped!9.5/10 stars from me"

76561197997311546,Not Recommended,404620,20567731,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,Khan of the Mind,"This game [EDIT: so far, see below] is a bare-bones reskin of the 2012 version, changing only the candidates and issues. The only gameplay chnage is the consolidation of ""radio"" and ""newspaper"" ads into a single categry called ""ground game,"" which is the only option for advertising besides television. Meanwhile, there are only about ten candidates to choose from on each side, almost all of whom are candidates actually running in 2016 (the exceptions are on the Democratic side: Bill Clinton, Al Franken, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren). This removes a major element of the fun of the games: the ahistorical match-ups. Could Barack Obama win a third term in 2016? Would Mitt Romney beat Hillary Clinton if he were running? This game can't answer these questions, though I assume it would have been easy to throw these characters in as well - they were already in previous games!That brings us to the problems with the game. Historical Candidates are listed as a feature on the Wiki, yet I do not have the ability to choose to play as any of them. However, I have seen both Lincoln and Nixon selected by the computer player as running mates. What gives? Most egregiously of all, when I have played online multiplayer with a friend, the games appear not to have been synched properly. We both thought that mismatches in polling between games (he had D's winning Iowa 48-45, I had R's winning 52-44) were a feature, albiet a lazy one. However, the synchronization carried over into the actual results! The game listed the results for three different states on the end map as being wins for the Democrats (one a substantial win), yet the game colored the state red and counted it toward the Republican total. Furthermore, both the winning player and losing player were each told that they had won the popular vote, and each game had a completely different vote count.In summary, this game clearly had little effort put into it, and I hope some free patches will be forthcoming to fix these issues. I would love to see patches re-adding the candidates from previous games as well, but that's just wishful thinking on my part.EDIT: The game is still in early access mode, so hopefully some of these features will be added and bugs will be tweaked before the finalized version."

,Recommended,404620,31367576,Posted: 25 April,all,The Arkham Knight,"I've been holding off to write a review for this game for a while. I wanted to get a complete review out, and now, 33 hours later, I feel like I'm finally ready to write a complete review. So, here it is. My review for The Political Machine 2016. Let me just clarify that I did not play The Political Machine 2012.Summary:The Political Machine 2016 is an election simulator made by Stardock Entertainment. In this game, you can simulate the presidential election with a variety of candidates. If you play your cards right, you can come out on top with all 50 states, or, if you utterly fail, you can end up being humiliated by your political rival. Whether you win or lose is entirely up to you.Candidates:Some of the candidates included are candidates in the early stages of the 2016 Presidential election. This includes Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders, and Ted Cruz. This is only a small amount of the candidates. There are also memorable politicians such as Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, Michelle Obama, and John Kerry. There are of course many more potential candidates than this, including some independents who barely agree with the party they are placed with(Gary Johnson is a Republican, and Michael Bloomberg is a Democrat). However, with the DLC, many more candidates are added, such as Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon. I won't spoil the rest, since part of the fun is finding out who the other candidates are. There are a total of 6 candidates to beat(and unlock) for each party.Game Mechanics:Once you start your campaign towards the White House, there are many things to need to do. You can upgrade your Campaign Headquarters to bring in more cash rather than fundraising(trust me, you'll need to fundraise either way. Campaign Headquarters only bring in about $90,000, which is tiny compared to the costs of ads.). You can also build Outreach centers, which help you get endorsement points. Endorsements are very important, and can change the whole election for the better or for the worse. The last building you can build is a Consulting Office. These help give you points to hire operatives, which are crucial to the game. Operatives can give you a strategic advantage in certain states(such as keeping the rising democrat ratings in California when you have awareness maxed out), and can help you secure a victory.The next mechanic in the game is ads. You can make Ground game ads, which are small ads promoting a certain view. They are extremely cheap, but very weak. If you want to get your views out there, you're gonna have to spend a lot more. This will let you place a TV ad, which can shift certain state demographics outside of the state you placed the ad in. TV ads are very useful, but very expensive. Use them wisely. The other extremely useful mechanic is the speech mechanic. Speeches can shift entire states, and allow you to turn that state towards your side, if your awareness is low. Be careful, however, since speeches in states with maxed out awareness can hurt you. The final crucial mechanic is fundraising. At some point in your campaign, you will lose money, in which case you will need to fundraise. In richer states, you can earn up to $450,000. This is a lot of money, when compared to the amount some less populated states will give you.Playability:This game is very fun. With the amount of variables such as Candidates and demographics, this will keep you very entertained. Also, with the campaign DLC, you could be spending a lot of time trying to get the really good characters. At some point, you will hit a wall, though. That is unfortunate about this game, since the first 10-20 hours are very fun(or even 30 hours in my case).Errors:While most of the time the game runs very smoothly, it does occasionally crash and freeze. I've seen many cases where I finish giving a speech, only to see the game run extremely slow, causing me to restart the game. And when the game restarts, it sets you back. It doesn't save where you left off, it set you back about 4 weeks. This is very annoying. Another issue is when a certain black box appears in the middle of the screen and breaks the game. Restart, setting the game back. This is by far the most annoying part of the game.Final Verdict:In the end, I'm very glad I bought this game. I feel like I got my money's worth. With all the candidates, and the possible creation of a custom candidate, this game is well worth the $9.99 price tag. The mechanics in the game are very smooth. While there are many glitches and crashes, and the game does hit a wall in terms of replayability, it was an overall fun experience. The Campaign DLC is worth it's price tag. In the end, I feel like this game was well worth the money I paid for it. With all factors considered, I'm going to give this game a final score of 84/100. I liked most of the game, however, I feel like Stardock could have done more to fix errors and put more things into the game. If they put those things in, this game is easily a 90/100. So, I leave you with that score and a lot to think about. If you are considering buying this game, understand that it may be not the most accurate, but it is certainly more fun than most political sims out there."

Reagan vs Mondale, the four-way that included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Eugene V Debs, or even further in the past with the likes of Jackson and co.), congressional elections and even other nations' elections (perhaps US-backed elections in Iraq or Afghanistan for example).Ultimately, in its present form, it belongs onaddictinggames.comor on the free-to-play part of Steam.

You can visit every state by plane and make speeches, create local and television ads, solidify the issues to attract voters, and orchestrate a strategy to win the White House.Pretty accurate to the electoral college system, despite D.C. not included with its 3 electoral votes. Ohio, the famous swing state today, is very spot on with its split-divisiveness among the voters in regard to who they want to pick for President. Florida, however, as the other important swing state seems to be much easier for Democrats to win and isn't too resemblant to how it swings today.The use of personal assets acquired from a point system called ""Political Capital"" are very amusing and satisfying to use in order to help your campaign. You could have an Advertisement Guru help reduce your ad costs or even a Spin Doctor to improve your ratings in a certain state. Or at the most dramatic, a Fixer to remove your opponent's assets. It's dirty but heck it sure is fun. You can also earn Endorsements to help raise awareness of your campaign and gain voter support.Unfortunately, the Green and Libertarian Parties aren't included in the races you can run, even with Jill Stein and Gary Johnson being in the game (the 2016 third-party candidates). In the DLC, the historical Federalist and Democratic-Republican Parties aren't in there either. So the issue here is it's strictly just the Republicans and Democrats running against each other and therefore lacks political diversity.But overall, it's a fun game of theory and American political fansy.

What with the whole Donald Trump scandal of last week, the game is becoming increasingly on-topic. Trump’s brutish and brash approach has shaken up the contest for the Republican nomination, and Bernie Sanders is doing a similar thing for the Democrats, by bringing the lingo of socialism back into US politics for the first time in decades. Next year’s election could be one of the most interesting we’ve ever seen.Indeed,The Political Machine 2016features most of the candidates on both sides, including Bernie Sanders and the now infamous Donald Trump, plus a few extra. Alternatively, you can create your own candidate – there’s a decent bit of variety in terms of customising your character with hats, hair and accessories. Having chosen your candidate as well as your opponent, it’s time to set out on the campaign trail.The game begins with a handful of states leaning towards either the Republicans or Democrats, although most states are still undecided, and thus up for grabs. The player travels across a map of the US, using political speeches and advertising to convince the population to vote for them. Speeches are cheap, but use up a candidate’s stamina quickly; advertising expends less stamina, but costs more money in the long term. Building campaign offices in each state can ensure a steady flow income, or can provide points each turn that can be spent on endorsements, which earn a nationwide boost for your campaign, or operatives.Operatives come in all shapes and sizes, and perform all manner of tasks. For example, a spin doctor will improve your ratings within a state, while a consultant will boost awareness of your campaign. Alternatively, you can use operatives to actively derail your opponent’s campaign. For example, an intimidator reduces awareness of their campaign within a state, while a fixer will remove an operative working for the other side.Each campaign lasts for a set number of turns, and at the very end the votes are counted, and whichever candidate has gained the most electors wins, becoming president-elect. The most exciting part of the game comes when the results are announced, and you get to watch each state turn either blue or red.6/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE |OKAY| GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

It's a goofy little election simulator. The game is much more fun with friends, though, especially if you're both being total goofballs, like my friend and I were.There are some minor nitpicks. Third parties might be a good addition, especially if it becomes more than a two-player game. It would be fun to take down both the Democrat and Republican parties as some party I made up. Also, it's possible to be screwed over by which topics are most relevant, although that might be to avoid blowout wins. (I only experienced this when I was doing much better than my opponent.) The biggest gripe, however, is that talk show appearances can blow up in your face, and it's not even your fault. Your candidate can say downright stupid things you didn't want them to say, and you have to say it because it's the only option you have. Some damage control would be nice, because currently I think it's better not to go on at all.All in all, I think it was money well spent, especially since I think I bought it on sale.

I can't stress how annoying it is to play on normal and get my head shoved up my @ss everytime I play. Most of it is realistic, except for how the states play. When I'm playing a campaign, there are states in every election that will always basically vote for your party like Kansas for Republican. In the game, there is a constant need to drive attention away from the battleground states, just to save a state like Texas from ever falling to the Democrats. Really, I see what they are doing in trying to add diversity, but it takes away the feel from fighting neck to neck in a state like Ohio or Pennsylvania. Instead, we are given an AI that will always convince natural conservative states easily by visiting them once or twice. I just don't feel the need to campaign in Oklahoma to regain the vote when there are swing states I need to win. Also, the game lacks diversity in terms of creativity. There is a limited character creation process that only includes a small amount of features; as well as creating your own party or running as an independent. Yes, the game is $10 and it is pretty decent for $10, but the game doesn't have much to offer than running against an Democrat AI who can somehow win Texas even though they always vote conservative IRL with little campaigning. Basically, the game lacks some balance issues with the AI and how the function of the states play out as well as creativity. I wouldn't recommend this game to others, due to the fact that I'd rather pay an extra $10 or $20 for the game if it was improved upon compared to what it is now. I hope this was helpful in your guide for trying to recreate the 2016 Presidential Election."

First action he took week one and two were to go to a political chance, he got unlucky both times, and they both drained all of his stamina (Time Waster), giving me two free weeks to take over any states I wanted.Week 4: I got Florida, Texas, and California in my back pocket during those three weeks I had to act. Not bad.Week 6: I got invited to go on The O'Malley Scenario. I went and I got a pretty good rating, which won me Wisconsin.Week 8: I have almost got the entire Southeast in my back pocket. Week 7 I pretty much finished Central US.Week 10: It's Running Mate time! I made a character some other guy who reviewed made (Polibot) so Credit to Him for that idea. But of course that is who I picked.Week 11: All hell is breaking loose. New York is a battleground of Politics. Vermont, taken by me, Pennsylvania, taken by me (by one speech!). I have him surrounded. New York will be mine.Week 15: It's been a while, but I got on 60 Seconds in week 13, it went really well. The whole Western US is mine. My power ever grows stronger, waiting to take New York.Week 18: I've done it! I did it! New York is finally mine!... Oh wait what's that? I still have to take Hawaii, Michigan and West Virgina to clean sweep? Crap.Week 21: Last week guys. I took West Virgina... However Bernie went to Michigan and gave a speech on Student Loan Reform and took it back right after I got it... if I say he was opposing it... Maybe I could take it back... OH... OH♥♥♥♥♥♥HAWAII!

I have been informed Bernie ran into another Time Waster rendering him useless to take back any states (West Virgina, Michigan, and Hawaii) he had a chance in.3 hours before Election: It's time guys..

For those of us who have played the previous Political Machine games, there is really nothing new here besides updated candidates and updated issues.The gameplay and the gameplay mechanics are solid, and they have been since the inception of this series.

While I think the interface was easy enough to use I wish it had a few functions like zooming in and out on some kind of button on the map. As for how the game plays it runs well but the one thing that drove me crazy was the newspaper popping up on me while the computer still moves I am stuck so I missed out on events I could have got if the game waited for me.The game itself is rather simple which while amusing makes it a bit harder to replay for me after a few rounds it feels like you more or less have done everything the game has to offer. I will need to try it again a few more times and maybe search around for some mods to see if I can get more out of it. All in all if you enjoy politices this game isnt all that bad and no matter how you look at it you can reform the US with sanders or you can make america great again with trump. Another little thing I really enjoyed about the game was the creation system to make a new person while it was a little hard to nav around it was amusing to see all the options.One thing I felt it was missing was random events which seemed to be really lacking unlike some other games I have played such as demoracy. Now while I understand this games goal is to elect someone and in demoracy the goal is to run the country I feel like some stuff could pass over to both games. I think one thing that would be nice would be to create your own plan on budgets and what not if elected. While I cant give much overview of the game due to my lack of political knowledge but as far as games go I felt like this was lacking a little.Even with all this being said so long as the price is right for you then I cant see why it wouldnt be a good idea to own this game even if it was only for a laugh.

Other than new candidates there is not much that is fresh and new about the game.  My main critique is that more nuances could be added to the actual campaigning process and less attention paid to how many different issues one could campaign on.  The endorsements seem to be almost non-consequential.  I feel like there should be more that have varying levels of effect and/or some that can be claimed by either party and have a positive effect for that candidate.  Further, the primary process and having independent candidates are a mainstay as what could be added.  Also, i'm on board with a presidental debate(s) which is a larger version of the interview questions.  Which leads me to my next point.  There needs to be some sort of way to see how the interview either hurts or helps the candidate.  Currently it just seems very abitrary.On the positive side, the interface is much improved and there a fewer glitches in gameplay.  The game is always enjoyable but it needs some new, fresh, and innovative ideas to keep me wanting to buy future versions.

,Recommended,404620,22912293,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Nootiful,"Top notch game and highly recommended. The new update of candidates is great - any game which allows for you to beat Trump as Nancy Pelosi is definitely a must buy.There are, however, a few recommendations to make it even better:1. Third Party Candidates/Parties/Run as Independent. This is spoke about quite a bit and would fully transform the game. It would obviously be brilliant as you wouldn't be forced into just a two party route, but more importantly it would be great online. Currently, it is far easier for Democrats to win than Republicans, which is not great for multiplayer as one person has a lot more good candidates to choose from than the other. This leads to point No.2...2. More Candidates! Now there has just been a great update, but the GOP side is still fairly weak (probably due to the necessary inclusion of the many 2016 candidates). Ideally there should be more ex-Presidents and ex-Presidential candidates from the past and far past, but really just some C20th ones will do e.g The Bushes, Reagan, Nixon, JFK, FDR. Maybe even include some First Ladies or notable VPs in there too, it would definitely add more range and keep the game dynamic.3. Set the Agenda. Now whilst this is a 2016 simulator, it would be great if you could set which issues you wanted to be the most important in the election (this would also help remove the bias against the GOP, as the Dems do far greater with Independents on issues such as Gay Marriage and Marijuana). Also, this would be great to simulate PAST elections (e.g Bush vs Gore, Obama vs McCain), which would be extremely fun and great for online play.4. Music. This is a minor issue, but sometimes the music loops poorly or barely loops at all.5. Workshop? Not as necessary as the ones above but the addition of the Workshop would be great to share Custom Candidates with other people. For example, fictional Presidents such as F.Underwood or real political figures that the creators of the game might not have time to make but the players could share. in fact, this could actually solve the need to spend time making new candidates all the time when really the public could make them.At the end of the day it's a great time and none of the above issues will stop me from playing it, they would just take it over the edge and turn it into an even greater game. You have until November guys!"

I love politics, and this is a great way to see how broken the election system really is. I spent my first few playthroughs as Dems, and my last few grinding out a few achievements.Pretty good game, but there are a few things I would love to see implemented1) More points for choosing issues depending on difficulty levels. If I'm playing on cakewalk I get the same amount of points to spend as if Im playing on the hardest difficulty setting. Maybe adding in a setting when building your candidate that may effect polling or something, but I would like to have more points to put into issues.2) Primaries. This may be coming or not, but it would be something I would love to see. The election by itself is great, but since we are in the primary stages right now I would love to run my candidate against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and see if I can win in the primaries, and then go up against Trump or Carson or whoever won the Republican primaries.Those were my main 2 issues with the game, the second one more than the first one. The first one is just an annoyance thing for me, because I spend all my points early and then I dont get to put as much into things I like, I usually end up with + or -10 on each issue. Overall a great game, would highly recommend for anybody who likes politics and hasn't played one of these games before."
,Recommended,404620,19341672,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Tito The Midget,"This game is fun and humorous, but also pretty basic at the moment. Given that it's Early Access, I expect more features to be implemented. I know multiplayer is on the horizon, and it seems like it'd be a fun way to kill an hour or two with a friend, since it has a board game type of feel to it.My wishlist for the full version:1. Some sort of primary season. It's probably a lot of work to incorporate the full primaries, but I think having some sort of national debates that behave similarly to the way the game handles media interviews would add another layer of fun to it. Maybe break it down into ""Early Primary States,"" ""Super Tuesday"" and ""The rest of the primary season"" as a way to avoid feeling dragged out. I just think it'd be fun to have to simulate a campaign against the other members of your party, then shift back to the center to win a general election. And really, the primaries are where candidates say the most outrageous things anyway.2. Related to the above, debates. The debates are among the most attention-grabbing parts of Presidential campaigns, but they're omitted entirely from this game.3. Slightly more interactive fundraisers. Right now, you just click ""fundraise"" and get some cash in your campaign. Something as simple as selecting ""Exclusive VIP fundraiser,"" ""grassroots fundraiser,"" etc. and then selecting the target demographic to make fundraising more dynamic than just ""Go to California if you're a Democrat, go to Texas if you're a Republican, click the button and get money."" At the moment it just feels more like a stamina bottleneck than a real mechanic.4. The ability to raise issues from your platform. Right now, you can only give speeches and create ads about the issues that are important to the state you're in. You start out with access to just the state's top 5 issues, and then that gradually expands as you build awareness and campaign infrastructure. It makes sense, but it also doesn't allow much of an opportunity to introduce niche issues to the campaign. In real life, Donald Trump made immigration a major issue, Bernie Sanders made income inequality a major issue, etc. In the game, if your candidate has a more niche issue in their platform you'll probably never get to actually give a speech or make an ad about it. If I want to create a candidate with ""fixing infrastructure"" as their main issue, it should be an uphill battle to make people care about that issue while my opponent is talking about things like Obamacare and unemployment, but in the current framework of the game it's virtually impossible to even talk about the issue until the very late game when you're not going to be able to build your campaign on it. Some of the issues that never come up aren't even particularly niche - things like global warming, Planned Parenthood/abortion rights and fighting ISIS rarely come up, but they're major issues of this campaign season.5. The ability to have your running mate do something. Right now, you just stash them in a state and they provide an awareness boost, basically making them just a beefed up consultant. Given that, choosing a running mate is pretty meaningless. In real life, running mates are used to balance the ticket - a more hardline candidate chooses a moderate running mate, a more moderate candidate chooses a hardline running mate, etc. A running mate should be a meaningful choice, and they should be able to bring some kind of boost to your campaign."

There's not a whole lot you can change in the series, though I think that the bobble heads are a bit worn out now, and there could have been better graphics in the design of your own candidate.  It's a bit cartoony the way it is... but it is what it is.I played 4 short games of 26 week turns.  I played them pretty much the same way to see what sort of results I would get.  3 of the games I ran as Republican and lost all 3 games by slim margins.  When I played the game as a Democrat it seemed to me that the states fell in line with the Democrats much more easily, i.e., the states would react more positively to a speech by the Democrat than by a Republican.Knowing how the electoral votes works is key, and you can of course campaign the big states of California, Texas, Florida and New York and then work some of the mid-west and southern votes.  Hawaii and Alaska are pretty much swing states, and it would not make much difference.A longer game could allow you to do better in terms of election, because with just 26 week turns you can only have enough time to focus on the larger states, and that's probably why the swing was more in favor of Democrats, so I will likely play longer games to see if longer strategies work better.Overall it is a fun game and worth the $20.  It would be great to see better graphics of the map and especially the candidates, perhaps be able to re-play in other past election years, create new parties would be an awesome improvement so you can run as Independent, Tea Party, Green or just make one up.  Lastly, I wish there was some way to add more issues to the game, and create a different political environment.  Perhaps an editor???   And it would be great to have a version that plays not the final election but getting the parties nomination with primaries, and other such features... IF that could happen you would have a truly awesome game, though now I'd give it a 6 out of 10."

A big issue is that the multiplayer is very innactive as I left it on for an hour then the game crashed. It seems very similar to the 2012 game but I never played it. It also has a few key people missing, like George Bush and George Bush, but that is why there are custom candidates. It does not seem accurate to real life but that does not really affect the game itself. Plus its very easy to mod."

You can make yourself like Donald Trump, or a super-mecha-death-Christ. The problem with it is, you can't customize your party. You can only choose either Republican or Democratic. Even candidates who are 3rd party that art running are shushed into other parties. For example, Gary Johnson, the front runner for the Libertarian party, is a Republic candidate.  Gary Hasn't been part of the Republican party since 2011."

As an example, say you're in Oregon, and you're a Democrat, but most of the population is Republican. While it might seem like a good idea to reduce gas prices because that benefits Democrat and Independant leaning voters, it is actually a much better idea to increase gas prices, a more Republican leaning option, as the Republican leaning voters will say ""Hey, these Democrat guys are actually pretty cool!"" and decide to become Democrat leaning voters.On an unrelated note, it is a sad, sad day for the world when Donald Trump becomes president (Good bye, Russia, China, South America, Canada, Africa, UK, Germany, Korea, and Japan.

On sale for two bucks and fifty cents, I couldn't resist goosing the economy and picking it up. For that price it is a fun little game.It is a turn based strategy game where you pick from existing candidates who are represented by bobble head dolls or create your own candidate. Once in the game you are presented with a map of the 50 states that shows the states who are locks for one party as either blue or red and the states still in play as grey. You can easily filter the map to show rich states for fund raising or take a look at the map by electoral college votes. Your candidates move between the states launching ads, giving speeches or establishing campaign headquarters.The headquarters are interesting as they come in three types. The traditional one is good for fundraising and increasing awareness of your candidate. The other types give you currency to get endorsements from say the gun lobby or operatives who can increase the effectiveness of your speeches or your advertising.There are also random events that can hurt or help your campaign. The most interesting of these is the chance to appear on national TV shows and answer two questions. The biggest missing item are any form of debate between the candidates and independent candidates. Still it is fun this time of year to pick from the various bobble headed candidates and try to win the voters over to your side.Quick, clever and fun this is a nice cheap game for those who like politics and light strategy.Rating: B-"

Because of the vast array of political figures whom you can play as makes the game feel much larger. Each election feels different, though they usually come down to who can win Pennsylvania, Floridia, and Michigan. It's cheap and allows you to run as candidates whom you want to see run for President (Ambassador Nikki Haley). It's a little simple at times: delivering speeches and paying for a few advertisements to win over a state, but perhaps that's how it actually is in America. All in all, it's a enjoyable game that is worth the price.10/10 would recommendMientras que este vídeo juego no es tan realista (Senador Rafael, Ted, Cruz ganó California contra Crooked Hillary), es muy divertido. Porque de la amplia gama de los figuras políticas quién puede jugar como hace este juego más grande. Cada elección le siente diferente, aunque usualmente es quién puede ganar Pennsylvania, Florida, y Michigan. Es barrato y le permite correr como candidatos a quienes quiere ver correr para Presidente (Embajadora Nikki Haley). A veces, es un poco sencillo: dando discursos y pagando para algunos anuncios para ganar un estado, pero quizás es tal como es en actualidad en los Estados Unidos. Considerándolo todo, es un vídeo juego agradable que es vale el precio.10/10 se lo recomiendo"

The best thing is when the campaign is over and the game goes state by state declaring winners. It creates a moment of drama, because you may not know if you won right away."

I think there should other party options such as a literal Green Party, an independent, or past parties such as the new terminated Socialist Part in some DLC. A DLC where it goes back to the Federalists or thw whig part would be interesting even thought the game is for modern situations."

Give option to run as a third party candidate. This would completely change the dynamic of the game and could potentially make it even more competitive.2. PLEASE ADD A PRIMARY MODE. It would be so fun to take your candidate throught the primaries and then eventually to the general election if you win. It would add more playing time a more of a randomization aspect to how the game plays out. If you were just to have a simple delegate system that would work in a certain way to where certain states are proportional and some winner take all or just make it all winner take all.3. Workshop support would make this game better because people could possibly come up with different maps or add custom candidates to the workshop.Overall its a really fun game if you like politics and live in America. Btw Trump is op.Edit: Trump isn't as op as he used to be but still op.

The game play can either be solo against a simulated computer opponent or the more random and challenging and frustrating human.  Elections in the United States are complicated and this game provided clear insights into the mechanics of a well executed campaign.  Players may choose from a variety of canidates each with an individualized yet historically based set of stance on various issues.   There are multiple tools, maps and news articles to keep gameplay even more challenging while the turn clock counts down before your opponent outsmarts your campaign."

New characters, new (DLC) play mode, tweaked features, same bugs. They are small bugs like not being able to select a character on the map, but in four years they could have fixed that. The game's a template that can be released with a few changes every four years, but come on. Bump it up to 10% new material.EDIT: There's a bug where your candidate becomes stupid after their first interview and only has access to the worst responces possible. Doesn't seem like it will ever be fixed. Ruins the replay value. They didn't change much in the engine after four years and they made one thing much worse. Changed vote to not reccomended."

Try to get it on sale for 5 euros like I did+- Feels like a flash game. Just me?"
