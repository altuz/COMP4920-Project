76561197976327138,Not Recommended,404640,22304269,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,becephalus,"I love how the game specifically instructs you that you don't need EVERY FEATURE in a game in the tutorial, and then releases a game development game so weighed down by useless features it is positively unplayable.Playing in the stock market, and decorating your home, and employee morale, but a lot of it doesn't really actually work, and setting vacation time?  I mean what kind of game is this exactly?Limit your scope, this might be very detailed, but it is not fun, and the interface of needing to navigate to different buildings and then navigate to some sub screen just to do anything is time consuming and annoying.Why do people keep making these strategy games with incredibly tedious ""theatre of the mind interfaces"".  It seems like a German thing, and it is atrocious.  Have a freaking responsive dropdown menu.EDIT AFTER MORE PLAYTIMEI tried to give the game a second chance since the developer responded to the review.  I still would not reccomend it.The tool tips and gameplay cues about what happens when you say advertise with your game, versus advertise for the company as a whole are not remotely clear.  The lack of save functionality is crippling in realtime game with poor and non customizable autopause features.  Trying to get the information about say what games are popular is on a totally different screen than the one that offer syou contract and it 3 or 4 clicks away.The whole bank makes little sense, the loan terms are all wrong.  You ae only charged interest once, it is not amortized.  So you can get a $100k loan for 1 year for a one time 7%, or over 25 years for a one time 30%...which do you think is a better deal?  Loans don't actually work that way.  A 1 year 7% loan indeed costs you ~$107k, but a 25 year 30% loan costs you $750k NOT $130.There is a good game here somewhere with a better interface and so more clear tool tips and fat cutting of needless features and more focus on the game development portion of game, but uggh what a chore to play right now."
,Not Recommended,404640,22306989,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Hisu,"Aside from launch/early access hiccups (audio language mismatch, missing text, etc), the control is abysmal: the interface requires you to constantly switch between rooms and needlessly navigate redundant menus. It also lacks necessary indicators (you have to go to development room, then to development menu to view development progress), there are no tips as on estimated effect (for example, on copy protection), and the overall gameplay is not only non-intuitive, but also redundant (like having to find a proper publisher for game GENRE, and there might be none at the time).All in all, it might be fixed somewhat, but I do not believe any major issues will be addressed, and thus do not advise to buy this game."
,Not Recommended,404640,22331880,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,mrmonsura,"This game has potential, but everything just looks bad and feels bad. It barely felt like I was making progress, even after the tutorial I was still confused (by the way the tutorial is pretty long, doesn't save your progress during it, and is ridiculously long.) The UI reminds me of a mid-90s mystery game.It's nice with the details and complexity, but just doesn't pull it off correctly.The biggest problem is the clutter and general unkemptness of it all. I make a game, but wait, I need to go to a completely different room to research things...ok did that, now lets start...oh wait, I don't have the necessary employees, lets go to a completely different building to hire people...Ok hired a graphic designer, programmer, and audio technician...can I make my game yet? Yes, but make sure you pick your console...ok PC, alright now lets wait for development...done, now lets pack your box.....erh wtf am I putting in the box (better remember that tutorial.)Finally, packed and ready to go, lets order it! Oh wait you need to get a publisher...after hunting for a publisher in every building (oh the lawyer got it.) Let's order!

That quote above is the entire review.  Since I wrote it, the developer convinced me to give the game a second chance.  Mostly because I didn't give the tutorials a chance.Sunlight Games: ""@NME Plays: You should try the tutorials...""Wait, that was the very first thing listed in my review above.  ""Awful tutorial""Sunlight Games: ""The game was 6 month in EA and got a lot of polishing. Did you play ALL 5 tutorial?""Fine, I'll play all 5 tutorial.  I went back and replayed them, but for reasons described and demonstrated in my video, I didn't learn anything from the tutorial.  I tried to restart the first one, but since I'd completed it, I guess the game thought I had mastered all the skills available in that tutorial, and wouldn't want a refresher course.  Oh well, I guess I'll just work on 2 through 5.  So I did.  I made it through 4 more tutorials, all of which were just as bad as the first.  I didn't learn anything.It took about 35 minutes to complete the remaining tutorials, at which point I was released to the world of Game Tycoon 2 to do as I please.  I choose a character, which I assume I'll never need to see again.  I pick a company name, NME something or other.  Then a company logo...I chose the H8 logo, because I H8 this game.Then, because I'm super confident in my skills from all the excellent information given to me by the tutorial, I choose hard mode and start my game.I lay out the groundwork for my game.  A brilliant piece of work.  Truly, a masterpiece of it's time.  It's called Bang!, and it's a shooter.  But it's not just any shooter.  This is 1980, we don't have fancy things like graphics.  It's a text based shooter.  I can clearly see this will be a hit.  Just imagine with me.../fire at grueSYNTAX ERROR/shoot grue>>You can't see <GRUE>, it's dark./shoot north>>You hit the <GRUE> in the leg.  <GRUE> Eats you.  You are dead.Thrilling, right!?  Now, don't go stealing my ideas or anything, because I've already filed the paperwork to make this a reality.So, we start developing Bang!, but I run in to a problem.  I don't have staff!  How dare I make the assumption that a beginning developer start their first game on their own.  No!  I need a programmer and a graphic artist.  I don't know why, because there are no graphics.  Maybe he's also a writer, because he's a creative type.  This is where the one point of realism I liked came in though, because I deliberately didn't want sound in my game, so I wasn't required to hire a sound guy.  Nice touch, 1 single point to Game Tycoon 2 for that.Now, let's go back to my office and watch the little Newton's cradle on my desk.  Yes, there is a semi-functioning Newton's cradle!  If you hover over it, the balls go back and forth.  Well, the ones on the end do anyway, the 3 in the middle just sit there transferring energy.  Lazy good for nothing...wait a minute.  Something is missing.  Apparently I wasn't the only one to not hire a sound guy, because Sunlight Games didn't bother to put that little clacking sound these things make in the game.  I'm taking back that point I gave you in the last paragraph.Finally, the time has come.  I made my game!  Bang!  It's here, it's done!  I rush over to the production and distribution area, where I design a box.  In the tutorial, I just went with the standard poor quality box, and it showed.  Man that thing was ugly.  Not for my pride and joy though.  Nothing but the best for Bang!.  I go with the Noble option.  Yeah, the scale is Normal, High Value, and Noble.Oh, I also skipped Copy Protection, because A. I don't believe in it, and B. it's 1980, what options were there?  A sticker that says ""Please do not make illegal copies of this software"" as the Simple option, and Complex is a copy of the music video ""Don't Copy That Floppy"" that is mandatory to watch every time you load the game.Back to production, we don't get an option for a manual, which is odd to me, since the developer of this game is really invested in making sure the player sees the tutorial.  Maybe all games just come with a built in guy that talks you through everything in an unintelligible language.I make 1,000 copies of the game, since that's the minimum, and I have no idea what the market is like.  I'll play it safe, assuming I can make more later, I just might miss a sales window if I have a hit.  I get my 1,000 games, and...are you kidding me?  This is Noble quality box making?  Not a single edge on this box is a straight line!  I'm all for artistic design here, but come on, be practical.  How is this supposed to sit on a shelf?  I guess consumers are forced to lay it on it's back.  Although, for all I know, the box isn't big enough for all the disks, and it starts to bow outward a bit.Well, let's get to business.  All this work is about to pay off.  Time to sell these games.  I need to determine a price.  Well, I vaguely remember it costing over $1.00 to manufacture each game, but I don't know if that price includes development costs or not.  Let's assume not.  I suppose $3.00 is a fair price to ask, but I want to make sure.  I'll just drive down to the local game store in the mall, and price check other games.I make it to the game store, which doesn't sell erotic games by the way.  They made a point of specifically mentioning that in the tutorial.  The only thing here is a list of hit games.  But because it's before any games have been released, it's empty.  Why does an entire store exist that doesn't sell anything yet?  I'm feeling my immersion start to fade.  Everything is falling apart and nothing makes sense in this world.  Just then, a black hole emerges from the empty game store, sucking everything into it, where I die and it's game over.Then I woke up, and I was still playing this game!  I angrily drive back to the distribution center, where I say screw it, sell it for $3 a game, I don't care.  But I don't have a distribution contract.  Now I have to drive to the lawyer, negotiate a contract, drive back, ship my game, and repeat the process.  When I make it to the lawyer though, there isn't anyone interested in distributing my game.  No one wants a text based first person shooter.  I guess there's a lesson to be learned there.Make sure a market exists for the game before you make it.  Because no matter how much you defend how great a game it is, if no one wants it, you've just wasted a bunch of time and money.To anyone who does like this game, fantastic!  I'm beyond thrilled that you found something in this world that brings you joy.  But for the general public, and those on the fence, and those who think this is a sequel to Game Dev Tycoon, I would advise against buying this game.  It's just not fun."

I made SURE the old game folder was deleted in Steam/common but when the tutorial pops up it started at #4 learning all about the marketing and PR department.INSTANTLY this character speaking Germish babble atarts to talk over the tutorial WHY WHY WHY??? What is the point of that??? WHY NOT JUST READ THE TUTORIAL TO US? Bad bad choice dev.You're looking at a nice big office with a nice big LED monitor and three other doors. Wait. LED monitor in 1980? Really? OK I'll go with it.Now comes the really disconcerting part after Babbling robot's voice stops, HIS LIPS KEEP MOVING. I let it sit for about five minutes and they kept moving like A ROBOT in a German PC game. He wants me to open the map and select the Law department. problem is WHERE IS THE MAP TO OPEN???Let's try M.M doesn't work. If I stop and go back it's just going to start here again, So it's click on everything time. Crap RIGHT clicking on the window doesn't bring up a map it brings up a view of the buildings around you AND NOTHING IS LABELED ANYWHERE. A big yellow arrow points at a building yay. But no labels.The next instructions ar ""After you pick a lawyer the publisher contracts are automatically displayed"". WAIT how much does a lawyer cost? WHY do I need a lawyer? Can't I self publish? This is not going well.From the arrow lawyers are on the ground floor. Figures, bottom feeders on the bottom. WAIT I DIDN'T PICK A LAWYER it immediately threw me into the publisher's area WTF???  ""Now select the tutorial-publisher contract and conclude it"" Conclude what? HOW?You click on ""sign"" the babling moron doesn't tell you that ""Jango krakenrobbins"" as he said. ""Since I ALREADY DEVELOPED A GAME""I did? OK lets just go with mr. babbling Germish.OK so a game was completed and I have to keep in mind deadlines and genres. Really? Deadlines? Shouldn't this be like kinda open ended? So a message pops up telling me I passed the game but when it disappears I can't recover it. Grrrrrrr. What is ""passed the game"" mean. grrrrrr.Now it's time to go to the ""map"" (window) and select the publicity? ooohh nice, money time. Wait, what? I can book campaigns booths of r  fairs and do interviews? WHY why not HIRE someone to do that???  Here's the problem, in this window there is no indication of how I get back to the map, none. Click bang time. Right click BELOW the window I'm in and another nondescript building is pointed to.WHEN MR. BABBLER STARTED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON ADVERTISING THAN ON THE CORE GAME I GAVE UP. This game is a nightmare. There's no continituity and the polish was done with corse sandpaper. Sunlight charges WAY WAY WAY too much for this game. Buy GameCorp DX for $5 by game dev tycoon, Gamers go makers, or Mad Games Tycoon but don't waste you money on this.End (I KNOW the dev will make a comment but this is the final review)"

(This is the sequal to the much older Game Tycoon)secondly this game is early access, you can expect the game to be unpolished, broken and to generaly not be super user friendly to start with (hence it's early access... you know unfinished)Thirdly given the background and limitaintions of this development team the translation is more than adequatefor what you need to know.now the slight bad bits i picked up on from my time on the game to date.Sadly the toutorials are a little broken from what i played and need alot of work.Customization also seems to be a little low on content.in short this review is made to dispell some of the people interested in this game. Its not game dev tycoon nor is it meant to be. what it is is an unfinished sequel to a game predating GDT with heaps of potential and a dedicated development team. certainly worth the investmont."

First off, before we get started, I wish to  apologize for my horrible spelling. I have trouble seeing due to poor eyesight.Anyway, we move onto the review of this product.First, I literally cannot follow the turtorial. They speak in simlish. That is fine for two office workers speaking to each other. However, simlish is not okay for convey information. I should not have to mute audio to understand a basic tutorialSecond, the menus are so repititve that I cannot navigate the interface. There are menus for the menus for the submenus; it goes on and one and one. For example, you take out a loan you need to click out of the ofticel; next you need to click on the map, which is in an corner, then you click on a bank, then you click on a loan officer to take out loans. These loans have such high interest and quick paydates, they were not worth work.Third, the graphics would be excellant when I started gamming back in 1999. However in 2017 these 2D graphics are like they came out of the late the 90s. Come on, 2D graphics are better these days and I expect better."

I would now say it is an enjoyable game to play. there is always some work you can do to improve but good job so far.

It can be a little tricky when you first start playing, but once you figure it out its a blast.  There are a lot of things to keep you busy while developing.  The strategy is  key.  I spend hours playing without realizing it.  At least until my wife let's me know :)More Detailed Review:The more updates they put out, the better this game gets.  There is a lot of strategy in planning your next contract to take on.Some games only require 29% quality, but you don't want your reputation to drop by putting out a low quality game, so you put your programmers to work and spend a little extra money on features to make it a good game.  However you didn't quite get the Difficulty right, so your quality is only 50% which gives you a rating of 35.  You spend a few thousand $ on advertising but no one is buying your game.  Quick, go accept another contract and try to do better.  Wait, my company reputation is getting low.  Need to go advertise my company before all my games tank out!Crap, 12:00am and I have to get up for work at 6:00am.  I will do better on my next contract when my brain has rested.  Goodnight ....Woke up at 5:00am, time for one more contract before work :)"

This game has the ability to be something spectacular, You probably have gone a little over board with the 3d graphics side of things, it reminds me about of simcity 3 map. I would personally prefer say crisp clean 2d graphics and a better game play engine. remember this is a simulation sandbox. the more 3d in it the heavier the gpu load.Plus by having 2d graphics you open the door to it running better on mobile device. Also you could implement a feature later on upon developing consoles that allow a infinite number of upgrades buy the upgrade and the cost just adding + 1 for the upgrade and + X amount + X for the cost."

However the mechanics added since then seem to have steadily help solve this slow problem. I still don't feel confident on being able to play a full playthrough or indulge myself into this until the game comes out 100% I don't want to judge it. When  it is full access I am sure that what the game developers have set up will mean that this game will be a good one, I just can't play it right now until I have the full game but I love the idea and hopefully they will see that through which is why I brought it and helped support the game developers."
