Firstly, it's a text-based adventure, with minimalistic graphics and a LOT of reading.  So if that doesn't sound like you, SKIP THIS STORE PAGE NOW.  Secondly, it's kind of an old-school ""dungeon"" explorer, complete with some nice pixel-y maps, but completely lacking in any stats or other regular ""RPG"" elements apart from an inventory.  Combat consists of nothing more than choosing to fight something, then you keep clicking on text messages until you or it dies.  THAT'S IT.  No stats, no combat tactics, JUST STORY.  Again, if this doesn't sound like something you can live with, LEAVE THIS STORE PAGE NOW.Phew.  Glad that's over.  Are they gone?!  Good.Now that it's just me and you, curious one, let me say straight up that whatever else this ""game"" is, it's extremely well-written and has a fascinating story.  This Nathan Meunier person could probably write books for a living.  And highly Lovecraftian books they would in all probability be.  Yep, he's one of those...but a very GOOD one of those.  The depth this game goes into about rituals and demon summoning and what-not suggests a first-class crackpot who either reads too many ""esoteric"" texts, or has a spiffingly good imagination.  This Book Is A Dungeon is short, but intriguing, and I certainly look forward to anything Mr Meunier gets up to in the future.A few suggestions to the dev/author for next time:  The price is a tad on the silly side (one or two dollars would be far more realistic); how about some MUSIC to further invoke that Eldritchean atmosphere; and thirdly, how about some save/checkpoints next time, as redoing bits over and over and over again does get a bit tiresome (especially when the text is so moodily staggered and can't be skipped, and so many bits of the game are so ruthlessly trial-and-error)?Fantastic first effort, though.  Keep up the good work, sir.Verdict: 8/10.(PS Some advice to budding players: Be sure to keep a pen and paper close at hand.  The game might keep a map for you, but you're gonna need to make plenty of notes, just the same!!!)"

The writing is superb and the whole atmosphere is very engaging: grim and macabre but it's varied enough not to take away my desire to explore.I liked the story, and the enviroment. The artworks are not the best, but they fit the theme and the game so perfectly, that it doesn't really matter. It does get a little repetitive a few times if you die and need to redo something, and the fights feel boring and unnecesary, but those are just minor annoyances."

,Recommended,404690,18441899,"Posted: 12 October, 2015",all,AtypicalChuck,This choose-your-own-adventure style Lovecraftian horror game is light on combat and puzzles but heavy on amazing storytelling and blood curdling imagery (via text).  The pixel art is spread out but top notch.  It is a huge throwback to older adventure games (Zork Zero comes to mind) I liked to play... but more accessable.The game has a ton of amazing detail work and is a true work of art.  The developer is still ironing our a few typos but all-in-all I am having a great time exploring all the awful ways to perish in this dark and cruel world he built. A+!
,Recommended,404690,28688761,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,~GSW~ JumpyJump,"TLDR: Thumbs up for the effort, while not necessarily for the game itself.This Book Is A Dungeon is essentially someone's first foray into video games. If you've ever written a game in Python, you can probably replicate this game with ease (sans the graphics.)It took me about 2 hours to complete, which, for 59 cents isn't all that bad of a deal. I would have finished it in an hour or less, were it not for the obligatory, unskippable retreading.As a game it's fairly primitive and that hurts its playability. It's a game of ""do the right thing in the right order or die and restart most of the game over from the beginning."" You test possiblities and try to decipher clues in the text but, like most text adventure games, it's just a matter of trial and error until you win.To underscore just how simple the game is:-There are no save states.-There is exactly one very, very basic RPG-style combat in the whole game. Which seems impossible to lose.-There are no sound effects.-There is no music.-No animation aside from the text.-There is no way to skip ahead through obligatory pauses in the text, which is kind of obnoxious. The deliberate pauses work the first time, but every time after you find yourself wishing the dev had put in the time to just code ""Hit space bar, go to the next line of text.""The writing is probably the strongest part of it. So if you like dank, mysterious, Cthulhu-esqe magical storylines, it was done competently enough. If the writing had been attached to a more robust game it would have made for a better product. As it is, TBiaD is one notch above a straight text adventure from the 80s, and only because of the (fairly basic) graphics.So, while I can't honestly recommend the game due to its simplicity, I liked the theme enough and respect it as a first attempt at game making that I'll give it a thumbs up.What should you pay for it if you were going to get it? As little as possible (sorry dev.)While I'd like to say ""Yeah, pay the dev's full asking price so they can continue to work on games and improve"", there's just not enough meat on its bones to justify anything but bottom dollar. The dev put a minimal amount of effort into the actual game side of it, beyond the pixel art, and that makes it hard to argue for paying what they're asking.Still, if the dev can take what they learned here and turn out a better, richer game experience next time, I'm happy to have my money help them along on that quest. The game clearly has a soul and isn't shovelware, so, that's gotta be worthing something."

,Recommended,404690,25369664,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Erbkaiser,"This Book is a Dungeon is essentially a choose-your-own-adventure game in a horror setting, but it has some rogue-lite elements as well.Everything is done through text with occasional graphics for enemies and other special encounters, and a dynamically updating map as you proceed through the game.It is also very difficult and unfairly so: there are multiple instant kill choice results, so you have to replay to learn to avoid those. Making this a little more interesting is that there appears to be some randomization going on, sometimes an alcove will contain a monster, sometimes the same alcove will contain something else instead.I bought this on a whim based on the cyoa tag, and I'm not disappointed. Excellent writing and good gameplay, good enough that even though I rage at the unfair deaths, I keep playing."

It could be finished in a half hour if it didn't reset back to the start with every loss. Resetting so far is a real loss, its hard to be engrossed when you spend a minute or two clicking through pages you had already read, some of which move at their own dramatic pace. Its something you would probably find interesting and appreciate when its free on a site, but if you plan to buy it I would wait until its a price your willing to pay for an hour or less of your time."

The story is brilliantly Lovecraftian and engrossing, particullary the work that went into the collections of books and tomes in the library section. My only qualms are that firstly the fact that you had to complete each painting in sequence without any form of checkpoint, is very frustrating, and I think it was to the detriment of the imersive story, as it required me to repeat sections by flashing through the choices to finish it. Secondly the one piece of combat in the game seemed absolutely arbitrary as it was seemingly unfailable, would of loved to of seen better use of a combat system or for it to be left out completely, or solely conducted through choice and consequence, as with the Avian creature in the first dungeon. Alltogether though I enjoyed this game and I would love to see a sequel as well as other creators making this kind of game."

It's a horror text-based game, so don't expect anything else than having to read a lot to advance in this game.I didn't like this game that much, but it obviously has some good points. By not having a lot a visual content, it makes you imagine the action, and this works very well for this game. The author writes pretty well, so it's easy to read and to imagine what's going on.Also, don't imagine to go in this dungeon and survive on the first go; that won't happen. You will die more time than you can remember. But this is the way that this game is supposed to be played: you will die in very differents ways and the descriptions make it fun to die. Really. It's not frustrating to die, at least, not in this game.The negative side of dying a lot is to have to start from one of the few points you can start from and having to pass through the same text again... and again.So if you know what this game is about and it appeals to you, give it a go. But don't expect to play it for long, it's a very short, but entertaining game."

There's no saves or the ability to speed through text so if you die, you must go through the whole chapter again and click click click click. This is especially annoying when you have to do 3 chapters correctly in one go. Do two chapters right then fail the last one- you must do the ones you already passed again. Some of the choices feel more like guessing than using logic."

Atmospheric, twisted, and fiendish in all the ways it seeks to kill you.I do wish it was longer, but I've been replaying to see the various ways I can meet my end. Give it a try and see what horrible fate awaits you."
76561198029904609,Recommended,404690,24652371,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,bear_storm,"This is incredibly atmospheric, if still needing a little polish.TBIAD is a choose-your-own-adventure in the style of classics like Hell House, where the choices you make are more about trail and error and embracing the game's own fever-dream logic than trying to do the practical thing in a given circumstance. That would be frustrating in a less well-written project, but the narrative in TBIAD is solid. It pulls you along with a sense of immediacy and dread that I haven't felt from a game in quite a while.There are a few convenience options to make up for the instadeath lurking around every corridor. You can skip the intro and restart the game, which is nice, but there's nothing yet to speed up the pauses between lines of dialog - which are ominous at first and then annoying the second time you have to deal with them. By a similar token, some deaths take quite a while to unfold, to the point where it's quicker to exit and restart the game than to wait through them. These make it difficult to play longer sessions of TBIAD, which is a shame. This game is ought to be immersive.Good news, though. This project is not complete yet. My review may be swiftly outdated as new features and content are added, and I suspect the game will only improve.For the moment, it is as brutal, gripping, and intense an experience as I've ever gotten from a visual novel, and I'd urge anyone who doesn't mind long waits and lots of words to wade into it."
,Recommended,404690,34223927,Posted: 13 August,all,Tablis,"The writing is decent. It managed to disturb me at times, which is not easy. It's a bit less subtle, less refined and Lovecraftian than I anticipated it to be and instead more in the direction of in-your-face gore and horror. But it works.The most disappointing thing is perhaps how quickly immersion is lost. The first attempt is atmospheric, but only the first. There are plenty of ways in which to die while learning the choices by trial and error, and having to click through so very many paragraphs of text over and over again replaces fear with indifference. Also there are no RPG elements or meaningful combat whatsoever, despite what one of the screenshots might suggest. This is entirely a ""choose your adventure"" type of game.So is it worth getting? Yes, but only at a discount; it's somewhat short. You'll need a good grasp of English to fully enjoy the descriptions. And if you're the type that's particularly squeamish about the occult and demonic, this is definitely not for you."

It's a gruesome tale of misfortune that has a lot of subtle commentary about human nature (See: Chapter 4). It's mainly text based, but there is still a fair amount of well-created pixel art which adds to the style and the nostalgia factor of the game. The writing is fantastically done, with great atmosphere, characters, and creative concepts throughout. Not only does the game do this, but keeps it going consistently from start to finish. All of this causes it to stand out as a very unique game, and the overall vibe it gave off drew me to it instantly.In short,This Book Is A Dungeonis a unique game with a distinct style, gruesome storytelling, a great atmosphere, and some fantastically creative ideas.

However, I can see that this game is mearly the start of a larger project or it is simply the basics for more content related to the game. It's generally short for a game but it completely makes up for that with it's sense of style and the immersion within the game. The game does have its shortcomings, such as a stupidly simplistic combat scenario that was thrown in there and the fact that there are no saves to speak of, meaning that you'll have to redo everything upon death, which WILL happen. This is partially solved by being able to skip to certain main areas within the game and bypass all the tedious clicking, however. The game overall gives much more than it looks to possess and can easily be expanded on.It's short, simple, and delivers a whole world to the player.

I played through it a couple times and it took me about two hours to read through everything and solve the puzzles, but after you know what you're doing you can breeze through it.There is only one thing I don't like about the game: there is one random encounter in the game, just one. It doesn't really fit the rest of the point and click style. The combat isn't even fleshed out either, all it amounts to is clicking attack until you or the monster drops dead and it drags on just a little too long.

My partner came over and we played it together and were laughing our asses off at how completely childish it is.If you're looking for a good text-based adventure, stick to something like Zork, or HGTTG, which were actually decently written. If, on the other hand, you want something that will make you cringe, I suppose this might work."

,Recommended,404690,33255721,Posted: 4 July,all,Kiwibot,"This is a pretty decent game with lots of wonderfully grim and gory elements. Loved all of that. All the creative elements kept me playing, I wanted to see more, to learn more about this dark, creepy world.With that said, the countless deaths I had to suffer through meant I had to reply the same parts OVER and OVER, so many times. Especially that one room. You know the one. A checkpoint system would've been great, and fairly easy to implement since this is a Twine game. The battle system was kind of boring as well, but at least the enemies were interesting, and there aren't that many fights in the game.But even though I had to reread parts several times over, it was still a pretty short game, it didn't have time to get frustrating, and it's still definitely worth your time, just for the bloody, fleshy creatures and things you find in it."

I really liked the art in the game, it's one of the things that originally caught my interest. My biggest complaint is the lack of a proper save system, so if you die you have to play through alot of your progress to get back to where you were. Despite this I did play again to get all endings, which I don't usually do but with this game I felt compelled to. A short game I definitely recommend, especially if it's on sale."

,Recommended,404690,34801996,Posted: 7 September,all,Monsterberry,"I'm hesitant to recommend this because I'm a fan of Interactive Fiction and what I played of it was very entertaining but what killed it for me was the lack of a checkpoint system or savestates. There were a lot of amusing, well written death scenes that I'd have to replay whole swaths of the game to get to. Still, it's very imaginative, moody, gory (always a plus) and atmospheric, and it really did stick with me enough to remember it almost a year later."

Not enough content for the five dollars paid, wasn't fleshed out enough, and is a mediocre story. If it was fleshed out with more content and story, i would reccomend it. But as it stands it seems like a game in early access, not worth five dollars. 5/10"
