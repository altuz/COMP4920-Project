,Recommended,404700,20835766,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,iddqd,"This game is marketed as ""Snake with a twist"" - which is the most correct definition possibkle. Instead of moving vertically and horizontally, you are moving circular. This makes for an interesting game experience.Also, the dev is a cool guy who listens to feedback and solves your issues, so that's a big plus. :)"

All moves are made in curves.Simple observations aside, this game is one of the very few under 1$ games i'd ever recomend. It's a fun time killer with a casual feel but with time or circumstance becomes quite difficult.If you like retro games like snake- give it a try.If you like to kill time between Queue on annother game and need a finger warm-up- give it a try.If you like to show off to your friends how good you are at clicking better than them in multiplayer- well give it a try. but i hope you are ready to loose friends.I'd give it a try/10... you may like it."

76561198357900966,Recommended,404700,30784711,Posted: 27 March,all,pixcalibur123,"This plays a bit trickier than the normal Snake where you moved in straight lines.  The curves can throw you off a bit, especially when you always seem to move around the target.  Good thing for the slow speed option, as some of the levels are pretty bad at normal speed given you have to make really fine movements.  Does feel satisfying when you get past a hard level."

I use to like snake game decades ago but for me this type of gameplay hasn't aged well for me.But that isn't the games fault, I simply fine the game to be too frustrating to be much fun for long. Good for what it is though."

I love this game so much, I am puting it under my game Collections. Thank You so much, for making this game for other people like me and these other people who had put maps on to the workshop. I am puting this as my 2nd place game of collection, so this is my game collection list:1 Pinball Arcade2 Curvatron3 Five Nights At Freddy's 1, 2, 3, 4, and Sister Location"

It's the equivalent to making a puzzle platformer where you can only walk backwards. Beautiful, but not particularly fun."
