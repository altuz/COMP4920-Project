Twitch integration works wonderfly, even unlocks some cards and titles for you and allows the chats of any player involved to vote in the round. Only drawback for me is that camera is turned on by default."

At the moment it is difficult to find games as someone who lives in the UK. Some advice I have been given is to ensure 'Enable Mature Content' is ticked.I would suggest to, at the moment, only buy if you have friends that play too, or are willing to buy.The game has just launched for a relatively good price yet ever since I bought it yesterday I have still been unable to find a game to join. I will try once more in a few hours and if the same thing prevails I will get a refund as this is essentially unplayable if you don't have friends to play with. Shame because it's a really nice concept."

This definitely still needs a battle royale mode and the ability to extend the time as long as wanted. Also, if one person gets the DLC the other people shouldn't need to do that also. In real life, if one person has all the decks, people can play off of him/her, and it should work that way here too. Lastly, unlocking cards is ridiculous. We're already paying to buy the deck, there should be absolutely no reason to have to unlock them once they're already purchased. You don't have to unlock it in real life and you shouldn't have to do that here."

76561198000096248,Recommended,404770,24449340,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,KeV,"Now Superfight is a game about arguments. You create a character by choosing cards from your hand aswell as one random card. Combos can look like this:George W. Bush with Laser Eyes riding a hot air balloonorHelen Keller armed with a harpoon gun riding a hoverboard.In addition you get location and event cards (that can be turned on and off when you create a lobby in-game) that further add randomness to your arguments. E.g. the above characters are fighting in heaven during a kitten stampede. And here comes the kicker: You now argue with your opponent who would win in a fight.As an owner of the physical game, i was interested in the game once i realized an online version was in the works, but i didn't participate in the betas at all. So after purchasing it today i went in blind.First of all, the download size is rather small. It was around 170-180mb until it was done. And that reflects when you open the game. You have several options:Fight, where you can join or create lobbiesSpectate which shows Twitch streams for you to watch and vote on (Requires Adobe Flash and even though i have it installed it asked me to download. Still works though, if you click cancel)Card Collection: All the decks and cards you ownStore: Just gets you to the DLC Store on SteamAnd for some people there's the big elephant in the room. DLC. You can purchase extra decks for 4,99€ (or regional equivalent) that add new cards from e.g. Walking Dead or R-Rated Cards. They are optional cards, since the game already has a boatload of cards and while i bought one of the DLCs, it was a nice mix between the core-cards and the DLC cards.Theres also an options menu which is rather slim, but it's enough for Superfight. Two sound options for Music and SFX, a Mature Content Filter, tutorial tips, fullscreen and resolution. And now come the two options that i was afraid of: Webcam and Mic. Superfight REQUIRES a microphone so you can argue with your opponent. A webcam is optional. I was afraid it would be clunky and make issues, but it worked like a charm. My mic and webcam were instantly recognized and the quality was fine.So i searched for a game and got into my first lobby. Nobody had a webcam on so you are greeted by their steam profile pictures. The sound was really good and i played with two americans and one belgian guy. Round was alot of fun and enjoyable.You choose your cards and once chosen your cards are on opposing sides in a standoff. You have two minutes to plead your case and then the other players choose who would win. If it happens to be a tie, a random spin decides who wins. And this is wheree twitch comes in. You can stream your game on Twitch and your viewers are able to vote on the argument winner alongside the players. It's delightful to see the loser of the argument/his cards get burned, ripped to shreds or trampled, since the animations look really nice.I have a few little issues with Superfight though at this time:1. No rematch buttonOnce the round is done, you can only choose Exit, which sends you back to the mainmenu. This is a little thing, but if you play with strangers and it works well, a rematch button would be obvious.On a different note, a friend and i got into a round with one of the producers (who's currently at Comic-Con, HI SUMO!) and he said this would be in the works and there will be a content update next week.2. The dangers of insecurity and webcamsThis isn't a problem with the game per se, but with the community. Earlier on i watched a stream where several (by the sound of their voices) kids made fun of a large kid that dared to turn on his webcam and it made me sick. This kid embraced the game mechanic of turning on his webcam, only to get ridiculed by as*****. There needs to be a serious amount of moderation, since the internet can be a screwed up place. Methods to reporting such behaviour need to be there and taken seriously.So after 2 hours i can say: Superfight is a well-working title that has alot of potential to become a twitch highlight game. Rounds aren't long, but offer alot of fun for a low price. Wholeheartedly recommended"

It's like cards against humanity, but instead of just randomly choosing the judge of each round chooses, it's about who would win in a fight. the fun of it is arguing complete stangers on rediculous topics like who would win, for example: Jesus with Laser Eyes who has to scream out his attacks before using them or Ryan Renolds assisted by a sniper riding a battle cat. All of this is taking place in a canadian hurricane. You've got 2 minutes to argue and then the other player vote as well as Twitch viewers. It's a good time, It's social, hilarious and really not that expensive. It's worth the 9.99 and there are probably going to be TONS of DLC decks coming out. I bought the 5 that are out right now for 14.99, and i've really liked some of the added cards.The game will be better once more people buy it and start playing, so jump on and let's SUPERFIGHT!"
,Not Recommended,404770,27645046,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Kuronare,"Superfight is an enjoyable and addicting cardgame with two colossal imperfections: a lack of players, and the incessant stream of downloadable content. I love the game. It was fun when I had the chance to play it during beta and early release. But now it's a ghost town.While not game breaking, releasing five dollar packs - to what was an already strained community - damaged the game more than it did benefit. By actively swaying potential customers, you unintentially killed the game with the periodic release of paid content, which ultimately has culminated into a fifty dollar bundle. For a game that isn't even six months old, ridiculous.As for the second, and the biggest fault, the active user install base. I would otherwise recommend this game if not for the sole reason that no one plays it. As of writing this review, I have been waiting in the single lobby, by myself, for a little under an hour. No one has joined, and I except no one will. If I were playing during peek hours, maybe there would be a few participating lobbies.I sincerely hope that the game can make some sort of comeback. Either through going free to play, or by launching a large advertisement plan to entice unaware buyers, or both.If you're willing to take the plung, I highly suggest you bring in with you friends. Else, you will find the game sorely lacking."

It seems that it would be easy to implement a Mac version of the game, since I've seen bigger games have a Mac counterpart. Still a good game though!Wish it would get some more love :("

A week after release and player numbers are 10 or less every single day.  On Twitch the most people I saw viewing were less than 10 people across 4 streams including mine.

I had to restart the game multiple times between rounds because it would get stuck ""connecting"" after I was already live.

I picked it up for like $1.5 (in my currency it was 14kr, NOK) and bought it for a couple of friends. The amount of fun arguments you have to come up with in this game is amazing. Superfight has the same problem that Cards Against Humanity has, which is that the cards and combinations can get old over time, which is why I think a workshop would be great for the game. If it gets old and boring though, just not playing it for a couple of weeks or months usually helps.There's a physical version which will make the game a lot more fun, but if you can't afford it or it's not available in your county then this is a nice substitute."
