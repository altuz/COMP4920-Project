The keys are simple yet it is quite hard to combine a few normal steps together :).I myself bought the game because I have seen it in this video ->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh5031UIt2sand I don't regret it. I will play it more when I have friends at home, funny things are bound to happen."

I said it in my review below along with other points, but if you screw up your race 9/10 times, the 1 time you get it right...it just feels so great.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9dMcUox8lUThe only con I have is the tutorial should instead give you feedback per your step. If I press the button too early by a millisecond it ruins the continuity of learning by making me fix the mistake.The daily challenge is sweet, the levels are perfect, I would just want more events eventually!Great job!"

It's fun as hell and it has a quite nice learning curve.I do admit that this game has already made me frustrated couple of times, but in a good way...unlike QWOP.Alright; lets get to the actual game:As the title of the game says, this is most of all a running game where you have to press andrelease buttons with right  timing to make your athlete move properly. The game itself hasvarious running distances for you to compete on and it also has jumping sports in it as well.Unlike in QWOP; in Ragdoll Runners you can actually move FORWARD...without FLIPS.The game has online best times list and you can compare your times withyour friends on steam as well... AND...the best part:LOCAL SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER (up to 4 playes I think)!!!!!!PS. no online MP [atleast atm]If you have the gamepads and you know that you have friends coming over,then on less than 5e price...THIS IS THE MUST BUY GAME !Pros:- Splitscreen multiplayer- Good learning curve- Cheap- Fun as hellCons:- Skipping work to play- Playing at work- Beating your boss on the game on worktime making him mad10/10 - Would get boss mad again"

,Recommended,404820,25570220,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,TheKryl,"This game is hilarious. It also frustrates me in a way that few other games have ever done before.If you've ever played QWOP and thought ""you know what this game needs? Multiple athletic events"", then this is the game for you, you sick, twisted, so and so.In all seriousness, I highly rate this game, it's a lot of fun, makes you constantly keep saying ""one more try"" and lets you backflip and wiggle like a fish out of water. 10/10."

But learning this game is actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be. I'm not quite there yet but there is definitely a nice feel to the physics and controls. Although it can be fun watching you crawl over the track like a baby seal the game invites you to master the skills and improve your records. Having the masterboards adds a bit to the challenge.5 euro's is not cheap, but I think a fair price. I think this game has potential for something a bit bigger and more polished, but for now I'm enjoying it quite a bit, as I said it is more fun than I expected."

The game has very nice graphics and also amazing background noises which change depending on how you play.I never disliked the game and sometimes I come and play when there is nothing else to play.I have made games myself and published them on some sites and I know what it's like to get negative feedback from some asshat saying that ''jm viking is a tryhard hurr durr'' so thats why i decided to make an actual honest review"

76561198014895731,Recommended,404820,33617351,Posted: 17 July,all,methodik,"Fun little game to play solo, brilliant game to play local split screen.The mechanics are rather basic in theory: You assign a button to both of your characters legs and one to lean forward. Each time you press a leg button, it causes that leg to push backwards, each time you let up it swings the leg forwards. The trick is timing - you'll have to learn exactly when to push and when to let go, in order to efficiently move your runner forward. Holding the button a bit longer results in more air being added to your stride, which then allows you to jump as well.It's not easy however - missing your step or flubbing your timing will often result in your runner doing humorous flips and faceplants, gamely still trying to move forward as you desperately mash buttons which rarely have a positive result.When playing solo, the game allows you to instantly reset, making such errors rather painless.When playing split screen with others, those failures become simply part of the fun. Particularly when someone is in the lead, only to mess up 10 meters away from the finish and start frantically pounding buttons while shouting NOOOOOOOO, with their poor runner doing an Olympic version of the worm as they try and make those last... few... steps... Absolutely hilarious!Overall, very enjoyable and well worth the punt of a few dollars."
