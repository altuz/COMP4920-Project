,Not Recommended,405180,18194361,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,Laze Dybo,"Game seems to lack any real atmosphere at all and overly feels rather cheap in it's deaths. Obviously pandering to the FNAF crowd [which I just so happen to be part of], what appears to be a rather unique and quirky little horror game is actually quite the monotonus and eventually pretty dull experience. What ruins it for me is the flashlight. You have to mash your space bar in order to get it to work sometimes, which again, sounds like a great idea. But it will end up causing you to game over as you fall victim to the Molestation Goat and his numerous buddies as you couldn't flash him in time. It feels like a genuine attempt to cause the player to panic which would help add tension, but it's just straight up infuriating. Even more so when you have to keep the flashlight on when exiting a level.Unlike most horror games, there's no real build up, no tension and the jumpscares end up becoming a genuine annoyance after the first initial few. They really lose their impact very quickly. Even the plot almost seems non-existant and is presented to us in some rather crude Max Payne-style comic book panels.Game looks nice enough and is marketed pretty well on it's store page, but once you get into it, it's just a rather dull experience sadly. Shame really, as it looked like it had great potential."

There is a very noticeable delay between pressing a button and the response which, in a game that asks you to be making split-second reactions, is beyond frustrating. The flashlight is intentionally bad, coming on and off at complete random when you try to use it, which is another deeply awful idea that forces you to hobble along on, hammering the space bar relentlessly to stun enemies.Jump scares are the only terrors to be found here and they wear old quickly after the first two. You are essentially walking down a corridor while the game randomly blasts you with obnoxiously loud game over screens. Not for me, thanks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkY1QIMwOjQ"
76561198238033162,Recommended,405180,29531474,Posted: 27 January,all,Levelsword4,"Honestly, I do reccomend this game for the type of person who likes short and quirky horror games. Though there are a few problems I have with the game.Pros:- I like the monster desgins and the ideas- Nice atmosphere- Pretty nice gameplay overall- I love the idea of T.V Show puppets coming to life (Unlike FNaF with the animatronics). Puppets have always creeped me out and the idea of adding them to a horror game is a great ideaCons:- Sometimes the flashlight doesn't work when you need it to, and that's pretty annoying- Pretty short game. Would expect it from i kind of game that's $2.99, not $7.99- As I said, the idea of the gameplay is nice, but it get's repetetive quickly- Graphics are meh-Jumpscares get oldNow I put that I reccomend this game because I enjoyed it. Now if you don't like the idea of the game, I would give it a NO. There's no MIXED option for steam so I ulimately put it as a YES."

I do, however, appreciate the departure from the hundreds of generic FNaF's knock-offs with this lane defense style game though.Seriously though, with a little tightening, this could be something a little more than generic rage inducing title guised as a Sesame Street knock off with no real character spoofs except the greeter (Big Bird).

76561198048974498,Not Recommended,405180,18218222,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,rjmacready,"Well well well, as if there weren't already enough Five Nights at Freddy's games in existence, someone inevitably came up with the genius idea of trying to kick-start their own ""rival"" franchise.  They seem to have overlooked two trifling little facts in their quest to become the next Scott Cawthon, however:  Firstly, there is generally only so much room in any given market for a glut of similar product, and secondly, Scott Cawthon, for all his flaws, is actually one very clever mother-♥♥♥♥er.  I'm not convinced the makers of this game are QUITE so clever, though I will certainly acknowledge that they appear to be by no means fully ""incompetent"".  Perhaps ""misguided"" would be a better word..?Let's examine what this game does ""wrong"", as opposed to what the first three (haven't played the fourth yet) Freddy's games do ""right"".  Firstly, there's no story or context here.  Well, okay, there's a tiny bit, but only if you read the Steam page and/or are able to make heads-or-tails of the brief comic strip-style series of images which precedes the menu screen (which I kinda doubt you could, had you not read the Steam page first)!  Following an admittedly well-executed if completely danger-free stand-alone tutorial, my first foray into the game proper ended within SECONDS, as one of the muppet-y antagonists snuck up on me from some-angle-or-other, and a quick 'n' nasty jump scare later, it's ""Game Over"".  Unlike Freddy's, there was no foreshadowing that this would happen, no sound that I am aware of that indicated I was in any danger...nothing.  The next time around I thought to use the quick turn-around button, and sure enough there it was behind me, but no amount of shining my flashlight on it seemed to encourage it to♥♥♥♥♥♥off, so I hedged my bets and just went straight for the door at the end of the corridor without looking back.  Success!  Next floor, well, obviously the exact same strategy didn't quite pan out, and...well, I'm sure there's some logic and strategy to all this, but I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I have the patience to suss it all out.  Which brings me to my next point...The Freddy's games have CHARACTER.  You're compelled to keep playing because it's all quite immersive and gives you a sense that maybe, just maybe, you CAN eventually beat it...and it achieves this partially by giving you an in-game tutorial which goes fairly easy on you for a while, as opposed to KILLING YOU IN THE FIRST TWENTY SECONDS of official gameplay.  There's ""hard"", then there's downright ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating.  The Freddy's games manage to be both of these things, but you're inclined to forgive them because they at least let you make SOME progress, and you ""almost"" make it through a level SO MANY ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES that it gives you the faintest glimmer of hope (Cawthon's a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that way, haha).  This game, on the other hand, is JUST hard and frustrating, and frankly not much fun.  There's no sense of trying to ""beat"" it...just an absolute recognition that it WILL BEAT YOU, over and over and over again.  It's all psychology, really, and where the Freddy's franchise is really clever and manipulative in this regard, 123 Slaughter Me Street just immediately corners you in an alley and fudge-packs you from behind.  Honestly, I've had more of a sense of accomplishment in some of the JOBS I've had in my life, and trust me, I've had some pretty ♥♥♥♥ing demoralising ""occupations"" in my time!  I've tolerated them up to a point, however, 'cause money is at times a necessary evil, but I don't play games to be treated the same way.  There's a big difference between a ""challenge"" and a straight-up♥♥♥♥♥♥raping, I'm afraid.The next big problem here is that it isn't really scary.  A lot of people have slammed the Freddy's games for their heavy-handed ""jump-scare"" tactics, but I'll happily confess that they worked a treat on me.  Why?  One word:  Suspense.  Jump-scares generally don't work without it.  There's precious little suspense in this game:  You're walking down a corridor, and suddenly you're handed an image of a vibrating, screeching puppet and the words ""Game Over"".  It feels neither fair nor frightening...just cheap.  Oh, and speaking of puppets:  WHY?!  Again, the Freddy's games have a STORY to them...a ""mythology"", if you will...a REASON for you being menaced by giant, cartoon-ish chickens and bunnies and bears.  There seems very little reason for such antagonists in this game, other than the fact that it's proved a highly lucrative premise in the not-so-distant past.In all honesty, I'm not entirely convinced the world needs another Five Nights at Freddy's game, much less an inferior rip-off of them.  Oh, and to the at least one reviewer so far who seems convinced that they'll unearth some deep, hidden ""lore"" within the game...good luck, pal.  I think you'll find that's just a pipe-dream you're nursing there.  There's precious little TO this game, period, be it mythos-wise OR gameplay-wise.  To heck with hope...an unending supply of PATIENCE is what you'll be needing here.  Even those of you who fancy themselves as SAINTS should probably pass on this one.Verdict: 4/10."

Whenever I try to play I just wind up closing the game.  I am too scared to play but I just played I got through the first floor (7th floor) on my 5th try. First time I got jumpscared I jumped and landed on my chest.  Second time I actually played and got frustrated because DUH I don't know how to play. I went to the tutorial and it showed me the controls and what to do. As other people pointed out, it doesn't tell you what to do if ""The Follower"", ""The Greeter"", ""The Waiter"", or the ""Devil Elmo"" appear. So I watched some videos on it and I saw what to do. Still uncertain about the ""Devil Elmo"" but It gave me some advice. I am glad about that. First, seeing people fail ingame. Then, seeing what to do if they appear. It was quite enjoyable to watch. The jumpscares to me are very affective and always catch me off guard.  ""The Follower"" is really quick and hard to keep away. That I want fixed for easier gameplay.

A patch is in the works for Windows 8.1/10; but overall, this game is AMAZING, the idea for it is great, and the graphics are really good too. Do get this game, especially if you are a FNaF fan. As FNaF is over, this will be a good temporary replacement in the horror genre."
,Recommended,405180,18232868,"Posted: 28 September, 2015",all,TheGameSalmon,"Up front: I really enjoyed playing through this game!So yes, some obvious FNAF relationships here: seemly cuddly animatronics, progressively difficult levels, a general sense of paranoia of ""WHERE DID YOU COME FROM??"" But in addition you have a humerous adaptation of Sesame Street and gameplay mechanics that make this game stand apart. I have always felt that FNAF would created its own horror sub-genre of games. This game is probably the first of many (that isn't a Five Nights at ______) to take a true step in that direction.There are only two minor things that I didn't like about this game. First, I wish there was some lore around why this place exists, where did they come from, who made them, etc. BUT I'm sure many of these questions will be answered in the sequel (which I am looking forward to). Second (and bear with me), I wanted it to be harder and with more mechanics/creatures. I keep seeing a lot of people say that this game is difficult to the point of impossible, but I didn't share that same experience. I managed to catch on to a strategy farely quickly and was able to beat the game fairly quicker than I expected to. I WANTED SO MUCH MORE!So bottom line, I recommend this game for any horror genre fanatic who loves a little bit of a challenge. I personally really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the sequel, which hopefully will include some new mechanics and lore that will put our questions to rest."

Its origanality is questionable but this is still a solid tittle, with simple but at the same time amazing and challenging gameplay! The Sesame Street like eneimes are truly terryifing, And bring out a childhood fear some people had locked away a long time ago. The graphics are fantastic, the enemy models could use improvment though, my opion: Get this game!"

,Recommended,405180,23959904,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,dawhoopmaster,"To like this game takes time. Most of the fun is memorising AI patterns and acting acordingly. The game is hard, and took me EXACTLY 3 months to beat. The characters and story are interesting, and the sequel set for release next month looks excellent. In terms of bugs, I've heard it has some problems on Windows 8, but these weren't apparent for me, I was playing on Windows 10.Also, go easy on the developers, ok? This is thier first PC game. The only games they made before were cheap, small mobile games, this is thier first big project. However, if you still need to moan about the graphics, play the sequel when it comes out, ok?My message from this is go easy on the devs. They tried hard, so cut them some slack.I've read alot of reviews for this game, and alot of them seem to be quickly judged and only focusing on the negatives, so be a bit more nice. And if it dosent appeal to you, thats fine! Myself? I really liked this game.Remember before when I said about how good the sequel looks? Well, heres the 2 trailers:Trailer 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLwvZUFm0YsTrailer 2 (What the game will actually look like):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjSBj3J6yBs"

Top that off with the dark story and you have a very interesting gameProsThe creature designs with the Follower,Greeter and Waiter are all very nice my personal favorite would be the GreeterEven though this game is insane with it's rage factor the pacing of the difficulty from floor to floor is still very goodTheres a very dark and cryptic story hidden within this game and like any good mystery it's always fun to dig deeper and see what you can findThe outro song for whenever you complete a floor is just awesomeWhile the game mechanics are simple there also pretty addictingThis game did manage to scare meConsI think this game should have an options menu the controls work well enough but they did take some getting use to if I had the option I'd tweak the turn around key to maybe s or shift and maybe the flashlight to a click commandPersonaly I'd prefer it if I could look left or right whenever I wanted to rather than only at specific partsI think the ability to turn around after looking either left or right would have helped alot in reducing some unnecessary rageOverall I'd recommend this game to anyone thats a fan of both rage and horror games personally I think the price is fair enough but some may disagree with me on that so you could wait for a sale but I don't think that would be necessary"
