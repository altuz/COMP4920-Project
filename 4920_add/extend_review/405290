The games are quality, the art style is dark and sinister, the music is always spot on, random rhythm games mix up the gameplay, the combat is awesome as in all the games.If I had to compare this to anything, I would say this is the bad♥♥♥♥♥metal version of Scott Pilgrim with more elements of RPG goodness as well as smashing Green Birds with Wireframe hangers. #birdemic"
,Recommended,405290,31750951,Posted: 14 May,all,Frootsnoops,"If you've played the Xbox 360 version of this game, you know how good it is. If you haven't, then buy it soon. It's a beat 'em up in the vein of Castle Crashers and Scott Pilgrim Vs The World The Game. You play as the punk rock band Charlie Murder, on their quest to defeat a mysterious villain (who's identity is eventually revealed). If you don't like gore, then you probably wouldn't enjoy this game, same goes for if you don't like the punk rock aesthetic. I highly recommend this game, it also has local and online co-op, as well as harder game modes unlocked after completing the game (like true vault hunter mode in borderlands 2). If you're not sure about it, get it on a sale.P.S. Probably only get it if you have a controller, although you can bind keys on your keyboard, playing with a controller is best. Also you can use a PS4 controller by plugging it into your mac or pc using its USB charging cord that comes packaged with it."

Charlie murder is a punk themed 4 player coop beat em up brawler. It is a very gory game with a dark story.1  The game is a excellent port from XBLA to steam. Not much is different from the xbox 360 version other than more options, like rebindable keys, resolution options and video settings. The game still has 4 player local multipalyer it feels as good if not better than the xbox port as I have beaten that on the highest difficulty before years ago.2  The gameplay is excellent, if you have never played a SKA game before it is hard to describe but it plays like a RPG style brawler like Scott pilgrim saves the world and castle crashers but it has guns, throwable items, melee weapons and explosives. You also have abilities with cooldowns, this game is great fun with friends and has challenge but if you go around collecting the best stat items, maxing your level in every way getting all the best items it is really easy but it has 3 difficulties of challenge. If you know how to build up a easy multipilyer it does not take very long to level up your characters and since there are a total of 20 characters 5 and 3 reskins of each ice, Goth and horror I think that is a good thing that it is not hard to level up to Max level.3 This game has loads of content you start the game off with 5 different characters and if you get the golden ticket later in the game you can unlock multiple reskins of the same characters with different abilities and some look like animals and vampires. But one downside of the character system is that if two people in coop wanted to play Charlie they can't, even if they unlock the reskins. But you at least have 5 choices and not 4.4 The game has lots of replay value and has a interesting unique mechanic of using your cellphone in game to take pictures of things like barcodes to unlock secrets. The game has many many collectibles and if you are an achievement hunter... Well good luck because s few of them will be a pain to collect all the items like in the ""I am thorough"" achievement by collecting all the relics, that will be a challenge for you.5 The game is not just a typical brawler, it has a few guitar hero sections, it has some interesting puzzles, it has a cellphone camera in game as a way to find secrets, a very interactive environment, it has a place where you can take props throughout the game and if you use a item you can break a table and with that item it will make the broken table drop a prop that you can place in your house you get later in the game to show your friends. The game has many collectibles rare items for example the glitch like a boss relic and the game is great fun to play with your friends.To Conclude, Charlie murder is an excellent game and is an above average PC port of an xbox live arcade game, it has 4 player local multiplayer a feature welcome on PC, the gameplay is great and the theme is unique, the game has loads of content and some interesting mechanics and lots of replay value, fair challenge and a great game to play with friends locally or online.Do I recommend you get this game? Yes, this used to be an xbox exclusive game but now it is out on PC and now you have the chance to try it."

My friend and I spent every afternoon playing this game, and to be honest, I forgot competly about this game until i saw that it was one of the newest releses. After seeing it, and after I got past all of the nostalgia, I decided to buy it. Playing this game has reminded me how much fun it was and still is. None of my friends own it so I always play solo, but playing co-op is extremly fun. This game has very good artwork and provides a dark/funny take on the idea of a zombie apocalypse. I highly recomend this game!"

It's kinda like Castle Crashers, but in a different theme. Really turns you into a Goth lover just by playing it.Very high replay value and cool unlockable characters with different abilities. It's worth the 10€, I would pay even more."

Great, great, great for local co-op (and okay for online though watch for netcode hiccups as of writing). Add some RPG-leveling and abilities that make the whole thing even crazier and you've got a chaotic brawl that rocks out louder than a band destroying their gear at the end of an earbleeding concert.If you like the music, the style, and want a great brawler, have a try at Charlie Murder."

A side-scrolling brawler reminiscent of Turtles In Time, but also an RPG, and best of all you play as a damn rock/punk band! Each class is a different band member. You get tattoos for new skills. FREAKING TATTOOS! GENIUS IDEA! I haven't had this much genuine fun in a video game in a long time. Takes me back to the days when I didn't have responsibilities and all I did was play video games on the couch. Grab your friends, it's definitely more fun with a whole band! I just happened to be looking around the net for a PC port of the game when i stumbled upon an imminent Steam release that blew my damn mind. I of course hammered that purchase button and am happy as a clam! BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET!"
76561197988113155,Recommended,405290,31812864,Posted: 17 May,all,SAF,"Charlie Murder is one of the better beat'em ups out there. It's set over a post apocalyptic theme, with punk and death metal undertones. You've got level progression with different characters to choose from, special moves (anarchi), armor/clothing (and shops where you can buy that stuff!), lots of gore, a nifty soundtrack, fluid combat with combos and all sorts of weapons (pick up and throw an enemies decapitated head!), an in-game cellphone where you can take pics of certain items that unlocks stuff, and the game also has a few other things I'm sure I'm forgetting about...This game was a day one purchase for me on the 360 and here on Steam as well. I like beat'em ups and usually games that have RPG elements (equipables, level progression, unlockables) so this game is right up my alley. My only con is the difficulty, it's a bit on the easy side for me, but that may be because I have already played it a lot on the 360.If you like beat'em ups, especially of the Castle Crasheresque nature, then CM is a must buy, seriously, for the price, and what you get, you will at the very least ""like it"". If you're not into beat'em ups, than I cannot recommend, even though it's more than most standard beat'em ups, it's still just a beat'em up at it's core. I still like CM a lot, but I it's not a game where I have spent a lot of time on. Expect a 10-20 hr max shelf life, which is longer than most in the genre."

This game i would love to recomend to everyone!This has been a awsome port from the xbox 360 as this was a digital download only for the xbox summer arcade for 2013.This game is a side scrollling punk beat-them-up with upgradeable elements like leveling up your stats with new clothing like masks,benies,T-shirts and much more and upgrading your base stats with this  games version of twitter which means the more followers you have the more skill points you can put into your  character  and get a choice of power ups like my fav character Tommy Homacide he can upgrade in making healing/lazer totems with the heads/brains of fallen foes.This game is also CO-OP with a hint of PVP in it (Arena Buildings in the safe zones). The CO-OP Can be with 4 people on a single screen or can be played online.This game has various difficulty levels after you beat the game many times e.g beat it once/get chaos difficulty whitch in return can give you more  powerful clothing to fight your toughened foes.As a player of the  xbox 360 version and finising it I will ABSOLUTLY RECOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE!!!!P.S if you like the soundtrack like me go onto this website and you can get it for free if you want to as SKA Studios allow   you to name your price!!!!!https://skastudios.bandcamp.com/album/charlie-murder-original-soundtrackGoodluck to all of you who bought the game!"

The story is remarkably simple yet very captivating and you cant help but fall in love with and choose favorite characters! Honestly this is a steal at  $ 9.99. You have two buttons so quick attacks and heavy attacks and you can combine various combinations to uppercut enemies, smash them in the ground, you can also parry and shoot guns. On top of this you level up and unlock new abilities and find relics ( small trinkets think like binding of issac, that change you stats slightly and give you bonuses ) There is segments of the game where you do mini puzzles and little guitar hero parts that are different based on what character you play as. In a game I have never seen such a satisfying ending ever, trust me when I say the good ending and bad endings will make you emotional ."

Ska Studios has put in at least 3 updates for the netplay TODAY, the day it came out, so you know you can depend on the company to have things fixed soon.Other than that, this is one of the best beat'em ups out there, with tons of different clothing to alter your stats and tattoos to give you special abilities, also has a simple combo system to keep things interesting.All in all 8/10 beat'em up that'll be a 10/10 once the netplay is completely fixed."

,Recommended,405290,32005720,Posted: 27 May,all,William Shakesman,"If you thought RCRU was a disappointment, Charlie Murder might be up your alley.CM is an arcade beat-em-up married to a Diablo loot and stat grind. A lot of beat-em-up stand bys are well represented here: weapons, grapple/throws, environmental hazards, the sort of classic arcade mechanics that stuff like Castle Crashers largely ignored. Here, you have about five different team members each with unique abilities, spells, and play style. Unfortunately, the combat remains a bit on the simple side, with only one character having anything resembling a cancel.Online co-op is available, but I have not tried it. My memories from the 360 version involved a lot of griefing and a lot of mismatched levels. Since stats and gear are so important, you really need to be playing with friends with similar progression to have a coop experience that isn't one sided. And since friendly fire is on by default, griefing is incredibly easy.I am thankful we got this and Dishwasher on PC, as it is nice to see how the developers advanced along both games to Salt & Sanctuary."

You play as one of the members of the titular band, and then kill things. Then you kinda never stop from there on out.I won't lie; this game is all about Charlie murdering (heh) his way through the zombie apocalypse. It's an adrenaline rush all the way through with no stops. Trust me when I say you go off the rails on this crazy train.Anyway, the game kicks off with Charlie and company screaming into microphones as they plummet into Hell. Then they beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some demons. This is all you get as a tutorial. It's all you need.After the game decides you've figured out how to break various parts of people's bodies, you get lifted back to Earth as some paramedics kickstart your heart. After this, it's just blood, guts, punk rock, and beating the everliving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of anything that isn't a merchant or someone you're playing the game with.Stop reading here if you don't want to see the story.This whole ordeal started with Charlie and his friends sitting around when he starts writing a song out of nowhere. Then some other stuff happens when he and his friend Phil go their separate ways. Phil gets angry and thinks Charlie betrayed him, while the latter doesn't have any ♥♥♥♥s to give.Phil tries to be some kind of guitar hipster and goes indie for a while, but then he gets pissy again and goes to a church, where he grabs a scythe and becomes- no, seriously; Lord Mortimer. He then forms a metal band with some lady that looks like Raven from Teen Titans, a generic Norwegian, and a fat Satan. Then they go murder Charlie Murder, and the game begins.Yes, I realize how redundant that sentence is. Shut up.Punk's not dead, ladies and gentlemen.No, it came back from Hell to kick♥♥♥♥♥"

The only bad things is the multiplayer and how buggy it is, I am not talking about day one bugs I'm talking about normal teleporting, lagging and not syncing. I get most games have that and not all games are perfect but this has it well. I say this is best with friends on the couch. It would be smooth gameplay for everyone and you would be able to play with your friends. I love this game's multiplayer because of friends.

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good beat em up asides from Castle Crashers or anyone looking for a great cheap game."

Sucks that there will most likely never be a sequel or anything like that.The minigames are lackluster and don't have alot of things you can get from them, sometimes the combat gets boring. Since i've played this before it got boring quicker but if your a first time player you will likely love this, even if you don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the punk rock theme. I came into this game not really being a big fan of street brawlers like charlie murder is, but came out with it being my favourite game on the xbox *that was free with gold membership*Overall, without being blinded by nostalgia and whatnot, this game is good, honestly it's nice that it's 10 dollars but, for the devs sake i really want this to be a higher price so they can make more games like this.7.5 to 8/10"

Set in a punk rock apocalyptic setting, charlie and the band will take on all sorts of enemeis from slow movin zombies, to ninjas, undead ninjas, demons, cultists, rats, witches and all sorts of other baddies. The real treat comes in the game plus mode which ramps up the difficulty and unlocks a new set of looks for the band members. All in all for 10 dollars this game is a steal. If you like coop brawlers, get this game even going solo will provide a good experience. 2 thumbs up all the way."

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wordingCharlie Murder is a game developed and published by Ska Studios and I have finally got to play it on PCThe game offers some very well-made 2D graphics with fantastic gameplay, if sometimes it can be a bit stiff and annoying controls and it seems like this with every Ska Studios game, but there is an awesome soundtrack that blends in with the game's dark and punk toneHowever, the game does have a lot of enemies seem like re-skins of past enemies and Charlie Murder does have a few difficulty spikes in certain levelsBut all in all, the game is fantastic and I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a good beat-em-up game!RECOMMENDED :)"

I've been hoping this game would come to pc for a long time now, and now that it finally has here is what I think of it. First of all it runs perfectly, no frame drops or black screens and it looks a little nicer than the xbla version. second it is really fun and one of the best beatem ups so far on steam in my opinion. and last of all the multiplayer works really well too."

,Recommended,405290,34559593,Posted: 28 August,all,hitt.william,"5/10Charlie Murder is a neat, side-scrolling beat 'em up with a cool aesthetic. The graphical style is unique, and the dark and moody levels are quite inspired. You play as a member of the band, Charlie Murder. I played the bassist (called the Shaman in game) and my co-op partner played the vocalist (called the Berzerker in game). You gain powers by getting tattoos in a tattoo parlor, and your collectibles are QR codes that you find and can take pictures of with your in-game phone. As you progress in the game, you gain ""followers"" and can upgrade your stats and acquire abilities.During most of the game you're throwing combos at different types of macabre enemies, using weapons and powers whenever possible. My favorite weapon was one of the giant axes or hammers, which delay on the swing and then offer a powerful and satisfying crunch. As the shaman, my favorite powers were an ""earthquake"" which created a zone of lava that did burning damage, and a cloud that I could summon that would hit enemies with lightning and acid rain. The game can get somewhat challenging towards the end, and kept us engaged.However, the connection issues in this game are absolutely awful. The one thing I can praise is that it was easy to get my partner in the game, and he was never booted for any reason. Whenever a character goes down, the other character can perform a CPR/revival maneuver to pick them back up. Nailing the button presses, this only worked for me perhaps once out of the ten times or so I needed to revive my partner. I'm not sure if this was due to me using an XBOX 360 controller, but it was absolutely a pain. Additionally, if I quit to the world map when this didn't work, my partner would remain dead and not show up on the screen. However, sometimes if I continued to advance through a level afterwards he would appear beside me. On a few occasions, my co-op partner was looking at an entirely different screen than what was visible to me, the host. Once, I had to tell him to move forward when his character was beside me, though he was staring at a loading screen on his end. The icing on this buggy cake was the final boss fight. I'm not sure if my co-op partner was supposed to be able to move during the final cutscene, but he moved forward and punched the boss during the exposition. When the boss battle began, the boss was trapped off of the screen on the right side. We just kept using attacks until we heard noises indicating success and saw the credits roll.So, hopefully this game is much more stable in single-player. However, I bought it due to the online co-op feature, so it was a bit disappointing for me. It's a shame, because outside of the connection issues, I think the developer created something pretty special."
