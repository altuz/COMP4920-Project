,Recommended,405310,20798015,"Posted: 27 January, 2016",all,sparkquake,"Today onI Can't Believe I'm An Adult and Paid $40 For This Game: Lego Marvel's Avengers.First off, it's a Lego game. If you don't like running around, smashing everything in sight, janky controls poorly ported from consoles, and inexplicable chickens, this changes very little in the formula. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it and all that.Second, it's improved. (Graphically.) If you played Lego Marvel Superheroes, almost all of the characters that made the jump to this one have been made better in one way or another, even if it's just graphically. Thor, perhaps, was one of the most fun to play with, now that Mjolnir stays electrified and easily deflects projectiles heading your way. They also made up for Hawkeye's relative uselessness in the MCU (I love you, Clint, but it's true) by giving him several more block types to interact with than the previous game. The graphics are actually very nice and I can still run it maxed out on my definitely-not-a-gaming-computer. That's always a nice feeling.Third: open world. Grand Theft LEGO never fails to amuse me, but I'm easily amused and if you give me the opportunity to have the Hulk steal a car and drive it around New York City until it explodes, I'm going to take it. They took what was already the best part of the previous game and made it even better, IMO, and I've barely had a chance to play it. (UPDATE 2/2: Make sure you check out some of the other hubs besides Manhattan for more content -- also Coulson doesn't bug you about some guy stealing a purse every two minutes, which is nice.)Four: the heroes. While Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four are notably missing from the roster (blame FOX), this gave Marvel the chance to pull out some of its lesser-known roster of heroes. I'm not sleeping until I unlock Kamala Khan, because I'm just so excited there is a video game with Kamala Khan in it. Also, the Young Avengers will always hold a place in my heart for being the book that got me into comics to begin with, so I'm pretty excited about them, too. (I'm guessing the game willnotexplain how Scarlet Witch, in her mid-twenties, has teenage twin sons also running around fighting crime?)This isn't to say it's not without its flaws, because it has lots of those, too. Maybe I'm romanticising it because of the content that it's based on, maybe I'm biased, maybe I should just sleep and replay it in the morning when I haven't had coffee yet and see how frustrated a children's game can make me.There is no original story in this game unless you decide to play out your own in the open world. If you've seen the movies, you've seen the plot for this game. While it draws mostly from the two Avengers movies, there are sequences from many of the solo films as well. On the bright side, the fact that this is a Lego game means no one dies, soAgent Coulson and Quicksilverare fine, on vacation in Tahiti.It's a magical place.They also made the Bruce/Natasha relationship in Age of Ultron make a little bit of sense, which is a miraculous achievement I didn't think was possible. So props there.Because the game uses the original audio from the movies, things feel... off. Some lines are delivered too seriously for any Lego game, others are taken out of context to be used as chatter while you play, and it all sounds very quiet at times. For some inexplicable reason, they had a different voice actor record new dialogue for Bucky Barnes in the Captain America: First Avenger level, who sounds more like the original kid Bucky from the 1940s than the soldier portrayed in the movies. (""I'm with you 'til the end of the line!"" he says enthusiastically! For some reason I have taken offense to this and I'm not entirely sure why.)That being said, Hayley Atwell, Clark Gregg, and Cobie Smulders all recorded additional dialogue for their characters (Agents Carter, Coulson, and Hill respectively), and when delivered well (which it not always is), are amusing and make this game feel like it's supposed to be -- a Lego game in the MCU.You're thrown into the game's opening sequence with absolutely no instruction as to how to play. Fortunately, if you've played any Lego game on the PC in the past, absolutely nothing has changed. Unfortunately, if you've played any Lego game on the PC in the past, absolutely nothing has changed. The controls suck. They always will suck. This time, they just suck and you're given very little information on how to use them. There are puzzle sections I spent ten minutes on because things were just not clear.There are bugs -- I can't get the Steam Overlay to work, and sometimes the characters just won't do what you want them to (Tony, you're making Clint ashamed by how poorly you're aming your laser beam. Just hit the gold bricks, that's your only job).So far, it's a cute game. It's a Lego game. It's a Marvel game. And it's fun. I can't really complain about that. Is it worth $40? Not really, but yet again, it's not money I regret spending (yet).UPDATE (2/2/2016): I've finished Story Mode, and I have to say, I'm more underwhelmed than I was when I started out. While it's not necessarily enough for me to give it a not recommended rating, I'd definitely say that it's subpar as far as Lego game and pales in comparison next to the previous Marvel game. It's still fun though. Stupidly so. And it's not like people play Lego games for the excellent, original stories. So, yeah. Wait until this one goes on sale. But it's still fun, and it still has Kamala Khan, and that's good enough for me."

But the Manhatan map is almost iddentical to the one from Lego Marvel Super Heroes. The last game is better in my concept, and I would reccomend buy it instead of this one.But what bothers me more is that I bought the Season Pass hoping to have all content for the game, and I discovered that some packs were not included. Specially the Ant Man pack, that are needed to complete the game 100%.I love the LEGO series, but I will be more carefull when buying future games."
76561198049334202,Recommended,405310,21910864,"Posted: 18 March, 2016",all,darthparallax,"Let me just put it this way:This and LEGO(R) MARVEL Superheroes are two equal and opposite sides of the same coin.One is open city play Manhattan. One is open PLANET play Earth, plus a piece of the Nine Realms thrown in for fun.One is utterly Original Story, with all the Classic Characters LEGO-ified from the Fantastic Four to Deadpool, the other is Carbon-Copy of the Cinematic Universe.It Includes as much of the Netflix and ABC shows as possible while neglecting some obvious things from the previous game including the lack of return of even Deadpool Red Bricks, which is super obviously due to this game being prepared before everything was finalized for MARVEL to be allowed to make Deadpool and get Spider-Man into Civil War. Yes, this game is a MARVEL game with no Spider-Man, but with a team of 'Defenders' that includes neither Namor, Hulk, nor Doctor Strange.Does that make it bad? NO! This to me makes one game simply Timeless, and one simply a Period Piece. A Historical Artifact. The first game took place in a strange Tesseract-Aether created Alternate Amalgam Universe, the LEGO Universe. This is the reverse-engineer process, A Basic LEGO game, MARVEL-Cinematic Universe-ified.There are Three Kinds of People:Those who love love love what Game 1 is doing and hate what Game 2 is doing;Those who love love love what Game 2 is doing to get to the point and didn't stop as much to smell the roses for Game 1 (Game 1 lacked Infinity Stones or Eternity, come on!)And Those who......having seen what Game 1 and Game 2 look like......strongly believe that Game 3, which is so, totally coming, is going to be the all-time-record Best MARVEL game in the History Of Ever.LEGO MARVEL: Infinity War is going to have Spider-Man. It's going to have Deadpool. It's going to have Thanos and the Infinity Gems. It's going to have at the very least the Cinematic Universe's take on the Cosmic Powers that Be. It's going to not be so gummed up by a zillion X-Men-verse characters, and lack of Magneto is going to be a sad thing, but we will have space for a zillion other characters that we wouldn't have got that have their own charm, and we will have who knows what else. We can even strongly hope that by the time it's time for LEGO MARVEL 3, MARVEL will at least be able to negotiate for the use of Fantastic Four characters for the game, whatever happens film-wise. Which will be great and awesome.I have had some glitch issues and it took me a while to fix them.I wasn't able to get the DLC the same day I got the game, but as soon as I could, I did.It's LEGO. And it's MARVEL.If you have played basically any games at all, there is something in this game for you, and while you might be reluctant to pay full price for it, you know you wish you had more money to justify impulse buying it even if you have doubts. Of course you will miss Spider-Man. But you will love flying around the Planet landing on the Hub Worlds.As with many games of this nature, the Secrets and Extras are not only harder than you would expect after a slew of easy ones, but sometimes your own controls get in the way and make it seem physically impossible to ever get something.Be honest. You knew what you were getting into. You are HOPING for that experience, so you can say, I got THAT character-whose-name-I-don't-know-and-doesn't-appear-in-anything-I've-ever-seen-ever-and-even-my-dad-doesn't-know-this-insane-pointless-obscure-character.You know that character? The one with ZERO good stories about them? Well now they HAVE a Story about them. The Story of YOU getting their Character Token in LEGO MARVEL's Avengers.Captain America (Sam Wilson) Falcon can partner with Captain America (Civilian) Steve Rogers who is just in a Jacket and Shield, to explore Washington DC's Mall together, and just running side by side each other gets an Achievement. Know what it's called?ON YOUR LEFT.You do realize that right there is worth the price of admission, yes?Also, there's like, a whole game to play, and stuff, besides the zillion ''OMG SQUEEE!"" moments like that.Does Arnim Zola (Classic) look stupid and not fit this game at all? Yes, absolutely.Is that a problem worth complaining about? Not when finding him is one of the hardest things you'll do. He's not hard to reach, but he's HIDDEN. Really Well. Very Secret. Much Stealth. And his Hideout is one of the best parts of the game."

Most people have mentioned the dialogues from the Avengers movies which severely limits the humour and creativity. The game forces you into a linear storyline progression, and unless you catch one of the loading screen hints, you won't know that you can replay levels only through the ""Go to space"" option in the menu. Every time you Alt+Tab out of the game, it switches back to a smaller resolution. Not all of the DLCs required to get a Perfect Game are included in the Season Pass. The game is outmatched by far by the Batman trilogy, and even by Lego Marvel Super Heroes. You'd be better off spending your money on those games."

This is the shortest lego game to date, the base game is only 7 levels, with some minor side free roaming missions (nothing like the free roaming you get in the last Marvel game).  Compare this to the typical 15-24 level base game for most of the lego games, and it seems really really short.  In fact, I finished the base game in about 2 hours.  Then they have a huge amount of DLC that you can get with the season pass for another 10 dollars, which isnt too bad, but even with that, it currently adds 12 very short levels, which I ran thru in about an hour.  Of course, like all lego games, you will have the option of running back thru all the levels and picking up all the hidden stuff and unlocking all the characters and cheats, but even taking all those things (base game, DLC, extras) into account, this is by far the shortest lego game to date.Now, was the game fun, yes it was, and it was pretty cool that they got all the voice cut scenes from the movies (everyone except pepper potts, what was up with that?)  Sometimes, it felt like the game matched the movies a little too much, but that is a minor thing.Bottom line, you are currently paying full price ($40.00) plus another $10 for DLC, that still doesnt equal the amount of content from the last Marvel game.Totally not saying you shouldn't buy it, but I just want to be fair, because I read several reviews just like this before buying it, and I have to say, honestly, I thought maybe people were just picking on the game, but now I know its totally true.UPDATE:  THey have now released 2 DLC packs for Civil War, but neither are included in the Season Pass, which was supposed to include ALL DLC, showing once again that this game is much more of a money grab that all the previous lego games so for another 3 bucks you can have 9 new skins plus a new level."

It is a lazy, slapped together mess that was released with significant issues.* it is boring.  Seriously, I nearly fell asleep playing one level.  I kept playing levels hoping it would improve, but the sunk cost fallacy applies to games too, so I gave up after nearly 2 hours so I could refund it.* the sound is broken, I have to have volume twice as high as normal to hear anything at all, and even then it cuts in and out, and is often too quiet, then too loud.* sometimes when I started it I just got a black screen, and my resolution settings got all messed up.* free roam map is identical to the previous Marvel Superheroes game, I've seen it all before.* Season Pass does not include all DLC.

,Not Recommended,405310,31125255,Posted: 13 April,all,Fianchi,"Not usually one to write bad reviews but this game was incredibly disappointing so I'll make an exception.. I bought it at a discounted but still steep price because I really enjoyed the first lego marvel game and couldnt wait to play the next one. This one pales in comparison. The story line is adequate, it follows the story of the films, but it's not particularly enthralling. The levels are filled with bad cut voice acting excerpts lifted from the film, which often don't make a lot of sense in context. There's very little direction on what you need to do in the levels, have sometimes got stuck for ages because you have to do one tiny thing that isn't clear at all to move to the next stage. The multiplayer is really buggy, have had game stopping crashes on sections where the two characters are doing different things and one person gets permanently stuck.. And they've tried to add in new 'cool' combat mechanics, which pop up with button-pressings icons (like the traditional ones in lego that you have to press to do something necessary to progress through the level) but these animations are slower than fighting the enemies normally, and alongside this there are times when you need to do something to progress through the level and the button-pressing animation doesn't appear- it's like they decided to shake up the archetypal design of a lego game, and it just doesn't play nicely at all.I love lego games but i really can't recommend this, maybe it will improve later with patches? Don't buy it til then."

Thoroughly enjoyed the Story Mode, and I'm still left with much to do. Don't go into this expecting Spiderman, Deadpool, and others of the like, as this game is centered around the MCU. I found it was very accurate to the films, and as always had the touch of LEGO humour, hats off to Traveler's Tales.Overall verdict, 9.7/10, as it could always be better, but I was very happy with it, and I'm looking forwards to the DLC and Season Pass content."

This game is no where near the same quality of Lego Marvel Super Heroes.  However, I do recommend this game, not because of its story, but what comes after.  Don't get this game for the full $40.00 either, there are hundreds of better games that are more deserving of your time, but if this is something you are looking at during a sale, I would recommend you try it out if:-You adored Lego Marvel Superheroes (as in, 100% or almost 100% it)-You are willing to look past an extremely flawed story mode-You really enjoy an open world especially when you have someone to play it with-You have a controller because I honestly dont even understand the keyboard controls-You just want to have a fun, easy going, classic Lego experience-You are buying the deluxe edition of this gameHowever, I do not recommend you try it out if:-You are very much hoping the reviews and critisisms of the game you see in the reviews are untrue-You want to enjoy the classic humor poking fun at things in Lego games-You have a very small amount of patience/tolerance for bad games-You want to play through a good story-You will be embarresed when your friends see you bought this on steamOk, getting that out of the way, although I have only played 10 hours at this point, where 5 of those hours have been the story mode, I am beginning to really enjoy this game and its open world(s) it has to offer, which are all packed to the brim with collectibles and quests.  The graphics are good in my opinion, and the combat is enjoyable when it is to a limited amount.  The voice overs suck. Period.  The story isn't very enjoyable. Period.  But, when you and your friend are having a quicksilver race around NYC, or when you are doing awesome team up moves or watching Lego hulk beat the crap out of Loki, the true game or what the game could have been shines through.

On the other hand, the dlc's were really disappointing, too short and uninspired (except for Dr Strange I guess).Unfortunately...TT takes it a bit further in taking customers for granted idiots.Buying the season pass won't give you all the dlc's! If you want to go for all the achievements you'll have to pay again for the last dlc (Antman).On top of that, the last update was 9.3 GB (!!!), basically making you downloading the game a second time (and in the process making the game crashing at the start, at least for me...).I played and enjoyed a lot of Lego's games, I was looking forward to play the new Star Wars one but TT just lost a customer instead!"

I enjoy almost all their games very much and have a significant collection.  However, I was really disappointed with this one comparatively.The biggest problem seemed to be a lack of creativity/laziness because the game is like half identical to the Superheros game.  The helicarrier and overall city layout is incredibly similar.  Unfortunately though, instead of the ease of that game to get to the menu to replay levels, you have to ""go to space"" and navigate around a globe to find each level.  Considering the default is to drop you in Manhattan, I found this very annoying.Another huge pet peeve for me is that a large chunk of the achievements are not possible without getting all the DLC.  And all the DLC is not even included if you buy the ""season pass"" which I thought was the point of those things.  I didn't get the DLC because I was waiting to see how the main game went first, so I can't comment on it being actually fun or not.There is definitely a big focus on the open world play in this game, which was also true in the Superheros version, and there are some fun things to explore.  But the main levels held so strict to the movie, probably so it could use the exact audio, that it was a little bit boring.  They did still hide the character tokens and minikits on each level which I think are always fun to find.  And there was the handful of specialty actions that could each only be done by special characters which is what helps to make these games great and replayable.It hurts to write a negative review about a Lego game honestly, but I feel like they have set the bar higher for themselves, and this one didn't deliver as I'd hoped."

And I've loved most of them. But this? Traveller's Tales, what have you done?On the surface, you'd imagine LEGO Marvel's Avengers to adapt the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a way that other LEGO games do: they poke fun at their source material using charming plastic toys to underscore dramatic moments. Not so in this game. It's mostly downgraded to unfunny gags with ""LOL SO RANDUMB"" humor and awkward bits of dialogue that go nowhere.A LOT of the dialogue is lifted directly from the films... and not in a good way. It's as if Traveller's Tales hasn't gotten access to the pre-movie-score dialogue and is forced to try and filter out the music in the backgrounds of quotes, because every time the characters say something, it's quite muffled and sounds bad. Not only that, but it's extremely out of place with the extra dialogue that was recorded for the game, which is quite clear and without noise. It comes across not as an official Marvel media product, but as a mod for another game that's been haphazardly smashed into it.Another problem is that the game takes a heavy hand in trying to introduce the tutorials to the player, by forcing them to seek out Avengers logos which tell you how to progress, rather than letting the player gradually introduce themselves to the game's mechanics and gameplay.LEGO Marvel Super Heroes also includes a full cast of characters, including the X-Men and Fantastic Four. This game, being an adaptation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, doesn't - but that wouldn't normally bother me if the presentation of the game wasn't so bad.The game is held back by the game's self-imposed voice-over restrictions and ham-fisted, childlike gameplay and sense of humor. You might argue that this itself is a children's game, and I'd agree, but other LEGO games have been appropriate for all ages without being too easy or too hard.If you have young children, they'll probably enjoy this. If you're looking for a good LEGO game, look elsewhere."

The combat animations and really all animations in general are much more fluid and smooth than they were in the previous lego marvel game. Graphics are better with a few new fancy effects. The combat feels as smooth as butter. Overall this seems to be an improvement over Lego Marvel Super Heroes in pretty much every way. Dont listen to most the negative reviews. This is an excellent game and totally worth full price.FULL IMPRESSION:Now that i have had more time to play i have a few more things to say about it. First remember that map from lego marvel super heros for the main hub? Thats gone now. There is no map for ANY of the hub worlds and THAT is a pretty big disappointment for me. I used that map all the time in the previous game and its harder to navigate and find where things are now. Its excusable to not have a map for hte smaller hubs but the largets hub world in the game and you dont have a map to navigate it? like really? You do get a nice rader bubble in the lower left of the screen but it doesnt make up for having a nice map.There also seems to be fewer ground vehicles but there seem to be more air vehicles.The only bugs ive encountered are small animation glitches so nothing game breaking.All in all i still think it was worth the full price but im just disappointed that there is no map when there was one in the previous game.

Even though I recommend it I only do so for Marvel fans, if you aren't a big Marvel fan you'll wonder why you didn't just spend less on the movies since this game follows the two Avengers movies and then three other movies (Winter Soldier, Iron Man 3, and Thor 2).LEGO game wise: no game breaking glitches, the LEGO designs have never been better, my saves didn't get deleted like they have on previous LEGO games, and overall it was much smoother than previous games. The AI is pretty freaking dumb so if you can play co-op, I would suggest that, but then that means dealing with the mediocre split screen. Every level feels way too crowded and over-the-top too, but I guess that fits the comic book style.Marvel game wise: Probaly won't be a better one besides the other LEGO Marvel.In the end, don't pay $40, wait a relatively short time for the price to inevitably drop as they always do on LEGO games then have some fun with the story and the hundreds upon hundreds of collectibles, if you're into that."
,Recommended,405310,21066266,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,evilkumquat,"7 Out of 10Fun, but Often TediousLego Marvel's Avengers is very similar in feel to Lego Marvel Super Heroes, but not as polished nor as fun.The game itself is a typical Lego game- lots of bricks, lots of collectibles, lots of smashing- but too much of the game was devoted to very simplistic scavenger hunting while many of the unlockable characters were pointless to play as their power sets were of limited use for puzzle solving. In fact, once Korvac was unlocked, he became the main character I played as he has the majority of powers needed to unlock most obstacles including gold bricks, electrical grids, vents and bricks requiring telepathy (with the added benefit of flight).As for the usual Lego game glitches, my game only crashed to desktop twice and I was only forced to exit a level once after getting trapped and unable to free my character.Sadly, once all the main missions were beaten, all that remained was a TON of yellow brick missions in Manhattan (close to 100) as well as tedious NPC quests which often required no more than flying to one end of the map and back to collect objects. Being a completist, I slogged through, but it was without much enthusiasm. There was clearly not as much effort put into these puzzles as earlier Lego games.The racing levels were often frustrating because the controls for flight are not sensitive and very unwieldy (again, not as nearly as polished as Lego Marvel Super Heroes). It was very difficult to control the pitch and I was often forced to backtrack after flying just over or under the target circle.There is plenty of fan service and most of the characters that ever came into contact with the Avengers are here... except, of course, for non Marvel Studios characters like the X-Men, Spider-man, Deadpool and the Fantastic Four (and their respective villains).The majority of the gameplay vocals are ripped right from the films' soundtracks which is jarring- it is painfully obvious which sound was recorded for the game and which was from the movies, although it was nice to see Clark Gregg recording new VO work for this as Agent Coulson. I don't understand why Tara Strong didn't reprise Squirrel Girl because she did another voice for this game.Bottom line: this is a typical Lego game and worth it for those who enjoy the typical Lego games.It's not as good as Lego Marvel Super Heroes, but far superior to the bug-infested Lego Jurassic World."

The cutscences are also some of the best, making it also very good.I would give it a 9.7/10, missing that 0.3 becuase you need SO MUCH RAM AND SPACE :(Either way, it is an amazing game, and is definitely worth the $39.00, but I found paying 9.99 for the season pass was better.

If you don't like LEGO games, or Marvel stuff, there is nothing here to change your mind. Pass on it if that is the case.]You should really know by now if LEGO games are your cup of tea or not. That being said, rather than explain everything about them, I'm gonna focus on what this one does differently than some of the others.There is a lot of combat in this game, and as you probably know, combat in LEGO games is awful. Your AI team mates will constantly get in your line of fire, and you will ""lock on"" to random objects that the game thinks you are trying to punch instead of the bad guys that are in the process of killing you. Luckily, there are still infinite lives and you only lose 1,000 studs upon death.You can turn off hints in this game, which is a welcome addition. Still, I wish it do more than that, and stop taking control of the camera to make sure I see exactly what item it wants me to interact with next.The Manhattan hub from LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is back as your main hub. There are also a few other tiny hubs with a handful of collectables each. This includes Asgard, Tony's Malibu Home, a Shield Base, and some others. The X-Mansion is mysteriously missing from the Manhattan hub. If you go to where it should be, there's just a boring building.The levels all follow the Avengers movies, which isn't really a problem, but I would have liked to have seen a game with its own story like LEGO MSH had.I know this is branded as an Avenger's game, but the lack of X-Men characters and stuff is really sad. I mean, even Wolverine and Spider-Man were in the Avengers.Other roster complaints: Nova is the older Nova and not Sam Alexander, the current Nova. Not a big deal, but they have some other current heroes like Squirrel Girl's Unbeatable outfit, Jane Foster as Thor, and Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel. Speaking of Ms. Marvel, why the hell is Carol Danvers in this game as Ms. Marvel instead of Captain Marvel? Were they just too lazy to make a new skin for her? She's been Captain Marvel for years now in the comics, come on guys.Remember the black cosmic bricks from LEGO MSH? They're back, and still called cosmic bricks, but I have no idea why. Here's a list of some cosmic characters that cannot interact with cosmic bricks: Nova, Ms. Marvel, Captain freakin' Universe. So who can? Ultron. That's the only person I've found who is able to interact with these ""cosmic"" bricks. I get they wanted to gate them off until the end of the game, but why not just rename them if only Ultron can use them?Speaking of Captain Universe, there is something about the character I really like. So one of the spots you can interact with is an area with hidden bricks. You usually have to play this dumb minigame to detect the bricks, but if you use Captain Universe, because of her cosmic awareness, the bricks just show up. She gets to skip the minigame completely. Nice attention to detail.This game has a serious lack of hidden levels. Remember how in LEGO MSH you used gold bricks to build doors to bonus levels? Yeah, that's gone. What are gold bricks for, you ask? Who knows, I can't find any use for them at all. The game does unlock three more levels after you finish most of the story, but these are just other Avengers themed levels, and don't feel like the wacky or pure LEGO bonus levels of the other titles.While it's a shame to see them continue to just scrape by on these cookie cutter mediocre LEGO titles, it's still a decent purchase if you enjoy the series.That being said, maybe you should wait for a sale, or pick up LEGO Marvel Super Heroes first."

I enjoyed the Lego Marvels Super Heroes (LMSH) very much, spent hours completing it and having fun but this one doesn't seem as polished if at all.LMA is basically a copy of the Marvel cinematic universe in lego form and humour. And, possibly my biggest problem is that instead of using new voice overs it has recordings from the actual films which sounds like someone has placed a microphone in front of a tv to record the specified script lines. It just sounds so bad.Other things are just little issues like irritating menus and constantly respawning enemies which seem to suck the fun out of it.Add to it that the free roam of the map, which is just there is LMSH, seems to be hidden in this. I know I've only spent a couple of hours on this but that is how much I've been put off by these issues and I know LMSH wasn't perfect as I did find a few glitches.

More time should have been spent on level development then on repetitive quests in the open world.The good news is we only had levels bug out and had to be restarted twice. But like all the recent lego games it's questionable how much (if any) testing was done in 2 player mode.I don't regret picking up the game having bought it on a really good sale and knowing that lego games have been going down hill but it's still disappointing to see them slide further. Is it worth paying full price? Not remotely. Worth it on a really good sale? Sure.

The campaign feels significantly shorter and there's simply less content overall in terms of side missions and things to do in the sandbox areas. Combine that with a roster which doesn't pack near the same punch as the first game, and you have quite a dud on your hands. Long story short, do yourself a favor and stick with LMSH and leave this one until it's on sale for less than $5."

,Recommended,405310,23963411,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,RevanNaut,"I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the LEGO Games so this was a must buy for me :)Pros:- It's got good graphics (Well for a LEGO Game of course, this obviously won't be the next Crysis).- The music is awesome (Then again, most of it is from the movies :D).- The huge selection of characters (And that's without the DLC included).- The big open HUB worlds you can visit and explore (This is where you get most of your golden bricks and characters/vehicles after beating the main missions).- Free Play mode lets you go back and visit the levels as any characters you want (I love playing The Sentry cause he's basically unkillable :P).- The addition of Stan Lee in the game (The guy's a freaking god :D).- The quests for The Collector were a nice touch and really expands on his character (Since you didn't see him much in the MCU).- The Red Bricks return once more and can make the game alot more fun (Using the Stud modifier helps getting the rest of the characters without having to revisit all the levels again for more Studs).Cons:- Some sections in the game can be really fricking annoying due to a time limit (Example: In the level ""Ultron Undone"", you're on a time limit for Scarlet Witch to charge up her powers. Normally, it's not an issue BUT when you get to the third section of Part C (Before the QTE with Ultron), its makes you so angry on Free Play mode cause you're trying to get all the collectables but it forces you into the cutscene, meaning you have to restart the sequence again just for another shot).- There's inconsistent audio throughout the game (For example, sometimes when Captain America talks during a take-down, he sounds super quiet).Overall: This game is a must have if you're a fan of either Marvel or Lego (Or even both if you're like me :D)."

LEGO didn't try in this game at the above points but the HUDs are nice that I explored; I cound't get to Asgard (Due to long loading times) or Miama (Due to lag). P.S.

This is an Avengers game first, and a Lego Marvel game second. Aside from this problem - and it's a big problem, which is why I wouldn't recommend this game - Lego Avengers builds on the free roam elements of Lego Marvel and Lego Batman 3, with a selection of smaller hubs to explore, and Manhattan itself to galavant around, finding collectables and stopping crimes. It's a real shame the Avengers licence gets in the way so badly, but if TT make a Lego Marvel 2 with the wider access to Marvel's character pool seen before, it should be just what we want."

After just over an hours gameplay I became incredibly frustrated on how much progress I was making. It's not because its a hard game. But it can take ages to figure out what your supposed to do.Also Captain America's fighting is broken. The enemys back away while he trys to do something with his sheild. Then when you try to hit them your facing the wrong way and not doing any damaged. The fact that this point of the game there were respawning enemys distracted me from working out what i was suppose to be doing.In the end I ended up watching a walkthrough video which revealed I was supposed to be pushing this giant weapon around. Not very obvious.In the end I became so fustrated I decided to request a refund.

It's true, not everything is a life-changer, or worth the money, or worth the effort, but some games are. We all love the joy of that truly AAA game that we rush to play at every open chance and that we think about despite ourselves, but games can be taken slowly and pacifically too. This is where I would throw LEGO: Avengers. While not the best LEGO game (LEGO: Star Wars), or the worst (LEGO: Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues), Avengers tries to be what it can with its astonishing limitations. Avengers steps up the fighting mechanic game while kicking down the puzzle solving game. It's....fine, but truth be told, I starting missing the puzzles halfway through. It tries to fight against the ""It's just formula!"" arguments by sacrificing some of the most enjoyable parts of a LEGO game. I like the expansions, and yeah, I'd say it's worth it, but my recommendation comes with a cautious yes. This is not a game you will likely replay. However, this is not a game you will rage-quit because it's terrible or annoying (LEGO: Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues). In the end, yeah....it's fine. If you're looking to extend your LEGO library (me), then you might just like throwing some hours onto this."

,Recommended,405310,26373412,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,Tediousity,"Just gonna be blunt: this is one of the weaker LEGO games. It's not as good as Star Wars, Batman, or the original Marvel, but it's still enjoyable.As many others have said, its main flaws are that it focuses too much around combat and only uses dialogue from the movies. Those are prevalent, but some others are that it has several open worlds, which sounds like a good thing, but actually almost all of them are tiny. That doesn't stop you from having fun with them, but it is irritating to realize that you can only be on one street in all of D.C. It's also somewhat darker than the other games: one of Black Widow's ""special moves"" is to knock a person down, then jump in the air and fill them full of bullets. Hawkeye can choke someone with his bow, and they don't even try to get rid of the death: Coulson is dead in this.Some pros, on the other hand, are that the character creation is much improved; there are also a bevy of different abilities and over one hundred characters; levels for the solo movies are quite nice; and hey, you get to play through a bunch of MCU films.On the whole, it's a good game but don't get it unless you really like LEGO games and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Also, you should probably buy the other LEGO Marvel title (LEGO Marvel Superheroes) first because it has X-men, FF, Spidey, and several more."

Imagine me putting together all the best parts of all MCU movies in an almost random order. Yeah, that's this game. It ain't too bad, but it is definitely annoying. What I will definitely recommend you to do is to watch the movies before playing this game, because it will MAYBE make more sense. Gameplay is pretty much identical to all other LEGO games. There is fun to be had, but in my 12 hours of playtime I was sick to death of this game. They used the voices from the movies and it not only sounds a bit bad in the game, the audio was also really limited making the game a dull experience. You are left into a really serious LEGO game with forced humour featuring chicken and milkshakes on screen... that's it for the humour. It is pretty much completely gone. The music is alright, but not to my liking - I'm usually more for darker music than this game, like Max Payne music and the Batman music in TDK Trilogy and BVS. It might sound like I am ♥♥♥♥♥ing a lot but that is because after LEGO Marvel Superheroes, which was great, you'd have somewhat higher expectations. LEGO Marvel Superheroes was so much better simply because of the original story written. This one takes previously written stories and mashes them into a repetitive and somewhat boring beat-em-up style adventure game.The game is filled with minor annoyances which might make you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. An example of this is the ""True Avenger"" thing, which is basically to obtain as many points from smashing things as possible. The problem with that is that you'd become really stressed out about them as you'd go around everywhere to smash every little piece possible to make sure you'd never have to replay these over-stretched levels. I wish there was something else in place other than the 'smash everything' thing. Graphics are also quite good for a LEGO game, but they are nothing special by today's standards. This game just feels so heavy on itself, I wish it had some light heart to it, like Saints Row. (Yeah, that sounds really stupid.)Other than that it was pretty fun but an average game. I don't really recommend this game unless it goes down to a sale of $5, like how LEGO Marvel Superheroes is on a usual sale. I wish I could rate it a ""mixed"" recommendation.

Like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham it features way more to do and way more to see than ever before. Though it sacrifices that Lego charm we've seen over the years.On the surface it has everything you want out of a Lego Game, but it soon reveals it's flaws.For starters the game treats you like an idiot with more cutscenes and camera cuts than any other Lego Game. Visually ripping you from gameplay every minute to camera loom over what you're supposed to do next far too long.Second, all the cute Lego gags that poked exceptional fun at the source content is gone. Replaced by cringe-worthy chicken jokes and a way way way waaay overused food gag.Thirdly, the levels are just plain uninteresting. They expand the films by letting you play through things inbetween scenes you never cared about and then draw out scenes you do want to play through then making them quite boring.Though one thing i'd like to put in it's defense is it seems to have put as much detail into the individual characters as Lego Batman 3. All in all, go for it, it's another notch in the Lego Game belt, but made to a lower standard than some. Hope this helps!"

After spending over 30 hours playing it, I am ready to give my thoughts on the game.If you are a person who likes to cheat on games like this, then unfortunately for you, there is not many cheats out as of now. I have, however, made a guide listing every known cheat so far, and that might help you for the time being.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=611666375The PC users will soon learn that it is currently impossible to change the controls, as it is bugged and will hopefully be fixed soon. I was frustrated with this at first, but soon got used to the default controls. There are some guides showing how to fix this, however, but you must also have LEGO® MARVEL Super Heroes installed for this work around to work.The game features 7 Levels devoted to the first Avengers movie, and 5 Levels dedicated to Avengers: Age of Ultron (or A:AOU) and has another 3 bonus levels, each level based on its own movie. Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3 each have their own level dedicated to them, however it is a very shortened version, it gives the game a lot more content, especially if you are looking to get 100%.A step up from its predecessor, LEGO® MARVEL's Avengers has 8 hubs instead of 1, with Manhattan being the biggest one. Another thing to note, the S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier is also in Manhattan and should be explored if one wishes to get all characters and gold bricks. The hubs are as listed:AsgardSokoviaSouth AfricaMalibuWashington D.C.S.H.I.E.L.D. BaseManhattanCompleting all of these hubs and getting all collectibles will take a lot more time, and adds quite a bit of content to the game.The game looks overall great, and it works smoothly. They took the dialogue from the movie, so it might sound unusual at times, but contrary to what others believe, I think it worked out pretty nicely. The game features quotes from the movies, and it has that LEGO humor that we all know and love. With many characters from the movies implemented into the game itself, quite a bit of characters are powerless, and overall, useless. About 1/4 of the characters in the game are useless, which is a considerable amount, considering the amount of characters this game has.Overall, I recommend this game as it is fun to play and has a lot of content, and that is not mentioning the soon to come content from the Season Pass. I hope this guide helped you decide whether you are going to get this game or not."

,Recommended,405310,20818821,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,「classy」 #prayforvegas,"I can't give this game enough thumbs up.LEGO Marvel's Avengers is the DEFINITIVE Super Hero game by LEGO. It features a massive core hub (Manhattan) and seven smaller hubs for you to explore at your leisure, including the SHIELD Base and the famous realm of Asgard. There are several characters that can be unlocked just by playing the stories (more on those in a minute), and over a hundred more to be found scattered through Free Play levels and the open world.Each hub has characters unique to that location. For example, a few character tokens you might find in Tony Stark's Malibu penthouse are Iron Monger, Happy Hogan, and (if I remember correctly) the Mark 5 Iron Man suit.The gameplay is a vast improvement over LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. The combat feels much better, and the new tag-team attacks are a blast. The combo system takes some getting used to, and the targeting can be a bit funky, but overall combat is very fun. Each 'main' Avenger can team up with another 'main' Avenger to perform unique tag-team moves, and which move you get depends on who initiates the combo.For example, let's say you have Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. If you initiate a tag-team with Scarlet Witch as Quicksilver, Quicksilver will run off screen and come back with a bunch of red LEGO blocks. Scarlet Witch then lifts them into the air (as Quicksilver dashes around in excitement) before causing them to erupt in a rain of energy. However, if you intiate a tag-team with Quicksilver as Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver picks her up and spins her around as she fires a beam of energy across a wide area.For 'side' characters, the tag-team is the same, with one person grabbing the other's wrists and performing a synchronized air slam. A bit grating after a while, but by no means a detriment to the game.The story is split across six (technically seven?) Marvel movies: Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: Dark World, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man (in the upcoming DLC pack, that is).Some people criticize the lack of an original story and the use of direct voice-acting rips from the films, but I actually rather like both of these. Many favorite lines are repeated, with some clever new dialogue to help fit the scene thrown in. The lack of an original plot doesn't bother me either, as the ones that the game DOES cover are all very well written and fun to play through.The game is drop-dead gorgeous. It's a bit heavy on mid-range laptops like mine, which surprised me a bit. However, even at 1280x720 (not my current resolution, mind), the game still looks significantly better than it's predecessor.However, the game is not perfect. It does have a few rough spots, such as the occasional friendly fire. The voice acting does get a bit tired after a while, as does the generic tag-team for other characters. The story is also a bit short, but the Free Roam makes up for that. The side mission 'Into The Aether' is a bit bugged, but that may just be me. Finally, the game is fairly easy.Despite these very insignificant shortcomings, this game is excellent and definitely worthy of a solid 9/10.TL;DR: Get this damn game."

Yes it doesn't have the X-Men or the Fantastic Four but it works on the Cinematic Universe. They'res already talk of a Civil War tie in (So it's worth getting the season pass), and while we'll get it after the console, we'll still get some awesome new content. Not to mention an Ant-Man tie in sooner or later.I think it's a good one as it's being added on, being worked on and hopefully, they will continue to do so.My only gripe is that for some reason or other Lego games have started putting in voice snippets into the game, unlike the old Lego Star Wars games where they just did emotions to get the gist across, which I felt worked nicer and was more comedic. Though I suppose this is just to tie in with how things work these days.

Well it's Marvel Studio's Marvel, voice acting taken direct from six Marvel movies for the main plot. If you want immersion or missed any of the movies, it's nice, but it's not where the game shines. It's the variety of reasons for the main story replayability, the side missions, the collectibles, and even the so called cheats make the game more fun.Not as Good as the first game, at least in my opinion. No X-Men, Deadpool, Fantastic Four etc is a bit bitter, but instead you get some of the lesser known characters tied to the Avengers and the other associated movies. Gameplay-wise, its definitely a sequel, better missions, some new small hubs, controls have been tightened. It's just sad seeing New York the exact same as the last game. The missions are creative enough, and the game is funnier than the first one too. I'm in my 20s and laughed a lotIf you liked Lego Marvel Superheroes then i'd recommend it, otherwise get that game first, its a much more complete MARVEL experience if you're looking for a pre-MCU collection, the storyline in that one is original too. This has corporate Disney all over it. I don't believe in paying extra for DLC for what is essentially re-skins and superheroes with powers that are the same as the 170+ that are already in the game and a few extra side missions.  Some people like the DLC etc. I get that, but this is just my opinion it's not worth it.This game is basically 90's Saturday Morning cartoon charm interwoven with the 6 MCU movies that it comes from, only with LEGO blocks added in."

If you like the other Lego hero games you will enjoy this one as well.  It was nice getting to play through the cinematic universe with the added flavor and humor Traveler's Tales puts into their games.The stories were engaging despite having seen them all in movie form already and their as always is plenty of replay value in the game itself.  They have many hubs now and have largely kept the hub from the previous marvel game intact as well.  This game makes for a good free roam time spender for that reason.The cast is vast and fun but I do think they limited the powers a bit more than they should have.  Many of the cast are also the same character in different outfits.  In some cases like Tony Stark these outfits are great because they change the character abilities.  Others though are only cosmetic but still fun.  That said the alternate costumes do not feel like they are taking away character slots from other heroes that could have been included.  The cast feels VERY thorough...I was hard pressed to find characters from the movies that they missed including.There were a couple things I wish they had done though.  Understandably this is a cinematic universe game with focus on the movies...but I would have liked to see the marvel mainstays like the Fantastic Four and X-men still playable...even in non-movie form.  This would have made the cast massive and I understand they have license issues to deal with but I missed some of the characters from the first game nonetheless.  I also think they could have made the problem solving aspect a little funner.  This was the first Lego game where both I and my young niece started to find them repetitive as opposed to fun and entertaining.Overall though I still recommend this game but I would wait for a Steam sale and get it then.

After the update finally patched any issues with the game Mac systems had, I finally managed to enjoy, and enjoying I did.The story arc is compiled out of bits and pieces of the main movie franchise, even going as far as incorporating original voice sound bytes - even though the storyline sometimes feels a bit strained, the variety in gameplay the game offers is amazingly polished, as opposed to some previous installments.The new radar/map is rather annoying in open world section, I kinda liked the simplicity of selecting where I want to travel and being directed there than aimlessly running around and trying to figure out where the hell I'm supposed to go.And I still hate all flying races in open world.The visuals are great, puzzles are fun to figure out, and the game itself is very rewarding in terms of unlockables.A definite yes for any MARVEL movie universe and LEGO fan.-------It doesn't work.I'm a huge fan of LEGO games, as I find them fun and and the humor is cheeky. I can even look over the occasional gazillion of glitches that plague pretty much all LEGO game releases, because in the end, it's fun.Well, not this time. I got the game and all DLC for my Mac just so I could end up starting what turned out to be 16GB of space taken on my computer, and face the warning that ""it might work with some errors on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.3"". The statement was false.The game doesn't work.So, let's keep it at low score until they stop lying to us about a patch that's ""coming soon"" for 5 months already, and see how it works after the ""soon"" arrives."

76561198142756344,Recommended,405310,29881782,Posted: 12 February,all,Thundercracker,"Lego Marvel's Avengers is a fun game to play. If you are a fan of Lego games and/or Marvel properties, I would pick it up. There are a few issues and things that I experienced. One being that when you get to the game menu and it says connecting to the game servers, if it is unable to connect to the games servers, good luck playing the game. You'll select a svae file and then load the save and then go to a blank screen where nothing will happen and you'll have to restart your PC and try again. For me, I have had to restart at least 3 times before the game will work. Then, while it's loading the save, the game will close window and go back to desktop even though the game will still be running. Occassionally the game will close and return to desktop randomly. Also if you pause the game for a bit and come back, the gameplay will go i and  out of freezing and running normally. The game itself is fun but can be a bit boring after a while. The story takes you through the two Avengers movies with levels that speedily give you an overall idea of what happened in Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World. They use a fair amount of lines from the movies to immerse you but ulitmately could have used more, though I am sure there are copyright issues and other tings trying to get A-list actors to voice a Lego game or someone who could mimic their voices. I do appreciate the time spent to give each Iron Man armor some kind of animation. Basically as I read in another review, the story feel ""phoned in"" and there was not much effort put into it. The way to get red bricks to unlock extras is that when you play a level in free play, The Collector will appear in a segment of the level and ask you to do something for him. Aside from the okay story, there are DLC levels from Captain Marvel, All New, All Different Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Ant-Man and Marvel's Agents of Shield and Masters of Evil and the DLC missions also include new characters. There are additional character packs from Spider-Man, The Thunderbolts, Captain America: Civil War and The Avengers Adventure Pack. So if you finish those there is more to do. There are 8 hub areas to explore and collect Gold Bricks, Character Tokens and Vehicle Tokens. The areas are Asgard, Barton's Farm, Malibu, Shield Base, Manhattan, Sokovia, South Africa and Washington D.C.Character Tokens can also be found in levels as well as the Gold Bricks. In the hub areas, you obtain Character Toekns by helping various characters do odd and often stupid tasks like finding cats. You find Vehicle Tokens by doing races in hub areas. Overall, this games is fun but can get boring and the story could have had more effort put into it."
76561198021707639,Recommended,405310,31146998,Posted: 14 April,all,L0rdSilverbane1,"Worth the buy on sale, but not at full price. Whereas the first Traveler's Tales foray into Marvel was fun and original, the fact that Marvel Avengers chains itself to the end of the first phase and all of the second phase of the Marvel MCU really limits it's creativity. Being able to use the voice over from Robert Downy Jr. and Chris Evans was not really worth the exchange, as the lego humor just doesn't mesh with the serious tones of Tom Hiddleson's Loki or Jack Spader's Ultron.The best part of the game was largely hidden until after the story mode was ended, at least for me, with the open world and collection, with actual fun quests and characters to win over that were not in the movie (Kamala Khan and Lightspeed of the Power Pack being my particular favorites). Unfortunately no X-Men and didn't get spider-man until the Civil War DLC as if Sony and Fox suddenly said 'no you can't use them in games either', which limited the feel of the world.I played it, I enjoyed it, and I am looking forward to the next Lego Marvel, but I hope that they return to the original storylines, more diverse characters, dialogue, and humor that we saw in the first outing, rather than being confied to the movies of the MCU."

76561198120400500,Recommended,405310,31517942,Posted: 2 May,all,Kitty Nat,"Marvel's MCU officially gets LEGO-fied!For those who've yet to play one of these LEGO games:One of the reasons I like these games is that they manage to be both kiddified (lotsa humor, relatively easy, player death is only a minor money penalty, almost no character is fully dead) and yet complex (lots of stuff to collect even after the story mode is done!).The other big reason is an attention to detail, especially in a licensed property like this.  There's plenty of room to approximate film and story locations to a remarkable, if somewhat simplified degree.  References and easter eggs abound in the hub quests.  Characters who give you quests have a few words to say, yet drop some reference that honors some aspect or variant or story.Also, try to spend time with most of the characters you collect for a while.  Every playable character gets a couple idle animations that accurately hints at some aspect to that character.  And there's a great variety in hand-to-hand fighting styles, with most well-chosen for the hero.  Armor-less Tony Stark throws a punch first, while Doctor Strange will rear back for a roundhouse kick.The Review:The main story consists of the first two Avengers movies, (Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron), but also gives you levels pertaining to Captain America: Winter Soldier, Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World.  (That's all the movies sandwiched between the Avengers movies, minus Guardians of the Galaxy.)  There's also a flashback to the key event that set up Winter Soldier.Available DLC includes a Captain Marvel story, a Masters of Evil story, a Classic Black Panther story. a Doctor Strange story (based on the 2015 All-New All-Different redesign), plus Agents of SHIELD (based on the back half of Season Two, regarding Skye's true identity), and one based on the Ant-Man movie.Also, in the main game, Agent Carter gets a lengthy quest series, with a neat trick to flash back to the 1940's.  (But, oof, the filter used makes some things hard to see.)DLC levels are in the same style as the ""intermission"" levels between the Avengers movies, with cutscenes rendered as LEGO-fied comics and voiceovers.Game FIRST throws you into the assault on the wintery HYDRA base (to retrieve Loki's staff) that kicks off Age of Ultron.  Only then does it take you to the start of the first Avengers movie, with a SHIELD base evacuation because of experiments with the Tesseract which leads to Loki's arrival.The reasons for this narrative choice quickly become apparent.  First, that sequence has the Avengers as a team, allowing the player to immediately sample the core six:  Black Widow, Hawkeye, Cap, Thor, Iron Man and Hulk.  Thus, the player does not have to wade through the team-assembly phase of the first movie before playing as their favorite Avenger, at least in this core six.Second, certain events in Avengers turn one or other member of that core six against you for part of the movie.Spoilers:Hawkeye gets brainwashed by Loki, Thor fights with Iron Man over Loki, and Dr. Banner resists turning into Hulk then goes all Hulk SMASH!!So, while this intro is unexpected (all other Lego movie adaptations put you in the first sequence from the first movie at the start),  it makes sense here.  You see the core characters and their abilities in the game right away, if only a taste.Usual zero scripted tutorial.  As with the previous Marvel Superheroes game, hints and explanations pop up from Maria Hill or Phil Coulson when you hit a floating Avengers logo.  Relevant button for action pops up.  Hints in the form of the portrait of a character that has the ability you need also appear.As with other movie adaptations since LoTR, cut scenes are animated with dialogue lifted from the movies, if tweaked for humor and kiddification.Example:  Phil Coulson'sdeathis a plot point that galvanizes the motley crew into a heroic team, and is therefore far, far too important to dodge completely.  It's handled quite deftly, and preserves the drama of the moment.There are also some comments during gameplay that have been pulled from the movie dialogue, which means that sometimes the audio is a little weak because they were speaking softly.  Characters employed for quests and DLC often have vocalizations and comments done directly by their voice actors and are much clearer.  Fortunately, there's a subtitle option.Plus, several actors from the movies and other projects have contributed additional voice content.  Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson is as game as he was in the other Marvel Superheroes game.Game engine might have improved.  The only slight stuttering of video on my machine (better than recommended specs) came when turning while flying high up in Manhattan.  It feels like there's a better allocation of resources.  There seems to be more compartmentalization within the sections of levels.Audio controls, howevver, have weakened.  Just on/off for the (loud!) music yet volume control for sound effects?Compared to Lego Marvel Superheroes:That first game had an integrated story, but efforts to squeeze in all those heroes gave some short shrift and only a handful of uses.  Here, there's a core team to concentrate on.No Spidey, X-Men or Fantastic Four, not even as collectible characters or DLC.  Heck, the Baxter Building and Oscorp are not represented in the skyline this time around.  Strictly MCU stuff now.  But that just leaves much more room for many other obscure heroes.Minikit rewards here are neat:  LEGO-fied versions of some notable comic cover related to the events in the level.  The Avengers as a group and in their individual titles are represented.This game gives you nifty, if annoyingly slo-mo power moves and combo moves.Unfortunately, there's no world map.  Level selection is accomplished through launching a Quinjet and roaming around the Earth.  The Avengers are a globe-trotting team!That sets up several hub worlds, of which Manhattan is the largest.  With Marvel Superheroes, only Manhattan and the Helicarrier were hubs.  Both hubs return in this game, with their layouts largely unchanged. But, as a Manhattan pedestrian comments, they've also changed it up a lot.  Far fewer rooftop agility courses this round!AnnoyancesThe lack of a world map is a PAIN when it comes to navigating Manhattan.  Oh, the ghost stud trail when heading to a new story mode level is its usual helpful hint, but trying to find a specific area of the island (so you can pick up your favorite character or vehicle early) is difficult without even a partial minimap and a constant arrow pointing North.  And you cannot set a target location to trigger a pathfinding trail.Instead, all the Gold Bricks and race locations and mission/quest NPCs are dots on a radar screen.  What they stand for do not show up on radar until you are very close.  However, there are little red and green arrows on top of the nearby icons that tell you if it is higher or lower than you, and the indicators granted by Red Bricks point very closely to their actual location.Fortunately, Marvel's version of Manhattan sticks to the basic geography of its RL counterpart, and the game captions broad areas. Once you get to Free Play or must transition to a new story mode level with Iron Man or another flying character, navigation becomes far easier.Sadly, for the first time in several games in the Lego series, after 100% completion, there's apparently no smashy-smashy bonus level in which you need to collect a million studs.  Instead, Avengers Tower's penthouse suite gets slowly decorated as you finish some of the hub quests.  Better for the partial completions.All in all, it's the usual LEGO fun, this time in the Marvel movie/TV universe!"
