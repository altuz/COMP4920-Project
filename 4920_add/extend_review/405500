A pure party arcade game where your goal is to smash up a room in various ways. There are secrets in... well basically every level I have played so far, and there are lots of levels to play.In short... if you liked crash mode from the burnout games, and want a different take on that idea, than this might be for you."
,Recommended,405500,23413553,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Stabf,"Normally I don't write reviews, but the hate on this has gone WAY too far. As someone with a not so great back/neck, I tend to lean back and play games with a controller whenever possible, so it just so happens I have a controller. And since I can read, I noticed the giant ""this game requires a controller"" warning when I bought the game, which for me makes it easier to play.As far as gameplay? Its a little on the simple side, and I do wish I could hit it one or two more times per hole, or have a longer smashbreaker. I supposed it would have no challenge if you could keep going, but I just want to destroy more stuff!This brings me to the main point of this review. This is a fun little physics destruction style puzzle game, just like it was advertized to be. The holes and objectives are creative, and the shot styles are a fun way to mix up your attempts. It is worth the ~20 bucks I spent on it, and would be even more worthwhile if on sale. Compare this to the cost of going to a 2 hour movie and getting a drink, and even getting 2 or 3 hours out of it makes the investment viable.I have already gotten those hours of enjoyment, and will probably complete it, which looks like it will take another 2 or 3 hours easily.As a side note, I saw people complaining about the framerate being locked at 30fps, but you can set it to 60FPS. Maybe they just added it?And I also saw some complaining about technical problems. I can report that on my homebuilt Win 7 64bit i5/Nvidia 960 rig I have had no problems."

If you did not like the mode or the game you will not like this.There are 4 regions but there are multiiple locations with a single map and those locations can have upto a dozen or more levels so there is a lot of content. You have a room, a goal and a few set way to start. Once you get a smashbreaker you have real control over the ball and this is essentially the aftertouch from the burnout series. There are secrets galore on each level as well the requisite signature smashes (remember burnout) and secret smashes (hello burnout).This game is aimed at a very specific audience with some overlap with other groups. If you've been waitiing for a 3d crash mode since Burnout 3 this is most definitely the game for you."

Do you like smashing things? If so, I'd recommend this.I've had a great time with this game so far. If you go into it expecting an actual golf game I can see why you'd be disappointed. But if you just want to play a game that is literally Crash Mode with a golf ball, that's what this is. From the mechanics to the fonts to the music, I've had non-stop flashbacks to Burnout 3.Overall, I have very little complaints. I notice that the sound cuts off on some stages. And sometimes my laptop has trouble keeping up, but most of the time it runs fine with lower settings. But other than that I appreciate the variety in missions, my wife enjoys co-op mode and I have yet to try the party mode. Getting platinum involves a bit of strategy, which is nice and has lead to a few retry loops. Some of the criticisms this game's received are valid, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying it. No regrets."

,Not Recommended,405500,23352424,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Yung Idol,"As a non-Early Access title this game is a mess. I was OK with what seemed to be a limited amount of content (4 areas) but was pleased when I found there were multiple areas and holes within each area, each with it's own challenges. Apart from that, however, this feels much like an alpha Early Access release title.1) You can only play this game with an Xbox controller. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea. I could see if there was an intricate control scheme much like maneuvering on your skateboard in the Skate franchise, but there isn't.2) Speaking of the controls, the only time you can even see them is during the loading screen which (Although great) goes by so fast you can only make out 1 or 2 buttons before you're back in the game. On top of this, it seems most of the controls don't even work. The basic scheme is A) Press the left stick forward to hit the ball. B) Press the B button during the special ""Smashbreaker"" mode and somehow use the left or right analog stick to steer the ball. None of the other controls I read seemed to do anthing.3) The game basically plays itself. Ready to go for the hole? Hit the stick and the ball magically flys in, ricocheting off of walls and objects as necessary to make a fancier end to the round. Granted, I only played 3 holes before I requested a refund, it seems there's no way to miss the hole. There is no aiming or planning or thinking required.4) The menu system is very wierd, in case you're looking for the Options screen, you need to go to Clubhouse first, then you'll find the settings for the game.Overall, I am very dissapointed with this game. I'm not really sure what the devs were going for here other than EXPLOSIONS, and, IT'S RUNNING ON THE UNREAL 4 ENGINE! Save your money for now and if they decide to drastically overhaul this game later down the line it may be worth it."

The first being that the game offers no form of guide or tutorial, and only the briefest of explanations as to what the controls are. The other being that the game ONLY supports an xBox controller.Here's the thing about all that: a lot of the problem there is that they couldn't be bothered to read up on what they were buying. They may have thought ""Ooo, Burnout! But with Golf!"" and just bought it outright. (Full disclosure: I was going to as well.) This is my solution: read. Do research. It took one (1) click once I got to the store page to find out that it needed a controler (if you don't count looking through the reviews, where it's plastered with negative comments about it). And as for the controls, it's in the options. A complete breakdown of how to play. It's conveniently listed under ""How to Play"". Now, some people want to be able to just jump right in and play with no delay, and I get that. But frankly, sometimes that just isn't the case.Don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect by any means. There's room for improvement all over the place. Better camera controls, more accurate movement, less resource intensive, there's definitely room to grow. As it stands right now, however, it's a good game that's fun to play, as long as you don't go into it already bitter (and have an xbox controller handy)."

,Not Recommended,405500,23351102,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Tagger,"EDIT!There was nothing stating that itonlysupported controller and that it was only a select number/brands of controllers, at the time of purchase. Stop whining about it clearly being stated now - It wasn't at the time - not even in the ""Additional Notes"" at the system requirements. The developer had to get contacted (Email, tweets and forum posts) in order for them to actually do this, so future buyers didn't run into this.EDIT!You NEED a controller to play this. Not just any controller. A Xbox 360/One-controller (or third party software to make a PS3/PS4 controller work). So make sure you have one!Can't play this with mouse and keyboard, which isn't stated anywhere - I actually had to ask, to get this info..Besides that point; the games runs at 30fps per default (you can apparently change that, but I didn't think that ""Clubhouse"" would be their term for ""Options"", so I didn't see this) and (for me at least) the ball movement seems ""slowed down"" (almost like slow-motion-like, of sorts) and kinda jittery. Can't see this being a thing of not meeting the requirements either (PC Specs on my profile). Sound tends to cut out as well, when smashing something, until you pause and unpause the game (which doesn't ""fix"" it all the time).Would I recommend this RIGHT NOW? - Nope. Not at all.Might this be a thing that's fixable? - Yup. Can't see how it's not. Nobody want's their game looking and performing, less than they want it to.TL:DR-ish:Not recommending it now.Despite only playing it for a mere 20-30 minutes.Bad performance (read: can't see them aiming for what I noticed above), sound issues and the actual need for a controller (lucky I had a few around), despite not mentioning this."

They should have given more hits per hole and allowed more control with a swing meter or something similar. Right now you just smash the ball and hope for the best.This game has a lot of potential and I really hope they're not done developing it because right now it feels like early access. Can't recommend right now but i'll change my opinion as and when updates are releasedUpdate: after the comment on my review I tried the game again. Spent a bit more time with it and came to the conclusion that PGA tour on the Genesis was a far more acomplished game with better controls and superior game mechanics. This game needs a huge overhaul before i'll even consider installing it again.

If you're familiar with Burnouts 'Crash Mode', then this game will feel right at home with you, as scoring big and creating as much destruction as possible is what it's all about.But take note of what's around you. Out of bounds & hazards can ruin your game in an instant, so make sure you take advantage of the fly by at the start of each hole. But they're not the only things to look out for. You need to go BIG if you want to get the Platinum medals, so shoot for any bonus cash holes to earn extra dosh or aim for the Smashdown targets littered around each course. Finding and hitting the 'secret' in each course will also give you a nice amount of cash.However, there's a catch. None of that matters if you can't sink the ball, so make sure you give yourself the room to make  that final putt, otherwise it'll all be for nothing.Overall, this really is a solid game and was quite a surprise. It's one of those games you come back to every once and a while, just make sure you've got a controller handy, cause it's best suited if you use one.Also turn Flex all the way up if your PC can handle it.

It has a golf ball and a hole to hit it into but thats about it. You have little to no control over power of the shot and directionality. The aim is to smash as much stuff in one shot (and extra time with fiery ball mode of doom) then you putt the ball. No skill is required in the slightest to putt the ball unless its behind scenery or suchlike. Otherwise, you can smash it like a drive right into the hole with no worrying. As it is, I wouldn't recommend the game. It would have been interesting if it required more input from the user. The most input that is required is LEFT and RIGHT, no UP and DOWN.A decent looking game but with too many flaws to overlook. The lack of genuine control is a deal breaker."

I had to make myself quit for a bit becuase I kept repeating the same level trying to up my score for a platinum trophy. It's totally the kind of game that you can go to play a few minutes and realize you've lost a couple of hours. If you like crash mode in Burnout get this game, you won't regret it."

So overall this is a fantasic game, i'm having alot of fun with and i'm not even a golf fan."
,Recommended,405500,23356326,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,TechhX,"CONTROLLER ONLY GAME RIGHT NOW BE AWARE.If you have an Xinput controller or ds4windows lets move on, The game is a physics based ""golfing"" game where you aim a ball at A LOT of physics objects in a room, you get a few swings and the goal is to get as much points as you can not get the ball in the hole in as little swings as possible. Hell on the putt shot there is very generous sweet spot where the ball will go in the hole, It took me 6 games to miss a shot, until then i thought it just auto went into the hole. It definitely has the feeling of Showtime mode from Burnout Paradise. The game runs great on a 980 Ti over 100 fps at 1440p Maxed out with all nvidia gameworks features enabled. . It is pretty dumb though that you cant use keyboard and mouse. But I garuntee its going to be in the first content update. There is also a bunch of levels, and in them you go back to the room and there will be different layouts too. I havent tried multiplayer yet because i havent been matched with someone so i cant report on that. But for $20 as long as you have a controller this game is a great value and its a really nice showpiece technical demo for unreal 4.Now all we need next is for three fields to work with epic and fix the mess that is the driving mechanics in unreal 4, and make a spiritual successor to burnout paradise, my favorite driving game EVER."

When I heard this game was coming to a PS; I asked if there would be a PS3 but nope then i found it was coming to Windows. Having already owned a PS4 controller I thought ""heck ya"" great compability!Personally I am loving it. Why? I have played Tiger Woods. I have played Hot Shots Golf. I have even played Planet Mini Golf and to be honest I'm really loving this game. It comes with challenges. Break this much in money to earn a Bronze Title. Break this much in money to earn a Silver Title etc,  In addition to the other unique challenges within the game. For example breaking all 4 gas stations will award you big bucks. Dropping your ball in the Money Flags will get you bonus $$ too. Breaking items in sets will help as well. Trick Shots; longer the ball goes away from target but into the Flag...huge payout!Admist my 117minutes of gameplay I have managed to complete 6% of the game, and get 3 Platinum awards; which btw is above Gold (and isnt shown for the amt to earn it).  There have been times where i'm having to redo a course several times in a row just to get what i want but thats all good I enjoy it!I tend to say ""ok 10minutes on this course then I'll give up""; but I manage to sink the ball and more courses become unlocked wanting me to play more and more lol"

Price isn't bad for some crashbreaking fun.If you have a mid-range computer you probably can't enjoy this game in full glory. My video settings are all turned down load, but the textures are set to High. Youcancap the framerate to 60Hz, which means there is actually 60 fps support.I think this would play better on a beefy computer, since it's Unreal Engine 4.However, having no keyboard or mouse support is kind of a loss. You do need an Xbox 360/One controller, or in my case, a Wii U Pro controller.Crashing the golf ball into a wine shelf distorts the audio, which could mean it's my laptop trying to process all the glass sound effects. Again, it's not a beefy computer. It needs more beef.Overall, until some performance patches are released I would recommend waiting until it's fully developed or if it goes on sale. Or just get it on PS4 then!EDIT: A 3.9 gig patch was just yesterday, didn't change much. Now downloading yet ANOTHER 3.9 gig patch. Kind of a messy launch going on..."

It's the heart of the game. Destruction. Make a mess. Destroy rich people's houses.Now for the bad:*No official Controlls for the Keyboard and Mouse:Granted this game is originally meant for consoles, this was made clear when they clearly choose to leave the keyboard/mouse out of this game, i have a 360 controller so i had no problems, but for people who would love to try the game but do not have a 360 controller with will be in for a dissapoinment.* Hard goals.The Controlls are slow, and that's okay... unless you're on a timer that's ticking down fast.The amount of time it takes to turn the momentum of the ball takes way to long to be able to destroy the next object.It's a bit unforgiving.The game is fun, and if you love physics then this is the game for you.Verdict:Gameplay: 7/10Music: 0/10 Annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥Physics: 10/10 would break again.Controlls: 3/10 (requires a 360 controller)Graphics: 10/10I hope the devs rais enough money to keep their company a flot.I read that the game director was scared out of his mind about the sales.Support them!"

It's a cool game!You basically get one tee off to cause as much destruction as possible (in slo mo if you want) and then you get a very simple 'hit or miss' put scenario to finish the hole.I really like it.Disclaimer: I've only played it for about 10 minutes.Another Disclaimer: I consider my purchase a direct contribution to the Burnout successor that Three Fields hopes to produce.

This had so much potential but it needed so much love and they just dont seem  to care.They couldnt even be bothered to release it with pc controls and the best they managed was 2 updates and not a word since july.  There is a good game here but we will never be able to see that game because they moved onto other stuff.I expected far better from you guys but thats what i get for trusting a new company please dont ever stain the name of burnout again in the future.

Unfortunately, although the game looks great, clearly it has *never* been tested on a pc:1.  No keyboard/mouse at all, not bad keyboard/mouse --none.  I'm not sure how they even managed to do that, it's like they wrote code specifically to anger PC gamers :(2.  Won't go into fullscreen if desktop scaling is on.  It renders a weird 1/2 screen view that is totally unusable.  Turn scaling off and its fine.  Desktop scaling is 15+ year old feature on PC :(3.  It will break your audio *system wide* again, no idea how they even did that.  If you run this game, your audio will break across all apps until you next reboot.  Kind of amazed about this.Either the devs are trolling us or just don't own a pc (how did they build this?) -- needless to say don't buy until there is some kind of update."

It's a great game to lose yourself in after a hard day at work. Smashing up bottles of champagne, expensive china, and antique vases. All in the name of destruction sake. Those looking for a more complex experience will be disappointed but those who want to have some good old-fashioned destructive fun with zero strings attached it's totally worth a look."
