,Recommended,405540,23915801,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Vino [Olive Garden],"I see so many games that want to be modern versions of NES classics. 90% of the time, they fail to emulate anything but the limitations of the medium - only two buttons, limited color palette, etc. Ninja Seki DX knows what made the greats of the era great, and what separated them from the hundreds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES games that we've all since forgotten about. Tight controls, challenging gameplay, and level design that teaches the player as they play.I really wish this had been released in 1990, where it would have gotten the acclaim it deserves. As of now, it sadly remains in the indie bargain bin alongside dozens of visually similar but far, far inferior retro-style platformers. Please give it a chance!"

You really should buy this game either if you're a huge fan and want some additional modes or if you want to support the developpers.As for me, I saw it featured ninjas, so I couldn't resist."

,Recommended,405540,21780167,"Posted: 11 March, 2016",all,makesound,"This is a great NES style action platformer in the graphical style of the GameBoy Color, but without the hardware limitations of eIther system. It plays like a super enhanced version of Mega Man. Super responsive controls in a visually retro package. I was a fan of the game in it's freeware edition and in some ways I prefer the previous incarnation. Mostly the soundtrack, but to my delight you can toggle betwwen the original score and the revised. Excellent game, buy it."

,Recommended,405540,30344364,Posted: 5 March,all,4Skinner,"A really under-rated game with excellent controls and a fair ammount of challenge.Includes Gameboy like graphics, a good nostalgia vibe and some very memorable songs."
,Not Recommended,405540,23778358,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Cone,"controls really well and has decent level design.  however, the mechanics are minimalistic to a fault and the difficulty is cheap, rather than genuine (i.e. lots of instant death traps that are a chore to avoid rather than a challenge).  this really limits the level design and overall gameplaydoesnt generate enough fun with its platforming; instead it rapidly goes between boredom and annoyance.  it's faithful to an older era and can be picked up pretty cheap though, so it could still be for you"
76561198041195703,Not Recommended,405540,24360926,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Terotrous,"This game looked cool, but unfortunately poor level design generally prevents it from being very fun.  The mechanics of this game are extremely limited (you have jump, double jump, and shoot, and that's it), and the levels themselves are also very linear and filled with pixel perfect jumps and cheesy instant kills.  This generally means there's only one way to handle any given situation, which causes the game to feel repetitive and eliminates any potential for skillful play.  On top of this, the enemies in the game also generally take way too many shots, which also makes the game feel fairly slow-paced and button-mashy.This game tries to be a throwback to Gameboy Color, but it possesses no interesting mechanics and would be a fairly mediocre game even if it had been released on that system (comparing this to, say, the GBC Goemon game really drives this point home).  It's a shame, too, because the game does possess moments where you can see there was some potential (for example, during the boss fights, which actually allow some degree of freedom and are generally the highlight of the game), but these moments are few and far between."

Only con i can find its that it could have more bosses variety."

The gameplay is hectic, there is a good variety of enemies and platforms, and the artstyle is charming, specially of you like japanese themed games. It offers the challenge of classic NES or arcade games, but without the unfair part and with really fluid and responsive controls. If you are into action platformers, this is definitely for you."
,Recommended,405540,32226582,Posted: 6 June,all,SuperPokeunicorn,"Ninja Senki DX does a good job of recapturing the feel of an NES game. It certainly has a has a charming aesthetic. The pixel art is well drawn with bold outlines and a varied color pallet. The soundtrack is also well composed and fits the Japanese aesthetic, taking inspiration from the game’s NES roots. The controls are tight and responsive, which is important in a platformer of this difficulty. While the game can get quite hard, the difficulty is never excessive, aside from a few frustrating boss encounters. The mechanics are simple and the level design is, for the most part, fair. The game is definitely on the shorter side, clocking in at just 3 hours for me, but there is enough content for the price point and the enemy and coin completion bonuses add a level of replay value. All in all, Ninja Senki DX is a game I’d recommend to anyone looking to scratch that “NES hard” itch."
,Recommended,405540,32379776,Posted: 12 June,all,wolf.and.shield,"A great little retro platformer.  The devs really nailed the old school platforming formula while managing to avoid feeling like a pastiche.  The art and graphics are bright and imaginative.  The challenge is tough but not impossible, and the game is great to pick up and play no matter if you have 10 minutes or an hour.  There is a lot of heart here for 5 bucks."
