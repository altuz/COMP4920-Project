,Not Recommended,405610,18647995,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,Manbeast,"I thought I'd give this a try, seeing how it's only $2. Unfortunately you get what you pay for and this game was sadly not particularly good.The gameplay is very simple, as demonstrated in the trailer on Steam. But that's also all there's to it: a very light shoot 'em up.The game is incredibly repetitive. Monsters come at you from the exact same angles every few seconds, making the game more of a pattern recognition exercise than anything. You have a basic attack that you can pretty much spam continuously and a whirlwind attack that needs to be charged but only kills certain enemies. The lack of a health bar, score meter or progress meter to the next boss is very annoying.Graphically there's really nothing to it. Playing it full screen is not recommended, as it makes all the ugly stand out.There's also not much sound. Aside from the looping organ music, the sound assets seem limited to a whopping 3 sound bites."
,Not Recommended,405610,26222242,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,TrapGod,"Where should I even start? The campaign mode is terrible. It has 3 levels, all of them which have a 10-minute long obstacle run that inevitably gets boring, frustrating and repetitive, followed by a boss fight that can be ended in as short as 15 seconds if you get some lucky shots and if you attack right off the bat. Besides the campaign mode, the current version offers survial mode, which is basically an endless torture of the same repetitive patterns of enemies and obstacles, the only difference being that bosses appear every 60 seconds.I'll be blunt about the mechanics: they just look like the developer/s wasted more time on prolonging the idiotic obstacle runs rather than actually working on the diversity of the game. The only things you can do are move left, right, and a tiny bit forward and attack in 2 ways: the normal, projectile attack and the whirlwind attack, which needs a second or so to charge and makes you invulnerable for a short period of time while also killing enemies in a very short range around you. That's literally the whole game. I wouldn't be bashing the lack of diversity of the game (it's normal in a game made in unity and with a cheap price tag) if it weren't for the awfully long levels.The enemies you will encounter are gargoyles, some banshees, wolves (most annoying enemy), and skeletal hands randomly placed in your path, while the bosses are cheap nicknames given to Nosferatu (The Phantom), The Headless Horseman (The Horseman) and Dracula (The Count, if I'm not mistaken), which have the same pattern of attacks over and over again, the only thing distinguishing them from the normal enemies being the increased number of hits required to take them down. A thing that I quite liked was the art style, I have to say that it turned out pretty well in my opinon.I certainly think that the game can be improved a lot and that an updated version with some fixes of the minor bugs in this one and added content (might as well have a bigger price, but I think it would be worth it) would have a pretty nice succes among the indie lovers. I can't reccomend it in its current state, maybe only for the trading cards and achievements (it will be a pain in the a** to get them all, trust me), but I do certainly hope that the game is not left unattended by the devs.TL;DR: A cheap game that might be worth getting at first glance, if you're looking for a couple of achievements (which are quite frustrating to get) and 3 trading cards, then go ahead, you might be satisfied with the purchase. But if you are looking for a nice little indie game for you to kill some time with, this game is certainly not what you're looking for (at least in its current state)"

I was very much disapointed with the overall experience.The only positive I saw in the entire game was the soundtrack which used classical music.Other than that: the gameplay and response of commands is sluggish(an absolutely essential feature in a top down shooter), the enemies are one of 4 types plus 3 ""bosses"". There is absolutely no effort to make a ""story"" not even one or two sentences at the begining of a level.I cannot recommend this game even if you get it for free..."

Sounds are quite limited. The gameplay is VERY repetitive.-This said, it doesn't cost a lot. There are no bugs, or close to none. It plays smoothly. The trailer, the screenshots are reliable. In a sense it's a work well done.Conclusion: You really get what you paid for. Almost nothing.

,Recommended,405610,24099192,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,AeonCarnby,"Ok,I heard some reviews about this game saying that it was bad and things like that,and after playing it,even for a short time,as the game is indeed,a little short, I can say that the game is not bad,it's not the best thing there is out there,but the gameplay is fun,it reminds me to the Touhou series or Galaga and games like those.What I can say is that,paying the full price is not worth it,maybe if you find this game during a sale,and you have nothing else to buy,you can get this one,I got it for almost 10 cents or in my coin (which is the Mexican peso (1 dollar=almost 19 pesos)) 2 pesos.The game was really fun and really challenging,altough it's only 3 levels,but those levels are quite fun,you have some of your generic horror monsters,ghouls,gargoyles,wolves,bats,etc. But you also face the scariest enemies on the game....WALLS AND TREES.Yes,during most of the time,those two will be your real nightmare,but you can have fun either way,the 3 main bosses are 3 classic horror monsters,Count Orlox or Nosferatu (Here it's called The Phantom but it looks more like Nosferatu),The Headless Horseman and also Count Dracula.But the most impressive detail of the game is the BGM,the music is all made of classic epic music, like Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,or Dance Macabre and New World Symphony 4th Movement. The Music actually makes a big atmosphere for the game,and it made me enjoy the little time I had playing it,altough,I'm thinking of playing the survival mode,which is HARD MODE,but the game is really fun,you can spend some fun times but as I said,you can have more fun if you know that you bought the game during a sale.I give it an 8.7/10 It's bun,but you can get some frutrated some times and those walls and trees,man,I'm gonna have nightmares with those,but you can still enjoy it a lot."
