Sorry, folks!I enjoyed it, but found it in parts a bit difficult. It's a great mix of brain-teaser and dexterity game, embedded in a plot you unveil during the game.You will spend a great deal of the game playing an increasingly difficult series of levels where you must jump over obstacles and shoot enemies in a 2D setting, going automatically from left to right. So if you enjoyed the Bit.Trip.Runner games you will enjoy this.Length of the game: 2-4 hours for 100 percent.Recommended: When on sale for 2.50€ or less."

After the massive underground success of the 4th wall breaking darling that is Undertale, I was prepared for the onslaught of indie titles that pushed the button of being self aware. But what tickles me about Pony Island in particular is that it’s clear that its developer, Daniel Mullens, wasn’t making an attempt to ride any meta coattails. Pony Island was released in January of this year—just a fistful of months after Undertale arrived to the delight of gamers and DeviantArt account holders alike—far from enough time to take the derivative route.Which means that as an artform, video games are taking a turn around the bend, here. We’ve gotten past what graphics and clever plot twists can teach us, and developers are responding to that by questioning the position of the player within the game’s universe. Which is sort of amazing. Of course there were isolated incidents: Psycho Mantis reading your memory card is fondly remembered for a reason. But we’ve reached the point where the meta role of a player within the game is being examined far more closely. And that’s exciting as hell.But I’m getting ahead of myself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoERkB0MDTs"

I've been trying so hard to get myself into arcade but it's just not my type. However, this game is able to incorporate so many different aspects of various genres of games into one simple, 2D, pixilized, and story-rich game. The thing that surprised me the most was when this game used a common steam feature to actually ""play"" me dead. I'm not spoiling too much here so you should find out by yourself by playing this game.This game isn't long. It took me 3.1 hours to beat it without using any community guide(I spent 7 hours on my first undertale run). The puzzles are fun and not extremely hard.I'm not sure if the game designer was trying to present a philosophical reminder to gamers or purely just to show how desperate he was to make a good game. I'll leave this to be answered by the designer himself.Also, great soundtrack. No offense to anyone who loves this game, but I can actually find a lot of similarities between Pony Island, Lisa the painful, and Undertale. Since both Lisa and Undertale were earthbound-inspired, I wonder if there is a tiny bit of connection between Pony Island and Earthbound as well. However, it is just my assumption. That said, all three games have their own merits and extremely positive reviews.So far as I know, there is at least one direct reference to an Undertale character in Pony Island(if you do the required thing).Final reminder before you play this game: Don't judge a game based on its graphics."

,Recommended,405640,20513656,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,AestheticGamer,"Pony Island is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, just know the game is about a couple hours long to beat normally, there's hidden collectibles that unlock the true ending, the base gameplay is a Runner-type of game with a few twists, and it plays with the idea of game development.Now slight spoilers ahead, but I'll try to avoid any major spoilers, just things you could figure out from the first 30 minutes of play.The idea of a 'corrupted' video game is not an original idea at this point, but this may be the best it's been executed thus far. Pony Island has you playing a corrupted Runner-type game starring a Pony, and the game at various points wants you to stop to ""Insert Your Soul,"" to continue in some way. The game is extremely meta in a number of ways, and is more about breaking the game than completing said tasks... Though breaking the game comes in a multitude of types, some feeling more natural, others more from a series of mechanics. Outside of the Runner Gameplay, the game mixes itself up quite often, with the most common mix-up being these puzzle type of scenarios that are supposed to represent programming where a key goes down a list with variable-changing stats, you need to get to a certain stat to unlock Red 'block' gates, and you do this by inserting commands into blank slots to perform some sort of function. It sounds complicated on paper, but the game paces these extremely well so that they're simple to understand at first and slowly build on themselves.There's a story here that develops, and one difference in this game compared to many other 'corruption' type games is its narrative angle. We seem to be playing some guy playing a cursed arcade machine, his 3D hands sometimes pop-up on the screen and sometimes we break off of the arcade screen to see glimpses of the world off the screen. There's another soul trapped in the game trying to help us out to make sure we don't meet the same fate, and we get a direct line of communication with the maker of the game who is updating the game based off of our 'playtesting,' and gets mad when we 'cheat' at his game and, 'don't play how it was intended.' The game is never scary, just sometimes a bit creepy and also has a good sense of humor, as well as some semi-commentary on aspects of game design, including author's intent and gratification they look for when making games, which I haven't seen explored really in any other game I've played.It's a fun ride, sometimes challenging, tricky to get the true ending without a guide, but an experience worth taking I would say. The gameplay is fun most of the time in all of its different forms, there's many twists and turns along the way, the narrative is nice backdrop to everything else, and the game successfully may catch you off-guard multiple times during its course. Probably the best realized attempt at a corrupted game to this point in time, and even outside of that, a fairly fun multi-layered experience in its own right."

This game is genius.Storyline:Basic breakdown is that you are trapped within some funky arcade machine that has gone vicious thanks to the devil himself deciding to be a programmer. Take the cover of the game.. Take what you expect the game to be and throw them out the window. Already as you begin, it's clear that something isn't right - Having to fix a broken and glicthy menu from the get go before you're able to commence the gameplay is a sign that the devil may not be as good of a programmer as he likes to think.As the cursed player of this hellish demon-game, you get whisked around from a chaotic, glitchy, broken world to a cutesey, diabetes-inducing pastel nightmare, with random logic puzzles thrown in, to fix Satan's buggy code. As you guide your pony through the devil's glitchy game, you can catch brief glimpses of who your character used to be before they were killed and trapped in the game. The story is gritty, blurred and as twisty as the day is long. Basically, it's fantastic.Gameplay:I feels as though I had to make an extra section *just* for gameplay because it's honestly that damn good. The ingenuity of the puzzles, the level designs and the text communication alone make it note worthy. Pony Island as a whole is magnificent and shows incredibly unique ideas put together insanely well. When something like this, running on such simple mechanics can set an atmosphere so well, it raises the bar for many other games to do the same.Also!Passcodesto keep tucked away until needed;Baphometand2023Graphics:The look of it makes it feel like a genuine ported arcade game. It's pixely, it's box-like, it's all kinds of good while been fairly simplistic.Menus:Broken because of Satan.Soundtrack:This goes from being an eerie and abrasive glitchy, retro, electronic style base for the tension and horror-ish atmosphere and then completely flips a coin to be colorful, cute and innocent with its uncomfortably cheerful electronic notes. The changes in this set the scene and is yet another thing that makes this game so unique, it's unlike anything you've heard before.Final Conclusion:Get this. Seriously. It's rare that games can really spice things up with something new. With that been said, unique ideas are one thing, but it's the fact that they are brought together well that makes Pony Island stand above the rest. It keeps you thinking, provides great atmosphere, keeps you on your toes and has so much hidden content perfect for those willing to look for it."

,Recommended,405640,20762713,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Munru,"TL;DR: 4/5 score. Neat story, interesting puzzles and elements. Great music. Got $5? Worth.You start up the game and immediately are confused by the title screen. So you took action and begin playing the game. You play as a happy little pony, where you are galloping across the field and jump past the fences, in hopes to beat the game, only to find out that something is wrong with this game called 'Pony Island'.It's hard to give a good review of this game without spoiling what it really is about. That being said, I would advise to go in blind (no playthroughs/walkthroughs), as you will find to be more satisfied of the game but I'll try my best to make it short and sweet while not including spoilers in here.The game isn't really scary (except maybe for some that were really looking for a 'pony adventure' game) but the 'psychological horror genre fits, as it does makes you think. The game isn't very long, I would say that the average one would need to complete the game would be around 2 hours. However, it makes up for it by introducing neat new elements as you progress, like 4th wall breaking interactions, new puzzle elements, and more interesting secrets to discover.All in all, I think this is one of those indie games that stands out and for the right reasons. Good story, interesting gameplay, good music (at least I personally think so), and cool game elements. The game doesn't cost very much, so I would say that it's very much worth for the price."

I still took a chance.Oh god I wasn't deceived at ALL! This game is truly amazing !! Such an original concept, very interesting story. gameplay is super fun as well! I had a great time and I was super happy that there wasn't any jumpscares or stuff like that!

I expect report in greater depth soon, but I was so compelled by what I encountered during one session to wish to be certain that my friends saw something about it while it's still ""sale cheap."" After all, it is one of the highest rated games on Steam.I like computer games very much, and have played many of them over the past 30 years+. But there are few (VERY few) that I would catagolize as ""genius"". With Pony Island I wouldn't hesitate to do so. The way Pony Island is structured is staggering in it's complex ""comes the dawn"" manner. Without any idea what to do, or what's happening, you find that what needs to be accomplished has already been done at your hand, with only the vaguest idea that you actually DID know what to do, and did it. And what you did to succeed makes complete sense!Pony Island is GREAT FUN, and you may quickly fill up your screenshot library as I did, since you'll want to share every hilarious, bizarre moment of the game with your friends.Look...it's cheap, and you can get a refund...right?

Its a pretty intermediate puzzle game, making ita more casual play style if you are familiar with it. Excellent for new players as well.However the game only contain's 3 game mechanics;*a side scrolling platformer in which you have to avoid obstacles and fight enemies**redirection puzzles which most puzzle-gamers might not find enjoyable about a 2 playthrough because the solution is the same**A click and scroll computer and graphical interface while may seem to be challenging only because you are rarely shown and told where you need to go, it often takes alot of random luck and fumble to go where you need to advanceThe story is great, original and replayable to a point where its not repetitve .

However after spending a few minutes with the game you get a clue about what's really happening with the game.Spoiling the plot and puzzles of the game would certainly drain the magic which lies withing every level of Pony Island. Without revealing too much information, there's plenty of puzzles and secrets to be found, nothing that will hinder progress or force you to open guide, yet at the same time challenging enough to give you a (sometimes false) sense of satisfaction when you finally finish a level of find a secret.The game is riddled with meta references, to the point of absolute ridiculousness and at the same time it fits with the overall narrative (?) of the game. Truth be told, there's little replay I value once you find all the secrets and the game itself is quite short, yet at the same time Pony Island is superb at being overally bizarre and extremely fascinating to play through.You could argue that the game might have a few similarities with Undertale, on the overall pixely style,meta gamereferences, story-telling devices, but truth be told Pony Island a very unique experience and dare I say a breath of fresh air for gaming.I'd like to thank the developers for the innovative ideas and it is without a doubt I have to say this game is a must buy for everyone, it is definitely worth it to get this gem and I'm hopeful we will see more in the future, via a spinoff or an outright sequel."

,Recommended,405640,21973417,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,Emperor Gandhi,"Pony Island has interested me ever since I first learned of its existence when it first came out. It looked interesting enough, so I figured I would probably pick it up and give it a go whenever I had some spare money on me. That day came, and after going through this game in my freetime, I'm pretty content with the end result. Pony Island is one of the most original games in years, and my brain needs some repairs after I got through with the game.GraphicsThere isn't really much to say about the graphics. It's all sorts of things. On one hand, it's a happy pony game that a brony could probably enjoy, while on the other hand, the game is black and white with some other colors to make the game feel a lot more demonic, which pretty much sums up this entire game. There are hints of ""realism"" here and there, but for the most part it's a Unity game with a unique twist to it.GameplayThe gameplay doesn't have much to it either. The overall idea of it is simple enough. Shoot lasers at bad guys and jump. They didn't screw up with that (although it was difficult to mess that up anyway) and the puzzles are pretty solid. They're usually pretty simple but occasionally you'll run into one that makes you think long and hard. However, I do have my complaints here. Although the gameplay is simple and more reliant on the story, there are some parts to the game that feel really tedious. I will not get specific for the sake of spoilers. Also, again with the spoilers thing, the final boss did feel a little disappointing. It was very easy, and I was expecting a challenge considering who it was.StoryHere's where Pony Island is truly special. I don't think I've ever seen a game get more crazy with breaking the fourth wall as much as this one. Actually, this game showed me the most creative and clever fourth wall break I've ever seen in anything: movies, shows, video games, everything! I won't spoil it, but it's towards the end of the game, and I was genuinely shocked and tricked, something I don't say very often considering that I'm a ruthless and manipulative dictator. The rest of the overall story was very interesting. I was on the edge of my seat every minute, and I was waiting for some other trick to come my way and screw me over. This was the entire game, well, until the end. Although I was excited to finish the game and see what the finale would be, I felt it was very underwhelming to be honest. The ending wasn't THAT bad, because I don't mind endings whereit's open to interpretationbut I felt the game was missing something. With the final battle and that overall part of the game, I was bored and just wanted it to get overwith, simply for the reason you couldn't lose. I wish the fight had some more buildup, and the fight itself was actually exciting. However, it felt more like a chore and the story ended on a ratherbleghnote. However, the rest of the game was really interesting, and the finale was nowhere near as disappointing as something like Firewatch.AudioNot much to say here, but I am actually pleasantly surprised with the music. It felt very fitting, and made the game a lot more intense and enjoyable. Not to levels of something like Undertale or Mega Man, but it was still very good for a game like this and fit the mood perfectly.ReplayabilityI cannot get into detail about the replayability without spoiling part of the game, so check the score at the bottom for my opinion.VerdictIn the end, Pony Island destroyed part of my brain, and I'm going to have to fix it whenever I get an oportiunty, uh, I mean, opportunity. It feels fresh and creative, something rare to say about games today. I don't see this game as something revolutionary that will be remembered as a huge cult classic, but for what's it worth, it should be remembered for how clever this game was when it comes to toying with your mimed, oops, I meant mind.Graphics- 7.5/10Gameplay- 7.5/10Story- 9.0/10Audio- 8.5/10Replayability- 6.5/10.:8.2/10:.+Creative presentation+Mind-blowing plot+Fun puzzles+Surprisingly good music+Extremely clever4th wall breaks-Underwhelming final boss and ending-Occasional tedious segments"

,Not Recommended,405640,26365244,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,TheTitaniumDragon,"Pony Island is one of those very meta games. You appear to be playing a game on an old arcade machine, but as the game progresses, it quickly becomes clear that the arcade may not be what it seems, and the game itself is not what it seems. Satan seems to want your soul, and you, quite obviously, aren’t going to give it to him.Played via a virtual CRT monitor, the game quickly breaks down. The core game of Pony Island, where you play a pony jumping over a series of barriers, is broken up with puzzles involving redirecting keys to hack the game, as well as desktop sections where you communicate with another person trapped in the game, as well as constant mockery from Lucifer himself, who tries to convince you to give him your soul to unlock (intentionally terrible) gameplay, and who complains as you keep breaking his games (he worked so hard on them!).Over the course of the game, you confront three demons in three different battles of wits and solve a number of fairly simple puzzles, all while the game holds up a very thin sheen of not being some sort of demonic thing that might cost you your soul.Unfortunately, while the game itself is a neat concept, all in all it isn’t terribly fun to *play*. The actual gameplay is intentionally simple and samey, and unfortunately, hanging a lampshade on that fact doesn’t make it any more fun. The puzzles are okay but generally nothing to write home about, and while the sheer variability of the thing is interesting at times, at other times you are spending very long stretches doing the same thing over and over again, which just isn’t very much fun.The core game of Pony Island is deliberately bad and unfortunately, deliberately bad is still bad.All in all, I can’t really recommend this. It is a neat idea, but it just doesn’t really end up feeling like it has enough payoff to be worthwhile. It lacks the feeling of profundity you got from games like The Talos Principle; instead, it is just very simplistic and while it presents itself as what it is, ultimately what it is is nothing all that special. After you understand what it is, there’s little left for you here, and while it is only about two and a half hours long (maybe less), it still wore thin by the end. The moments of cleverness simply aren’t worth the time investment."

The puzzles are very simplistic, really not living up to the liberty of the meta form.It was a decent enough two hours, but doesn't provide anything you won't get from a flash game, and is absolutely a case of wasted potential."

You'll spend a decent portion of it playing a bare bones moving platformer and the other part of it hacking the game via puzzles.  There's a fair amount of dialogue as well since you'll often have people talking to you.  There are collectible tickets which unlock a hidden ending if you collect them all.It's hard to talk much about the game without spoiling anything.  It's interesting, I beat it in one sitting because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  It's also very clever.  You'll likely find yourself laughing at some of the dialogue or things that happen.  The game is also very unique.  I would have a hard time thinking of another game like it that I've played.Only a couple gripes about the game.  1.  It's short.  Expect anywhere from 2-3 hours unless you're really looking around hard for those tickets or other secrets.  2.  I didn't mind playing the platformer mini-game most of the time, but there are 1-2 areas where it goes on a little overly long and it can be a tad tedious during those segments.  3.  While most of the puzzles are fun, they are also often pretty simple.  You'll usually blow through them pretty quickly.  There are 1-2 late game puzzles that are somewhat obtuse in their solutions which could take a couple minutes of thinking or just random guessing to get through.Pony Island is a game that provides a fun, interesting, and unique experience. The strengths of the game allow it to overcome the few shortcomings that it has.  Certainly a game that I'm happy I played."

Pumpkins!,"I love games that mess with games as a medium, and this game gives me ever reason to.While the gameplay can be dull at moments, its creativity exceeds in its other aspects, such as its self-awareness and tricking the player. There are moments when I was yelling at my monitor as the game tricked me into something so obvious that I shouldt've fallen for it. (That sounds really vague, I know. But I musn't spoil anything. Describing around the game is the best I can do.) Not to mention as the game gets much more interesting as it preogresses as you learn about the purgatory you're trapped in. You'll need to play it many times over to capture all of the secrets of the story, that is if you chose to.I'm going to compare it to Undertale, as both games mess with a lot of aspects of video games, but both are actually vastly different in how they present thier story. Though, saying that, I do feel Undertale does its job better than Pony Island in the way of character development and player engagement. This is not to say Pony Island is mediocre, it is actually very much not so, but Undertale was a much more meaty game that had me thinking about it for weeks after finishing it. Pony Island isn't forgettable, but I don't think I'll be thinking about it as much as Undertale.Other, less important things, such as control handing and bugginess, I had no issue with. The game is very well polished. Not to mention the sountrack is pretty damn good.Pony Island is a brilliant game about games that tricks the player and tells a story not only about the devil, but games as a medium.8/10, Superb"

Let's do it!""~The Two Drunkards who came up with the initial concept of Pony Island.Lets start with this, if you plan on buying this game at all, DO NOT SPOIL IT FOR YOURSELF. Most of the fun from this game comes from the ""What's next?""Anyways with that said I rate this about a 7/10 overall.Price - 10/10 - you can't get better than 5 bucks.Gameplay - 8/10 - the game play overall is fun and enjoyable, with a few simple mechanics that kept me intrested and puzzles that were fun and somewhat challenging near the end.Story - 7/10 - The game overall has a story to it yes, and it's engaging and keeps you intrested. To be honest I liked it a lot, but it's not going to compete with games like ""Life is Strange"" and ""Clannad"" and so on. The story at its base was crap, however incorperated into this game it was funny and very entertaining.Replayability - 4/10 - This is where the game falls off significantly. You play through it once and you've seen it all, okay maybe twice, but you're not going to have the same experiance or challenges. It's a one time game, which for 5 bucks is perfect.Anyways I wont be writing any oppions about Pony Island story so as not to spoil the game. I would recomend pick the game up for sure, it's a very well done game and worth the play through."

Comedy ensues?Just know of you read any further into this review, you might end up spoiling the game for yourself. This one thing hate about alot of clever indie games that are trying to follow in the steps of games like Undertale. So just know, I might end up mentioning certain things that will spoil parts of the game. So, here we go!Also, it's best you go in blind.I supported Pony Island when it started off on Steam Greenlight. When checking out the free Game Jam version and playing it all the way through, I saw potential in this game and made sure Steam knew that I wanted that game and I guess many others did too.Pony Island, like Undertale, meta-games a decent bit but more towards the end than anything else. It is also kind of clever in it's execution of how game tells a different story then what you shown. From what some people have speculated, it shows how some game developers go through hell developing a game. I kind of support this idea but meh this is a review not an episode of Game Theory starring MatPatThe gameplay of this game is sub-par. The Platforming is solid and fun and the hacking minigames aren't too bad durning the first act. Then the second act comes in and then these parts of the game become repetive. They are really nice break though and give the player some interaction side from navigating a desktop or moving a pony across the world map. The first two boss fights aren't that great.[SPOLIERS STARTING]The first is just four hacking minigames where it's like Connect Four in a way as you and the demon take turns placcing certain code blocks. The final hack of this fight however, brings in the challenge and makes you plan your moves a bit better. The second boss fight is the platforming sections where you are chasing a demon as it throws down giant rock spikes and creating fissures for you to jump over while you shoot the glowly bits on the demon's face. The third fight however... lets just say it was clever. Really. Damn. Clever. This is where the meta-gaming truly comes as the demon uses your computer to mess with you durning the battle requires you to stay focused. The final fight is just another platforming section where you try to keep as many souls alive as possible while trying to survive the game having it's memory dumped.The games plot is kind of cryptic, requiring you to really look at things from different angles to understand what is going and having you find the secert demons that lie with in the game. Also, to get the final ending, it requires you to collect 24 tickets that are hidden throughout the game. Some aren't that hard but others are like hidden to point that you need the guy who made the game tell ""There is a ticket if you do X task and go to Y location.""The music in this game, as with alot of great indie games, are freaking amazing. The small 8-bits tunes you here as you play the game are very good and they match each situation well and can work well outside if their intended area if you want to play a different game with Pony Island's music.I like Pony Island and it's great if you are looking for a game to kill some time with. It's not a life changing experience but it's good, different, and clever in what it does. However, I wouldn't say its the next Undertale.RATING8/10"

It's an experience best served without any headsup of what to expect. However, if you won't mind going in a little informed, read on.The game puts you onto an arcade machine to play the ""supposedly"" Pony Island, only to find it's far less about Ponies and more about giving you an experience that would like to break any chains of what game experiences you've had before. It isn't afraid to go tearing down the fourth wall. There were times I wondered if this  was supposed to happen, or if the game had broken into some kind of unrepairable state. It plays with your mind, and like to throw in some horrors while it's at it.Pony Island features a mix of ""out of this world"" settings that makes one wonder at its marvel. On one side of the coin, it features mini-games such as jumping over hurdles and some (usually very well crafted) puzzles. On the other it's a mind boggling trip down acid lane. Most of what you see is usually not what's going on at all; a carpet covering up something completely else - and it's a joy to find out what kind of twisted dark hole you'll end up in next.

She was very scared that she had been tricked into giving her soul away to play an endless runner. I had to explain to her that Satan didn't make the game, and her soul wasn't in jeopardy. The last game I got her she wasn't this scared. I'm worried too, because this game encouraged her to poke around in e-mails and try ""hacking."" I don't think these are good values.

Kids these days are often focused more on cartoons than on their well-being, mentally or spiritually. I didn't play games growing up back in the 80's where they were all fake tennis because we just liked playing real tennis, or hell, Football. Final Fantasy was a joke because my high school fantasy came true... Yes that's right, I've been married for 15 years now. I don't get most games because they're either messageless crap for nerds like dungeons or dragons and the the ones that are about real problems (war) are too hard for me to play.  ANYWAY My daughter learned a lesson about trusting strangers and guarding yourself. The love of my life might think I'm being harsh but sometimes the world is scary and our daughter needed to learn that. So maybe you won't find a videogame that steals your soul but if you did would you be ready? I know my pride and joy would. What else could a dad ask for?10/10"

I've read people being quite disappointed for this, which is nonsense.This is NOT Undertale.But this game is good.Really good.Pony Island is a game-within-a-game and you, the player, are trapped in a satanic arcade game about ponies. I know, this sounds weird and stupid, but believe me: this game will surprise you. It's really original, surprising, totally crazy. A little gem. But it'll be worth your money (expecially if you buy it during Steam sales) and time. And soul.There's a variety of mini-games and puzzles in Pony Island, so get ready to challenge yourself. The first ones are really easy, but as it goes on the puzzles become more difficult - I got stuck on a couple of puzzles and then realized I was an idiot since the puzzle wasn't THAT hard, so keep calm and do it for the ponies.The story itself can be quite confusing, but there's a huge mystery surrounding this game and the ""player"", and you'll definitely be interested in knowing more. Oh, and somewhere in the game there's a nice Pokémon reference. Eheh.This game has tons of secrets and 24 tickets to find, and believe me...you should find them all. Do it. Once you've finished the game you can re-play various acts, so you can easily go find the ticket you didn't get - do it. Just do it. Don't delete the game before finding them all.Also the music is amazing and perfect for the game's atmosphere. I'll definitely purchase the soundtrack soon.Of course it also has some flaws. The game is quite short, some puzzles will make you REALLY angry while others are probably too easy and boring. Finding all the tickets is not that easy, some of them are well hidden and you'll need a guide/walkthrough to get them all.To sum up, this game really surprised me. I was expecting a twisted game, and I was right. I was soooo right. It's really funny, I enjoyed it a lot, despite how quick it is. I definitely rate it 4/5.Buy this game and make Satan happy.

Oh wait, what's this little game...So what is this game I asked myself as I booted it up. What I got was the most meta-narrative ever mixed with perplexing puzzles. The plot, while basic, is investing enough to keep you hooked in a single-play session. It's a simple meta-narrative where there is always 4th-wall breaks and everything, but if these things are done well then it's ground-breaking.This game does it very well. The gameplay is also basic but makes very good use of  a gradual learning curve as more aspects are introduced, this goes for both action levels and puzzles. So everything sounds alright, but what is amazing about the game. Well you see this game loves it's atmosphere, you are always in the action and as things progress. You see as the coded walls crumble and the more evil intentions of Pony Island. It invests you into the front seat better than most games I've played.So yes, this game is short but it's got an gripping  atmosphere and an intresting meta-narrative to boot. It's got good gameplay and even some replay vaule. It's definetely one of my favorite games I've played this year and I recommend you try it.

You will feel scared playing it too.It loves to trick you and your mind a lot and you feel like a a toy.  You're always being played with, tricked, and tested.  The gameplay is simple and has a little of many genres: action, platforming, adventure, story, puzzle, trivia, etc.   It's definitely a wild ride and really fun to play!There is a story behind the character for you to discover.  Unfortunately, you have only two times during the game to ask one of three sets of questions for each.  Both times offer more than 6 different questions, which demands you to play the game over and over until you find them all.  Sadly, the puzzles are always the same and since you've kind of lived the experience already, it isn't as fun.  The majority of the game, what makes it interesting, is the puzzles and unique gameplay you experience mostly on your first time, so playing it over and over just for these questions isn't really worth it.I haven't really gotten all of them yet, so I'm not sure if you're rewarded anything other than an acheivement at the end, but if you REALLY want to know what's happening, go ahead and try.And I'm not epileptic or able to have seizures, but the graphics did give me a few headaches and hurt my eyes a few times.  The only colors you see for the most part are bight red and blue (3D glasses effect), white, and black.  These colors jitter around a lot and there is a lot of fast paced portions in the game that may mess with you.  PLAY THIS WITH CAUTION!  And also take a few breaks when you can, it may help.But anyway, this game is worth the money.

76561198030948684,Recommended,405640,24098591,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,someblk,"So I'm not a reviewer.  In fact before today I had reviewed exactly one game and that was toward the pillar of the community achievement and was just me saying hey this is great you should get it.However playing Pony Island made me want to say something about it.I'm not sure where I can even start or finish without ruining it but I'll do my best..So from the store page you can easily read that it's game inside a game.  That being it's a game machine you play which has been written by Satan and which he controls and which you play but also have to hack to progress the story.I always found myself wanting to continue on and see where I would go next.  That's important.  I wanted to see where it would go but at the same time I always felt in control and that I was driving it forward.There are 3 main aspects to the game:* Pony Island* Hacking* The StoryAs such I'll break it down.Pony IslandSo these are sections that you play the part with the pony.  Jumping, flying, and as befits this game shooting lasers from your eyes to kill butterflies.I felt this part of the game was done perfectly.  There wasn't so much as to get sick of it, but more enough to fit with the fact that you are playing a machine named Pony Island.  I also felt it was balanced well with harder levels providing more challenge and sometimes some lost lives, but never too much for you to get sick of it.HackingSo several parts of the game require you to hack the Pony Island machine to progress and to not submit to Satan's will.I found these sections challenging but at the same time not so difficult as for you to get sick of them (which would have happened if they were overly difficult).A later section turns the 'hacking' into part of the Pony Island game where butterflies replace progression of code, and one of these was particularly devilish, but with a bit of experimentation it can be overcome.The StorySo for me personally this ties it all together.  The game wouldn't survive without the underlying premise and the story you follow.As I mentioned earlier though it never quite feels like you are following a story, but more like you are involved in one, and it's being written along with you, and those are the best kinds of stories.The game throws a few curves and a small amount of fourth wall breaking moments, one of which I really had to applaud and caught me very off guard,The game always makes you want to find out what will happen next, and that is the essence of a good story.OverallThe best I can say here is the game made me write a review, something I've never really done after 6(? I think) years of service and 200 Steam games.  I'd give this top marks and anybody who wants to play something a bit different should give it a shot.Money wise it's £4 and provides about as many hours of play on a single play through.  I'll be taking a second to unlock some extras, but if that's not your thing just consider it 4 hours of play time."

Witch is pretty fun to me.This game also has a little humor and dramatic feeling to it. But mostly an eerie atmosphere.And this causes to keep you on your toes as the story develops.And I guess it needs a little criticism unfortunately, but do not be worried because it are just little things I experienced.At first the tickets, they may be hard to find even for me. But it does give it some replay value thought to collect them all. And also, the puzzles can be a little hard. And sometimes it's just a little luck what kind of bothers me.And as last but not least, the soundtrack of this game is amazing.I even bought it.So, should you buy it? Yes! You should absolutely try it, even if it is not your taste.And just add this gem to your library.I'm sorry if my English sucked.At some part of the game, it really tricked me with their fake crash and steam pop up.

,Recommended,405640,28800557,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,SupremeS,"Pony Island is a game about an arcade cabinet that is secretly controlled by Satan for the sole purpose of harvesting human souls. Yeah. That one sentence on its own should give you some indication at how surreal and unique this game is – it’s an experience that takes the rulebook, shreds it to pieces, and succeeds in many ways at writing its own.At its core, there’s two main gameplay parts to Pony Island. The first is the arcade game itself; a simple side-scroller which sees you jumping over fences and keeping enemies at bay with your pony lasers. Yes, you are reading that correctly. The second is a sort of hacking minigame, which sees you moving command blocks around to trigger certain events and results at the right moment. This might sound a little confusing, I admit, but rest assured it’s remarkably intuitive once you start playing. The difficulty scales up nicely for both parts of the gameplay, and while some later moments are hard enough that multiple failures are likely, it never gets close to reaching the point where you feel like giving up. The only real critique I have here is that these parts of the game start to get a little tiring by the story’s end, by lieu of frequent repetition. You’ll be much more interested about everything that’s going on around you – because that’s where things start to get really interesting...You see, Pony Island has no issue with screwing with your mind. Whether it be via disturbing messages, odd visual distortions, or unsettling (and, to be honest, slightly annoying) sound effects, you will end up feeling rather uneasy at frequent intervals. As the story rolls on this psychological manipulation gets cranked up to eleven, to the point where it becomes challenging to keep your cool as everything goes really goes to hell. I’m naturally not going to spoil the precise nature of what happens, but rest assured there was one moment in particular that really startled me in a big way. Heck, even when I reached the end, I was honestly questioning whether I was still playing – trapped in the same way as the character I was just controlling. It's a bizarre experience.Perhaps the cleverest thing about Pony Island, however, is the way it affectionately pokes fun at video game conventions and the wider community that surrounds them. Typical tropes such as level grinding, ‘premium’ versions of popular video games, and forced tutorials are all bought up and subverted. It’s done in a clever manner whereupon the goal is not to shred these things into pieces and critique how rubbish they are, but instead more to poke fun at them in a light hearted manner. Satan even provides you with his frustrated ramblings about the fact that you’ve come in and started wrecking all his hours of programming work, as is the peril of modern game development nowadays. It could come across as smug – a developer lording himself over his players and making endless comments about how much smarter he is than everyone else – but instead the game manages to deftly work away from that, in a way that makes you more nod in agreement than frown in discontent.Pony Island, then, is something that you really need to get around to experiencing. It’s not the longest title in the world (with any replay factor mainly coming in the form of collecting tickets that I guarantee you will end up using a guide to find), but it’s certainly one that sticks in the mind. Indeed, at this low price, you’d be a donkey if you didn’t pony up the cash.And yes, I make no apologies for that pun."

Again.""That's about accurate free literation of my thoughts after an hour in Pony island.Now, this. To do something like this takes a touch of a mad genius. It's a nearly perfect mindjammer, insane borderline case between an arcade, puzzle game and one big metagame that challenges your concepts of gaming and reality. I kid you not - just play till the end and ask yourself after the credits and the final scene, did you feel yourself comfortable? Really? Did you? Without spoiling anything, start it as a silly experiment and get prepared for it to screw you sideways and leave your mind weeping and insecure. In the bottom of it lies a hard black core of comical but deep existential horror that made me laugh quite uneasilly a few times.The execution is near perfect, only one really annoying puzzle that feels more random than thought out when you solve it - any other parts feel like small but satisfying victory, when you find a way through the games ""bugs"" and ""distractions"". Plus, the whole package costs literally pennies. There are no excuses to leave your sanity intact. Play Pony Island and weep, big man."

,Not Recommended,405640,29955184,Posted: 15 February,all,Faxxaxascist Lard,"It's hard to give this either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Conceptually, the game is great, but in execution it's largely repetitive. The first hour or so of the game is basically comprised of three mini games that require little-to-no skill, repeated over and over with slight variation. The color palette is essentially monochrome, with the exception of a few cyan and red outlines, maybe a remnant of an abandoned 3D-anaglyph mode. Because of the lack of color, there's nothing to distract your attention away from the monotony of jumping over hurdles.You jump over a lot of hurdles in this game. When you're not jumping over hurdles, you'll spend your time solving logic puzzles a la Space Chem, minus the challenge or the fast forward button. In between these, it's mostly a game of hunting for small bouquets of red and cyan to click on to advance to the next hurdle-jumping exercise.In isolation, none of these are terrible. The problem is that they feel more like gimmicks and side-projects than full-blown games, yet they're stretched out over the entire playthrough, and it takes what seems like forever before they begin to have any sort of variation or challenge.The meta game, however, is just interesting enough to keep you going, and the last part of the game is superbly done. I was completely taken aback (that's not something I ever say about video games) by a certain act near the end of the game. I won't spoil that part, but I will say that the hurdle-jumping does, eventually, get some variety and a degree of difficulty. So do the puzzles.Pony Island works conceptually. It almost works in practice, but it's just too long. Removing three-fourths of the padding in the beginning of the game would solve that; I'd recommend this game with gusto. In its current state, though, it feels like a first draft. Very promising, but rough. Someone needs to come along and edit it."

From the opening moments of the game you're confronted with a start menu that refuses to work. You have to investigate other options to figure out why. This involves fixing the “code” of the software. Nothing too complex, the puzzle segments of the game presents a key that lowers line by line, from beginning to end, over and over again in a loop.Your tasked with replacing certain lines with different Uno-style blocks and arranging them in a way that forces the key to the correct end point, thus fixing the option to play. These involve arrows that make the key jump lines, while eventually becoming more complex with added teleportation and duplication mechanics later on.Soon enough you make your way into Pony Island after fixing the start option and you're presented with a pretty lame game. You play as a pony controlled with the mouse. The left button jumps and you can rotate your head by moving the mouse around. Jump over the gates. Do it again. YAY! YOU WIN!!! Now, insert your soul to continue.If you're looking for a great, unique horror game, you've found it. I couldn't recommend this game enough. Outsmarting the evil at work feels so satisfying. Every click, drag, fix, and play with Pony Island feels like progress. That dull hum of the machine, the slow uncovering of secrets and various encounters with characters via text messaging all work very well to create a genuinely unsettling atmosphere. Everything great about the Horror genera is here with an interesting narrative that's heavy with laughs and fun to play."

Not that half of it is very much, it's small, but more on that later.  Since people seem to like them, here's some pros and cons:Pros:Extremely self-aware. - I hate to bring it up, seeing how many people apparently believe it's the singular cause of the Holocaust or something, but if you liked what Undertale did with the fourth wall you'll probably like this.Never anything short of clear-cut and understandable. - Though the game does have some challenge to it, failure never sets you back too far so you have plenty of opportunities to learn.Good soundtrack. - It's solid and no track gets repetitive before it ends.Cons:Obnoxiously intellectual? - I know a lot of people think of being intimate with the fourth wall as a cheap way to make the game ""smarter"".Short as hell - Like, getting all the actual content, but for a few secrets, takes at most three hours.  Playing normally.  It's kind of sad, but hey, the game is five dollars.8-bit aesthetic. - Once again, I don't mind it, but a lot of people I've seen around Steam have this obnoxious ""I HATE THIS GAME"" response the second they notice it has any visible pixels."

There are some cool and well made meta- and breaking the fourth wall moments - a particular one had me surprised, confused and almost uncomfortable - but unfortunately, they tend to drown in the flow of repeating puzzles. The idea of the puzzles aren't bad, the problem is that they never increase in difficulty and comes constantly throughout the game, which is a combination that gets repetitive and boring after a while. Fortunately, the storyline is interesting and bizarre enough to keep you intrigued.Nevertheless, Pony Island is a neat, short little game with a brilliant setting that, despite the puzzle flood, feels refreshing and overall fun. 7/10, would kill Jesus again."

It has SHMUP and Jump'n'Run elements, which are done well, although sometimes a bit repetitive. And as it's building up an eerie-horrorish atmosphere, it does so without the use of jumpscares.I finished this game after 2,6 hours, which might be a bit longer than it might take others. And I played it in one take. This is one of the fewer games I finished in a long time, and I really liked it.

The variety of play is impressive and challenging, and it lends well to immersion - as does it allowing you to genuinely express yourself, which I appreciated. Secrets extend replayability, and the game is stuffed with clever hints that facilitate the experience.Overall, this is a stunningly well put-together and graphically strong world to spend time in. It's a creative achievement, and it represents the dividends of recent titles it clearly drew inspiration from - especially when it comes to the ending.(e.g. Undertale, The Stanley Parable, Portal)Oh, and the soundtrack is pretty darn good.

It's a hard game to review  because giving any details about it would end up in me spoiling it. If I had to give this game a genre, I'd say it was a puzzle game for the most part (although there are some light platforming sections that are in the game but never really get too diffficult). There is a character that you interact with (which I won't spoil) that reminded me of Glad0s from portal with how sadistic yet funny they were. In fact, the entire game has a great sense of humor. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little on the short side. Although there are some collectibles that extend the life of the game, going through main game without getting them can be done in about a couple of hours. So be warned that if you're expecting this game to keep you engaged for tons of hours you may end up disappointed. But, if you're just looking for a game with great quality for a few hours then you should pick this one up. I give it a solid 8/10 for it's creativity and being a nearly flawless game."

If you're really on a budget, then Undertale costs $10 and this game costs $5, but Undertale has about... 3 paths and a total of about 8 endings depending on your choices in game.So if you want to buy a gimmicky and somewhat-interesting-in-concept game, then get this.If you want a game that does the same but does it better and has far more content and has more to say, then go with Undertale."

Pinkett,"This game is a strange mix of runner-style platforming and puzzles, with elements of glitch horror, satanic themes, and some undertones of the difficulties of game development, including self-doubt and criticism from the public.You're trapped in the Devil's own game, ""Pony Island"", and find that it's a barely-functioning purgatory that you have to fix, and further break, in order to escape with your soul intact. Plenty of twists and turns in a fun, compact, game that's easy on the wallet.Absolutely recommended, play it before watching any LP's or extensive reviews.Pros:+ Really cool concept and great execution.+ Genuinely creepy moments, a very fresh take on horror.+ Puzzles get progressively more challenging, and feel great when you complete the trickier ones.+ Only $5.Debatables:+/- Short, at about 2 hours long.+/- Ponies may be offputting to some, but as the trailer says, it's not really about the pony.+/- Offensive to religious people?

The puzzle parts are fairly trivial and quickly turn into a chore as well. The rest of the game - figuring out how to ""hack"" around the machine - is essentially just navigating menus and clicking things, with no clever or unusual solutions involved.The plot is fairly simple and far from mind-blowing, and the fourth wall breaking elements are cliched. There's some arguably cringy talking-with-the-programmer humour, and Satan himself feels more like a grumpy game developer this kind of game usually involves. There are some secrets and token collectibles in the game, but they don't save the plot, and they don't make the game worth replaying. The game is really short, taking a bit over an hour to beat.The graphics are pretty good, although the retro aesthetic gets hard on the eyes after a while. I also get the impression that a handful of 3d elements and sounds are stock Unity assets, which feels a little bit out of place.

I bet they'll even call you a ""brony"" and you'll get to feel REALLY COOL as you correct them.

There are a few bugs to be worked out I suppose (I'm currently waiting for the developer to patch a fix in for an issue I pointed out), but the fact that I care enough to wait is basically proof that it must be doing something right.I'm hesitant to say more because, like Undertale and The Magic Circle and Stanley Parable before it, most of the enjoyment here comes from being surprised, so yeah.

I came in blind, didn't even see the trailer. Once I realized I was playing a horror game of sorts, I expected to get bad creepypasta, and I absolutely got better than that. It's tongue-in-cheek, and while that makes me roll my eyes from time to time, most of the time it works well. Puzzles aren't obtuse, there's an appropriate degree of silliness (ie not too much), and exploring the broken machine is satisfying.It's definitely not without its flaws. The narrative shines when progressing, but all of the extra information you can get on the side (not just about the player character) feels meaningless to me at best, and complete nonsense at worst. And not that Undertale was the first game to keep track of things across multiple playthroughs, but it feels forced here and not nearly as elegant and meaningful as it was in that game. All the parallels to Undertale do this game a disservice, but they're being drawn for a reason; there are specific lines in Pony Island that made me cringe, they wanted so badly to be as good as Undertale's version of that line.I wouldn't say it's a must-play, but it's much better than I expected. I'd like to think it says more that it drew me in and made me want to collect every ticket, reveal the whole backstory, etc. than that I was dissatisfied with what I got from doing it.

I mean, the start is obviously very misleading, but the trailers include actual gameplay that makes you re-think your choices, which is also a good way to understand games. At the start of Pony Island, I knew what I was getting into. Some parts actually made me want to lend my soul to Satan (yes, it's actually very sad if you think about it, smh) which is mind-boggling. The way this game can control the real you without actually controlling you surprises me.It's a good way to learn how to puzzle, too.I recommend you do NOT watch any videos on people playing it, (a mistake, I have done it) it'll ruin all the fun and excitement.Overall, this game is pretty good, def. recommend it.The saddest thing is that trackpad gameplay is hard, (I'm using a trackpad, and I'm still in adventure mode!) and if you don't have a mouse it can be challenging.

Even more so if you are a completionist.The meat of the game are the runner-like jump and shoot passages and the 'coding' puzzles which are of increasing challenge and quite cleverly introduce new mechanics. But the frequency you have to repeat them in-between is borderline lunatic.The meta game is somewhat interesting but ultimately it stays very shallow and apart from some collectible puzzles it only serves to drive the linear story forward. Very little to explore or discover but lots of unused opportunities.The plot is thinly veiled and for anyone with knowledgeable on the topic it's fully revealed in the first few minutes. Twists or surprises are non-existent although, again, there was ample opportunity. Oh, and don't expect anything like a rewarding or concluding ending.The game started quite funny but it got so irritating that I almost started to hate it.

,Not Recommended,405640,30128888,Posted: 23 February,all,Alien Rope Burn,"The problem of being told that a game is surprising and clever is that it's something of a spoiler.Pony Island is kind of a metacommentary on the role of agency in videogames and... um... I'm not sure what it's trying to say, but it certainly is. Like the Stanley Parable before it, it plays a lot with seemingly forcing you down a path, but occasionally letting you peek around and find secrets. The main issue is that when it's forcing you and when you have agency are often rather obfuscated, and it works to be lawl unpleasant at times in the former situation, with the excuse of ""hey, you can always turn the game off!"" (A friend of mine did just that, which is as sure a way to ""win"" as any at Pony Island.)Where Pony Island is clever is not in the writing, but in generally playing with game interfaces and messing around with expectations in that regard. And in that, it's at its most fun. Getting to tool around with the various visual gags is where it works best, and there's some eyeraising moments. A lot of the actual gameplay comes to a mouse-based platforming game (the titular Pony Island) and simple logic puzzles where you maneuver a cursor through code by manipulating commands.It's tough to say if I'd recommend it, because I found it alternately interesting and irritating. It has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but it does visual gags well. If you thought Metal Gear Solid's Psycho Mantis fight is the ideal gaming moment, this is a game for you. As far as gameplay, though, or a story...? I don't know if it's all it's hyped up as, and there are long swaths of the game where it just seemed to be going through the motions to me. At the very least it doesn't overstay its welcome... by too much. If there was a way to give a ""neutral"" review I would, but if something isn't positive, I have to go to my default negativity.Played through it once and probably pulled open about half the secrets."

The hacking-based puzzle game that forms the meat of it kept me engaged and thinking, especially with the twists and new additions to that formula that you instinctivly pick up on. And the ways it clevery uses and twists the interface, making it part of the puzzle too, adds so much to the overall experience.It's worth the $5 entry price.

,Recommended,405640,20997535,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,GrabEmByThePasse,"Have you ever played Icarus Proudbottom Teaches Typing or Frog Fractions? If not, stop reading and start in on those free flash games; I'll wait.If you've made it back with your sanity in one piece, or if you've already recovered from losing your mind, you'll probably have noticed the thing those games have in common, which is that they're not exactly what they appear to be. There's a simple mechanic at the core of each game, but the real game is more in the meta commentary about what the game actually is. Games about games, like The Magic Circle, are the decidedly postmodern expression of restless developers who aren't satisfied with the complacent feedback loops and progression curves of modern games, but unless they're literally making a point about the meaninglessness of control (The Stanley Parable), they're best when they actually manage to be a game, even as they deconstruct the entire notion.Enter Pony Island, a self-described ""suspense puzzle game in disguise,"" which basically establishes the game-within-a-game ""Pony Island"" as a limbo-like punishment for gamers, a one-trick...well...pony, in which you leap your magical pony/unicorn over gates over and over again until you agree to cede your soul to Lucifer. Pony Island itself, then, which does far more with its retro framing device than You Have to Win the Game or classic Strongbad cartoons, is a game of constant one-upmanship; players ""cheat"" at the devil's game, at which point Lucifer changes the code, forcing players to once again hack their way around his conventions. Along the way, the game pulls tricks from Eternal Darkness's book, cleverly attempting to convince players that the game is failing so that players will feel smart when they out-think the devil and progress to the next act.Except, and here's the really clever part, the heart of the game really is ""Pony Island."" Even though you're aware that this black-and-white wireframe jumping simulator (which eventually gets two upgrades--a laser and wings--that don't add much to the difficulty) is a repetitive anti-game, there's so much framework built into Pony Island itself that you can't help but dive back into the original game. And along the way, you'll even get to see the various iterations of design, from a minimalist text-adventure rendering to a pathetic 3D version, and even a few different skins, including a cheery, full-color ""modern"" version. If the goal is simply to not play ""Pony Island,"" players can simply quit at any point--Mullens doesn't go so far as to obfuscate your menu options. But because there are hidden ""Pony Island"" tickets to collect by completing cryptic tasks--along with equally meaningless Steam achievements--players soldier through the banal hopping in order to see what clever trick comes next.And there's a lot of content here, from optional tasks like interacting with the desktop's ""Settlers of sAtan"" and finding passwords buried in broken option menus, to a series of ""hacking"" puzzles that involve placing basic operators into holes in faux-code. It's nothing overly strenuous. Even when loops and splitters are introduced, which calls for a lot of mid-routine micromanagement, the game isn't actually trying to keep the player from winning; it's just trying to convince the player that it is. That's the genius: ""Pony Island"" represents every repulsively designed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t time-suck, and Pony Island redeems them all. This even fits into the whole idea of games-as-limbo, in which players can either uselessly throw away their life/time/soul, or can find something of merit within the limns of all that code and thereby make something more of themselves. (It's one of the reasons I turned to criticism in the first place, as actively participating in entertainment is far superior to passively observing it.)Even though there is no part of the final level that I even remotely enjoy, I couldn't put Pony Island down. It kept wrapping new and surprisingly devious tricks around the same-old-same-old pony express, and the context kept me going. Is there any practical difference between shooting a laser of corrupted binary data at demons or blowing a gust of wind at butterflies that just want to tickle you? No, just as ""Pony Island"" itself could be just about any game. What matters, then, is what's around the mechanics, and in that, Pony Island has found gold, and the fact that it doesn't settle for simply being a series of puzzles (like Please, Don't Touch Anything), is what elevates it to a Game That Matters--a game that, in finding both structure and absurdity, succeeds more than Frog Fractions. It's a joke that laughs with you, not at you."

76561197976835855,Not Recommended,405640,20411802,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,Destin,"TL;DR: Pony Island is an unusual puzzle and gallery shooter game that's fairly meta, but not nearly as intelligent as it wants you to believe it is.My experience with Pony Island was not very thrilling.  I was bored throughout most of it.  I spent the first hour or two trudging onwards, telling myself that all the cool stuff was going to start happening eventually, and I just had to wait it out.  Before long, though, I realized that that wasn't the case—that the repetitive pony shooter really was all there was to see here.  There's some ticket-collecting gimmick here for all of the virtual crack addicts, but not much of substance—nothing that really makes you laugh, or feel things, or stop and reflect, like a good indie game would, nor is there much of a challenge.  It's just kind of... a thing that you experience.With that, I'm left wondering what the game's appeal was supposed to be.  It's not really funny—I think I laughed a sum total of once—it's not really witty, and the music doesn't do much for me.  The game is embellished with a few meta-heavy gimmicks and a narrative of ""the game is possessed by an evil force that is being a jerk to you"", but the bulk of the ""gameplay"" is split between a gallery shooter with a laser-shooting pony, and some ""put the right item in the right place at the right time"" puzzles.  With slight variations, you'll go through the same kinds of puzzles and shooter stages over and over, for bulk of the 3 hours of the game.  With regards to this, I think it fair for me to summarize the game as being a one-trick pony.  (Hah!  Get it?  My joke is almost as clever as the game itself.)On the positive side of things, the game is competent.  Stylistically, in terms of graphics and sound, it nails the atmosphere that it's going for.  However, style doesn't cut it for me; I'm looking for subtance, and I found Pony Island lacking in that category.Another positive: Therewasone boss ""fight"" that I thought was kind of neat, and some of the meta stuff happening there really took me off-guard.  But that's just 10-15 minutes of the game.  I spent the rest in boredom.Lastly, the game is only $5.  This is a plus, because if it looks like the sort of thing that would appeal to you, despite my negative view of it, you're not putting a whole lot on the line to buy it and see for yourself.In closing, there's a lot of hype surrounding this game right now, but I don't think that it's warranted.  Pony Island is simply a repetitive game with very little to say.  I think people lauding this game as an early contender for GotY 2016 are gravely mistaken, as I doubt that anyone will remember this game come the end of the year, much less 5 or 10 years from now, when an actual great game's legacy would still be vibrantly alive in its fans' minds.  There's just not anything really memorable or insightful here.In short, I don't recommend spending your time on Pony Island."

The attempt at horror is just terrible, this game hasn't offered me any of that good old paranoia that a game of it's type promises. The dialogue feels rushed and it leaves no impact on me at all. The hacking bits were nice, but became somewhat boring and it didn't give me the degrees of freedom as I expected it to. The story seemed to have been alterable at first glance, but it's all in a fine line, everything along it, you see coming.

To find out the whole story you need to finish the whole game for at least twice (5/3 times to be accurate) and I just don't want to play it anymore after first playthrough.

The majority of the game is a boring, hammy, nonsense narrative with some tedious ""platforming"" and logic puzzles, and truth be told I stopped playing halfway through because I was bored to death before picking it up again a bit later.  I wanted to play it through just to say I did, and, well...Why couldn't all of it be as interesting as the last 15 - 20% of the game?  Saying much of anything is pretty spoilerific, but once things started to change up, I was actually hooked up to the end.  The entire rest of the game feels like it takes far too long to get anywhere, and then everything catches up all at once.It's only a slightly negative stance, as I realize there is merit and effort in there, but it took far too long to actually turn into something enjoyable.

I bought it because it looked like an interesting puzzle solver and had lots of good reviews and although parts of it are good. (The interactive bits between the player and the entities in the machine are quite well done) most of the game involves running the same linear pony run over and over and over which gets tedious. I might even have been able to cope with that but there seems to be a few bugs. One involves sometimes the lazer going off instead of jumping with the left mouse button (I even started using my left and right hand to press the buttons to make sure I wasn't accidently hitting the wrong ones by mistake but no joy there), and the other popped up as sin desert where when you do the large stream of lazer sometimes it takes a second or two after you lift your finger off the button to stop the lazer from working.....by which stage you've died because you were meant to jump. (You don't seem to be able to start a jump with the lazer going). That means you go right back to the beginning and have to run the same linear jump and fire game over and over until you manage to get through despite the glitches. Maybe it's because I'm using a trackpad. I wasn't aware the game said to use a mouse not a trackpad until I'd already bought it and since I don't own a mouse the trackpad's all I've got (Worth bearing in mind if you're a laptop only user like me).

There are two types of gameplay, one involving puzzles (Yay!) and one involving boring and repetitive platforming (Nay...). I get the vibe that it's aiming for the same sort of teritory as Undertale, but Undertale worked because the weird mechanics and 4th wall breaking were incorperated well into the story and characterisation. In this, the gameplay often feels completely seperate to the plot, and the antaganists do not feel particularly ominous. I like the idea of villains taking over the game, with the player losing control, but I feel it could have been pushed further. At no point did I ever feel panicked or caught off guard. On the other hand, this game is only £4, won't take up much of your time, and a lot of people seem to like it."

That said, I wouldn't really call it good. I can't really be too specific without spoiling anything, but it boils down to a couple hours of interactive narrative with some mostly dull gameplay segments. The humor is pretty amusing, and there's some neat dramatic moments, but for a game whose main selling point is its meta-ness, the story has a surprising lack of depth or significance.

At the end of the day though, I do consider having fun while playing the game, so I'll role with an upvote.My reason for not entirely being satisfied was probably because I played ""The Magic Circle"" before this. To me it seems like Pony Island was heavily inspired on that title, and it tried it's best but just wasn't quite there. If I put the two games side by side I can easily say which parts of Magic Circle fit where.The game did troll me once though, and I'll have to give it that. Other than that one amusing part (which is by the end of the game mind you) you'll be treated to a lot of puzzles that are both reflex and logic based. I'd rate them as being okay, but my playtime says more than enough about the complexity of those.The idea behind the game is of course pretty novel and I love to see these kind of titles more often, but at the end of the day Pony Island still played it's ideas on the safe side by trying to appeal to completionists (Steam achievements can spoil the story for you, and there are collectibles that I don't really care to pick up as they are not relevant to the story) and have a token deeper/hidden story that I couldn't bring myself to care for. There are a bunch of things I found illogical about it, but I'd be spoiling it if I started discussing it in the main review (I will adress that in  the comments though)Maybe I'm just spoiled by my recent play of Undertale and fond memories of The Magic Circle this game dredged up, but I'd like for this to have a deeper layer I just altogether missed - which I don't believe is the case, as the end of the game kind of made me deadpan at the flat storytelling. Again, look into the comments for an explanation, if you don't mind spoilers.TL;DR - 5 EUR is a good price and I didn't mind paying it for Pony Island. The pony was cute and setting interesting. If you like small brain-teasers and a relaxing game after work, pick this one up."

The game has some good ideas but the gameplay and the narrative weren't compelling enough to keep me engaged. It's reminiscent of Undertale in a few ways, but Undertale succeeded in hooking my emotions into the characters and backstory in a way Pony Island did not. When the game ended I did not feel any compulsion to dig into the rest of the story that I missed, to try to find secret endings, etc.I'd say the first 15 minutes of the game are its strongest, when you first break through the facade and interact with the ""desktop"" of the system and the narrative picks up. I don't feel the game delivered on that opening ambition.I think the game would have benefited from a slower burn and actually trying to play up a psychological horror angle (not sure why it has that tag, I wouldn't classify it as such) with a bit less tongue in cheek. The antagonist(s) weren't actually all that menacing.From a gameplay perspective, the core Pony game (and its variations) was adequate but not super fun in and of itself. The ""hacking"" puzzles were okay but a bit clunky to move pieces around with the mouse. I appreciated how some puzzles had hints in garbled code.

I'm really surprised it'd gotten SO many positive reviews and that makes me feel like i've missed something? I've looked around on the net and watched videos and I didn't see much that I didn't see while I was playing it except a really uninteresting hidden boss at the end.I honestly try my best to find something likable or at least interesting in any of the media I consume so it took me a while to really formulate an opinion on this one, but after turning it over in my head for a couple days i'm not left with much favorable to say.Right away the ""take something cute but make it all uhh... dark and stuff"" theme wasn't too promising, but I saw a lot of potential in the ""satanic game"" idea and the graphic style gave neat atmosphere that really worked for a while.  I spent the whole game waiting for it to realize this potential into something greater but it never delivered. I guess it's a horror-comedy but it's neither scary nor funny. For as hard as it was trying to be clever, it caught me off guard maybe twice in the two hours it took me to complete it and the entire trajectory of the game felt really obvious. I don't really like games that try to be clever above all else anyway. It make the whole game feel substanceless.The thing that bothers me the most tho is that it doesn't even have much in the way of engaging gameplay to fall back on. There's basically two game-types you switch between, one being a really underdeveloped action runner and the other being essentially a pipe puzzle dressed up to look like a coding game. Both get really repetative.There's an earlier browser version of this game from 2014 that takes maybe two minutes to play. It's really stripped down compared to this. No real story, no pipe puzzles, none of the clever tricks, none of the wacky dialog, and no pony lasers. What it does provide is an eerie and mysterious atmosphere without anything else to weigh it down. It's not scary or otherwise particularily notable, but it's a charming little game.

,Not Recommended,405640,20720262,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,Blizzard,"I dunno. It's not a bad game. It might be the two reviews I read that ruined it for me. The two snippets I got were about ""thinking outside the box"" and ""just go in blind, you'll get the most enjoyment that way,"" which to me seem like definite good signs when I'm looking to buy a game. I was excited, and ready to be hit over the head with something brilliant. I played through it in one sitting, and I finished feeling pretty underwhelmed. At the end of the game, you're encouraged to delete the game from your HDD once you're done playing it. My reaction to this encouragement was, ""don't mind if I do,"" and that was that.So the game, of course, is not about ponies. The title of ""Pony Island"" is part of the overly cheerful facade that the game literally immediately tears down the instant you start. You're going on a journey with the goal of figuring out what exactly is going on, all while playing through some minigames and fighting the big baddie. But this process is painfully linear. If you think to do something that seems like it wasn't part of the intended linear path, you're typically rewarded with a ticket (tickets don't do anything other than net you Steam achievements) or some tongue-in-cheek joke. And then you hop right back on that path because you've gotten your reward for straying from it. I have nothing against linear storylines where the player doesn't interact with anything going on, and that method has worked fine for other games. But if there's going to be a linear and uninteractive story, it has to be good. And it is not good - it is mediocre. The plot is straightforward and unengaging. I found myself feeling apathetic when moments meant to evoke a response came up. Maybe I was just in a bad mood or feeling grumpy or something, but the story just didn't work for me.And the gameplay is awful. The two core gameplay elements - a ""hacking"" puzzle and a hurdle-jumping platformer - are painfully boring. You can figure out what you need to do in a matter of seconds for both of them, and then you have to spend a minute or two executing that plan. If you mess up, you get to enjoy going all the way back to the start. Over the course of the game, new elements are added to these games as an effort to keep things fresh, but both minigames are so one-dimensional that it takes all of 15 seconds to have a solid understanding of what was just added, and then you're back to the grind. Now to be fair, the gameplay is clearly not the focus of this game. You're not buying the game to have fun jumping hurdles or solving rudimentary puzzles. You're buying the game for the rest of what's packed into it. But the literal and metaphorical hurdle-jumping of the gameplay just takes up so much time that it's hard to forgive it for being so dull, even if it's not the focus of the game.I really wanted to like this game. I just can't. It doesn't do anything new, and it doesn't improve on what has already been done. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's meh. A resounding meh."

The platforming is intentionally bad, which is foolish, because it's a significant chunk of the game.Story is your reward for slogging through the intentionally bad platforming. But the story is also simple, and you will guess most of the plot twists.

I tried to continue playing and 'get into it' but nothing about it really grabbed me.A lot of people seem to really like this game, so you know, take my review with a grain of salt? You might really like it, and want to show it to all your friends! It might really be your sort of thing!But for me, it felt like- well like a gimmick game.  Like other than the meta aspect of it, it didn't have depth or charm or anything else.  Undertale had the meta aspect, but that was far from the entirety of the story.  Maybe if I had continued playing, there would've been more compelling depth to the story, but there wasn't any from what I saw.The graphics are nice.  I liked the ""outside the game"" vs ""inside the game"" graphics, as you can see your hands and the game tickets, and it's a nice touch.I didn't care for the villian beingsatan / lucifer / the devil / etc.  I feel like a villian actually made for the game would've been a bit stronger and more solid. Like, I don't believe in the devil, and it seems kind of 'stock villian' sort of thing.  Kind of like when movies have nazis as stock villians, since you don't really need to convince the viewer to dislike them.  I think having the villian be a crazed game developer would've actually been more interesting.  How did a game creator make this sort of game that can capture souls? Where did he get this sort of power? Why is he doing this? Those would be valid questions that would spike curiosity and keep you trying to unravel things.

,Not Recommended,405640,21810707,"Posted: 13 March, 2016",all,fleur,"This game has some really neat moments, but I would only really say it's above average at best, as the few really cool moments are adrift in a sea of not a whole lot else. I don't feel I wasted my money, but I wasn't really dazzled, either - if possible, I would have given it a thumbs sideways. This review will include vague and mild spoilers.The tone is a lot more lighthearted than I was expecting going into it blind, and the shooty jumpy puzzly bits can get repetitive after a while, but some of the stuff it pulls is downright brilliant. If I had to level any criticism at the game beyond what I've already mentioned, it's that it didn't go far enough. The narrative looked like it was going to go to a pretty weird place for a moment, and there were a few knowing winks and nods at the fourth wall, but by the end it settles down comfortably within the confines of conventionality. There's a bit of a payoff, but it's not much, and it really feels like meta for the sake of meta without much thought put into it.The game's second biggest problems are the tone and the muddled focus, as well as the overall lack of a cohesive narrative. You play as a guy playing an arcade game. All the same, you as the player are also recognized as a participant in the story. I wouldn't say that the game is about the player character - he has no agency within the story to speak of, and we do not learn anything about him or his personality, goals or indeed character, beyond a few bits of biographical trivia locked inside some hidden areas. When we actually find out his identity, the revelation only hinders our ability to identify with him, and further distances the player from the player character. He ends up being neither someone we can easily self-insert as, nor a freestanding character of his own, which left me wondering why he was there to begin with. There's another actor in this story, but he's more of a plot device than an actual character, so I wouldn't really factor him in.The game isn't about you, the player, either. Beyond the quick wink and the nod, it does not engage with you or speak to your experience, and the game certainly doesn't become about you - it looks like it might, but then it goes right on back to focusing on the personalityless cipher of your player character. It doesn't even comment on the fact that you're controlling him.Of all the characters in the game, Satan gets the most development, but his motivations seem muddled and unclear, and whatever development we see is undermined in the end, possibly because the developer wanted to have a climactic sequence. Satan isn't really scary, either. Neither is any of the rest of game. What seemed to get off to a promising start is undermined by the fact that we see far too much of him, that he's petty and that he's entirely ineffectual. He felt like a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Not a force beyond your reckoning against whose machinations you are entirely helpless, but a petty chatterbox and a complete pushover. Were he more aloof, more powerful and more sparingly used, I might've actually been afraid of him, but I'm afraid that wasn't the case.Likewise, the tone of this game is all over the place. It doesn't know if it wants to be funny or unsettling, and it kind of fails at both. There were a few sequences that got some hearty chuckles out of me, but there was not one instance of uproarious belly laughter. Nor was I really creeped out at any point. Religious horror relies hugely on exploiting the solemnity and gravity of religious symbols to induce fear. Moments of levity undermine that unless they're turned against the player - it shouldn't laugh with you, it should laugh at you. When you laugh too, it should grab you by the head and push your nose into it like you just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the carpet, all the while laughing at your expense. That you're a sinner, that you're filthy, that you're excluded, beyond all hope of salvation, that's what you should be feeling. Sometimes it feels like it's going to go all the way with that, but it always gets cold feet at the last moment and bolts off while apologizing.In the end, you have a story that's neither about you, nor your character, nor Satan, nor your helper. A story where all the obstacles are effortlessly overcome through seemingly no effort and your antagonist fumbles and stumbles comically at every step, where the stakes are poorly defined and there never seems to be any risk at all of anything truly unpleasant happening. We're playing not to see the story of a character or learn more about a world or solve a mystery - we're playing to find out where they're going with this, as the game itself aptly points out. Turns out that where they're going with this is nowhere in particular. What's left, in the end? A few really cool moments that I do think are genuinely brilliant. If you think that's worth 5 bucks, all the more power to you."

At all.It's basically two mini-games: one is terribly un-fun where you jump over platforms and shoot things which is extremely easy until later in the game at which point it is merely somewhat easy and boring throughout. The other is a very mediocre puzzly game which similarly advances from extremely easy to somewhat easy.All of this is wrapped up in a story which you will grasp in full from the first 2 minutes of playing the game with no real plot advancement.It doesn't help that the game is constantly plagued with extremely slow to appear un-speedupable text. The whole thing took me 100 minutes to complete and I want those 100 minutes of my life back.This is the first review I've ever written but I had to do it because my mind is honestly blown at how this game manages rated 'overwhelmingly positive'.

I just never felt immersed enough to care about getting them, you can find out why it's all happening etc but I just.. don't care. How am I supposed to invest time on something I have no real cares for? I actually found what happens if you collect all the tickets on youtube and the result is very underwhelming in my opinion...It was pretty darn easy - there's the main mechanic of the bouncing butt stallion, then there's the puzzle side of it. I only got stuck once, and even then it was only for about... 10 minutes? (not to mention I was playing at gone midnight so sleep addled)The ending was predictable, I saw it coming a thousand ponies away.The music wasn't great. I mean it's not the worst I've heard but it's not great. I wouldn't pay the extra money for the soundtrack... I don't even remember any of the music anymore to be honest, so it's just not memorable for me.Pros:It's cheap. I mean yes it's short but for the a higher price a cinema could've ripped me off for a film about half the length so it's not like the money is.. completely wasted.There are some moments, while few and far between, that can really throw you for a loop. There's one particular ""boss"" that might as well go around with a dang trollface on him. And I approve.Neutral:Graphics. I mean really on a game like this you can't put them as a positive or negative 'cos they're just.. how they are. Just make sure you personally like the kind of graphics they are and it's fine. I like some of the glitched out effects there are though.Conclusion: Kinda wish I'd just watched someone else play it, the immersion isn't really there for me.

While the runner stages feel more like a chore, that you endure for the sake of progressing the story.The story and aesthetics is what redeems the game. What they do with the puzzles, and the way they connect the story with the fact that you are inside an old computer is interesting to say the least. It doesn't leave much to the imagination, but makes you pounder what computer games can be.This said, it is a 2.5 hour game, that consists a lot of running in a straight line, jumping obstacles.

It practically mocks the player's intelligence and is one of the worst horror games ever made.Creepypastas are made fun of in many corners of the internet, mostly for their absurd clichés and in general terrible writing. The average story is about a ""relatable"" teenager who gets a mysterious video game from a yard sale. After playing it, lo and behold, the game is incredibly corrupt and features hyper-realistic blood, satanic symbols, and a klefka laugh somewhere. Then the player's model starts begging for help as the narrator begins to vomit uncontrollably.The criticism is fair. Horror should not derive from explicitly featuring gore and signs from the devil. It should derive from fear of the unknown, well written imagery, and a proper atmosphere. Because of this, most people can recognize and ridicule bad creepypastas for their terrible interpretations of what horror fiction is. Good horror games such as Amnesia know to stay away from the ideas utilized by Creepypastas, and instead use the human's inherent fear of the unknown to its advantage (obviously not all creepypastas are completely terrible, the vast majority are). Pony Island clearly does none of these things. The inability for people to see these issues in Pony Island is beyond me.The game attempts to create horror by contrasting the kid-friendly original facade of the game with the real evil side of the game, filled with crying death ponies and messages by the devil. But this ""horror"" is incredibly immature for the same reasons that make creepypasta immature. The game again and again reminds the audience that ""it was made by Satan himself"", and it calls the player childish derogatory terms ala ""mere mortal"". It is also apparent that the game believes adding creepy looking binary (yes, literally 1s and 0s) everywhere will result in the audience weeping in fear. In other parts of the game, it unironically uses creepy looking ASCII to increase the horror value. Keep in mind, this game takes itself seriously.The puzzle mechanics, or should I say mechanic, are all the same. You pretty much lead a key to a finish line by properly placing a bunch of obstacles to get through logic gates. At first, the idea was sort of neat, but after the 20th time I finished it, I could not help but grow impatient. The puzzles are practically the same thing over and over again. They are boring, repetitive, and dull, which is bad considering solving these puzzles is 90% of the game. Other parts of the game involved you moving your mouse sporadically across the screen in hopes you would find a button that would allow you to proceed to the next level. This is completely brainless design, but I don't think the creators of Pony Island cared for quality anyway.You also have to proceed levels eventually by controlling a crying pony with devil wings that shoots binary death lasers to kill evil devil skulls that are trying to kill you. Again, this game is taking itself seriously.There are many, many things wrong with Pony Island. It is a disgrace to the horror genre, and is a disgrace to the medium. Many flawed horror games I can still give credit for trying (Five Nights at Freddies) for doing some aspects right. I cannot usher any praise for Pony Island. It is a game stained with terrible design and mind bogglingly awful writing. Stay away at all costs."

This game is more focused on its generic meta story to bother actually making the game part of it any fun or interesting at all. If you aren't solving easy, repetitive puzzles, you are running, jumping, and shooting lasers as seen in the trailers. You do this over and over and over again. I just found myself bored throughout this whole game. There are some clever bits sprinkled around, but they make up a small portion of the time you'll spend playing, which is around 2-3 hours. If you aren't sick of Satan centric storylines yet and have some spare change lying around, i'd say this game is worth a shot for the $3 sale price.

Before I go into a rant, listen, I find the concept and its art design incredibly good, the game messes with you in such a way that you want to keep on playing, it's just a shame that the gameplay itself isnt very good. Pony Island goes into two main forms of gameplay, the infinite pony runner and the code puzzles, sadly both of these will end up wearing on your patience rather quicky as the infinite runner is just that, and the puzzles get frustrating to the point of soaking up most of the adventure without giving you much of a reason to enjoy them. This game is a sponge of repetition, new concepts do not come frequently, and for the most part all they are is just a visual effect with little variation. I can only recommend those who are extremely curious to try the game out, and hey if you find something in the game I didnt? Thats fine, enjoy the game, this is just my opinion after all."

It is also creepy at times, say, when, one of your freinds starts Steam messaging you, but actually isn't.Overall, it is a good game. I do recommend, and it is one of those cheaper games on Steam. Just, if you are a Christian, I suggest you stay away from this game. No offense."

The plot's damn good. I would compare it to Undertale in the way that it has a plot that seems simple at first but grows increasingly more unorthodox and better.Don't let the fact that this game is called ""Pony Island"" make you avoid purchasing this game. Don't let the ""oh you play pony games so you MUST be a weird My Little Pony fan or some s***"" stereotype get to you. Let ponies be known as heroes and beings of badass masculinity.If you look at my games, you'll immediately think ""oh this chick is a sucker for indie games."" Well, I AM, but I am slowly but surely getting through them, and I plan to review them all. I just believe in giving random games that aren't necessarily broadcast on television or by YouTube gamers (that I know of) a chance. So lemme tell ya. This game is WORTH IT.

The fact that the game has a story but doesn't shove it down your throat is an interesting take, you can play through it without ever finding out the whole story or you can search every nook and cranny and find out a very interesting, if not slightly confusing story.But by far the most amazing mechanic in the game is when you confront the last demon before the final boss. I won't ruin anything. But I would really like to see an entire game based around that kind of meta gaming"

Absolutely give it a go if you enjoyed games like Undertale, Frog Fractions 2 and other ""meta"" style narratives.The humor is a little hit or miss, or it can be, but I would suggest playing through the whole thing (short as it is) before forming an opinion.This is likely the type of game that might be studied in the future.

The puzzles are clever and the action sequences are challenging without being unfair, but neither of those would've made a good game on their own. What makes this game stand out is how it includes the player as a character in the story, your actions as the character you're controlling as well as your actions as a person playing a videogame.

This game  takes it's one simple idea of ""Possesed Arcade Machine"" and goes to the edge of the universe with it. It creates a real ""Oh **** I'm actually playing a possesed game"" feeling at certain points, while still being light-hearted and funny.

A few puzzle and action here and there.I liked the concept and the mood of this game is really special. The plot is really fun and keeps you wanting to move forward. The game is very short (about 1h30min) but that's OK.Actually it is because the true gaming segments (puzzles and action) are not so good and become boring VERY quickly. They are more a joke than anything really, but they are in your way to move the plot forward... so ""alright let's get this orver with"".In conclusion I'd still recommend this game for the unique experience it offers, but with a warning: you'll find yourself playing sequences that would have made you uninstall any other game right away."

However, for some bizzare reason, the developers have undermined this exact train of thought. This is a game, like Undertale or Frog Fractions, in which the joy of the game is the subversion. One therefore has to ask, why is this subversion spoiled by the games own Steam page? Unlike Undertale or Frog Fractions, which start without you knowing that there is something off with the game, Pony Island throws you in right away. The joy of these types of games, realising the subversion, is not present in this game.The underlying game (the game within a game) of Pony Island, the one button endless runner, not the subversive game, outstays its welcome. The joke of the game is that this underlying game is bad and poorly programmed, however it doesn't move away from it. There could have been different games and more minigames (like the programming minigame) and more exploration of the computer on which Pony Island is situated, y'know the subversive bits of the game. Unfortunately, most of the time is spent in this generic 'endless runner'. One has to ask, at what point does a subversive game go from knowingly making fun of the internal game to actually being that internal game. One has to ask if Pony Island crosses the line.This might seem like a lot of complaints for a reccomendation however the game is cheap enough and fun enough (despite it's flaws) to be worth at least playing once. There is not much value in making a review about the good points of the game because if you are looking at downloading this game then you already know why and so reccomendations are kind of beside the point. I thought it was just worth noting, that unlike other games in the genre that Pony Island does not quite stick the landing."

,Recommended,405640,24769094,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,teenalphabro,"Pony Island, to me, is a game that utterly exemplifies what the medium of gaming can be at its peak. People can go on and on about games being art or whatever, and that's a discussion for a completely other day. But to call Pony Island anything less than a work of art would frankly be insulting to the game.Everyone knows by this point that the game isn't a cutesy little flash game. Yes, it's about Satan messing with you in a 90s computer game, with some angelic force helping you get out of your predicament along the way. In esscence, it's a basic setup that paves the way for a metafictional look at gaming.Now, some may cry that as becoming too cliched, or tacky, or hamfisted at this point. 'Don't we have enough Spec Ops: The Lines or The Stanley Parables? Can't we just have a fun dang video game?' you may ask. To which I respond, this game is actually very fun. Challenging? Absolutely. But it's also very fun. I'm not gonna come out with the 'oh, it's the Dark Souls of this type of genre,' partly because I've never played a Soulsbourne game, and partly because that's a tired phrase anyway.Basicaly, Pony Island is a very fun game. It's a good game on its own, and it's also a very good slice of metafictional narriative. I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Just don't buy it for your kids, in all seriousness.

A someone who is new to PC gaming one of the genres I was most looking forward togetting into was that of metagames. Specifically, this refers to games about, well, games and do so by playing with genre conventions often humorous and occasionally dramatic effect (bizzarely, these almost never seem to get console ports). Undertale was first on my bucket list, for obvious reasons, and Pony Island drew my attention next thanks to its low price and a similarly strong reputation. I made a point to avoid as much information as possible about the game, not even reading the full steam description, and I feel I made the right choice in that regard. Pony Island exists for the sole purpose of surprising you and it does a fantastic job of it. What surprised me greatly was that the game was a rather strong example of psychological horror and its tricks truly got under my skin at times. However, it is flawed in a rather significant way: the actual gameplay is not very fun. Much of the game is based around a very typical 2D runner minigame and though I am aware that it is poorly designed on purpose you have to spend a very significant amount of time playing it, more so than I feel was necessary. I have similar issues with the puzzle mechanics: they are not bad, but at times they feel they are present merely because the game feels like it needs to have something for you to do. I would have prefered a slightly shorter, more refined experience with no filler, but what is good in Pony Island is not only really good but utterly unique. All this and a bargain price and you have a great storytelling experience that is an easy recommendation to all. Before I finish I must give a warning: the game is meant to be played in one sitting. Considering it's length of about two and a half hours this should be managable, but it is worth keeping it mind."

Never in my life have I played a game where you're stuck in hell and your punishment for the things you've done is to play a boring pony game for the rest of your existance. The goal of the game is to find a way to crash the game and escape hell. It's a very fun concept and is extremely well executed. The game has a great sense of humour much like Undertale, so if you like Undertale's sort of humour you'll laugh a lot at this game. The game is a puzzle game which means it has some good puzzles that are actually quite tricky, which is nice (Papyrus approves).The thing I didn't like very much about this game was the music. I bought the soundtrack and I must say some of the songs in this game were ot that good at all (though I do love the main theme). Another thing that bugged me was the pony levels themselves. They were very repetetive and there were quite a lot of them during the adventure mode section, which slows the game down quite a lot.Other than that, I think the game is in my opinion flawless.

,Recommended,405640,20673833,"Posted: 21 January, 2016",all,Imperishable_NEET,"Think of this 4-hour narrative indie game like you would a movie ticket - five dollars up front for an evening of solid entertainment. Are all the meta gags groundbreaking for the medium? No - Portal, The Stanley Parable and Undertale all did it better. Still, you'll appreciate the labor of love that went into this project. It's a meta-game about game programming and development. Programmers, chipheads and vaporwave fans alike will appreciate all the subtle nods to Windows 95, Atari, Arcades, Nintendo, Programming, Creepypasta, Terrible Flash Games, and the myriad glitches inherent to all software.I do have one incredibly autistic nitpick that just bugged me, and that's the game's ""zeroes and ones"" motif - actual base-2 binary dumps are usually abbreviated as base-16 hexadecimal strings because it's slightly more readable than the raw pulses read by machines. Every Hollywood hacker movie gets it wrong, though.Pony Island is not without much bigger problems, unforunately. The pony-jumping, whether by design or otherwise, wears out its welcome fast after just so many iterations. The two constant games at work here boil down to a flappy bird-esque timed rail jumper, and what can best be described as a programming minigame. None of the programming puzzles will make your head explode or require a particularly trained mind, save for Louie's last ""Puzzle Break"", which I found to be a massive difficulty spike requiring way too many steps and variables to juggle around - you practically need to draw out each step on graph paper. Maybe it's easier if you're well versed in programming or just have a really good memory, but the sheer difficulty of that last puzzle broke the game's pacing for me. I had to look up the solution on YouTube, and even following a walkthrough required me to write each step down over several grids. There's one last puzzle after that, but it's essentially a breather. Still, after wasting an hour on that last one, I was NOT in the mood for any more programming puzzles. I guess your mileage may vary, but I can't be alone in struggling with that one.Another, lesser thing that tripped me up was trying to guess a ""Pay Attention and Remember This"" riddle on the last Core. I simply was not listening for the solution the guardian gave out earlier, and unfortunately it's given out right before a checkpoint when there's a lot of distractions going on, so I had to look up the solution on YouTube, again. Surely I can't be the only one who was caught off guard? How did this get by playtesters?! I get that it's supposed to test your mental savvy but this kind of 4-hour game really should be completable by the masses without having to break out a strategy guide. It's not a super-hardcore ""git gud"" game like Fighters, Dark Souls or Dwarf Fortress.EDIT: Turns out I made an honest-to-god mistake and got too easily distracted. The passphrase actually flashes below him after the checkpoint for a good 3 seconds. It's no less noticable than those ""I love Paris in the the spring"" mind tricks designed to mildly screw with you. I was just too incompetent to notice before I pulled up a strategy guide. There's no strikeout markup on Steam but consider the above paragraph void.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ***All gripes aside, the ending was pretty cathartic - it left me satisfied for the evening I invested into it. Although before the final escape, I was still pretty confused if Satan was dead after a previous ""Final Fight"" following the second core file deletion, or if God was a greater evil than Satan pulling the strings a la Shin Megami Tensei, or if the lost soul was going to betray me, but none of those cliched tinfoil twists I half-expected came to fruition. Satan is the villain through and through.As for the tickets, there's a bonus fight at the end for collecting them all. Not much of a ""True Ending"", just an extra. It's really not worth your time. There's no big replay value here aside from little tidbits. You're better off viewing the bonus stuff you missed on YouTube. Don't let this game's one-trick pony wear itself out and negatively taint your memory of it through even more repetitious search for that last lousy point. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Pony Island has about as much replay value as The Stanley Parable, which is to say, next to none at all. It seems the developers were aware of this, as they literally tell you to delete the game from your hard drive when it's all over. I won't knock the game for being honest about itself. It's a charming little disposable experience for one or two sittings, well worth its meager asking price - moreso than the vast majority of forgettable Hollywood reboots with much less artistic merit than this game. All in all, Pony Island rises above the Sturgeon's Law tide of trendy 8-bit amateur garbage trying to ape Fez or Undertale (themselves heavily inspired by Super Paper Mario and Earthbound, respectively), without breaking any real ground for the medium."

Many elements of the game are subtle and designed to mess with your head as you play- you're not hallucinating... well, at least not entirely.Through a mixture of ingenius and cleverly disguised elements of code, the game plays almost like an interactive puzzle that constantly keeps you on your toes. Yes, the puzzles are not exactly my favorite (and it can be easy to get maddeningly stuck on a few, because the back of your head will KNOW the answer and your brain will just refuse to catch on), but the style and narrative are simply unparalleled except by its fellow classics such as Undertale.Quite simply, the game is an instant classic.

I only got stuck once, and I'm not even sure how. It was entirely due to my own idiocy.But, of course, the main draw is all the weird fourth wall breaking nonsense it pulls. I can't explain too much of that without spoiling, but i can say that its done very well. At the end of the game I found myself shaking my head at the screen, asking, ""What the hell is happening?""My one gripe with the game is the pacing. It lasted about two hours, but felt much longer. Some segments feel drawn out and often times entirely unnecessary. Because of this, I felt kind of disappointed in the game when I first finished it. But I think I went in with my expectations a bit too high after seeing similarities with Undertale, which is kind of unfair, because Undertale is Undertale. I love Undertale so much....The music is sparse, but when it does play, its great. The soundtrack sells for $.99, and I'll probably pick it up after I finish this review.This game is great for what it is. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I might, but I'd definitely still recommend this if you're even remotely interested.

I enjoyed the little ""programming"" puzzles and the navigating through the computer bits.Although, to be a bit honest, I would've preferred someone other than the devil himself be the creator of the arcade machine. It's a bit of a cliche theme. At some points during my gameplay, I found myself wondering if it was getting religious (I think I found a bible reference in there somewhere?) or if it was just being edgy.

,Recommended,405640,24013591,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Acid Rain,"Pony Island is one of the games that have popped up recently which attempt to sell themselves based on their concepts rather than their gameplay. In this case, it's that of someone accessing an arcade machine made by the Devil himself to steal souls. In this end, it works fairly well. However, there isn't any real buildup to it. The developer is clever at times, but tries way too hard to be creepy. It's about as subtle as a Ben Garrison comic.The puzzles were more trial-and-error than anything I had to put thought into. For something that's supposed to feel like I'm breaking out of the bounds, I felt railroaded into a pre-determined plot. I couldn't choose alternate paths or indeed, make any decision at all, really. It's quite jarring to destroy conventional structures yet be forced into another. I very rarely felt creeped out.I get the feeling that there's more to the plot than can be understood with one playthrough, but I'm not really inclined to try it again. It was worth playing once, but it's not interesting to the point where I'd want to bother with it once more.All in all, if you're a fan of walking simulators, Undertale or otherwise out of the ordinary games, I'd recommend it. Otherwise? If the concept interests you, grab it during a sale."

This is the type of game where the most memorable part of the game is how the player felt during the ""A-ha!"" moments.

Its like nothing I've ever played before, and at a few points it actually sent chills down my spine. As far as gameplay goes, its pretty simple.The main mechanic is just jumping over barriers, slowly gliding on wings, and shooting targets with lazers, and the levels are broken up by some puzzles involving logic gates.The game is pretty short so it will depend on how quickly you can pick up on the puzzles and notice small details to make it through the menus, although there are many secrets and easter eggs scattered through the game to find. A full completion of the game should take around 2-3 hours.Loved it, for $5 I'd say its deffinitely worth it."

I had that warm and fuzzy feeling just from the name itself, and once the text hit the screen saying ""This is not a game about ponies"" I was in love.  The concept of the game is great and implemented very well.  The dialog can be a tad corny at times but does not take away from the experience whatsoever.

NotonPony Island.Init.That's literally the premise of the game. You're playing a game.... about being stuck in a game. The game made by probably the literal devil or..... something demonish like that.The gameplayoverallis repetitive.Most gameplay is jumping or doing a little puzzle, that's consistent. At least it lets you get used to it in that sense.There are definitely some cool parts. This game has lots of homages to older games and genres, and there are some interesting scenes.The plot itself is kind of forced.I really dig the premise, but I feel like it's trying too hard.Pony Island's atmosphere is like if you walk through a front lawn on Halloween. A good scary lawn has some neat, creepy ambient effect, maybe with some music, fog, a few tombstones, and an animatronic or few. Pony Island is like the whole lawn is full of really interesting animatronics, but they're pretty cheesy and constantly moving, and it ruins the mood.Don't get me wrong -- the implications of much of what happens in the game is really interesting. For instance - and the following isn't a ""spoiler"" so much as it is something that's better to think about after you finish the game -it's slightly implied that every time you mess up,youdie and you continue on assomeone else.The game has its own world and lore that's pretty neat.But if you're like me and can't stand ""edge for the sake of edge,"" then the spiel gets a bit annoying fast. Especially the main character who guides you through.Now, I'm not saying this game isn't worth playing for that reason.I definitely think it's worth some time.It tackles gaming in a ""metafiction"" sense -- that is, addressing itself as a game.The genre has a lot of opportunities for metafiction narrative, and this is one of the better shots at it.But if that's not your thing, then you're going to absolutely loathe it.Overall, Pony Island keeps you entertained the whole way through, but much like the souls in the machine, you might be just waiting for it all to be over.Is Pony Island worth it?I mean, why wouldn't you buy a $5 game? It's extremely good for its price tag. It's well-programmed and a fun challenge that'll take you on a journey. I'd say, if you're still interested despite my long rambling,give it a shot."

Not many games can actually grip me that much, and I usually turn it off half way through if I keep dying. I thinkmyonly criticism would be that it seems a little short. I'm no game dev and I understand game development is a very gradual process, but this really left my with a taste for more.The fake steam messages courtesy of Asmodeus, the way 'HE' says ""you again?"" and such after your first playthrough, and Louey's face being corrupted as soon as he pops up after the first playthroughwere all so intriguingly meta and the sort of thing that was right up my street and overall I think it was a really... for lack of a better word, just a really surprising game.

It seems basic, until the game starts to use the steam overlay, as well as system sounds in it's own clever way. It honestly really scared me, and I fell for it.I LOVE these kind of games that focus more on the story about the game, not the story the game tells. My only real gripe is that the game's version of Pony Island is really boring and the hacking minigame gets old. But it's also less than two hours, so it isn't really that bad."

Though I got really frustrated with the arcade action parts because indeed this game requires precise mouse control for aiming. Coordinating my actions was a struggle but I eventually got through it. There were some mercies, like challenges that didn't overstay their welcome, or buffs to help you do things better. On the other hand, I do not want to replay the game because it's not what I would think of as a fun game. Rather, it is like a dare, hoping that I would keep going forward."

The game seems to be segmented into several mini games that by themselves would be fairly simplistic and boring but together they provide to an overall satisfying narrative. Just when one part of the game stays out its welcome it throws something new at you to keep you going.The game is about 2 hours long took me about 4 hours to complete it 100% and that seems to be the perfect length for this game.In closing I just want to say that this game has provided a great start for the new year in gaming and if i continues like this then 2016 might even beat 2015 when it comes to great releases."

Of course, you could get all the spoilers and then play, or not, as you like, but it's so much more satisfying to play it yourself. It was straightforward-- but it's not at all, with a deep backstory that we only have glimpses of.The gameplay was smooth, using almost exclusively the mouse, and the puzzle introductions were incredibly clever. I only noticed during my second playthrough that the hacking sections had instructions in ""code."" Instructions! And commentary! It was frustrating at times, but never because it felt unfair, just because you didn't do well enough, but just one more try and you'll get it.The achievements are a little... well, the last one you get is frustrating due to some RNG based things, but apart from that, most of them are the kind of thing you get as you play through the game. The boss battle formats were varied, but all were smooth and understandable. So far, this has been the only game I made a goal out of getting every achievement, and the satisfaction afterwards was so, so good.Not perfect, and some things were implied to be more than they were (but told by word of God that it was a scrapped feature), but overall, a really good game to dig ito and focus on for some time."

Gotta say, I'm surprised, here's the in depth review:Pony creation: Creating your Pony is fun, intuitive and a quick process. There are lots of customisation options to choose from, a whole colour wheel, you can even use a JPEG or PNG file as an emblem on your Pony. When it comes to naming them, it's a bit strict with what isn't allowed or not, but since you'll see other people's pony's online and this game has children and families in mind, I think that's a good choice.World: The world is bright and colourful, lots of fun and interesting things to find. I was expecting something dull and basic assuming this was made for children, but no, it's extremely well designed with plenty of content.Mini-games: There are several mini-games to play, the first of which is a fence jumping mini-game, sounds boring but it gets quite tricky and builds up experience for your Pony for it to become a race pony later on. It throws in some unexpected little obstacles to keep things interesting. The other mini-games include: {4893-::""?£@£)!££K:SDEL££(S9d39d39dsodll{PATHETIC MORTAL"

The premise is that you're trapped playing a game made by Satan called Pony Island, and he desperately wants your soul. The only way to escape this is to follow the directions of another who are in a similar situation. The novelty comes from the unique puzzles and situations that occur over the course of the game, combined with some clever meta humor that leaves you wondering what's real and what's not.It's not a long game, roughly two hours which is fine for a US$5 assuming that's you're kind of schtick.

I also like the graphics for this game, it does a good job setting the mood for the game.I wouldn’t say this game is perfect by any means. Some parts of the game get very repetitive and frustrating at times. The soundtrack, in my opinion, is nothing special.

This must have will have you on the edge of your seat cursing at yourself each time you can't get a result. Horror is well defined in this one.Picking out a horror game isn't the easiest task anymore. So many times I watch a trailer, buy a game and spend the next couple of minutes waiting for it to install at the edge of my seat with the lights off to get into the horror game mood. Waiting fanatically for that install bar to complete, amping myself up with a spare pair of trousers at my side, just in case. And then the moment comes when I find out I am going to be walking around for the better part of an hour for a single jump scare and a bogus ""moral"" to contemplate.Pony Island has none of the later part of this. Each second I played I couldn't help, but feel challanged and spooked in the best of ways. A wonderful mix of horror, puzzles, adventure, comedy and ponies."

It meshes an adventure game with a free running game while pushing on the fourth wall so far it comes dangerously close to pretention.The gameplay is nothing complicated, the free running is simple with few obstacles to keep you from progressing.  The adventure is where things get interesting, here you ""reprogram"" the game with a set of logic puzzles and make decisions about how you may progress.  Taken together it creates a surreal environment which paints a disturbing picture of who and what the protagonist is and what is actually happening.As to where you are and what Pony Island is, I won't delve too far into details for risk of spoiling the experience.  It is a carefully tailored experience to lead you to the proper conclusions and make you want to dig around in the game for more information.Unfortunately, the game digs into insufferable pretention enough to make every hipster on the West Coast of the US roll their eyes until they go blind (a net positive outcome).  The antagonist is an obvious author insert who spends most of the game telling you how much smarter than you he is and how you couldn't possibly develop a game like this, perhaps even lacking the intellectual capacity to enjoy it.While there are annoying problems with the game's attitude, they are far outmatched by the quality and enjoyability of the experience, making this well worth playing."

Pony Island does a good job depicting you as being toyed with by an all-powerful being, trying to break out of his prison by slowly breaking down the rules until you find a flaw in the system.Big complaint is the length of the game compared to the price. Not a lot of replay value, the game is pretty short (took me less than two hours), the gameplay is pretty bland (but you can argue it's intentional, after all Satan can't program a good game), and the ending is pretty unsatisfying. It could probably take less than 3 hours to 100% all the achievements if you knew what you were doing.

The story is great and the platforming is awsome.Platforming-The platforming in this game is better than the last 2 mario games. Everything plays solid, the only thing that might trip you up is the glitch flashing on the screen sometimes but thats part of the feel of the game.Puzzles-The puzzles are smart and add new elements bit by bit. The only time might get stuck is if you try to play the games start to finish, you might get tired and not think strait. The puzzles are fari and beatableMusic-What can I say the sound Track gets 10/10 but the music is even better ingame. The second I finished the first thing I did was buy the soundtrack. It fits the mood of whatever level your in but never sticks out. When you listen to the soundtrack you can tell what part of the game the music is from with out reading the name of the songVerdict-This is a game I think every one should play and experence. For the price its great and you can get good replay value out of the 24 in game tickerts. Over all i think Pony Island is a great Platformer/Puzzle Aventure and a great way to spend 2-3 houres.9.7/10Edit:I Just 100% the game and ther is a secret boss fight that you dont want to miss.

I’m generally not a fan of 8-bit games, but I respect a good game when I play one.The game started a little slow for me and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue, but I kept powering through. I started getting into the storyline a little more and decided that this was a game that I would see all the way through. I really loved how they incorporated me (personally) into the game, not just my game character. The story was entertaining (no spoilers), but the game play is a little redundant. Luckily, the game is relatively short, so the redundancy is tolerable… and necessary for the storyline. I really appreciated the subtle blur between game and reality (play the game to find out), and wished that there was more of it. … Picture “Eternal Darkness.”I totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, simple game mechanics, and has a few hours to spare.

The game throws you into a simple game of jumping over fences, but also while trying to escape from the machine. It shows nice, happy ponies, but under the ""mask"" the game has, it is going through hell. I mean sure they might say in the beginning that the machine wanted your soul, and to me, it was okay. But it got stranger when I looked around. Also it got stranger when depictions of pentagrams and demons appeared through out the game. Overall, it was one of the best games I have played in a while. I would highly reccomend it."

Rather it is a lampoon of the cutesy pony games, and it goes into dark places. Demons and trapped souls make up the main story. The excellent writing makes the thought of souls trapped in an 8-bit video game seem perfectly believable. There isn’t a lot of realistic blood and gore that can be done with a limited graphic set, so the story line brings the creepiness to the game. The game juxtaposes cute and terrible to great effect.There are 3 kinds of mini-games:1.	Action sequences like a pony arcade game2.	Programming puzzles3.	Miscellaneous othersThe programming puzzles are clever and the miscellaneous ones require out-of-the-box thinking. I found the pony action sequences to be repetitive and difficult after a bit, and require really fine timing and reflexes. If you're into classic arcade-style games, then this is actually a selling point. If you're not an expert, then the other good points of this game more than make up for it. There were a few times in the game where I had to look up help to get around a puzzle, and one point where I didn’t even know if I was in some sort of fool’s errand Purgatory with no solution. (make sure your screen brightness is cranked up)The story is where the game excels. It’s creepy in ways you couldn’t guess... Several times it leans heavily on the fourth wall. For the price, the value is excellent. It took me 10 hours to beat the game, and I want to go back and get all the achievements. Definitely value for the money, I wish that more of the first-person adventure games that cost far more would have writing that’s equally good. The artwork is excellent too and imitates the 8-bit world right on the money.8/10"

One of them is a puzzle with very interesting and fun ideas, 4th wall breaking. It is quite unique, funny and overall great.2. The other one is the most boring, laziest sidescroller I've seen recently. You wouldn't spend five minutes playing this one even if it was free, you wouldn't even bother reading this review. It's a game that a beginner developer could make in a few hours.Now the question is if the quality of the puzzle game outweighs how utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the sidescroller is. Now the game often jokes about how bad it is, you could also say that it being bad is part of the concept. But that doesn't alter the fact that half the time you're playing a bad game.Also, the visuals of both games are hurting my eyes, and the game gives a constant humming noise instead of a soundtrack (intentionally). They seem to try to justify this by making it look like an old arcade game, but arcade games CAN have nice soundtrack and fun visuals. There is no ultrawide 21:9 support, the game is fixed 16:9, no mods available right now.Overall the game has pretty big problems (half of the gameplay is junk, ugly visuals, no soundtrack, no sounds). They try to justify this by building a story around why it is so bad.I give it thumbs up only because of its uniqueness, but this is a neutral review.  I really like unique ideas, but the execution is far from good here.Conclusion: buy only if heavily discounted."

It gets very repetitive. The graphics are really pixelated, even for a pixel art this is extreme! It seems like it was made mostly for kids given how simple the game play really is.I guess I could forgive it for just being a simple little time waster, but it's very glitchy! Most of the menu options just straight up don't work, and you see bits of code that the developers forgot to clean up. While these just look like simple over sights, they aren't game breaking.

A self-aware game playing around with conventions and poking fun at video games in general, but some of its story elements come off hollow.  Get it on sale, but a replay of the game is liable to make you like it less.It's trying to follow the same path as undertale.  To an extent, it succeeds, but without any of the branching paths.  This works fine if you try to proceed as the designer expects, but you become aware that this game trying to undermine you is really just shoving you along the plot, including one point where the guide flat-out tells you so.Still, the main gameplay is solid, and comes to a satisfying conclusion.  There is a reward for 100% and a few minor differences for playing it again, but it comes off more as a slap in the face than anything."

It's kind of a hard game to really put in to words to try and describe it to some one. You almost have to experiance it for yourself. Its one of those oddball games for people who like that kind of stuff and every now and then its a nice break from the norm. I got it on sale for $1.50 and for the 3.5 hours i got out of it i was pretty pleased with it.

There's not much to say without completely giving away the game, but the gameplay is mainly jumping over hurdles. Literally. There's also puzzles, which thankfully add to the somewhat repetitive hurdle-jumping. It does get more intense as the game goes on, but again, no spoilers. The graphics are not great, but authentic to the feel the game gives. There is one thing that REALLY stood out to me as I played. The soundtrack. It is PHENOMENAL, one that I would definitely recommend buying, even if you don't like the game. Most likely, you'll beat it in about 2 hours in one sitting. So, take that information, combine it with the 5 dollar price, and make of that what you will. All in all, the game was very good, and a very well-executed idea, but I felt the repetition was a bit much for me. However, I recommend it because I know that it is a game that a large amount of people would like. So, if you're into good puzzles, a well-crafted story, some repetition, a great soundtrack, and a fun couple of hours, then I would definitely suggest that you pick it up."

76561198141565612,Recommended,405640,29148738,Posted: 9 January,all,Arcane Guardian,"I'm going to go through a few pros and cons of the game. Don't read ahead if you don't want spoilers.Pro - Interesting premise for the sort of generic 'you're stuck in hell/limbo' type of a game. You're a soul playing an arcade game about ponies the devil designed as a way of convincing you to give up your soul. I can dig that.Pro - Vague storytelling that compels you to keep playing. At several points in the game, you come across a red code-demon who gives you blurry visions of your life before you died, and then you can ask one of three questions he presents to you. There are 5 questions in total, so you'd have to go back and replay certain areas to ask all 5, but they all have very short answers that compel you to find out more.Who was I? ""Your name was Theodore. You left behind a mother and a daughter.""Who killed me? ""His name was Abu Al-Kindi. He fought for his city.""When did I die? ""1252 years after Christ was born. In the waning summer sun.""Where did I die? ""At the foot of Jerusalem's Wall. Far from your home.""How did I get here? ""Your soul is damned. All damned souls come here. Before moving on.""Along with this information, there is a secret avatar later in the game you can discover, who is a Crusader. If you put the pieces together, you can infer that the character you play as was a crusader trying to take back Jerusalem, but was killed in the process. Makes sense why Satan wants your♥♥♥♥♥Con - If you collect all 24 tickets hidden throughout the game, you unlock the secret boss fight with the blue soul. It has 3 phases. The first 2 I found to be slightly difficult, with every hit you take it restores some of the boss's health, but the last fight was incredibly easy and very unfulfilling after it was beaten. You don't get a prize, you don't get any achievements, nothing. You don't even kill the boss! All he does is give you some extra dialouge and then sits there until you choose to exit the game COMPLETELY. Not even to the title screen. Just exit the whole thing. Very unrewarding fight and seemed to serve no other purpouse than to be an easter egg. (which there are already a ton of in the game.)Pro - EASTER EGGS AND SECRETS. I love me a good secret. There are a good amount in the game so I won't bother listing them, but you'd probably need to look REALLY hard if you wanted to find all of them WITHOUT using a guide.Con - Repetive gameplay that get's annoying after awhile. During the adventure mode part of the game, It was annoying having to do the same mechanics over and over, especilly if I died and had to restart the level. Not a huge deal, but I didn't care for it at times.Pro - New style of puzzle solving! The idea of going into the games code and switching things around to advance in itself isn't a new concept, (see Magic Cirle) but Pony Island's take on it was refreshing for me.blah blah blah im sure there are more but this is all I care to write.

For less than two bucks on sale right now I would highly recommend it. This game is better the less you know about it so I will keep the review simple. The game is broken into two gameplay styles platforming and puzzle solving. The platforming is definitely the weaker of the two but not bad in anyway. The puzzles are very unique and enjoyable. The best part of the game is the atmosphere/story. This game will mess with you. It reminds me a bit of Eternal Darkness for the Gamecube in that way.  The gameplay does start to grind on you in the end but the game finishes up before it wears out its welcome. If you want to try something different give this a try."

The reason is that it takes less than two hours to play and,on balance, the jokes and the novelty outweigh the fact that the neither of the games-within-a-game are particularly good.The ""hacking"" puzzle game is only OK and the ""Pony Island"" minigame is truly terrible. It's deliberately terrible because it is Satan's own game, but it would still be intolerably crap if the experience wasn't over in two hours: It's just barely short enough that you can laugh it off.What makes the game shine are the metagame elements (Asmodeus is particularly great) and the narrative -- you really do want to find out what happens next.

Twisting how you expect a game, and Steam for that matter, to work, it plays games with your mind more than you play the actual game itself. The story is very simple but the way it unfolds is anything but conventional. I find it difficult to explain without ruining any of the very original ideas it has in store, but I will say this, - Pony Island is the most unique game I've played since The Stanley Parable.The less said about Pony Island, the better. !̸̶͚͖͖̩̻̩̗͍̮̙̈͊͛̈͒̍̐ͣͩ̋ͨ̓̊̌̈̊́̚͝͠ͅ ̷̧̢̛͖̤̟̺̫̗͚̗͖ͪ̏̔̔̒́ͥ̓ͫ̀ͤ̇ͥ͝ ̡̊͛̇ ͫ̉ͦ̊̀̔ͧͮ͆̽ͦͩ͋̌͗̚̚҉̵͖̟. ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴘʟᴀʏ ɪᴛ !̸̶͚͖͖̩̻̩̗͍̮̙̈͊͛̈͒̍̐ͣͩ̋ͨ̓̊̌̈̊́̚͝͠ͅ ̷̧̢̛͖̤̟̺̫̗͚̗͖ͪ̏̔̔̒́ͥ̓ͫ̀ͤ̇ͥ͝ ̡̊͛̇ ͫ̉ͦ̊̀̔ͧͮ͆̽ͦͩ͋̌͗̚̚҉̵͖̟."

The good news however?  Pony Island is surprisingly very fun.  There isn't a whole lot that can be said because the core enjoyment of this game is in the experience of playing through.  It is one of those novelties that you play once.With that said, it takes only a few hours to beat which is good considering both the price and the gameplay.  The puzzles range of easy to challenging towards the end.  The story isn't super complex or exciting but the concept is unique enough to drive the game forward.The only real complaint I have is the arcade portion became a teensy bit too hard towards the end of the game.It's a cool game and if you have a couple hours on hand and are looking for something different give Pony Island a shot."

It has two types of puzzles. It has a more structured type of puzzles with clear mechanics and rules, and it has a little bit of more open-ended point-and-click-style puzzle, but the real challenge of the game comes from the former.Although the puzzles themselves are fun, and the runner mechanics are not bad, the real joy of the game comes from the characters, the mystery, the plot, the hidden secrets and easter eggs, and all the other gimmics that I won't spoil for you. This is a really weird game, full of surprises, and that's where the game shines the most. This game took me about three hours to complete, mind you I went fairly slow looking for secrets, and I'm going to go back and try to find the rest, but if I had to guess as to the minimum amount of gameplay, I'd say an hour and a half, maybe? Not to say I spent 90 minutes hunting for secrets, but you might be faster at solving the puzzles than me.TL;DR The game has solid puzzles, but it's more than just the puzzles: it's the progression and surprises that make this game great. Avoid spoilers at all costs."

It's... better than I expected.Going in blind into this game appealed only by the trailer I found myself quite a quick and fun game to beat.- The story catches you by surprise and it is the main catch of this game. It has a retro feel to it and the vintage TV border was a great touch to it. There are a few easter eggs and secrets.- You'll be playing more for the story and progression rather than the gameplay, for me the gameplay is one of its bad sides as it gets repetitive despite adding more elements to the same gameplay core. It's always the same in the end.- As you progress it gets more and more interesting, it has a slow and boring start though.Despite being a pony game and not appealing to a lot of people due to certain stereotypes and being labelled girly at first sight I do recommend this game. Do not play it for the gameplay but rather for the story it contains.It's a very short game but it fits the low pricing it has."

The game is constanly throwing surprises, even when you think you've seen everything it had, and, while not being very challenging - most of it can be played using only mouse - it still has ability to keep the player engaged. The sound really fits the game -the part when arcade machine boots up, crashes or glitches.Visually its done in a stylish manner, that suits the overall narrative. And secrets - lots of them!

I personally would be happy paying much more than what they charge for it. One of the best indie games I’ve seen in a long time, in opinion even outclassing FNAF in its unique storytelling ability combined with simple gameplay.Also for anyone wondering, this is NOT a game for children, so definitely do not purchase this for your 6yo that is heavy into unicorns. This is a satanic puzzle game, get your facts straight parents!Overall, 5 Neps out of 5, a truly fascinating experience for those daring enough to venture down the path of Lucifer’s strange interest with ponies."
