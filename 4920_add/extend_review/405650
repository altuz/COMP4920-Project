Developers have proven to be a scam.First of all, anything they say it's hacking will be reported as that, with no further explanation. They don't say what methods they use to check if runs are legit or not, and don't provide any source of screenshots to see if they're aiming properly with their scripts.Secondly, the game was beaten legit months ago.Amaklavdid it time ago but was nulified for ""abusing the pause menu"", and immediately updated a new patched limitating the pausing during levels. So they literally changed the rules during the contest. Gamers outsmarted them by ""cheesing"" the game and they considered it as ""hacking"". And since they're the ones who give the money, who can obligate them?And finally,CreamyBubblebeated this game fully legit, and even recorded the whole session(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lFDcvX_9kk). Devs simply came and say ""we detected two hacks including wall hack so this is not legit"". I dare you to check the vid and tell me where's he hacking.I'll leave here the thread were everything is burning:http://steamcommunity.com/app/405650/discussions/0/451848855000466997/So long story short, don't support this game for the devs as they're definately mocking us. They don't have the money and they won't give it to nobody. The rules are made accurately so that they can legally deny EVERYTHING. Smart move."
,Recommended,405650,18891125,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,DeadbeatJesus,"Whilst at work, I was reading Kotaku, and discovered that the developers of Zero Reflex were offering $10,000 to the player who could beat it first. I rushed home, bought it the moment it came out, and proceeded upon my descent into the maddening hell that is this game.Zero Reflex is self-explanatory. You're limited to moving around a perfectly circular track that surrounds a nameless Eye. The Eye employs different attack patterns in each level, which you progress through in a random order. You work your way through the game, avoiding the things that make you die. Continue to do so until you win. Harder than it sounds, I assure you. ""Ah,"" you think to yourself, ""well that may be so for you, puny mortal, but I am the God of the bullet-hell genre."" Well then, my Lord, if that is the case then you should definitely buy this, but seriously, this game'll still make you cry.The unique twist that Zero Reflex employs is that whenever you die to a level, you have to repeat a certain amount of the levels you had completed prior. Die in any of those, and you regress even further. The higher the difficulty you're playing at, the further you regress with each death, and the less life you're given in order to survive each level. Effectively the game has 60 levels, comprised of 20 unique level designs, each with three difficulty modifers. Beat all 20 once, and you're made to repeat them at a higher difficulty. In the final set of 20, you die after one hit, and are sent back three levels for each death. Please be warned; this can get very upsetting.I haven't quite beaten the game yet. I came incredibly close, before it decided to take what little hope I had of success, and beat me religiously with it until I gave up. And so I'm taking a break to write this review. However, I do believe that the $10,000 has already been won, given the amount of people with 100% of the achievements. That said, don't let it discourage you from buying this. For less than $5 it's a steal, the developers deserve your money, and what's more, it'll develop a love-hate relationship with you that you'll be telling your kids about for years. - ""Ah yes, Timmy. I remember the days when I used to play Zero Reflex. I lost both of my hands to that vile game, y'know. Marvellous it was, marvellous."""

,Not Recommended,405650,21160626,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,Cray,"As first I was searching for some neat bullet hell game, I occasionally stumbled on this.First of all: Gameplay and the game itself.Well, the graphics are very minimalistic, but i told myself that it was no big deal, as long as the game would be packing.Sure, the first impression of the game wasn't bad, actually I enjoyed it. As farther you progress though, you see that it gets very boring and repetititve, that's exactly the way to describe this game's punishment method: repetitive. When one dies, he gets sent back an amount of levels, and needs to replay it to the point where he was before. I am sure it looked nice on paper, but in reality it just gets extreamly boring. Then, the difficulty scaling, is absolute bulcrap, the attack pattern remains the same, it just goes faster, you got less lives, it sends you back EVEN MORE and optionally the eye shoots more bullets at you. Fake difficulty indeed. But appart of this, it has this little fun effect, doesn't look like a finished game to me, more like one of these generic android games which you download, try out and delete in 5 minutes, mostly cause as you see all the patterns, it gets boring.TL;DR:Gameplaywise it is an ""OK"" game, could surely get better if the devs would put more effort into it and implement more stuff.So no, I DON'T reccomend this game, but i'll surely keep an EYE on it, for what happens next. :)"

,Recommended,405650,18903915,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,hackfrag@orlygift,"I always liked reflex based games, titles that allow you to always push towards your limits, but there’s something in particular that makes Zero Reflex so cool and exciting! This is a very interesting game because it brings in front a whole bunch of cool mechanics, and all of them are combined towards perfection in a stellar manner, as you would expect.What makes Zero Reflex great for me is the simple fact that this title offers you 30 seconds of amazing goodness. Simply put, you need to survive in a ton of worlds that have an eye at the center of it all, and that particular eye throws a ton of stuff at you. It can attack you directly, from behind or you will have to avoid numbers, small balls and so on. It’s a unique combination of tools that can be accessed here, and all of them are offered in an amazing manner which you will love for sure.It’s exciting and fun what a simple reflex title can do, and I have to say that I really like their mechanic when you die. The idea is simple, when you die, you get transported to the previous level, so if you finished level 20, started 21 and you died there within those 30 seconds, then you will get back to level 20. This way the game doesn’t really offer a setback, instead it’s created to be more rewarding and fun as a whole, which you will love for sure.The whole idea of passing all 60 challenges and winning $10000 is amazing, but let’s face it, this can be a tough challenge even for those that are accustomed with this type of game. The title can be frustrating at times, true, but it’s the entire nature of playing such a game that offers such a feeling, so you can expect yourself to spend a lot of time playing and trying to complete each level.I was impressed with Zero Reflex to be honest, as it does an amazing job when it comes to making its gameplay fun, accessible and quirky! It’s a really cool game, and at the end of the day this is what matters the most. It’s exciting, funny, but also frustrating, so it’s basically the perfect combination for those that want to enjoy a challenge and also have fun playing this sort of title. If you like such as experience, hop in for the ride, Zero Reflex is amazing!"
,Recommended,405650,18894627,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,(YouTube)Dragnix,"Summary:A small but pointed game that does the job at the price that it's asking for. It's a simple and straight forward game as you simply avoid hazards left and right while trying to make it to the next level. While it had the $10,000 as the draw, I wanna say it didn't need it as it's simple gameplay is complemented by the use of expectation between levels very well. The mechanic of having to go back X amount of levels on failure is helped by the levels feeling so different from each other, yet having a familarity in them as well. It uses the content it has very well as contrasted against itself, and it's only helped by a strong visual aesthetic. The soundtrack, while not my cup of tea persay, definitely does the job in terms of action oriented gameplay. While I'd like to see more levels and some other game modes in the long run, for 3 bucks, it's hard not to say the game is worth it, as it reminds me of the simplicity of games like Super Hexagon, while keeping the action up. Worth a look.Gameplay Footage and Video Review:https://youtu.be/rkbwu_9GbbwLists:+:Uses its level design against itself to subvert expectations, keeping the player on notice and not lulling him into any security better then a lot of games out there.Stage Loss mechanic works well to give the player all the reason in the world not to fail, especially in quick succession.Simple gameplay done well, very straight forward, but effective.Visual appeal with the neon and completely different color schemes between different levels.While the soundtrack isn't what I'd normally listen to, the dubstep/electronica fits the game rather well and does the job to complement the action.Price seems to match the content in question in favor of the consumer, yet not screwing the developer.-:Would like to see more. 60 challenges is a tiny misleading, it's really 20 levels with increasing difficulty (it does play different). Feel the game could add more content to really bring it to the next level.Again, just more. Adding a score mode collecting points in some way would help in longetivity.Little odd segments with recording at times with spikes, but never experienced it during non-recording gameplay."

Unfortunatly, the management at Exordium think they are EA and pulled a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥move by knowingly creating a fake contest to sucker people in. I voted for this on greenlight and bought it with no intention of getting that $10,000 prize, but just the fact they would knowingly ruin the reputation of they're game when reputation is one of the MOST important parts of being successful as an indie dev. THis game would have easily gotten an overwelmingly positive rating on Steam, and they could have made so much money! But no, they ruined the compsnies reputation on Steam, and the games reputation, because they just a little too greedy. Honestly, although there other games look great, I am going to be skepticle of them, as although this game is enjoyable, they have lost my trust."

What happens is people cheat quite easily, convince people the beat it legitimately, then claim fraud on the game company when their cheating is revealed.  Even when the game company gives hard evidence and proof to the cheat, it is ignored and forgotten.  I feel sorry for Exordium Games because apparently random strangers on the internet are far more trustworthy than them for some obscure reason, even when the random strangers are directly without any question proven wrong.  As for the winner being annonymous, I'm sure that was because they wanted to be since who in their right mind would want to be known for obsessing over a game that much, even when it brought reward?  In short, what we have here is a great game company who made a great game and even offered an unnecessary reward for those diligent enough to beat it, but we then have a community who claims fraud when proof is given.  Thank you for your great game Exordium Games!  I hope you get your deserved reputation back."
