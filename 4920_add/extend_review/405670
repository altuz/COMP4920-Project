76561198040837514,Recommended,405670,25005670,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,Brudda,"Combat core is an excellent arena brawler.  I highly recommend this game if you want something fun, casual, and different than your traditional fighting games.The gameplay is very solid.  There are no special inputs you have to execute to perform specific attacks, it's as easy as pressing one button, or you can mix it up with two different buttons.  There are a handful of fighters that you can choose from at the moment, they all have their own unique moveset and look.Before every round you can select a ""core"".  These grant you special abilities that you can use, such as laser beams, super uppercuts, super piledriver, charged rush, etc... These cost energy points to use during battle.The best thing about this game is you can create your own fighter.  You actually can pick and choose what attacks they can have.  The attacks aren't unique though, they are borrowed from the current roster of fighter's, but they all are made available to you.  This gives you so many options to find the best combo to use.You also have full customization of your fighters appearance.  Not too many options at the moment, but enough to give it a unique look.I don't have any negatives for this game other than further polishing of combat mechanics and more fleshed out stages.From an hours to price ratio you will get your money's worth.  Overall this is a great Early Access game, I would definitely pick this game up whenever you can, a must have for your library."

Combat Core is not the best fighting game but,I can tell you that it is the most addictive game.Control is very nice - Very smooth and intuitive and also easy.even for people who don't like fighting games (because they are difficult)combat core is easy to control.but gameplay is not just simple. there are so many environments and itemsto use and care, and you can make tons of combinations by equipping different kindsof combat core. and it definitely affects players' gameplay style. and it allows strategicgameplay. now sound effect also is cool, music is super nice.( + you can also create your own character)and VR experience is just amazing.I am sure that combat core is definitely the best VR game (which played with controller)on Steam VR. it is totally different experience from monitor play.it feels like I am controlling mini combat figures just in front of eyes.it is super immersive and realistic gameplay even though there is little annoyingissues. (soon will be fixed) for me, combat core is one of the best VR game so far.if you like fighting games and have VR - MUST BUY.if you like fighting games and have NO VR - STRONGLY RECOMMENDEDIf you don't like fighting games and have VR - RECOMMENDEDIf you don't like fighting games and have no VR - JUST TRY. you can refund if you don't like.Graphic - 7/10 (Getting Better!)Sound Effect - 8/10Music - 9/10Gameplay - 9/10UI and Designs - 8/10VR Exprience - 10/10Overall8.5 out of 10 - Very Nice"

76561198100955117,Recommended,405670,25137480,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,View The Phenom,"A great 3d arena brawler, Combat Core has the ""pick up and play"" accessibility of a party game while providing room for a lot of technical depth once you understand how the various mechanics work. Fights involve 2-4 players and uses the character stock system similar to Super Smash Bros..Basic combat involves utilizing weapons, grabs, quick combo strings and core attacks to deal damage to your opponent; as a party game this is enough to ensure a good time if you just want to beat down your friends in a few matches. However, once you understand how the parry and defensive roll mechanics work the technical game opens up considerably.Parrying is a technique that allows players to completely reverse momentum when successfully executed, even during a combo string! This is an incredibly powerful tool because it means that attempting to land combos is incredibly difficult as the defender can choose to parry at any point during the chain; if you're not using this you are missing out on the strongest defensive option in the game.As a counter to this incredibly powerful defensive option we have core attacks, heavy attacks and grabs. Core attacks are special abilities that require energy to use and cannot be parried, heavy attacks are abilities with delayed start-up that have the ability to bait and punish attempts to parry a combo string and grabs cannot be parried at all.This results in a series of mind games where the attacker attempts to bait and punish parries during his combo string while the defender needs to guess whether to parry or anticipate and evade an attack meant to bait his parry. It gets much deeper when you consider the different combo strings, heavy and core attacks for each character, so I'll avoid trying to get too heavily into it. Just rest assured that the game is much deeper than a simple button masher.The overall aesthetic feels good with music fitting the tron-style design of the stages and setting. Each character has its own personality with moves and sound bites to match.As for negatives, it is an early access game with a heavy emphasis on fine tuning the combat first. The UI and character models need polish, game modes are fairly limited, stages are limited and need polish, there's a limited number of weapons, the character editor needs work, along with all the bugs and glitches that normally show up in an early access game. However, there's a lot to love even now and the dev is very active and receptive to feedback; he regularly responds to comments in the steam discussion forum and even chats in the discord channel.If you're a fan of arena brawlers and fighting games in general, Combat Core is worth a look. While deceptively simple, it provides a lot of customization and depth for both players looking for a good brawl and those that like to play with a more competitive mindset."

There's not really much incentive to play yet since there's just Free For All and Team Stock Battle with players or bots, and a good character creator with everything unlocked."

Like you have to get it exactly correct or 0.1 - 0.2 seconds off in order to counter (which does no damage btw, only makes an opening for you to counter attack) in a fast pace gameplay setting :/The good things about this game:- fast pace brawling kind of gameplay- very fun when you play against your own skill level- more cool stuff still coming"

,Recommended,405670,33327542,Posted: 6 July,all,RockstarCRO,"Super Smash Bros. since its debut on the n64 has made an impact on the battle world. I can still play the original Super Smash on n64 and be pretty happy with the game. For whatever reason, I never thought about what if Super Smash was in three dimensions. I guess this is why Combat Core exists. In essence, Combat Core feels like Fighting Force 64 meets Smash sort of meets Dragon Ball Xenoverse. There is  a lot of potential here, but there is also a bit of work and organization to do. Remember - do your homework as this is in early access!Combat Core'sgameplayis at best neutral/ok. I cannot say its bad because there were efforts to make the deliver of the attacks unique, but I can't say its good either because I feel a little more variety needs to be added as well as fluidity. The basic movement system allows the player move along a three dimensional plane and jump to different heights in the battling levels, so jumping is possible. While in the air, players can attack. However, at the moment (I hope), players cannot really string combinations together with air attacks. The attacks work in what seems like a four combination scheme. There are two types of attacks : light attacks and heavy attacks. The same attack animation does not happen unless you do the same combination. The game does have highlights of cool battle, but sometimes it feels like whoever button mashes the most will win. I certainly don't like that and do like a bit of dynamic and challenge when playing these sort of games. Melee had that fade/dodge - this also has dodge but not to the degree that Smash had it. From what I understood from the semi-tutorial, you can mix up the light and heavy attacks to delivered a somewhat varied combo. Objects or weapons are also available in game. You can throw objects and hit other characters with objects. When you launch objects, they are automatically thrown at the opponents. Some people may like this, I would prefer more control over how hard I can throw instead of having a linear system in place.The characters have different abilities and skill sets. Speed, health and power are a few qualities that will determine your characters abilities. Bigger characters are generally slower and pack more of a punch whereas smaller characters are faster, but do less damage. In the character selection screen, players can choose what type of core to give their character. Cores will allow players to modify the characters stats to favor their playing type (so power over speed or speed over power). Cores allow the players to use their power-up burst move that delivers quite a bit of damage. If you hold down the heavy hit button, this will activate the start of the move. I tried looking more into how everything works. The how to play introduction is a bit rocky. It does explain some of the aspects of the game by showing you the button and animation in a small video. Issue is some of these videos freeze or go white and don't repeat or can seldom freeze the game. Not only that, specials aren't specifically demonstrated. Meaning the button combination required to make it happen isn't really shown. It would be nice having a training tutorial walk-through to help familiarize the player with the game and its specials.Thevisualsare okay at the moment. The levels sort of follow a transparent 3D single color neon look. I hope they add some color and some more objects to the game. I think adding more break-able objects would also deliver a better gameplay and visual experience. I love the stage design for the fact they've made levels in which players can go up and down, but players can't really get knocked off the heights or off the stage. I think its good players cannot fall off the stage, but at the same time it takes away from the excitement of throwing someone off a height (in a virtual world of course :D). Thesoundsare ok for the most part and the commentators  are okay. Their opinions are not too varied at the moment, but that is understandable as the game is incomplete (and the gameplay is a lot more important than this). I think adding more effects or special effects for certain attacks would engage the player a lot more into the game.Overall, a decent start to an early access game. It's fun and has a cool model with local and multiplayer game-play, but why not push to reach new potentials? I think there are a few suggestions the game would benefit from. One suggestion I would add is a third attack button. This could be in the form of evasion and attack or even better - a counter. I think the game would greatly benefit from such a feature. Also, consider having a second special - maybe something completely different from the first - or allow the player to choose? I would also continue to work on the movement. Even though switching and turning on a dime is awesome, it would make players think twice how they move knowing that it might take half a second for the character to properly change animations from getting traction to attacking. I'm neutral about this game and do like it, but I think the price is a little steep at the moment. I would definitely do your research on this one.EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.85/10GameplayC+Story / CampaignN/AVisuals / User InterfaceC+Sounds / MusicCReplay-abilityC+OverallC+"

I can see where they might be going with this game but it's a long ways off I right now.  Incredibly small arsenal of moves with barely any depth of gameplay.   While the arenas look super cool at first glance, they're nearly indistinguishable.  Creating a fighter is a nightmare and is just a mash up of the same set of moves.  I know it's early access but I just don't see what they are going to add in the future here that's going to make this come together.  This seems like a pretty first draft demo to me.Awesome cohesive soundtrack.  Booooooo basically everything else."

Wish the combat fighting system was more better combo input. Combo is just too simple and not really fun to play. AI on the other hand is so cheap. Spam a lot on grabbing and special, they tend to beat you down without a fighting chance. I know it's EA, but judging by it's dull and boring fighting mechanic.
