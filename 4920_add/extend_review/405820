,Recommended,405820,19750916,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,DeliveryGodNoah,"I've been a VERY LONG and dedicated fan to the Turok franchise since I was a child. Turok and Turok 2 were my first FPS games I have ever played, and I played them repeatedly as a child and into adulthood.I have every N64 game, PC port, Gameboy game, Turok Evolution, and even the incredibly average Turok 2008 on PS3 and PC. I even dabbled in the comics, toys, and collectables.You're, most likely, coming here from the N64 version of Turok, and that's fine. To be honest, there were few differences, even visually, from the original PC port and the N64 port of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter. On modern systems, there were a few glitches with the PC port, such as the music randomly cutting off entirely, and some visual hiccups.This PC version actually has some dramatic differences from the original game. First off, visually, it's certainly improved in most areas, and unnecessary in others.The most important visual difference is the increased draw distance. HOLY CRAP was I surprised to see the game with increased view distance.Don't misunderstand, there's still fog, but it's almost doubled in the amount you can see in front of you. There was so much environmental detail obscured by the N64 fog that has now been opened for everyone to see in this PC port.As someone who has played Turok more times than I can even hope to remember, for possibly hundreds of hours total, I actually felt like I was playing a different game entirely for a moment. To new players, you won't be at all impressed. In fact, you will for a fact say that the game looks ugly and the level design is terrible. But for long-time fans of the game, this will rebreathe life into the game visually.The next major change is the added on visual effects. This was mostly unnecessary, but I don't dislike any of it. There's now God Rays, Bloom, real-time reflections on water, and other visual effects. Sometimes they all clutter together in a bit of a mess, other times it looks rather appealing and colorful.Luckily, love it or hate it, these options are toggleable. You can turn off what you want and leave on what you want. You can make the game look as close to the original PC/N64 port as you want, even as far as turning the screen resolution down to good old 1997 graphics.The next major change is in gameplay. The original game, on N64 at least, made use of slightly clunky controls that resulted in making it impossible to do any precise aiming. To alleviate this, auto-aim was present, with no on-screen crosshair.In this PC port, there's still auto-aim, but I believe you can turn it off, and even put an on-screen crosshair. Since you'll likely be using a KB+M setup, this means you can finally aim (mostly) accurately with a typical modern FPS WASD setup.Also, thanks to the VASTLY improved framerate (as this is on PC), moving, jumping, and shooting all feels responsive, and those first person platforming sections feel more possible than ever!There is this horribly exaggerated headbob/sway. I know the original game certainly had headbob, but with the increased control and FOV it makes the sway dizzying to a degree. Strafing left of right has Turok fling his body and perspective by almost 45 degrees. Luckily, NightDive Studios provided and made the ability to turn this option off! Barely a couple days later they released a patch and now the headbob is completely toggleable, making the game much more playable to those who get sick from dramatic perspective shifts.Finally however, there is the game environment itself. In the first level alone so far, there have been pretty sizable changes to enemy placements, environment positions, and even entire new sections of the level. Seeing these new areas made my head spin. It'smostlywhat you might remember, but certainly changed. I can't say if I entirely like this or not. On one hand, it's a nice change of pace, almost like I'm playing the game for the first time again. On the other, it does seem to mean that a lot I thought I knew about Turok is mostly useless. It hasn't been too drastic yet, however, but we will see how that changes as I progress in the game.The music is still fantastic, easily my favourite percussion based soundtrack in any game EVER, fitting each level perfectly. Textures and character models are sharper and cleaner, but are exactly the same from 1997. Sound effects are also the same, though the sound design as a whole has been tweaked for the better to be more crisp.I do have a few nitpicks:1. No walk toggle. This was crucial in some of the platforming sections, and it seem Turok's movement speed has been slightly increased otherwise.2. The earlier mentioned headbob/sway.3. Gamepad controls feel floaty and imprecise.4. The map overlay shows in areas that in the previous port didn't. For examples, in the original port there were certain areas where the map did not draw, forcing you to explore, mostly in maze like areas. To 98% of players, this might be a great change, but for the 2% that have brain damage like myself, we might prefer the areas where we couldn't rely on the map.Overall, this is still Turok, one of the greatest old-school first person shooters I've ever played, and can only be topped by it's sequel, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (Please be swift Nightdive Studios!!!)I WANT to recommend this game to newcomers, but I'm afraid most of them will♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it for being old and outdated.This is really meant to be a game for the fans and nostalgic players, of which there are many.Edit about Price (12/17/2015): A friend of mine mentioned about the price. Currently, on release, it's sitting at $16 on sale, and $20 normally.Personally, I find that $15 should be the standard price, and they could have done $10 on sale. Other people would disagree and say $10 should be the base price.I feel $15 is fair, for a couple reasons.1. The original PC port of Turok is sitting between $20-40 depending on where you look. There are a few areas where it's cheaper, but the only one I found was from Italy.2. The original PC port isn't guaranteed to work. I know personally I had issues getting the soundtrack to keep playing during gameplay3. This isn't using the original engine, meaning some work had to be put in, especially to slap on those graphical effects and the change things around. This isn't a simple updated port, there are things literally changed from the source material."

,Recommended,405820,19750570,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,Lunacy,"The best way to play Turok.The first time I really play Turok 1. I've always been a Turok 2 fan, and I gotta say, with modern control schemes It's a lot more enjoyable and killing enemies is still really satisfying. Graphically it has aged gracefully. Even the platforming sections are not as annoying as they were before but are still really bad. The keys to unlock new levels are hidden in some sadistic areas at times, and replaying the levels over and over again is frustrating. The difficulty is somewhat lower than the original, mainly because of the modern control scheme. Dying to an enemy is actually really rare and most death will be mainly due to bad platforming sections.The pricetag of 14.99 is honest, but when the sales are over, the game will raise it's pricetag to a less honest 19.99. The game is still great, and it definitely deserves 19.99 but it will be hard to convince someone to purchase Turok over, let's say, Resident Evil Rebirth.The gameplay shows it's age at times, but when you blast an enemy with the automatic shotgun and seeing him coughing up blood will never get old. The game is gory and it is absolutely satisfying to kill people in this game. Being lost in this huge map, looking for the key that is hidden on a hidden platform can be really frustrating but when you kill enemies, that's where the game really hits the spot.I recommend this game, but I recommend even more it's sequel, Turok 2. Since it's Turok 1 but better at every point. No more key hunting but objectives to do, you can dismember enemies (which is really awesome), a ridiculous amount of weapons etc...The port runs great, has tons of graphical settings and is very nice to look at.I can't thank enough Kaiser and the guys at Night Dive Studios for what they do."

The music, the ambiance, it all literally brings tears to my eyes. This is a game I played when I was a kid. I got it when I was 7 and couldn't get past the first cave! I WAS TOO SCARED! When I finally did make it I felt like such a badass.Having my childhood returned to me in the form of my FAVORITE N64 game is SUCH an indescribable joy. I have played every Turok game from Dinosaur Hunter to, Seeds of Evil, Shadow of Oblivion and even Rage Wars, I still remember all the little hidden health packs and guns.Game runs smoothly and I am not a fan of the price but since this game holds a special place to me I will wear my nastalgia goggles and get it anyway. HOWEVER, unless you also have a pair of super awesome nastalgia goggles I would recommend waiting for a sale. A great blast from the past that should at least be played once by everyone who loves shooters."
,Recommended,405820,19821144,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Al Forno [Olive Garden],"Night Dive continues to demonstrate how to port games in the best way possible with Turok.  Refresh rates that go at least to 144hz, proper scaling at multiple resolutions, Upscaled graphics, FXAA, Modern lighting and blending effects, an increased draw distance, sensable default keybinds and adjustable FoV(!) make this a remarkable enchancement over the original.When playing ports of games this old, you kind of expect some oddities and some pain in the process simply due to their age, but you will find none of that here.I've played it from beginning to end and the experience was flawless all the way though.  $20 is a lot to ask for a N64 port, but I feel like that'd only be true if the port was bad, or even mediocre.  This is a high quality port and I think the asking price is fair and it enables Night Dive to do other ports of such quality."

,Recommended,405820,23809329,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,Aythadis,"Warning, this game holds a lot of Nostalgia for me, as this was my second most played game on my N64 back in the day. (Turok 2 being my most played.) *I still own my copies and they still work.Turok Dinosaur Hunter was, in my mind, one of the BEST FPS games on the N64. Some would argue that 007 Goldeneye and Perfect Dark were better, but Turok was basically the QUAKE/DOOM of the N64. Fast paced and total devastation to your enemies, which is why I hale this better than 007 and Perfect Dark. The quickness and speed to it and the feel of the weapons made it more fun to me than the others.It may have only taken me 6 hours to beat this (on Hardcore), but as this game is burned into my memory from playing it so much on the N64, it was easy for me to remember were everything is. I already knew where all the secrets were, all the weapon locations, ultra health, tech armor, keys, etc so I was able to really rush through the game. The game is near identical to the original version, minus the first level.Close to the beginning of the first level, on your way to get the second key, they had changed an area completely. It had made me stop and think, how much more did they change/add? Well sadly nothing major that really stands out other than that one spot. Some areas were slightly changed here and there, but you honestly would never noticed them unless you were paying real close attention.The game consists of traversing 8 levels, of which you run, jump, climb, swim, and shoot everything in sight. Collect 14 weapons to destroy your enemies, and kill the bosses. Exploring the maps to find the level keys, as well as secrets for more weapons/ammo/powerups.All the original enemies are still there. All 14 destructive weapons are still there. The music that is engraved into my skull is still there. The same sounds, textures, it's all the original stuff! (Some fan made mods add some HD textures, which is awesome!) Some people may not like it that it looks outdated, but this is NOT a remaster/reboot. This is just a ""upgrade"" to make it work on PCs. No new content was really added into it, and nothing has really changed... But honestly they didn't need to change anything!The plus side is since they smoothed out the graphical settings, it can pretty much run on anything. I boot the game up and it already selected my resolution of 1920x1080 60Hz borderless window, and runs at a smooth 60FPS. This has everything from FXAA Antialiasing, Bloom, Light Scatter, Occlusion Queries, a new water texture with new refractions and reflections system, and a freaking FOV setting!FOV settings has a few choices. 47.5 (which I think was the original N64 FOV, which makes the game unplayable at this day in age, terrible motion sickness,) 74.0 (your standard console FOV,) 90.0, 110.0 (which is what I played at,) and 120.0.Another addition to the settings adding a crosshair (which I didn't use), changing the ""weapon bobbing"" settings, being able to change ALL control imputes, as well as using ""Extended Draw Distance"" which can greatly change on how the game plays. With the extended draw distance you can see so much more of the world. Hell I didn't even know certain places had roofs on them! Since of the addition of the extended draw distance, the enemies have also been tweaked. They have been made to work with the extended draw distance so they would shoot you from a distance like you would as well, making it fair. This ALSO causes some enemies to shoot you from parts of the map that you would be going to later. It's not a major problem, but can be slightly annoying. If you really want the ""Retro"" feel on how it played on the N64, turn off the extended draw distance. It gives the game a different feel to it.All the little tricks/glitches that I used/abused back on the N64 still work in this game, which is great. The strafe running, the platform shortcuts, the quicker way to get down long flights of stairs. The only sad thing is, back in the original versions, you were able to blow up people off the edges and make them fall into the abyss just because it's funny (to understand what I mean, look at the last screenshot on the store page)... Well they took that out.  Now when you try to fling an enemy off into the abyss, there is like an invisible wall that stops them and keeps them on the platform. It's not a major problem, just sad that I could not do that anymore.From the little problems, it doesn't affect the game. It's still the great game that I grew up playing, and was nice to run down memory lane while murdering everything in sight. This game still a blast to play, and I will always recommend this to everyone to give it a try!EDIT: There has been a new update that added a Level Editor and Steam Workshop support! Like, WHAT?!?! That is awesome as F*CK!I've attempted my own hand at the editor, but it seems to be broken for me. Devs are still working on improving and adding more features to it in the future.Pros:- Same great game that I grew up on- Fast paced Gunplay- Smoothed out Graphics- Same great soundtrack- Old cheat codes still work (disable achievements)- Improved Options/Controls fit for PC gamers- Runs at a smooth 60FPS- Map Editor & Steam Workshop- Achievements (only 8)Cons:- Some may not like the old look- Some minor sound problems- No Steam Cards- A little expensive~~~~~~~~As a message to the Devs Nightdive Studios, if they happen to read this review, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS GAME! I was so happy to replay this game, and will HAPPILY get the remake of Turok 2 when you release it! Keep up the great work!"

,Recommended,405820,30381178,Posted: 7 March,all,[MOB]VinBeast,"This is a great remaster of an alltime classic shooter.In Turok you play as Tal'set who is a time travelling Native American warrior who goes to a world called The Lost Land to stop someone called The Campaigner from ruling the universe.The game is split up into 8 very large and open levels in which you collect keys to open later levels, collecting hidden pieces of a weapon called the Chronocepter, jumping across difficult jumping puzzles and killing enemies ranging from poachers to dinosaurs and cyborgs with weapons ranging from Shotguns and Rifles to Rocket Launchers and Plasma Guns.Visually the game was one of the best looking 3D shooters at the time (1997) and the remaster has done its best job trying to make it look acceptable to a modern audience while still catering to the old fanbase.Audio ranges from a funky Electronic and Tribal soundtrack to meaty weapons and enemies who die in exagerrated and humorous ways which pay homage to its comic book roots.There are still a few issues that might the game hard to recommend to new people, for one the jumping sections can be rather difficult and tedious to get through and some of the levels can suddenly cut off which will force you to revisit and backtrack through if you missed some of the earlier keys.Overall though Turok is still a highly entertaining oldschool shooter and the remaster does a fantastic job keeping it up to date and along with workshop support there is plenty to sink your teeth into."

This was something I had hoped for a long time but never thought would happen. The original Turok games are some of the most nostalgic games from my childhood and I really couldn’t have asked for a better re-release. I have never played the PC version of this game before, so any comparisons I make will be based on my time with the N64 version.There are a multitude of options to choose from ranging from visual to simple convenience options including things you’d usually have to edit an .ini for in almost every other game.The game runs smooth and controls amazingly well. I doubt I could go back to playing this game with an N64 controller again after playing the remastered PC version with mouse and keyboard. The platforming and aiming in particular are far improved.Graphically there are some improvements, though the look of the game is still very much the same. The improved draw distance is definitely one of the better improvements. There is still distance fog but it is nowhere near what it was on the N64. Another one of the more noticeable additions to me was god rays, which were very surprising to see in an old N64 game. They look really nice though. A bloom effect has also been added and it looks nice, and is definitely noticeable. There are some added water effects like reflection and refraction, though the reflection effect looked pretty weird, so I disabled that one. The game comes ready for HD resolutions and automatically detects your display settings. The game immediately started for me in 1920x1080(144hz), though I did have to disable windowed mode.Another addition to this release of the game is achievements. Definitely a welcome addition in my book, even if they are rather simple and there are only 8 of them. Hopefully trading cards will be implemented eventually also as a Turok background could be pretty cool.There are some small glitches like blood sticking to invisible surfaces, or occasionally being able to see through a wall as you’re falling or moving in a weird way, but these are very minor and for me they don’t detract from the game at all.The price tag seems pretty high for an old game like this especially if you’ve never played the game before and it holds no nostalgia value for you. For me this was definitely worth getting though since I have been hoping for this for so long and I’ve always loved the game.Now I just wait for Turok 2, and when that releases my life will be complete."

However it mixes in a few elements that were more usual in console games, like lifes, checkpoints/save points, collectible keys to unlock levels, etc. This is not so surprising, as it is a remake of an N64 game."
,Recommended,405820,23319190,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,marumawa,"IntroductionLet me just start this off by saying that I've never played this game before it was released on Steam, so this review won't be from the perspective of a guy with nostalgia goggles, however I believe that my love for Turok is partially fuelled by the fact that I've always been a huge fan of the Quake series. I had heard of Turok before, but I never batted an eye until I saw that it was released on Steam. I took the plunge and bought it, and I'm so glad I did.How well does thegame play?The gameplay in Turok is sort of what you'd expect from a mid-to-late 90s, no-nonsense first person shooter. Turok's gunplay is fast-paced and feels fairly fluid, however Turok isn't all about gunplay. Turok will put you at platforming segments or require you to explore in order to find certain keys. If heights aren't your thing then Turok may or may not be a game you want to play, especially in one of the later levels, and while Turok may not be as fast paced as Quake, it's definitely a game that will require you to be aware at all times.You may die a few times in Turok, or even more than a few times. In other games, it'd be like ""Oh no I forgot to save/quicksave and now I have to go back ages!"" or ""Oh no, it saved automatically at this boss and I have little to no HP left!"" However, in Turok, there are checkpoints in the levels (and savepoints, don't forget those!) but when you die, you will respawn at that checkpoint with all of your health, but that's dependent on whether you haveextra livesor not.What about thegraphics?You see, this is where the game sort of falls short, because even with the enhancements made to the visuals, it still doesn't hold up as well. However, it was mentioned that they improved the water visuals, adding reflections and refraction, and it blends in with the old-school visuals that the game provides. The draw distance is a minor interference but in Turok's case it can add to the tension with the platforming sections.And opinions on thesound design?Meh, it's something that could have been done better. I hate having to hear obnoxiously loud grunting while my character climbs up vines and transitions between caves and the outside aren't too great either, however other than that the sound design for Turok isn't too bad and it's passable.Youroverallopinion on Turok?If you're a fan of fast paced, no nonsense first person shooters such as Quake, then Turok is definitely for you. This game is as old-school as old-school gets. It's a game that all first person shooter fanatics should play at least once. While the visuals don't hold up, the gameplay itself is the real deal. Though for a game as old as Turok, I would advise waiting for the price to lower. £14.99/$19.99 is quite a lot to pay for a game from 1997, but if you're new to the franchise it may seem reasonable. Turok deserves myseal of approval."

,Recommended,405820,26175740,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,cyan0s1s,"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is an FPS that originally appeared on Nintendo 64 in 1997 and later ported to the PC, unbeknownst to some. The Turok series has always been a strange one: Largely popular on the N64 platform it was best known for, but it had absolutely nothing on PC shooter competition even in the year it came out. Its sequels would take radical turns in gameplay style and features, often with mixed results, with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil typically being regarded as the last great Turok game, at least the last one most similar to its predecessor. A lousy reboot in 2008 simply called Turok all but killed off the semi-popular franchise, at least until last year when Night Dive Studios resurrected the first title and gave it a bit of a facelift (remaster, not remake) bringing the N64 classic to a wider audience. I never owned thus never played it on the N64 but I did acquire the PC version many years ago and enjoyed it quite a lot despite its shortcomings.Turok was originally a comic book, Turok: Son of Stone in the 60's, a relatively innocent series of books about two Native American brothers who went on adventures in a desolate valley populated with dinosaurs. In the early 90's Valiant Comics brought back a revamped series called Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and the setting was vastly altered: the valley is now 'The Lost Lands', a place where time moves in a self-contained loop. With dinosaurs, aliens, demons and future tech in a bizarre unison. The villain is an entity known as Mothergod who uses the Lost Land as a base of operations and outfits dinosaurs with intelligence-boosting implants turning them into 'bionisaurs'. From there on there's things like a post-apocalyptic future Earth, various Lovecraftian abominations and high-tech future warriors. Yeah, the 90's were here. There's many elements in this iteration that would show up in the games. Later on another series was published by Acclaim Comics in 1998 as a tie-in for Turok 1 and 2.Turok is not a character's name but a title meaning 'Son of Stone'. For many generations the mantle of Turok has been bestowed upon those who saw the protection of the barrier as their sacred duty, the barrier between this world and the others. The axis of all being the Lost Lands. Turok travels between alternate dimensions stopping those who would try to conquer the Lost Lands and thus all of the multiverse with it. In this game you are Tal'Set, a time-travelling Saquin warrior tasked with stopping The Campaigner, an evil warlord who controls a vast army of creatures in addition to his own troops, seeking pieces of the Chronoscepter in the Lost Lands. This ancient artifact, once assembled contains the power to rule the known universe.Turok's gameplay is standard for the era but closest I can compare it to would be the first Quake. Movement speed and jumping height are excellent and grant you a lot of mobility which allows you to easily sidestep and jump over enemy attacks. And jumping you will be doing a lot of, for even the most rudimentary skill it is absolutely mandatory to master if you're going to finish the game. Platforming is commonplace but not hard to pull off and is very responsive. Among this there's an assortment of keys you obtain in each level which are used to unlock the next, and a piece of the Chronoscepter in each level as well. The majority of the game takes place in outdoor environments with the occasional indoor section. Exploration is key as there's all kinds of stuff hidden around. Interactivity is decent with being able to scale certain walls, swimming, collapsing trees with explosive weapons and hunting deer and warthogs for extra health (tip: use regular shotgun shells for best results). There's no use function so activating things requires a simple approach or stepping on pressure plates. There's only eight levels but they're pretty large and take anywhere from 45 minutes to a little over an hour to finish.The bestiary is surprisingly varied, well animated and different from one another. It's a bit ironic that the game's subtitle is Dinosaur Hunter since 6 of the 8 levels contain mainly humanoid enemy types like poachers, evil natives and the Campaigner's own troops. But there's a host of other lifeforms like cave dwelling leapers, giant beetles, the ape-like Purr-Linn, and of course dinosaurs, mainly biomechanical velociraptors and dimetrodons. The enemies get more bizarre the further you go, with aliens, demons and robots near the end and of course a few bosses sprinkled along the way. Death animations are also pretty violent, but nowhere near as gory as the sequel, considering this was on the N64 but by that time Nintendo had backed off with its censorship. People grab their throats with blood jetting out of their neck and raptors produce a crimson volcano from their maw more often than not, but it's pretty tame by today's standards.The weapons were another highlight from this time period as most shooters had little more than 10 or so but Turok boosts a whoppin' 14 in all. From a lowly knife and Tek Bow to high-tech death dealing in the form of the atomic energy Fusion Cannon to the Chronoscepter itself. And all manner of shotguns, miniguns, grenade and rocket launchers, and alien technology in between. They're all great fun to use and are one of the main selling points of the game. The iconic Cerebral Bore from Turok 2 isn't in this one but what's here already is more than sufficient to get the job done.Visuals are obviously aged with early 3D models and low res textures but they're still competent like Quake's IMO and leave little guesswork as to what the hell you're looking at. As stated earlier everything's animated well and the addition of updated graphics options in this remaster do make things look a bit nicer. Originally the draw distance for the fog was abysmal due to console restrictions, the FOV was insanely low and the frame rate for the original PC version was capped at something odd like 42. Now the draw distance allows you to see more things (and some things you probably weren't meant to see), the FOV isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the frame rate's a silky 60 easily making this the superior version of the game. Audio's low quality as they come straight from the source but they're not too ear-grating. The music's not bad though and mostly consists of fitting tribal beats, dreary ambient pieces and a sinister industrial style on the final level. The levels are mostly set in a jungle or ancient temple but throw some curve balls later on. Night Dive greatly reduced frustration in exploring these by doing some very minor streamlining, removing redundant hallways or reworking a section to flow better, and the placement of certain keys and some extra save zones on the tougher maps.Criticisms include the low difficulty in combat as most enemies aren't that challenging to fight and are easily exploited due to their animation, but hitscanners can be annoying and the pulse rifle wielding Campaigner sergeants are extremely aggressive and require a lot of jumping around while laying into them to not get hit. Hard difficulty isn't that much harder and just makes everyone bullet spongy and removes pickups from dead enemies, effectively screwing you out of the Mortal Wound pickup (permanently raises base health) if killing with the knife or regular arrows. Limited save areas as a result of consoles and the amount of platforming can be tedious, and the Chronoscepter piece on level 7 is very out of the way (useful hint: not all lava hurts you). Lastly if you can score hits with the Chronoscepter on the Campaigner it massively cheeses him.Overall, Turok is a very 90's FPS in its design but that's largely what makes it so unique and fun to play and I highly recommend it to fans of the genre. Happy hunting.4.0/5"

I was more of a Nintendo fan back then so the N64 was my main console over the PS1 granted I was till a PC kid but once the N64 games started pumping out games like Goldeneye 64 and Turok I mainly played them for quite some time.  While the N64’s hardware was lacking in a few ways I still loved the console even if by today’s standards looking back it was horribly antiquated compared to disk based console systems.Turok was a good game back then, I don’t remember a lot about it but I do recall it running moderately well compared to higher fidelity games like Perfect Dark 64 (even with the extra ram).  It may have been even one of my first semi open world/exploration kind of games that I ever got into but I’m not sure, still though the different worlds/levels and weapons always added some refreshing gameplay from time to time.This remake of the original PC port is every way better then the 64 version by far, now that it’s on PC you can now mod the game to have say user made higher def textures and now the developer Nightdive studios has added a level editor, something that the original N64 version did not have.  The game itself is everything that I remember it from my younger days yet runs at least 10 times better as far as performance which should go without saying given how powerful PCs are today compared to back then.  If you had fond memories of this game back then or even recently if you are a retro gamer then you will get those same feelings.Turok is an early platformer and because of this you will probably die to falls quite a bit or have to redo sections because you fell off or missed a jump.  That is one thing that at times frustrated me because it is quite prevalent in many levels and while the extra performance boost for this port is helpful so that there is little to no input lag you will still probably die or fall many times.I’m glad that Nightdive is continuing support for the game, as they just recently released the map editor and now the Steam version has Workshop support for user created levels.  I eagerly await Turok 2 if this is the type of quality that I should expect from this developer, and considering they have done other games like a remastering of System Shock 1 and 2 which players seem to like quite a bit.If you are into retro play or you were alive and playing on an N64 platform you will enjoy this for sure.  Though while the price is a bit steep given how old the game really is, I’d say it’s mostly worth it but I’d still get Turok on sale unless $20 is not that big of a deal for you."

76561197980195335,Recommended,405820,22509882,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,Crypto,"OverviewThere have been many iterations ofTurokover the last 20 years, so first let's be clear about what exactly you're getting in this version of the game: this is aremasterededition of the first game in the series,Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, originally released on the Nintendo 64 in 1997.  This is not to be confused with a reimagining or a remake; Night Dive Studios' mission was to clean up, repackage, and preserve the original game, and in this modest but noble goal they have succeeded.Turok Remasteredis a faithful reproduction of the retro classic, which includes all of the charming glitches from the original but none of the technical flaws.  The game is optimized for modern platforms and has never looked better on an HD display.  Minor graphical touch-ups have been added, although they are very subtle.  All in all, this is now the definitive version of the game.GameplayThere are three major elements toTurok'sgameplay: combat, platforming, and exploration.Combat moves at a fast clip, as most areas of the game feature at least one respawn wave of enemies who will flank you if you backpedal from the enemies which lie ahead of you.  The enemy respawns are sometimes quick and occasionally relentless, but it never feels unfair since there are clear audio/visual cues associated with the spawn-in.  Adding to the frenetic pace is a very quick character movement speed.  Enemies can close distance in seconds and the player-character is equally agile and responsive.The gunplay itself focuses on the player amassing an arsenal of weapons (found through exploration) and then frequently switching through the inventory wheel to pick the right tool for the job.  Unlike many modern First Person Shooters,Turokplaces no limit on the number of weapons that can be in the player's possession at any given time.  Additionally, unlike many of its contemporaries,Turokdoes not reset the player's inventory after each mission.  As a result, there's a continuous sense of character progression / growing strength.  Yet, the game also manages to gradually become more challenging as spongier, heavier-hitting enemies are introduced later in the game.  Gunplay inTurokis just as much about being accurate as it is about managing and conserving ammo; if you use too many rockets on the middle-tier enemies, you won't have them when you really need them to deal with the bigger baddies.Platforming inTurokcan be a particularly vexing mechanic, especially for newcomers.  If you haven't done a lot of platforming from a first-person perspective, get ready to learn the hard way.  Missing a jump usually means instant-death, and there is a whole lot of unskippable jumping in this game.  Not even cheat codes can help you get past these segments, so it's a skill you must be committed to mastering if you plan to play the game to completion.Exploration is a large part of the game, and it's one of the most-rewarding.Turok'slevel design is smarter than meets the eye, often employing subtle environmental clues to lead the player in unexpected directions.  Some levels are more linear than others, but all of the game's eight major regions are full of secret areas off the beaten path.  Diligent exploration is rewarded with upgraded-ammo, extra life tokens, keys to open new levels, and early access to more-powerful weapons.  The trickiest and most-rewarding collectables of all are the hidden pieces of the game's ultimate weapon: The Chronosceptor.  It should also be noted that, while some of the mandatory pickups (namely: level keys) are easy to miss, backtracking hardly takes any time thanks to the extremely fast player movement speed.AestheticsTurokwas originally released towards the beginning of the N64's lifecycle when 3D gaming was still relatively new to the masses.Turokwas one of the better-looking 3D games of its time, but to virgin eyes I imagine that it must look really rough around its sharp, polygonal edges.  Luckily, Night Dive Studios has cleaned up some of the original game's glaring technical flaws.  Most apparent among them are the oppressive fog and draw distance.  If you remember the N64 game fondly then you'll definitely appreciate how much easier it is to see where you're going in the remastered version.  No longer does the fog hide enemies standing five feet in front of your face.  However, Night Dive has tastefully decided not to eliminate the fog completely, preserving the some of the mysterious, haunting aesthetic of the original without compromising playability.True to the original, the music is serviceable enough but doesn't stand out.  It's thematically appropriate but not very interesting.  There's a lot of minimalist, primitive-sounding percussion, but the music loops too frequently and conspicuously to effectively blend into a subtle, immersive, atmospheric texture.  The sound effects are actually rather humorous at times, which breaks the mood a little but is generally joyful.Final ThoughtsThis is a solid game.  And the remaster-- price not considered in this review-- doesn't come across as a simple cash-grab, in my opinion.  True, very little has been added to the game.  But Night Dive Studios has made too many considerate, tasteful decisions for me to be cynical about it.Turok Remasteredis a technically flawless, unadulterated, minimally upgraded port of one of the great N64 shooters, and I recommend it to anyone who still occasionally revisits and enjoys playing the classics."
,Recommended,405820,23055029,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,TheArcaneMirror | Winter,"Turok is a true classic of the FPS genre. I have played around a bit with it as a child, but never really played it seriously. Instead, I had a lot of fun back then just putting in the cheat codes, unlock all weapons and cause some havok on the enemies. Seeing this gem back on modern systems with improved handling and support for modern screen resolution is great. The game still plays like a charm and has an odd but lovely personality to it. The game world seems to be one giant drug trip, which is quite entertaining to experience. The fluid movement, the iconic and - later in the game - extremely powerful weapons are still fun these days. Some of those weapons are just ridiculous, filling the entire screen with satisfying gigantic explosions. :DThe levels contain secrets to find and encourage exploration. The soundtrack with jungle drums keeps you at a good pace.Talking about the value for the price: I think that this refresh is quite overpriced, given that the game just needed a few adjustments to work well on modern machines. I can see that aquiring the license might have had its price for the studio and that the audience is quite small, so the price can't be super cheap. Anyway: the game is super fun and I would definitely recommend to buy and play it. If the price tag is too high for you, wait for a sale - but Turok definitely deserves a place on your wishlist."

It's got fun weapons, the melee if you choose to use it handles surprisingly really well (one hit to anything in the back if you angle it correctly), and the game has secrets all over the place. The difficulty of this game is not necessarily balanced - hard is probably just right of a challenge, Hardcore is completely unfair. There's a few instances of ""FPS platforming hell"" that you need to get through with no quicksaving to beat the game, just as a warning.It's worth picking up if you're a fan of classic shooters."

As for this game, don't even get me started. Night Dive Studios did an amazing job porting this game to PC the right way. Everything that a PC game should have, is there. Mind you, this game is old, N64 old. So they could only do so much for the graphics, although there's a handful of options, more than you would expect from a game this old. The game plays like a charm. Super responsive controls unlike the original PC/N64 version. My only gripe is that they didn't add a ""save anytime/anywhere"" function. It's vanilla as can be as only being able to save between levels, just like the Original. That's both a bad and good thing; Bad, because these levels are HUGE and not everybody has the patience to beat a level in one sitting and good, because it adds to the challenge.Turok is an amazing game and the steep price shouldn't hold you back. There's idiots out there that pay $120 for a game with little content. *cough*Star Wars Battlefront *cough* I can't wait to see how they fix the FPS issue with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil because that game suffered from very bad frame drops in the N64 and PC port.﻿I highly recommend this game!"

I've secretly loved this series from the sidelines for awhile now but now have a new revamped nostaglia to give this series a try.I hope that Night Dive Studios continues in their pursuits of revitalizing this wonderful series. Like some of my fellow steam users, I have the option of playing this on the Nintendo 64 for about (""$12.00"") on eBay +shipping (""$13.00"") or simply playing the existing copy of Seeds of Evil that I currently own and the thought had crossed my mind and  I assume yours as well. Although, I much prefer my computer over most consoles these days. For that extra $13.00. I want to believe it's worth more to support Night Dive Studios.What you are paying for is another copy of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter with enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics. What your purchase means though. It is a contribution, that will help Night Dive Studio's continue to remaster the turok series possibly. Depending, upon the sales of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok: Seeds Of Evil. With wishful thinking may lead to another project in which there is a new turok experience. Say 2018. Feeling nostalgic, this game is for you.A young friend of mine, I was talking to him the other day about how great this game was and still is after 18 years.. What's Turok. So I barried him out backyard with my trusty shovel, no seriously this is a great opportunity to both preserve and showcase to the newer generations. Preservation of an ""Old but not obselete"" piece of gaming history. - Terminator GenisysGameplay Final Review: Normal ModeA fun enjoyable experience to remember, old school mechanics, no reloading firearms, ammunition and health a plenty, remember to save often at the hub and or during levels as they are pretty lengthy, lots of high jumps off of ledges and walking along cliffsides, simple yet sometimes surprisingly clever puzzles, step-on-that, step-on-this, collect that and secret areas. Swimming was an interesting mechanic that I thoroughly enjoyed. Loved shooting just about everything, tribesmen, the variety of dinosaurs in this game. Lots of enemy varieties so you will not be bored by repetition. Was surprised by the fact that the raptors regenerate. Collecting the Chronoscepter pieces is a nice little sidequest that pays off in the end.Ask me, is it still worth $22. I am satisfied with my purchase and have played at least 12.8 dedicated hours of this title, however there was an issue with the sound and was not available to me during my experience from the start to end. Which in all honesty was a little upsetting and disapointing after waiting 18 years to play this but overall a great experience. Bearing this in mind,  I am looking forward to the entire series being remastered, as well the next remastered sequel Turok: Seeds of Evil, I still have not passed Level 2 after all these years. Help me out Night Dive Studios with sound this time.I want to believe, what do you believe in Steam users? X-Files :)Note-worthy issue:- Sound cuts out for some reason? Quick fix, listen to the Original Soundtrack on youtube using your phone while you play. Although you will miss out on SFX of firearms, cutscenes and creatures as you watch them go through their scripted death rattles lol.- Night Dive Studios, released this title on steam as of December last year.

This game combines two of my favorite things shooters and dinosaurs. The music is a masterpiece whether your wondering through the jungles, ancient cities, underwater and so on.

While the controller looked like it was designed by aliens for people with more than two hands, the games it had and the way it utilized that controller cemented it into the hearts of gamers in all corners of Earth.And when it came to the top FPS titles, there was GoldenEye... And then there was Turok.Turok: Dinosaur Hunter was the first FPS I ever played, and it is one I have fond memories of. And while I loved the second in the series the most, I will never forget this game.Story:Oddly enough, the story was not told in-game, but was hinted at in manuals and other forms of media.You play as Tal'Set Fireseed, a Native American from the Saquin Tribe as he is transported to Galyanna, The Lost Land, a land where time has literally NO meaning and is inhabited by all sorts of aliens, peoples, interdimensional beings and DINOSAURS.However, this new world and ours are now under a terrible threat.The Campaigner, a meglomaniacal cybernetic tyrant, has devealoped a superweapon that threatens not only The Lost Land, but also our world as well, as he masses an army of cyborgs and cybernetically-enhanced dinosaurs in a terrible plan of universal domination.It is up to Tal'Set to become Turok, the Son Of Stone, and end the diobolical machinations of The Campaigner once and for all.Gameplay:I'll admit, the N64 verson was a lot harder to play, but this one is definitely better to control, though the difficulty is still there.The game really does handle smoothly, and it does manage to feel fluid, without any hiccups at all.The enemy AI is very notable, as they are vicious and can think cunningly and gang up on you, so be wary what you do.Graphics:Sadly, the graphics look very dated, but that is not imprtant to me. You can be a delicious cake even if the frosting looks as old as your granny running in terror in the rain. Even so, the graphics add to the charm, and to be honest, they aren't the worst.Weapons:There is an INSANE amount of weapons you can hold and carry, from the usual pistol, shotguns, assault rifle and bow, to a minigun, rocket and grenade launchers, a cannon that unleashes a NUCLEAR BLAST, and a fair bit more. Whatever you decide to tackle your enemies with, this game will give you those options.Sound:The sound has upgraded quite a bit since the N64 version, and while it does have moments where it could have been better, it is a far cry better than it once was, and the N64 version was pretty good for it's time.Rating (1 being the best, 10 being the worst) 3.2 (Gold Rating, Four Stars out of Five)This game is the best way to experience the original Turok, with the upgrades and better bells and whistles that you need. While some things could have used some work, this game is able to beat the issues to deliver one grand product and nostalgia trip."

This is a game where you can sit down and run through it, and then run through it over and over, with the same enjoyment.You will not be dissapointed, especially with the draw distance the way it is. Now, lets get into some things you might run into you don't like.There is a difficulty setting, easy, normal, hard, harcore. Hard and Hardcore are a little buggy, considering what changes are the enemies basically sliding across the loor like its an ice rink, making them hard to hit. I don't reccomend you try hardcore until the next update.Dying by enemies such as soldiers, or raptors, low level enemies, is extremly rare considering you will have weapons that WILL kill them fast. Bad platforming actions or decissions usually land you a reload or losing a life.Bosses are exceptionally easy if you are used to strafing and shooting.If you are looking for a good adventure, first-person shooter and puzzle game, all meshed up into one video game, this is the game for you.

Most importantly for me this game has run without a hitch.  Too many other older games are put on steam and essentially require the consumer to google how to just get it to start up.

I didn't expect fancy new graphics or high quality textures, that may explain why i'm glad it got released in the state it is now. The game plays great on Windows 10 at 60 fps and the controls have been updated to more modern standards. There's also some extra optional eye candy stuff, like bloom, sunrays, water reflection, extended draw distance etc. It also features achievements and steam cloud. There's no manual saving, instead there are save stations, so no save spamming.Overall, i recommend this game if you love Turok and don't mind paying a little more to put on your nostalgia glasses."

,Recommended,405820,23142770,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"I never played Turok: Dinosaur Hunter when it first came out in 1997. I remember that it was considered a classic adventure game in first person and a technological breakthrough. Turok has been remastered nearly 20 years later. While the remastered version has graphically improved, it still is not up to today’s graphics standards.The basic plot of the game is cliché and ordinary. The game stars a Native American who is up against an extraterrestrial villain named the Campaigner, who steals the Chronoscepter and ends up being scattered throughout the 8 levels. Turok must fight against dinosaurs and ancient people throughout the various levels which consists of temples and villages, but later levels look like sci-fi sectors.In the beginning Turok may look like an FPS game, but it is truly a first person adventure game. It requires plenty of platform jumping in order to navigate each level. If you’re looking for the many secrets in the game you will have to do even more jumping such as jumping long gaps and many pillars. The gameplay and the environments feel old school and can provide nostalgia to those who play the 1997 version of the game.The enemies feel old school and consist of velociraptors and mercenaries. The violence in this game is palpable, as you can see blood squirting out of the mercenaries as they die at your hands using the arsenal of shotguns, assault rifle, minigun, and rocket launcher. The enemy A.I. is good, but not great. Sometimes a mercenary will circle around you to hit you, but at other times it won’t.Other old school elements include the health pickups and ammo scattered across each level. There are keys to pick up in order to access subsequent levels. This means you can return to previous levels to find keys that you may have missed. The save stations are far between each other throughout each level. This means you will have to dedicate some time to the game before finally reaching a save point. There is no quick save feature to help you. Yes, there are checkpoints but they are only good if you die. Upon dying you will be returned to the last checkpoint you crossed. There is the old number of lives system showing how many lives Turok has left. This lives system feels quite archaic.While this game is not up to today’s graphics standards, I do give Night Dive Studios credit for putting forth the decent effort for improving Turok’s graphics. The frame rate has occasional stuttering that can be a little bothersome at times. My FPS instantly decrease from 60 to 35, then increase to 47 and back to 60. It is a minor annoyance, but I think this problem could have been addressed in a patch.I think Turok is worth playing again for those who played this game back in the late 1990s. The game is technically smoothed out and optimized for modern hardware. I think Night Dive Studios is on the right track when it comes to making remastered versions of games. At 20 bucks or on a future sale Turok would be a decent game to buy if you love first person platform jumping and exploration.My Score: 7/10"
,Recommended,405820,19752881,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,St. IGNUcius,"Boy am I glad to see a Turok game on Steam! The Turok series are some of the most creative and mystical first-person shooters out there. Night Dive Studios took the rough PC port of this game and truly made it shine by adding support for modern resolutions, removing the 30 FPS cap, and adding several subtle yet beutiful graphical enhancments such as god-rays and realistic water shaders.It seems as though we'll never get a new Turok game that retains the creativity of the first 4 (the 2008 reboot was a disappointment). With that said, it's very pleasing to see the orignal Turok get a proper 2015 face-lift.If Night Dive Studios did something similar with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (my favorite game of all time), my life would be complete."

When Turok was a new title I only had access to a Playstation 1. As a result I'm confident that I hold no real nostalgia for the series. The only reason I bought this Steam release of Turok was from the suggestion of a friend and that I like Night Dive Studios who thankfully rescued System Shock 1 and 2 from being abandonware. For me the worst case scenario would be getting my money back through a refund.I am happy to say that I've enjoyed my first hour and the first level of Turok and I'm certain I'll be coming back for more if not completing the full game. If you're like me and miss the days of FPS being ""Doom-Clones"" I am certain you will like Turok. The weapons are satifying to shoot, the enemies (ranging from Beasts to Humanoids who look like Scarecrows) all have lovely littlle death animations. The level design itself is one of the most interesting features. Whereas Doom and Quake had bitesized levels Turok has 8 levels. If each one is as big as Level 1 this is a fairly large game to explore. Much like Doom you're given a map and I personally find it enjoyable to see a blank map become filled out as you run around and kill everything that moves. I don't think you have to rely on a map much in this version but I'm sure it was a godsend for the console release with incredibly small draw distances the N64 version featured. To break up what could be a very repetitive game you have bits of platforming that I find enjoyable, only once or twice did I fall to my death so far.There's some story about your lead character being a Time Traveller who has to stop some weapon from falling into the wrong hands but make no mistake you're just a Doomguy with a Indian Headress on. You're just going to be killing every monster in sight.Like most action games with simple controls this game has aged very well, the primitive graphics are colorful and the game feels silky smooth in 1080p. The only thing I'm not digging is the music as at least in Level 1 it's just a repetitive jungle beat MIDI playing constantly. Sadly not every game can have a soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor.The price is a tad bit steep, I'm used to paying only $10 for rereleases of 5th Gen games but when you consider Night Dive Studios made a brand new engine the extra $5 doesn't seem so bad for the work put into it. I say if you like an old school shooter get it and party like it's 1997."

This game in particular is probably one of the best and this remake does it even more justice.Pros- Amazing, powerful, hilariously unrealistic weapons. From the Bow to the Chronoscepter, they're all useful in all stages of the game and incredibly fun to use (my personal favorite being the Grenade Launcher).- Fun sense of exploration. All of the levels have different secrets to be found, many are in very unsuspecting spots. They are also fairly complex and not so straight-forward.- Good selection of graphical, audio, video, and gameplay options. I'm so thankful to be able to play with  110 FOV.- Very Quake-like. Secrets, the weapons, etc.- Level Editor! The devs released this pretty recently to open up the community to making their own levels and the like. I've been having a bit of trouble with playing some custom levels, but its not a huge deal.Cons- Lack of story. Not really a major con, as it doesn't really affect the gameplay. You gotta read the comics to get a basis of the game and understand why you're a Native American man running and gunning other men, dinosaurs, dinosaurs WITH GUNS, aliens, robots, etc.- A LOT OF JUMPING PUZZLES AND PLATFORMING. This isn't something that can really be changed, but it is what it is. They're just a little frustrating on some levels.Verdict: 9/10This is a fantastic game and definitely worth the price.

I decided to pick it up in the recent summer sale based on numerous recommendations from a friend, who frequently uses it as a point of reference when discussing other games.For those unfamiliar, Turok began as a comic book in the '60s, concerning Native American warriors accidentially finding their way into a realm known as the ""Lost Land"", a land forgotten by time, populated with extremely irate dinosaurs. This was kept intact with the 90s reboot by Acclaim Comics, which added aliens and advanced technology into the mix, and told a story of a family line of these warriors, the Fireseeds, and their taking up the mantle of ""Turok"", Son of Stone, to face the Lost Land's many dangers. This first videogame adaptation concerns a man later identified as Tal'Set, who would reappear in a prequel, Turok: Evolution.From what I can tell, Turok 1 was considered by some reviewers to be derivitive, praised for its graphics but largely regarded simply as a ""doom clone."" In particular, the PC version was seen by some reviewers as inferior to Quake. Considering it's largely more of a console game, having released on Nintendo 64 first, this doesn't seem to me like a fair comparison. Others later lauded it as a ""system-selling franchise"" that established that PC was not the ""exclusive realm"" of good FPSes. In retrospect, such an assessment may have been premature.Regardless, Turok 1, and in particular, this Night Dive rerelease, shines through mostly in its controls. I can't speak for the original PC release, but this one handles so well its scarcely feels like im playing a console game, permitting me to straferun and jump with the best of them. It also runs very well, subject to none of the frame loss and distance fog issues of its original N64 incarnation. It does have anumber of odd console-game features, such as its extensive platforming sections, limited lives and fixed save points. My few deaths were found in the bottomless pits, and I can't say I miss that particular aspect of the era. Nor am I particularly enamoured of the game's cryptic item placement. As a child playing things like the Doom and Quake demos, which comprised early, comparitively easy-to-navigate levels, Turok would have driven me up a goddamn wall. It reminded me oddly of Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, which actually had much more awkward platforming. I don't think less of the game now given easy access to guides, but the game does stand out as an example of a very different era in level design. There's also absolutely no story text or narrative cutscenes anywhere in the game, which even Doom and Quake managed a bare minimum of.Thankfully Turok also delivers a wide array of nasty weapons and enemies, eclectic and colorful environment design, thematically appropriate music, and some fairly well-executed boss fights. It also has a well-executed hub system with seamless level transisitions, permitting the player to freely explore available areas at will. Compared to the dark and dreary castles and temples of Quake 1, and the grim and gritty military complexes and canyons of Quake 2, Turok's visuals stand out. The hub-based level design is also executed far more smoothly here then in Quake 2, in which one becomes hopelessly lost quite easily.Turok occupies an important place in the history of singleplayer FPS and this release is certainly worth a purchase."
,Recommended,405820,19756808,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,[GND] Jester,"Turok in actual playable form!  No horrid mouse input here.  In addition, there are many new gameplay and input options, the UI has been redesigned slightly, there are new graphics features as the description says, and the levels have been redesigned in a few areas (for better or worse).  The more modern draw distance actually makes some parts much easier, but it's good to have acceptable draw distance.Widescreen support is fine.  I run it at 2560 x 1440 144 Hz with no issues related to this.For those who never played Turok, know that this game is known primarily for two things: setting and weapons.  The setting is distinct; The Lost Land, a place that looks ancient in some areas with its ancient ruins, overgrown jungles and dinosaurs.  Fast forward to levels 7 and 8 which are filled with aliens and massive Sci-Fi constructs.  Like other classic FPS games, Turok is filled with hidden areas so be sure to explore.And the weapons... the Turok franchise has always had some of the coolest weapons you'll find in FPS gaming, although the sequels are better in this regard.This remake has some bugs though.  Sound is glitchy like the original PC version and unlike the N64 version, and setting projectile collision to Precise just crashes my game.  It also has only preset FOV values but you can edit them yourself in config.cfg with any text editor.  Likewise an FPS cap is in place (60); you can try removing it but do so at your own risk.  I haven't tested it myself but the originals get insane when the frame rate is too high, since game logic was tied to frame rate.Most of the original cheat codes still work, although the gallery cheat (THBST) seems to be gone."

This new port fixes/modernises the controls/movement and generally makes it play far better than the N64 version and is essentially to my understanding a re-write of the engine to make it work on modern computers/OS's. The fact that the developer has opened the engine up for modding is very encouraging and a very good gesture on the Devs part.The main textures/models haven't been changed but there is a HD texture pack on the Steam Workshop which provides some high resolution textures for the levels. Given how far the engine has been opened up, I'm sure a full HD mod will appear eventually.Here's hoping the devs port over Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion and Rage Wars assuming the source codes of those even exist as they never got PC ports."

Turok 2 might be still my all time favorite game (and it'll be in my library immediately after the release next year). It's a fast paced exploration platforming shooter with a native american going berserk on everything in his path. That's the short version. In the long end, Turok has quite some backstory (even comics) but never really stood out. Which is a shame, because it's definately a valuable gem.I remember playing Turok on pc with my dad. He moved and I aimed and fired. It was so scary for me back then but at the same time so awesome.Here's to the remasters of these amazing games, and hope that they'll release Turok 3 and Rage Wars as well!Heck, I'd buy Evolution or the 2008 reboot again if it gets released. Even the bloody gameboy games.But for this specific Turok:Pro's:+ Fast paced action+ Very large explorable maps with loads of secrets+ Cool weapons+ Old school nostalgia+ Great music+ Bosses+ Remastered --> 60 fps, 4k, widescreen... it's so fluent and awesome+ I...

Your movement speed is rather fast, so is some enemies' speed, a lot of them shoot projectiles that are still a challenge to dodge, and most enemies respawn constantly! It's not so quick that clearing areas out loses its purpose, but its quick enough to constantly keep you on your toes.There is also a satisfying exploration aspect. There are a lot of secrets which yield useful goodies as well as pieces of the Ultimate Weapon. In every level you don't just have to run to the exit: you need to grab three keys to unlock the next levels (with some minor exceptions). The exploration sometimes verges on overwhelming but as soon as you gather the willpower and start mapping a level out passage by passage, it usually becomes very simple. Heck, the only truly exploratory level is level 5, although there's room to wander around in the other levels too.The graphics are really outdated, but you can judge them from the screenshots. I can just say that unless you are really sensitive about amazing graphics (in which case why are you even reading this?) you won't mind because it is perfectly functional and depicts the game's environments adequately.The music is nothing special, but it excels at making you feel pumped and ready for action, as well as creating the atmosphere of the Lost Land.Now, lastly, the port's quaity. The controls are pretty much flawless. There's all sorts of options like head bob, FOV, extended draw distance, crosshair, bindable keys, etc. Apart from a few minor things that might as well end up added after this review is written, I don't know if I can think of anything I would've expected out of this as a port that it doesn't have. It'll also get extensive modding support and level editor, so there's that. If the community engages in making levels, this game's humble length won't matter at all! And someone might make, say, HD textures and models and whatnot. But that's all hypotheticals.Summing up, if you are at all interested in a good action FPS and aren't afraid of levels that are more open than a narrow corridor, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservise by not getting this game. Recommended as much as I can possibly recommend a game!"

There are many ne options such as the ability change the render distance, up to 4k resolution support, the option to change the fov, the game is capped at 60 fps but it can be unlocked, and a level editor so this game can blossom a new modding community. This may all be expected for any game on steam, but for Turok this is a godsend. They only thing that may be a negative if you're a true Turok purist is that some of the levels are re-designed and some of the keys and levels have been moved around, but that's only if you're the type that simply can't accept any change.

I love how the camera bobs and weaves when you strafe or climb!Do keep in mind that exploration is a bit more important here, some of the best levels are arguably the ones that let you loose in a more open ended fashion. So you may get lost, YMMV here. (Thankfully the automap is excellent)Four complaints, all relativley minor:1) Sometimes the levels do tend to drag their feet (Not for terribly long but some could have chopped about 10% to 20% of their content and that'd be ok)2) Weapon selection can be annoying when you have most of the weapons3) Shockwave projector and alien gun are useless when compared to the rest of your arsenal4) I do wish there were more dinosaurs to fight. There's nothing really wrong with the enemy design here, but for a game called ""Turok: Dinosaur Hunter"" you'll mostly be fighting mercenaries,  tribesmen, and robots.

Mouse/keyboard aiming makes this game much more bearable though. The game is definitly quite aged, but it's still pretty fun to play with all its crazy weapons. And honestly that's what most people remember this game for, its weapons, and dinosaurs.This is similar to a lot of older shooters that focused on fast run and gun action and less with story, but it also has a large focus on platforming, so if you hate that kind of thing you may not want to buy this game.Objectively the game has a ton of issues (Mostly due to its age), but it still manages to be pretty fun if you want to shoot up some bad guys with interesting weapons.

Personally, i feel the mouse works just fine for the type of game this is.Turok is loaded with secret areas, hilarious AI and a nice variety of weapons. One play through i am guessing takes about 5-6 hours depending on how quickly you move through the levels. Ammo conservation is key to winning this. It can be challenging to learn how to aim at first but do the tutorial and you can get the hang of it quickly.The levels are expansive, and often provide multiple paths.

Each level has a certain number of keys to find and a chronosceptor piece.  The goal of the game is to find all the pieces of the chronosceptor and kill the Campaigner.  The leves in this game are huge and there are many hidden areas to find.  The gameplay is extremely fun and very fast-paced, similar to games like Doom.

Eventhough I'm running it off an SSD, there are is some occasional stuttering when it loads some sound clips.

Well let’s see, they have added graphics options including some FOV options (default is 74), and a much better key binding system than the original pc release which did the key bindings outside of the game although the sub sections might be a little annoying to me but others might like them. There’s also a thing in the graphics options called saturation. Really this is just the brightness slider but there are other sliders there that let you give the game a bit of a colored tint to it. I don’t see much use in it but it seems like a nice little feature if you like to see the game in red or somethingAs mentioned before their is a new difficulty level called hardcore. I went straight for it and its kinda like a doom nightmare difficulty for Turok. Enemies do more damage move a helluva lot faster, fire faster and in this games case respawn faster (this they respawn already) although i'm pretty sure it does not affect bosses. Did i rage? A little of course because of the difficulty i chose. Did i still enjoy the game? The answer is hell yes.The game runs much smoother than its original counter parts it runs at 60 fps and doesn’t seem to have the slowdown effects that the N64 had when many enemies were on the screen or too much gunfire going round etc. If some people are sticklers for the old fog there is an option ingame under gameplay options called extend draw distance. Turning it off switches the fog back to the classic Turok style.  Turning it on doubles the distance so you see further. Honestly up to you how you play.Theres a load of enemies to deal with from knife and staff wielding ancient soldiers to dinosaurs with weapons attached to their arms. Dunno what more you could ask for from that!I did have a crash once in game and once when closing but they seemed to have been fixed extremely quickly.Honestly if you’re a fan of old shooters especially exploration ones. Pick this game up.  This port is much better than the original, the music doesn’t cut out, increased view distance, much smoother gameplay and a variety of options to edit makes this a great pick up.Now alot of people are complaining about the price and im pretty sick of this little argument. This wasnt just a remaster of the PC port of Turok. They did this on a new engine, had to change a few things and redo all the stuff from scratch. Its not like they can just copy it over and it works. It takes time and money. Since this game is much more polished than most of todays AAA titles (im looking at BO3  which i played over the free weekend and the latest batman), it crashed less, it runs fine, doesn't need a top of the line system and for 20 USD is an excellent purchase for a single player game."

If they relaunched the franchise, this game is a perfect blueprint to go by. Well, aside from constantly respawing enemies, similar looking levels, dated AI, scattered save points, and hard to find keys that get even more confusing to locate once the player has explored all regions of the map. Turok2 is an improvement over this game, but also suffers from confusing level design where you can't remember if you explored certain sections or not. This becomes a problem even more if you take a break from the game and try to come back.This version is very well put together. The controls and HD texture enhancements make it easier to play.

Very tribal and percussive.I played this on the n64 many times, hunting for the elusive parts of the chronosceptre and searching out secrets, and everything from the original game is still there. A real blast from the past.I highly recommend this game to anyone who remembers and enjoyed the original. As for anyone new to Turok, I suggest you buy it for a true hardcore  single player shooter experience with real character.Now such a fine port of TUROK Dinosaur Hunter lives on PC, it joins the echelons of my personal favourite shooters from days gone by....Blood 1 & 2,  Shogo MAD ( Mobile Armour Division ), Shadow Warrior ( original ), Doom 2 and of course, the peerless Quake....and to that list I can now add the PC version of TUROK Dinosaur Hunter.This is how a remaster of a game is done, my thanks and congratulations to the development team. I await your next conversion ( I already have the updated & excellent version of System Shock they made ) eagerly and will likely buy it on day of release, just as I did with Turok.I AM TUROK !!!!"

The game has been ""cleaned up"" as I like to call it; upscaling everything to modern resolutions, increased draw distance, optimized for smooth 60fps, and modernized the controls to the familiar WASD scheme. Even the menu feels right at home, with the same look and feel, albeit a few new options for PC specific settings. All of the classic music and sounds return. The precision of the mouse is a godsend from what I remember as horrificly cumbersome N64 analog stick aiming.Literally my only complaint would be that the audio side of things doesn't match up with the visual upkeep; everything is still low bitrate sound clips and music. A minor nitpick at what is otherwise another very well done gravedigging from Night Dive."

I have Turok, and Turok 2 on N64, and it's nice to play them with my desired control method.What draws me to these games is their originality (native americans fighting dinosaurs, aliens, cosmic horrors.) and the colourful and epic weapons. The levels are pretty big and fairly linear, so you won't find yourself getting too lost, the enemies have decent AI (they roll to the side to dodge bullets etc etc) and if you shoot them in the right way they clasp at their neck gasping for air before dying.The platform sections can be a bit irritating, but, they had those back in the halcyon days of FPS games, so I can't grumble too much about it.All in all, a must buy if you loved the originals. and for those who haven't played a Turok game, give it a whirl if you're sick of the same cookie cutter 'realistic' modern military shooters."

The ability to use a keyboard and mouse makes this game much easier and to have to have any real challange you will have to play at the highest difficulty. The view distance is still very short and you can't see very far due to the fog which is annoying. There are minor glitches like when you look into water you see a poor attempt of replication a relection and it just looks like your seeing whats underwater. Some of the hitboxes are a little wierd still but overall it's pretty good. This is the best version of Turok by far, the only problem is that it's $20 at full price. The 15 dollars is the most I am willing to pay for a game made in 1997. It's not a remake, it's a remaster and I feel like the developer is trying to make extra cash over nostalgia. Unless you really like Turok or old school FPS games like me then I highly recommend you wait for a sale to bring it down to $10. Turok still has almost no story and doesn't hold up as well as other old school FPS game. Even with all its flaws It still is a enjoyable experience 18 years later. Turok gets a 7.9/10 -Infinite"

I jumped over the moon with happiness. I was able to relive the nostalgia and awesomeness that is Turok. The remastered graphics are so much better than they were before and honestly the game has aged really well unlike most video games of the 1990's. What I liked about Turok Dinosaur Hunter is that it's one of those games you can play for hours and never get bored of it. There is really nothing more satisfying than fighting dinosaurs. Turok Rocks. And the jumping parts are not much of a problem, I remember playing the N64 version and when I had to jump on those really small platforms I was fustrated like hell because with the controls on the N64 it was really hard to try and land properly but now I jump on the small platforms without any fuss. Turok Dinosaur Hunter is the Goldeneye of Dinosaurs games. And I recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience the good times they have had. And If there is anyone new to Turok They will want to give this a go. Now that Turok Dinosaur Hunter has been Released, What about the more superior sequel Turok 2 Seeds of evil, I swear if they don't release Turok 2, I'm going to go on a rampage like an Angry Tyrannosaurus Rex."

The Lost Land is some kind of weird place, where you'll find endless pits, jungles, ruins, ancient cities, robot fortresses, and all kinds of stuff like that. It's denizens are poachers, soldiers, dinosaurs, giant worms, killer plants, giant bugs, ape like reptile beasts, demons, aliens, natives, hell, all kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥is against you in this game. No regenerating lives, in game save points, so you can't abuse quick saves, and limited lives, quite old school.Now, I played this game back then using the N64 controller, and I was never really a fan of using a joystick in shooters. (Haters gonna hate)In my opinion, the shooting was kinda hard, and the platforming was a nightmare at time. Yes, I blame this game for my fear of heights, because some of those jumps are merciless, and if you miss, you plummet down the abyss.Now, this port feels amazing. Even if the graphics are kinda dated, because it was an N64 game, they gave it a few improvements, like water reflections, sun rays, and stuff like that. And I still managed to keep a smooth 60 FPS no mater how much♥♥♥♥♥♥was moving in my screen. Now, the controls are beautiful. Being able to play this game with a mouse and keyboard made those jumps way easier, and shooting feels way better now. I was able to pull incredibly accurate shots over long distances, something that was quite hard on the N64.The soundtrack is amazing, still one of my favorites from that era after all of these years. This game is sort of linear, mostly on the first and last levels, but it still forces you to explore every nook and cranny of the map, looking for keys for the next level or Chronoscepter pieces.The only thing I would kinda dislike about this game is that it's rather short. That, and the base price is kinda high, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale. But yes, maybe it's the nostalgia googles, but I really recommend this game."

I see it as a ""better Metroid Prime"" due to how the action stays consistent and fun, with little downtime.I'm glad that I got to relive it once again."

But sometimes you've got to put down the nostalgia goggles and look at what's staring you right in the face, and that is a bland, repetitive, clunky and boring game. Sure it's an old game, but think of other games from the period that still hold up today. Take something like Crash Bandicoot, which is still just as fun to play today because it was such good game design. Sure i played that game as a kid and my opinion may be flawed, so let's try another - Soul Reaver. I didn't play that until 2011 and was immediately absorbed by the compelling story and gameplay. I wouldn't rate it ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" like this game appears to be because its faults are obvious. For example, the majority of the puzzles involve pushing blocks, which is repetitive and boring too. Here's an example of a game i loved to bits as a kid and simply can't get back into because i can see how hugely flawed it is and i've accepted it - Turok Evolution. Good game design is timeless. Using the time period excuse for older games with a few oddities here and there is fine, but when the core gameplay is like this i just don't buy it. It's a bad old game, not a good old game (just like Sonic Adventure. Come get me internet.)The main reason i went out of my way to write this review instead of simply refunding is because of the asking price! £14.99 is completely absurd for the quality of the content.

,Recommended,405820,19756025,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is a relic of a different era of game design. One that was more at home with Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda than Doom and Quake.Turok bares a lot more qualities reminiscient of Mario than Doom really. The game features an overly cartoony art style with exaggerated proportions, it takes place in a vague indeterminate setting called the ""Lost Land"" reminiscient of Mario's mushroom kingdom. It features player lives and pickups inorder to gain new ones. It has a hub level strictly for warping to new ones ala Super Mario 64. It has platforming sections. And the general objective of the game is to ""gather something from every level in the game and kill the final boss"". It's weird to me coming back to it since, swap the graphics and change the protagonist into a plumber and the enemies into goombas and you have ""Super Mario the FPS"". Just add dinosaurs.Now this game originally released on the N64 and has been ported to a brand new engine with this release. You have things like a water reflection shader, higher framerate, FOV options and widescreen. The higher framerate causes the game to feel much faster and more akin to Serious Sam.Now all this being said. Whether it's worth the 20$ asking price is entirely dependant on if you like older first person shooters and don't mind the rough edges. Since you can beat it in about 6 or so hours. Personally I do like the game as is, and with the promise of a level editor and Turok 2 down the road, I'm more excited for the future of the series than I ever was before."

The bad news is the game is ugly as sin by today's standards. But that's okay though. I still like the gameplay. It's hardcore, old school. No regenerating health, no abundance of body armor,  Ammo can be scarce so don't be surprised to find yourself facing two soldiers, one with a plasma rilfe and all you have is a  combat knife and a death wish. I'm playing the game on a Surface Pro 3 with the Steam controller and it runs without any issues. 2160 x 1440 with the extended draw distance turned on. It runs pretty good with all effects turned on at that resolution, between 30-35 FPS  but I wanted the higher framerate (50-60) so I turned a lot of it off. It doesn't make much difference anyway because we're still talking about a N64 game with N64 textures. Bloom lighting on those is doesn't do much.But I do recommend the game for anyone that fondly remembers Turok and wouldn't mind playing it again. I've but almost two hours into it and it's still fun even though I haven't played it in almost 18 years."

A time when 3D graphics had firmly supplanted 2D on consoles, and analog control was new. A time when reflection mapping and particle effects meant a game was realistic, and we considered these derp faces highly detailed.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789409826A time when platforming meant insanely challenging precision hopping 1,000 feet in the air between what one magazine article of the era lamented as ""floating rocks the size of dinner plates."" All with slippery, floaty controls compared to what you're likely used to today, and a draw distance we all didn't know better than to think was just ""ambient fog"" that added atmosphere to our games.An era where grey, green, and lava red were considered a stunningly vibrant array of colors.Make dinosaurs extinct againThis game... ohhh, this game! When I purchased an N64 back in the 90s, I got four games with it. Doom 64 (still my favorite classic style Doom ever,) Mario 64, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire (someone please remaster it with modern controller support and upscale like this game, please!) ... and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.By today's standards, this is a brief, ridiculously challenging on any difficulty above easy from the second or third level on, very ugly, less than ideally controllable (although it feels fine with mouse and keyboard) first person shooter. But in 1997, it felt revolutionary. With a speed and polish something akin to the original Quake, graphics which at the time were gorgeously slick, the appeal of fighting dinosaurs and soldiers in jungles, and plenty of secrets, it was a big hit and a staple on the system.This is a fairly no frills port, but adds modern controller support, FOV settings (I recommend the lowest one for something akin to the original game's FOV, but crank it up for that high speed feeling fisheye effect if you want it,) vibrancy settings (with Reshade - use version 3 and OpenGL incidentally - and vibrancy turned on but all the way down, the game really pops and looks like the original but with much higher contrast,) FXAA, bloom, *massively increased draw distance*and other bells and whistles. There is no retexture, but existing textures natively scale all the way to 4K resolutions. So everything looks sharp, if dated.There are eight levels, and one hub stage. The goal of the levels is to find all the keys which unlock subsequent stages (so if you miss any, you'll need to replay them a bit.) Saves work via manual save points, and a checkpoint system only restores you after death during your current session. Loading always takes you to your last manual save point. Old school.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=788498785The game is much more challenging than I remember. Some of that is due to revamped AI toughness, but mainly it's just that this is a pretty challenging game, especially the platforming sections. I'm much better at it now than I was in the 90s, thankfully. But expect a tough time due to the save system.Using a controller, the game works fine (native dual analog control just like you'd expect,) but even after tweaking the sensitivity and turn acceleration settings for more than an hour, I couldn't ever get it to feel quite as precise as modern games do. The acceleration curves are very dated. Mouse and keyboard feel great, however. That said, I did adapt and play with my 360 controller. I wanted to relive the console experience, just with twin analog.Level variety is decent. Jungles, treetop villages, lost ruins, volcanic plains, and mechanical bases. Enemies are pretty epic in my opinion. Dinosaurs, soldiers, soldiers riding dinosaurs, dinosaurs modified with weapons, and later on, some fairly intimidating mechs. And this Suburban Commando era Hulk Hogan looking boss that I completely forgot about until replaying the game after 20 years.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=788498946Weapon variety is nice. Exploding arrows, a variety of guns, advanced energy weapons... all the things you'd expect. This game and its sequel always stuck out in my mind as the point where modern, animated weapons, and crazy alien tech with blue glowy energy started showing up in first person shooters. They still look pretty good, and as mentioned, have some pleasing particle effects. Honestly at times while replaying this, I was reminded of the Halo games' arsenals. Which may give you some idea of how modern it felt for 1997.Who should buy it?Anyone cool with old school games in the vein of Quake, but with a more outdoor vibe. Anyone who doesn't mind old school save systems, and challenging platforming.Who should steer clear?Anyone who doesn't want tough platforming sections, limited lives, manual save points, and dated visuals. Anyone who was hoping for a true HD retexture."

,Not Recommended,405820,33239425,Posted: 4 July,all,Arkan01d,"TL;DR - Easier than Banjo Kazooie remake. But not really able to recommend to newer players.Do I enjoy the game? HELL YEAH!! It's fun, it's frustrating, it's old-school quirky and fast paced. Do I recommend it? Hell No! The reason I don't recommend it, is the only people whom it would need recommending to probably won't see the same game we all enjoy.Turok is 100% a product of it's generation. That doesn't mean it's a bad game. It means this game will only really be enjoyed by those who grew up at that time. The first problem this game has is it's level design and engine. It reeks of N64! Which the game was built for, I know. However, the limits of that console keeps this game feeling cramped. Keep in mind this was the same time games like Blood, MDK, Quake II, Hexen II, Tomb Raider II, & Star Wars Jedi Knight II were coming out on PC.  Those games had a much more open feel. Their level designs still hold up today. Turok does good for the tech it was built for, but it does lack in comparison to these titles.Weapons are another concerning factor. There is variety, but they don't have range. Enemies can shoot you further than you can. It's strange to be taking damage from someone and when you shoot at them the bullets don't reach. The shotgun is underpowered imho. Why does it take 2 hits to take down a raptor? You have limited ammo and a long animation sequence between shots. Unless you have explosive shells, this gun is hardly worth it in most situations. The bow and arrow is another one. Other than hitting large enemies, this weapon leaves a lot to be desired. And why can't you switch ammo? You have to use your best ammo no matter what. Then there's the knife. It doesn't 1 shot even some of the most basic enemies. You take a big risk using it, but the reward is not there. That's just my take on things.The limited lives and spaced out save points are another throw back to an older generation. I doubt most new gamers will appreciate mini-bosses standing at every save point. Exploration is punished by enemies respawning. You have to play the levels a few times to get all the niche's figured out. The secret warps are limited. Although spread out nicely throughout the levels, they repeat and bring you to the exact same secret you entered at the last checkpoint.It also must be commented on that a crazy faced, fully stereotypical, Native American may put an itch under the skin of SJW's. But this game came out in a time when that wasn't considered taboo or even that bad. Carmageddon had just been released rewarding players who murdered innocent people. Shadow Warrior was making fun of Asian stereotypes. GTA 1 had just been released. Duke Nukem was objectifying women. It was a different time for sure.These are just a few quirks that Turok has. Do I think they are barriers to enjoying the game? Depends on the type of gameplay you were raised on. If Halo was your first game, and you were raised on infinite, op, pistols, and the ability to hide in a corner until you regained sheilds, then this game will feel very unfair. If you were raised on Doom, and sometimes running for the exit switch was your only option, then this game is a nice balance between FPS speed-running and exploration/platforming.But hey! At least it's not as hard as Banjo Kazooie!!"

,Not Recommended,405820,29128424,Posted: 8 January,all,Drakevarg,"Never assume a good game will stay good.For about 75% of my playthrough, it felt like a given that I'd be giving this a positive review. Turok is a visually limited, dated game with next to no story, but it had a bouncy, almost Crash Bandicoot-esque feel to it that made the game feel surprisingly upbeat and unambiguously fun-for-fun's-sake in a way that very few FPSes manage. Even Doom is a bit bogged down in that regard with its demonic gloom and preoccupation with macho metal badassery. Plus you get to fight dinosaurs, which I don't think happens nearly enough in games, despite it seeming like an obvious match.Buuut then the last two levels happened, and my goodwill dropped like a rock. I feel like the game's assets were planned and developed before they even thought about doing any level design, because while the last two levels have more unique enemy models than the rest of the game put together, the actual design of the levels are absolute crap. The penultimate level is crowded with way too many respawning enemies, no real visual direction so it's impossible to get any sort of instinct as to what's an exploratory path and what's a main path, and is filled with points of no return, especially after the halfway point where it basically turns into a totally different level. And the final level stacks hordes of overpowered enemies on top of making most of them respawn, is now almost completely linear, and drags on for FAR too long so that by the end of it even the two back-to-back final bosses were just an extra speed bump to the end credits.The first 3/4 of the game is actually a lot of fun and made me wish that the other Turok games were available on Steam, but if they're anything like the last quarter of this game I wouldn't bother with them even if they were."

Well, actually, no, it's not. I'm recommending it because of nostalgia, nothing more. If you never played the N64 original then you might as well consider this review a thumbs down. Despite the many refinements Night Daive have made to the original game it's still not good, and never will be.So what's wrong with Turok?, you might ask. Well, other than the obvious aspect of the visuals, which can be excused due to the game being 20 years old, there's a list of problems that exist not only in this port, but in the original game too. The port is actually very good, and credit to Night Dive for a job well done.The main issues with Turok, mostly left over from the original version, are as follows:-Poor level design. There are many areas in the vast, sprawling levels where it's very easy to get lost or turned around. The map helps to alleviate some of the issues but is not really dequate. In many places vital areas are hidden like secrets, making progress difficult and replaying the levels a neccessary chore.-Terrible hit boxes, both for enemies and your own weapons. The hit boxes tend towards the large side which isn't so bad for enemies, although it does look stupid, but will lead to cases of shooting the ground at your feet when you know you were aiming clear over the edge of a ledge.-Poor audio/visual feedback. It's often unclear whether or not you are hitting an anemy, and even when you do the response from enemy is very unsatisfying. Enemies have no stagger animation, or indeed any response to being hit.-Nonsensical arsenal layout where redundant weapons are not replaced or removed, but exist in the player's inventory alongside the superior version of the weapon.-Lack of challenge. This is more of an issue with the port than the original game, as having access to mouse and keyboard controls in a game made for a controller with a single analogue stick makes everything a lot easier.Those are the main problems I found with Turok. There are others but those are mostly nitpicks so I won't go in to them here. But even so, if you played Turok when it originally released then go ahead and give this version a try. The port is better than the original, certainly, adding many quality-of-life features that we have come to expect from modern games, but doesn't detract from the nostalgia feeling. I had a lot of fun with Turok, despite the game itself being pretty awful, as it always has been."

Being a ""remastered"" version, I was expecting to see a little sharper textures and some better particle effects. It seems that the game itself has just been brought over to another engine or something that supports better shader fx.Maybe my mind is foggy, but I don't remember there being such horrendous camera tilt in the N64 version. Pair that off with the insane speed Turok accelerates to and I feel like i'm riding a motorcycle. The respawn rate seems to be a little bit high as well, especially since ammo and health are limited and targets (unless firing physical projectiles like pulse rifles) can't miss you.All of this stuff is easily dismisable, though -- it's all part of the learning curve of the game.What gripes me the most is the amount of visual bugs in the game. Insane clipping, massive frame rate drops when underwater/ in the clouds, uncapped meshes, Z-fighting, and that's only what I found in Level 2! There is literally no excuse for some of these things!If you're looking to shell out 20$ for a quick nostalgic trip, go for it.  You'll get it.

Once again,I would not recommend it for any more than $20---and this is coming from someone who has paid for nearly every re-release of DOOM on every platform and still enjoyed it just as much.BOTTOM LINE:  A remaster of Turok 2 or a $20 Turok Classic Collection would have held up much better for the money.

The save system in Turok is horrible, what were they thinking? Gunplay isn't bad, but again, they managed to screw up. Alternative ammo types is a great idea in theory, but you gotta do it right. When you pick up special ammo, i.e. expliding arrows, it downright replaces your main ammo type so you can't just keep the exploding arrows for the big baddies and switch as you wish. The HUD even hides the default ammo! Same goes for health & armor, if you have armor, your health is hidden. WTF? Last but not least, respawning enemies. I've entered an interesting area where I wanted to explore and find all goodies on the roors and some minutes later, I was out of ammo as enemies respawn all the time without dropping all the ammo I need to kill them. This, the boring level geometry and the horrible excuse for a save system make me want to play Quake again.

STOP TRYING TO DO PLATFORMING! its not fun to manage badly controled and bad physics jumping. everything else is trying to kill you, why is reality also doing it? its not fair!8) that damn music.. it keep making dinosaur and animal noise.. how can i know which ones are really a dinosaur behind me and which one are just confusing ambience?those are my reasons to be glad i am not living in the past right now!..wait.. what i just wrote is in the pa...SHIIIT!...beeep"

76561197970790497,Recommended,405820,30479716,Posted: 12 March,all,Sub-Zero,"At the time this review, I have just completed the game for the first time, clocking in at 5.9 hours of playtime. I'm assuming that those reading this are familiar with the original PC/N64 releases, so bear with me not going into too many details on gameplay and story.Wow, what a remaster. It kept everything I knew of the original game and put a bunch of changes on top, that, in my opinion, improved the game quite a bit, but not to a degree that it felt different from what I remember.The annoying view bobbing that plagued the original game can be turned off now and the draw distance (fog) can be increased (but not entirely removed). Sounds are decent (and easily moddable!) and are based on the N64 version.The higher resolution and improved lighting makes it a good looking game, although the textures are merely upscaled, not necessarily HD by today's standards, same with character and item models. Basically it looks like a more polished version of the original game.As far as my 6 hour playtime is concerned, you have to know that I used to know this game inside-out as a kid, around 15 years ago. I barely ever got lost this time, and even then, just paying attention to the environment helps. Increased draw distance helps a ton in this regard as well. While the level design can be confusing (especially for first time players), it can eventually grow on you, barring initial annoyance. Never before were keys this important to find.So the game can be short, but with stuff like finding the Chronoscepter pieces and (truly well) hidden secret areas, there's reason for further playthroughs.I recommend this to anyone who liked the original and everyone else who wants to play a classic shooter that was a bit different from the masses at the time, both in style and in gameplay, as this game can almost be seen as an FPS/Platformer hybrid."

I tried going back to the N6 version and had many failed attempts at installing the old Turok PC cd onto my computer. Finally Night Dive Studios has resurrected this absolutely revolutionary FPS classic. Before Turok FPS were mostly made of sprites and took place in corridors, Turok took the action outside and let you blow apart fully polygonal enemies with a huge armament. Many people remember Golden Eye as the must play FPS for N64 but Turok was released before bond and was truly the game that broke new grounds. Night Dive has done an amazing job at remastering my favorite game from my child hood and it’s worth every penny. Turok is the reason I am a gamer today. 11/10"

Out of any FPS style game I've played, Turok holds the most time I've ever spent playing. Maybe Turok 2, but they just don't make them like this anymore. The game feels very natural with the keyboard and mouse compared to the N64 controller, making it a little easier to navigate and avoid enemy attack. I also liked the advanced sight into the fog this version gives you, much more time to react and plan your attacks. Really the only thing bad I can say about this title is the price tag, to someone like me, I felt it was a small price to pay.

The levels were supposedly redesigned for the re-release, though it's been so long I don't remember what the original ones were like, but it wasn't overly difficult to find all the keys or the Chronoscepter pieces - however, only a few of them were in plain sight (and I even managed to miss one that was) so there's still plenty of room for exploration.You might want to wait for it to go on sale, but if you're interested in a classic, it's worth picking up."

I keep it on the second-lowest (74 I think) to make things a bit friendlier but any higher than that and it just looks wierd to me.-There's no auto-aim. Unless its possibly there on Easy mode, I don't know, haven't tried that...-If you draw an arrow you can't switch to another weapon to keep from firing.-No option for spring-look joystick - so that exact original feel isn't there if you really wanted it (not a problem for me though).-I wish there were achievements for more things, like ""Find a backpack"", ""Beat Game on Hard"", ""Beat in under 10 hours"", and some to make me play through it more than once, like ""kill 10,000 enemies"" or ""Play for 30 hours""Nothing's really disappointing about it though - if you're like me and loved Turok and just wanted to have Turok with Achievements, here you go. Nice job Night Dive; thanks for bringing it back.P.S.  If you're playing this for the first time, remember this was March of 1997 (for the N64 version).

Now with improved draw distance, smooth and remappable controls and even increased difficulty options.And while I may call this a port, saying that doesn't exactly do it justice. The engine it runs on is entirely new and doesn't actually have too heavy a relationship with either the N64 original or the somewhat shoddy PC port. And on top of that the engine also supports moddability, something the originals never had.If you can handle the dated visuals this is totally worth what they're asking for, the game itself can be on the short side if you know what you're doing, but the exploration required to find level keys plus the chronosceptre peices if you want to build that too are fun in a way most key hunts really aren't. The levels are packed with secrets which helps with replayability too.So TL:DR. it's good. And at that you should thank Kaiser for his great work on the engine.

This is a pretty faith 1:1 coversion of the original game on the N64/PC to modern PC systems. So this is not your typical ""Remaster"" game that changes the whole graphics and gameplay, while ruining or forgetting some stuff in the process. And let me tell you something, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is STILL GOOD AS IT IS! So I'm glad how they decided to aproach this. Instead you get the same classic game with slight but welcomed graphic improvements and the obvious advantages that mouse and keyboard inputs provide.To those that dont know anything about this game, Turok is a classic FPS that wasnt like anything back in 1997 or even today. This game introduced something that FPS didnt have back then, platforming and verticality, in fact I think it was the first game that did. Basically this game plays like DOOM with Super Mario Bros. levels of jumping all in a 3D environment. The first thing you'll notice is the incredible speed your character has when you move around. And jumping is not just a secondary occasional action, its the key aspect of the gameplay and without decent control of it you will get nowhere as your shooting abilities wont be enough if you want to progress. But dont worry things can only get more fun and feel natural as you make your first jumps. The game teaches you the basic and advanced actions in a tutorial that WILL help further in the game, such as ""long jumps"" and ""diagonal jumping"".The level design is very clever and complex, they are like laberinths, so forget about just corridors and buildings, you are out in the wild with dinosaurs and other hunters that want to cut your head off. The weapons as with all Turok games can be as simple as a pistol or crazy and inventive like the Quad Rocket launcher or the Chronoscepter which you must find all the parts to assemble it if you want a better chance with the final boss.The improved PC controls and a simple increase in color saturation and lighting has made wonders to this old game. Dont let the blocky models and old looking textures fool you, this game still has a lot to offer today, specially in an era dominated by online multiplayer modes and the lack of fun and replayable campaigns in FPS games. Also, the gamepad support is still excelent, probably because the original game was meant for a console so if you are looking for an FPS game to play while sitting comfortably in your couch, look no further, this game plays great with BOTH mouse/keyboard combo or Gamepad. And trust me there arent many fps games that play this good with a gamepad (at least not without autofire, LOL), hehe you can thank me later.I think this game still has the potential to entertain us for years to come, and hopefully it will be here to remember us and future generations what a fun FPS campaign is made of and what we should demand in FPS games and what not. Give it a chance I promise it wont let you down.One last thing: a Real Dinosaur Hunter plays withouth crosshairs! Happy Hunting! ;-)"

Read on for full review.Turok: Dinosaur Huntermade its debut on the Nintendo 64 and PC in 1997. This game was one of the greatest adaptations of the titular hero when it originally released, but does its remaster still live up to today's standards?ProsConsTurok: Dinosaur Hunter has never played any better than it does here, and it runs at a butter-smooth 60 FPS.Lack of proper cutscenes within the game to make the story more engaging.Minor changes to level design are seamless.Enemy AI pathfinding didn't carry over well for the remaster.Difficulty changes were much needed and add great replay value.Textures are muddied.New lighting and graphical effects are well done.Sound effects are very inconsistent throughout the entirety of the game.Ambient environmental sounds are all great and immerse you into the game.StoryThe game thrusts you into the Lost Land, a place I can only describe as the garbage dump of time and space. Pretty much anything can get sucked into this land, and you were no different. As Turok, your duty is to assemble together the pieces of the Chronoscepter and put an end to the Campaigner's tyrannical reign.The problem? None of this is explained to you in-game. You're left with an opening cutscene that tells you to locate keys to open up level portals in the Hub. The lack of any proper introduction makes you think there would at least be 'something' that builds the plot up as you go along your journey; however, without spoiling anything, the game's ending has a similar feeling of short-sightedness to it that will still leave you completely dumbfounded the same way the introduction did.It was jarring in 1997, and it still is now.GameplayNight Dive Studios has put such an untold amount of work into fixing the original game's flaws while still keeping true to the source content, even with its minor changes made to level design.One example of this is that you can now choose between four difficulty modes in this game: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Hardcore. Veteran players will find an added emphasis on survival with conserving weapon ammo and dodging enemy fire on later difficulties that was not present in the original game.Unfortunately, the pathing for enemies seems to be messed up in this remaster. Simply put, enemies nowhere near your vicinity will detect you and start running towards a wall. While it didn't affect me too much on Normal, it becomes far worse on later difficulties when mixed with the relentless respawn timer and increased enemy speed.GraphicsTurok: Dinosaur Hunterhas never looked better, but that's not saying much. While this version of the game boasts the smoothest Turok experience to date, running at 60 FPS in 1080p, it still looks like a prototype ofTurok 2: Seeds of Evil.The textures are muddied and lack variety, especially in the game’s early stages, but if you're used to games from the Nintendo 64 era, it shouldn't get in the way of your enjoyment of the game. Much appreciated changes were made to saturation, the addition of bloom, god rays, anti-aliasing, and water reflections, as well as an extended draw distance. All of these changes help make the environments in this game pop and stand-out from each other, though I wish shadows and other dynamic lighting effects were added into the game.AudioWhile the Nintendo 64 soundtrack still does this game justice, the sound effects need a lot of work for creatures like Raptors and Leapers, traps, and enemy footsteps. These inconsistent sound effects, which I don't remember being nearly as present in the original game, are so bad at times that they can cause audible pops in feedback for your speakers or headset, no matter the volume settings of the game.Luckily, the addition of ambient environmental sounds adds a new level of atmosphere and does so without feeling out-of-place.ConclusionFortunately, Turok fans will feel right at home playing the game on Steam as the remastered version ofTurok: Dinosaur Hunterachieves a great balance between platforming action, puzzle-solving elements, and shooter-based mechanics to make an experience that feels unlike anything else on the market even today. While it still has its fair share of issues that can be ironed out by Night Dive Studios, this is by far the most definitive version ofTurok: Dinosaur Hunterout there."

Reading about the Remake and finding Turok on Steam 20 later is just awesome. I guess there are a lot of people who wrote already glorifying notes, hence I'll pinpoint out the differences.1996 vs. 2016:better graphics: I'm sure there is an overview concerning the graphical enhancements (water, AAFX, fog, etc). The developers didn't enhance the graphics to much. Hence Turok kept its look and feel. For example the fog – originally designed to save comping-power – wasn't removed. But the player is provided with the option to reduce. Hence he still can enjoy the original games atmosphere.more accurate controls: the PC Version in 1996 felt like a N64 port. Setting up the controls took some time and usually ended up in a half baked configuration – Uhm... jeah I cyn play with this, but I could be better. The remake controls are WASD-Style and work precicely.aiming: opposing to the 1996 version the Player now can turn the crosshair on :)the “mortal wound”: in the current version it drops very rarely, but this doesn't matter because this item was originally designed to increase the auto-aim-accuracy.Violence and blood-settings: opposing to the games PC Version in 1996 the current Version allows the player to chose red, green or “no blood”. Especially the German Players might be happy to notice, since the German Version was cut by removing Skins and blood effects to match the youth protection requirements.I hope that Turok 2 will be remade soon and that the Developers port the bugfix concerning the Tranquilizer Gun."

76561198132792574,Recommended,405820,30420546,Posted: 9 March,all,armoredrobot,"Goddamn, this has aged well. Not quite as well as Quake, maybe, but I expected Quake to age well. I had no expectations whatsoever for Turok, but lo and behold, it's a really fun game. Not perfect by any means, but definitely really solid and enjoyable.This was one of the first FPS to be on consoles, to prove that the genre could exist on more than just PC. A lot of the design decisions reflect this: there's a fairly generous auto-aim feature to make up for the lack of mouse, and the weapon select feature is clearly designed for scrolling, not selecting with specific keys. There's also no ""Use"" button, probably to make up for the relative lack of buttons on a controller compared to a keyboard. More generally, however, there's a more arcadey feel to the mechanics. Your character can jump really high, swim for a very long time, and not take any fall damage whatsoever. This complements the near-omnipresent platforming (another arcadey touch), which is surprisingly good for an FPS. Additionally, there are pickups scattered around that, if you collect 100, give you an extra life. These arcadey features seem more geared toward the consoles of the 90s than PC, and give Turok: Dinosaur Hunter a very different feel to most FPS of the time.There doesn't seem to be any plot whatsoever, only circumstance. You are Turok, a baffling Native American stereotype living in some weird world that seems to combine elements of prehistory, such as dinosaurs and extensive jungle, with elements of the future, such as laser guns and high-tech bases. For whatever reason, you've decided to kill every living thing in sight and assemble the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter. I don't know anything more about the plot than this, but it gives me an excuse to shoot cyborg Deinonychus with an explosive shotgun, so I'll give it a pass.The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Besides all the platforming, the main focus is shooting, which feels wonderful. It's fast and frantic and almost effortless at times, the difficulty curve is well-managed, and there's lots of variety to add interest to proceedings. There's an excellent selection of 14 or so diverse weapons from all sorts of time periods, although it's pretty poorly balanced (I couldn't find any use for the Alien Weapon or the Shockwave Weapon). A couple have different ammunition types, but you can't toggle them, so all you can do is wear out the better type before moving on to the normal one. That's dumb, but it's not enough of an issue to really be worth complaining about. Ammo caps are also kinda low, but the Backpack powerup remedies this to some extent. There's also an AK-47 that fires 9mm pistol rounds, which I thought was interesting.The enemies are about as diverse as the weapons, in both design and gameplay execution. There are some fun enemy death animations, and you can shoot random harmless animals for health pickups. The game is also very bloody, but not gory; defeated enemies practically gush blood particles, but other than that appear untouched. Unfortunately, enemies spawn infinitely even though ammo does not, but this can be worked around to some extent by simply ignoring and running past them.The levels are pretty well-designed. The game forgoes the usual structure of 15-30 normal-sized levels in favor of 8 massive ones, each with tons of secrets and alternate pathways. These levels can be replayed as often as you want in order to get enough keys to unlock later levels. The level design is often quite maze-y and easy to get lost in, but it has the same odd property as Quake where the levels are intuitively designed enough that you can often have only a vague idea of where you are, but as long as you keep moving forward you can usually get to where you want to go. This works well enough that I barely ever needed a walkthrough. I can only imagine the backbreaking amount of effort it took to design the levels to work this way, but I certainly appreciate it.There are no quicksaves. Instead, there's a system of checkpoints and lives that can be gained by collecting enough points, as mentioned above. Occasionally, there'll be a statue where you can save as often as you want, but they're generally limited to 2-3 per level. This doesn't work as well as quicksaves, of course, but it's basically fine; checkpoints are spaced well enough to avoid serious frustration.The camera jerks around constantly in response to various actions, such as climbing, swimming, and turning sharply. I got used to it fairly quickly, but if you have trouble with FPS-induced nausea, be warned.Overall, Turok's a very solid game that has certainly stood the test of time. The gameplay is enjoyable, there's a lot of variety, it works to set itself apart from other FPS, and what issues there are are generally minimized as much as possible. I recommend it.EDIT: $20 is a bit steep for a game this old, though. You should probably wait for a sale unless you're dead-set on getting this."

It is, however, much, much better than I remember it being. Due to this excellent port, the ability to finally play the game with proper keyboard/mouse support, and excellent customization options for both the graphics and gameplay (setting the difficulty to 'hardcore' is very challenging), this version of Turok feels like the definitive version of Turok. It does not feel like an N64 game exactly - it feels like an N64 game reimagined and remastered perfectly for PC. Flying through the labyrinthian levels and blowing away tons of creatures feels nearly as responsive and fluid as it does in classic iD software games like DooM and Quake, and the weapons are cool and fun to shoot.It's a steal when it's on sale, but now, having played it, I could recommend this game for its full $20 asking price - even if the developers never get around to finishing and releasing the SDK.

Like the long lost and older cousin ofUnreal, Turok contains a semblance of an arena shooter but with a focus on adventure. There's no facade or pretense in this game. You are the Turok. You hunt dinosaurs but you also fight aliens, demons, cyborgs and robots, and pesky mercenaries. If that doesn't sound awesome I don't know what is.And if you really care to know what else is going on you can figure it out as you play because it's real simple:Your mission is to stop a guy from using the Lost Land as a base of operations for a future conquest.Does that sound like a complicated plot? Personally, that sounds like all the plot you need. Plus, the settings speak for themselves. Some are wide and outdoor. Some are haunting and morose. And some are sinister and cold like a machine fortress. Armed with a knife and bow & arrow, you set out and wind up using a quadruple-fire rocket launcher and the legendary chronoscepter. Wait, what's the chronoscepter? Let's view the manual:""The Chronoscepter is capable of creating micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, thus disrupting matter at a focus point.""Wait a minute, you get to shoot a micro-tear in the fabric of space-time against your opposition? How many other games start you off with simple weapons and by the end you're using scifi weapons and weapons that destroy time and space itself? Don't answer that because all you really need is the knife. Knife > Chronoscepter. The enemies don't stand a chance.Overall, if you want to go back to a time where games were games, adventure and action was the focus, and it's you versus a wide variety of enemies that make you question reality itself; then the land where time has no meaning awaits.

At it's core, Turok is a FPS from a time when you could carry around enough weapons and ammo to arm a small country facing down an actual army of soldiers, dinosaurs, aliens, or soldiers riding dinosaurs with rocket launchers.You'll quickly start to realize that what the game lacks in beauty, it makes up for in fierce combat. There is no hand holding here. No hiding until the booboos go away. Just you and the savagery of The Lost Lands."

Though there were some moments further in the game where it questions you ""Are the developers on crack when they are making this?"" lol.So far the game is good, it lacks the story in game. All starts with you playing as Turok and you must collect the keys to unlock the levels, which is the max of 8 levels. Theres also a secret weapon through every level. Find it and you can use it, useful on the final battle.Pros:Great weapons.massive killing later in the game.A game where you look for important items in order to progress.No glitches or bugs except for one which i'll explain later in the bottom.You play as a Indian tribe using modern weapons, so why not?Cons:Less ammo and health, you have to be very conservative with your health and ammo, you also have lives which can be used for full health when you die. I just wish there can be some mystic water that regenerates health or something but I guess you'll have to play smart in order to beat it.No autosaves or quick saves, you have to use a golden statue in order to save your game which is throughout the game. It gets pressuring without saving later, but when you do, its a relief. You have to walk at it in order to save your game.Overall: Its a really good game and I have a blast. Its actually worth a buy.Glitch/bug: Theres a white flickering light when you start playing and it gets annoying. However, I discovered the solution. Just click this link for instructions as it helped me and I was able to play it perfectly well.http://steamcommunity.com/app/405820/discussions/0/365172547950979990/Follow it and you should be able to play.Tips:DO NOT KILL ALL ENEMIES! Not sure if it depends on difficulty (I played hardcore) but some enemies respawn but not all. Just dont kill everyone, use your ammo wisely as I said its low. Very scarce. Some enemies like dinosaurs are not necessary to kill, if you seen some just run away. Dont bother knifing if you know how to not take damage and if you are patient. If any monsters that respawn such as dinosaurs are in your way, kill them but get out of that area quickly before they respawn. Which would mean you waste your ammo for nothing and you'll have a hard time finding refills.A secret weapon will help you in the final boss battle and the last piece of it will always be at the final boss so no worries, always keep your eyes on any suspicious areas. You'll know when you get it from the key menu in the pause menu. Its that lonely symbol from the other symbols (other symbols are keys btw).Secret areas exist in this game, so look out for them. It can save your life on crucial situation whenever you are low on health or ammo.Collect ammo and health wisely, the moment you collect everything, you'll probably wish you didnt when you are low on health and ammo. Leave them alone if you are packed, come back later when you actually do need it.Lives, dont waste them on something ridiculous. Such as falling to your death, which is a primarily worst thing to waste your life on unless you knew you were going to die anyways. If you do just load a game. If you lose all your lives, its game over. If you have lives, it'll bring you back to life, taking you to the checkpoint or the statue you saved at.Checkpoints arent saves, so dont turn off your game lol. Turn off after you save, which is from a statue.Turok is a strong swimmer, so he can go underwater for long amount of time. Enough time for you to search the area. Dont sit there too long though, he can die eventually. But it'll be a very long time. You'll know when the air meter pops up, then you need to get out of there.The more weapons you collect (without sharing same ammo), the easier the game will be. It starts out rough at start but if you pull it through it gets easier. That I can promise.Remember to collect ALL the keys, thats the whole point of the game and the way to beat it. You need those keys to unlock levels so you can access them, including the final level.This is pretty much all I can give. As for glitches/bugs concerns, all I had was the white flickering screen and the link I sent helped me out with the problem. If you are able to play it, have fun.I also give this 9/10, despite the glitch/bug but its possible to fix anyways. So its all good."

Try out community made maps and mods.What I disliked or was disappointed withYou can't switch ammo types you have to use whatever you've picked up, which is a shame because I wouldn't have minded saving some of them explosive shotgun shells for the boss fights or tougher enemies.The game needed more power ups.The game is quite short. It's a lot of money for what it is.I would of liked to of seem more of the body of the weapon, especially the shotgun and assault rifle.More steam achievements would have been cool.Weapons need a larger ammo capacity.I wish the puzzles were more challenging in the portals.You only get a maximum of 9 lives.ConclusionFun and addictive game.

,Recommended,405820,33256952,Posted: 4 July,all,trepmaws,"Ah, a classic 3D FPS. This of course comes with a familiar set of good and less good aspects:Pros- Good old run n' gun combat. Like other shooters of the time (and stuff like Doom 2016), it's worth staying on the move to avoid getting shot and/or torn apart. Add on top of this the fact the game will periodically spawn in more enemies, and there's almost always some kind of action to keep you on your toes.- Large arsenal of weapons with plenty of variety, from the mundane but effective (shotgun, assault rifle, a knife that, unlike Doomguy's fist, is actually fairly useful in a pinch), to the unusual and flashy (energy weapons and explosives of various sizes and effects).- Element of exploration in the levels. While the level layouts are mostly linear, you are rewarded for going off the beaten path and checking all the nooks and crannies. Usually this bags much-needed health and ammo, but there's also the possibility of finding a new weapon early or a nifty powerup. And you WILL have to do some searching if you want to collect all the pieces of the Chronoscepter, this game's ultimate weapon.- Plenty of intersting enemies to use said weapons on. Of course you'll have dinosaurs and humans to shoot, stab and blow up with explosive arrows, but the Lost Land is a weird place filled with all kinds of crazy stuff. Expect every level to throw something new at you that you haven't faced down yet.Cons- To get to new levels you need to find keys in previous ones to unlock them. Fortunately keys are usually not that hard to find if you're already hunting around everywhere for goodies, but nonetheless if you miss any it means taking another trip through the level to find what you missed. Level 5 in particular is a kind of a maze, and I wouldn't blame anyone who misses at least one key during it.- Remember when FPS games thought they should have platforming as a key element, without fantastic controls to back them up? Yeah, this game looooves its precision platforming over perilous pits of alliteration. Obviously this remaster's mouse and keyboard controls help a lot compared to the old N64 incarnation's janky setup, but you can still expect the game to punish you with lost health and/or lives when you screw up even a single jump. And it's still not hard to screw them up, even with modern controls.- Speaking of lives, you have limited lives and save points. Just one of those things I suppose the genre hadn't grown out of yet at the time. Not the friendliest thing to have to deal with when you consider how quickly enemies can tear you to pieces on higher difficulties, plus the aforementioned platforming. If it's any consolation, the game is designed around this, with it not being TOO difficult to get more lives if you remember to explore for resources and grab the bonus stage portals when they show up. Also, slain enemies stay dead between lives and bosses retain whatever hurt you put on them before they killed you, meaning you won't lose quite as much progress as you may normally expect.So overall, we got an old shooter with old design quirks, given a fresh coat of paint and controls that won't make you tear your hair out. The original N64 version would be a bit hard to recommend today, but having a mouse and keyboard to use makes a huge difference (or a modern controller; I played this all the way through with an Xbox One controller and, thanks to the sizeable amount control customization options, had a ballin time that way too). Given that huge change, this is now totally worth playing, whether you're an old player going back for that sweet nostalgia or a new player wanting to check out a fun bit of gaming history. Either way, I can guarantee this one still delivers."
,Recommended,405820,33158900,Posted: 2 July,all,KerdaKai,"I first rented this game back in March 1997 when it was originally released, then purchased it outright later that summer (along with an N64 Controller Pak, because god forbid you try to beat this in one sitting).  I went on to love and complete all 3 of the mainline Turok games released on the system (even Turok 3, which was lowkey garbage), and this rererelase does an exceptional job of wiping away the thick fog and wonky controls of the 64-bit original and playing the way Iguana likely intended it to.Draw distances are vastly, vastly superior, you can turn on a reticle to fascilitate actual, proper aiming (and turn on a ""precision aiming"" mode to trim down the bloated, console-friendly hitboxes of enemies), and most importantly, you get fast, responsive keyboard and mouse controls that make the game play like a modern release.Of course, this is still 1997 design, and gameplay never evolves beyond simplistic shooting, keycard collecting, braindead enemies, and a shocking amount of 1st person platforming (which is actually manageable now on Kb+M).  But it all works, really well, and it's fun.  If you're a younger player who's never experienced Turok, but enjoy modern shooters like Shadow Warrior and Doom 2016, there's real fun to be had here beyond just nostalgia.It also has to be said that the game looks absolutely decrepid, low-poly chunkiness liberally smeared with Vaseline textures, but it's so aged that it almost crosses over from being a relic to being downright A E S T H E T I C.  It's very much of its era, which is bad, but in a good way."

I never played this game on the N64 but i did play Turok: Evolution and i loved that game and when i saw this i had to grab it. Now the price is.... a bit much for it i would say that they should lower it to at least £12 or £13 but other than that the game is great. Better FOV than the original one (saw some gameplay of N64 version) and has much more fulent controls than the original had as well.Futhermore, the gameplay is amazing and a much better improvment from the N64 version, and for all you people out there that are going to give this a negative review just because of the price, then i would say you should wait till sale, then buy it and give it proper feedback in the way of negative or positive, which ever you want but don't give it a negative review because of the price because that's a small detail to what this games price is really worth. It's worth the trip back to your childhood (for all you people who did play this) and also to experience Turok in a completely different way than before and also for all of those who weren't alive back in 1997 to have fun with a remastered game and get a feel for classic Turok.Hoped this helped you in making a final decision.

Pretty Good but despite its improvements, this game is showing its age.+Everything that was good about the Nintendo 64 version of Turok Dinosaur Hunter is good in this game. This remake is amazingly true to the original.+The most major change between this version and the original is the fact that the game's fog has been pushed so far into the background that it is no longer an issue. The game is much easier and much less frustrating as a direct result.+Fast paced action.+Interesting variety of enemies.+Interesting variety of areas.+Interesting variety of weapons (though some weapons seem fairly useless) and the weapons themselves are often quite creative in their effects and operation.+Cool and exciting boss fights.+Very few bugs and no freeze ups.+Good menus and settings which are true to the original version.+The deep bass-oriented drum music is still pretty good and the music for the game's boss and final confrontation level are still excellent.+Can download user-created mods including a texture pack for higher-resolution textures (but I did not personally test this out).+Extremely responsive mouse/keyboard controls which were easy to customize/re-map.+Very nostalgic for those who played the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.+/-True to the original, this game has fairly mediocre sound effects of fairly low quality.+/-Interesting hub-based level/area structure which requires you to track down keys to unlock additional areas. Unfortunately some keys can be difficult to find or can be easily overlooked. Fortunately, the Internet has a lot of help freely available on the subject.-Textures seem blurry, repetitive, and stretched by today's standards and have not aged well.-Though the game's levels/areas are technically hub-based, areas themselves are designed to be run through in a fairly linear manner. Areas have a definite beginning area (near the entry portal), middle area and ending area (near the exit portal).-Although the enemy AI in this game was pretty good at the time the game was first made it is showing its age now.-This game has none of its story explained in-game. You must pretty much infer what is happening from seeing your surroundings from area to area. There is nearly no dialogue and no narrative.-Still cannot save your game wherever you want but must rely on irritating checkpoints and game save sites built into the physical confines of the level. These game save sites look like weird altars.-Jumping puzzles are still a recipe for potential frustration, particularly for inexperienced FPS players.-Relatively short game by today's standards which also seems to encourage you to rush through it due to the fact that your character moves so fast that he can outrun and dodge nearly any enemy in the game.-Cannot duck or go prone.-Repetitive enemy death screams throughout.-Oddly, the effects for the Nuke and Chronoscepter weapons were not as amazing or awe-inspiring as they were on the Nintendo 64 as these weapons create a lot of fog (or rather temporarily change the color of the area's fog) and that fog is largely absent in this version of the game."
