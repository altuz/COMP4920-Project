,Recommended,405830,32166866,Posted: 3 June,all,Mitri,"Solid gameplay with decent controls and levels. The level designs will at times be tedious and there is a quite a bit of backtracking if you miss something the first time around. The port of this game is astounding and you can tell a lot of care was put into this port. Cool features like a cheat code that enables you to play the game like Super Hot, multiplayer, etc. As well as fixes and objective markers when near an objective (Something the game has benefited a huge amount from). I can absolutely recommend this classic especially with such a beautiful port to steam."

,Recommended,405830,30563935,Posted: 16 March,all,Zenoth,"Very impressive remaster.+ New visual effects+ Actual new gameplay mecanic that helps Turok during platforming (that one is impressive)+ MORE BLOOD than the already-violent original (more blood decals on surfaces than before too)+ Sharp, clear textures+ Game looks fantastic with Ambient Occlusion (and frankly with everything maxed)+ Reflections on water? What is this sorcery! It's awesome!+ DRAW DISTANCE! DRAW DISTANCE!+ Related to the above (draw distance increase), some parts of maps where enemies used to NOT see you (and you not seeing them) because of the Fog in the original will now shoot at you if you happen to be within range. It actually changes the dynamic of the game a little bit and it's great. There's a couple of places where more enemies than ""normal"" will shoot at you (especially guard Dinosoids from fixed posts at a distance) because they can now see you, but of course you can see them too. So it's a shooting craze in those map sections.+ You can actually choose between the N64 or the PC versions of the Soundtrack, I think I had a tear in my eye when I saw that.+ I THINK that there's some (very few) places where one or two enemies have been ADDED compared to the original. I'm playing my first game on Hard right now... it may be why. I might also be wrong... but I'm 100% confident that I've seen at least two locations in the first map (which I've completed by the time I write this review) where there was at least one extra enemy that just didn't exist there in the original. The best example I can give is right at the VERY beginning of the first map (Port of Adia). There's a dinosoid spawning at the port right after the initial explosion occurs as you walk to the right. I remember clearly that in the original game there were NO enemies there at all (unless there WAS one but I just don't remember if I actually beat the game back then on Hard, or not... it might be because of the difficulty setting, but that would surprise me). Anyway, the gist is that if they indeed ADDED some enemies here and there based on difficulty setting then that's AMAZING. More enemies means more things to shoot at, that's always a plus in my book!+ What can I say more? IT'S TUROK 2.+ Buy it.Thank you for reading if you did (also, remember, just buy it, you'll thank me later)."

,Recommended,405830,30580163,Posted: 17 March,all,Akka,"A polished relicNightdive delivers another flawless remaster of a classic game, offering the world one last glimpse at fps design from over a decade ago. Those who fondly remember Turok 2 will be pleasantly surprised to re-experience this old school titan. Turok has been set free from the drawdistance masking fog, and experiences no hiccups no matter how hectic the onslaught of alien mayhem becomes. Compared to the N64 controller, mouse/keyboard handles like a dream. If you know what you're getting into, absolutely pick this up.On the other hand, if you have never played Turok 2 then heed this warning. It is almost NOTHING like the original.Turok 2 is a convoluted labyrinth that wraps in on itself, confounding anyone not intimiately familiar with the game. The original developers at Iguana employed every cheap trick in obscuring your destination and hiding the items you need to finish the game. Unless you've beaten this game before, you will not be able to clear this game without at least a litle guidance.Locked doors will stifle your progress, forcing you to find the key or switch sometimes hidden in complete pitch darkness. Brilliantly, Nightdive implemented quest markers, outlining many interactable objects. The abundance of hint nodes may seem annoying at first--but it becomes absolutely compulsory in the latter half of the game. Just look at one example, how nearly invisible this switch is.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885553783The nodes won't save you every time though. Just look at this perfectly ordinary wallhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885004076You can't even see the climbable pegs unless you stand immediately next to ithttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885004216How about this ordinary looking destructable wall?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885556949Those images aren't optional little Easter egg secrets. They obscure fundamental items you NEED to clear the game. Those three instances are just the tip of the iceberg, you'll run into issues like that constantly.The difficulty is one last problem I have with the game. Normal mode is far too easy and you can't switch to harder difficulties midgame. Other than instant kill pits, you won't die even once. Even when you do kick the bucket, the game showers you with extra lives. If they didn't cap at nine I would no doubt have had over 20.Finally I'd like to also mention that the musical score here is underwhelming, especially compared to the legendary soundtrack in the original. I recommend turning the music here to zero and loading up the OST of the original game on YouTube, running it in the background while you slay and explore.Turok 2 lasted me about 14 hours, double the time I spent in the prequel--not because there's more content here but because most of my time was spent in frustrated backtracking. This game certainly isn't for newcomers.Despite how heavily I harped on this game's flaws and it's penchant for obfuscation, I'm still giving this game a recommendation. I can fire a flying homing drill that latches onto a dinosaurs head, blood spewing from his skull like a fountain. He shrieks, collapses on the ground, wretches blood, vomits, and dies. The violence in this game is brutal and oh so satisfying. It loses out on its original theme of dinosaurs but adds to it a plethora of targets for you to shred to pieces in wholesome, oldschool carnage.If you ever get frustrated at how much a contemporary video game holds your hand, just load up Turok 2."

,Recommended,405830,30673523,Posted: 22 March,all,漢 a.k.a GAMI,"(Note that I'm not a native English speaker, so you might find some grammar mistakes in my review.)Turok 2: Seeds of Evil... the original black version of the game is still in my N64 console. Playing this remaster reminds me of my beautiful childhood memories.. When I could barely even finish the first level because I spent hours of playtime running around and finding the objectives; I can exactly remember being in the 2nd level for ages and not getting any further; ..Having my friends coming over and play TDM together with 4 people on 1 console.. I will never forget these goldy times ; )But let's move on! Playing this on the N64 and on PC are two whole different dimensions. While playing something with great graphics like this on the N64 felt already great even though you were having like 15-20fps, playing this with completely refreshed textures on a stable framerate now feels freakin' badass!And that's what I desired! I played the remaster on Hard, killed all bosses and found all required Items.The following Pros & Cons are based on the remaster AND the game itself. This is just my own opinion about the game!Pros:++ Great looking graphics for a 1998 game++ Much better port than the original PC port, which was clumsy af and had a really bad hit detection.+ Looks beautiful with maxed out settings+ Steam Achievements+ Adjustable FOV (finally no more tunnel vision..)+ You can now save your Progress at any time of the game!+ a HUGE weapon arsenal with unique weapons such as the Cerebral Bore ;)+ 6 different Levels, each with its own prehistory+ Suitable for each player --> Difficulties from Easy up to Hardcore, where the game gets a real surviving challenge!+ Intelligent AI for its time: Moving around corners, hiding behind obstracles & objectives, running panicly away when locked on by weapons such as the C.B. :'D . ( and hey! You can even make these dinosaurs fight against each other if done right ;)+ You can now see markers on keys and activatables if you're near them, which results in missing less objectives when playing through the game (This can be deactivated in the options though)+ Explorers get rewarded! You will often find secret passages or destroyable walls with spicy loot.+ Multiplayer feels like the one on the N64, just with the original weapons and more levels+ Brings back childhood memories++ Hard working developers, who put their heart into this game ♥Cons:- The game can be pretty confusing if it's your first playthrough. Sometimes you have to run all the way back because you missed a key or a switch to activate.(Markers made this much easier now though)(^Some levels can be like a labyrinth, with parts where you have no clue where to go next anymore, resulting in running through the whole level again and looking for missed things.)- Sometimes, enemies can die in 1 shot, but can also take way more shots even if u hit the exact same spot- Some enemies will respawn after you used a warp portal.- You can run out of ammo really fast at the first levels(except you play on easy, where you have doubled magazines<<)- The Multiplayer can get really laggy if you're playing with more than 3 people from different regions.~ (The game is missing the old Multiplayer mod, which was way more competetive and skill reliant than the current one.)Despite the cons, I think it's a great and worth game at all.Pretty much a must-have for any fan of the series. Huge Levels with actual objectives and additional weapons is what the game makes a good addition to the first Turok.20 bucks is quite a lot for such an old game, but I think this time the price is justified. (and hey, if this bugs you, you can still wait for upcoming sales :^)I enjoyed my playthrough and I will do a second one on Hardcore soon.Oi, and If you made it to this point, I really appreciate it that you've read my brief review :) Thank you!#Bewareoblivionisathand ;)"

,Recommended,405830,30647955,Posted: 21 March,all,ThatDarnOwl,"When I was very young I would visit someone's house every single day after school to play on his n64. He had a bunch of games that I still remember to this day, like Star Wars Episode One Racer, Goldeneye and many others.But none of those games mattered to me as much as Turok 2. The game was insatiable to me. The graphics were crisp, portraying these worlds the game conveyed with such stunning detail. The way parts of enemies would blow off upon firing with the shotgun was tantalizing. The game wowed me so much that I would keep coming back, day after day, just to see it some more.Something like 14 years later I have since beaten Turok 2 a few times, and every single time I'm still stunned by the work that went into this game. Especially in comparison to the original. Turok 2's worlds are massive, portraying locations like a large medieval city, industrial locations, a large underground cavern system amidst lava spires, and even abstract locations like floating platforms suspended in space. Your weapons start out fairly mundane: a bow and arrow, a pistol, a shotgun. But eventually become fantastical, like the razor wind; a rotating serrated disk that fires like a boomerang. Or the Cerebral bore, a gun that fires a probe that drills into an enemy's head and detonates.More than that Turok 2 is just what I think of when I think of a first person shooter. Its storyline is just... there, something to get you into the action of killing monsters. But it feels like the developers chose to focus on making a really fun and unique balls to the wall action game on the N64. It's an overly ambitious game, and nowadays it feels rare to play a game where you just feel like you're having fun like a kid again.https://youtu.be/xKyhMCXcWtA"

I played with it at first withNintendo64, after that withPC, and now withSteam, and I liked again going through those six different worlds! 🤗👍Although, there is not much story, soTurok 2rather a game with a little story. Therefore, there could be a few questions which will never be answered. 🙁 For example;Where Turok came from? He just jumped out from a portal.Did he wanted to come or he was brought to there?Why he is so special?Did those five different worlds were united or they just collaborate against a common foe?But, I did not missed much these unanswered questions.For me, the strongest points of the atmosphere were two things:A simple Indian against the high technology and mystic enemies.Six almost completely different worlds!To me, these combinations were really fantastic. 😯👍I recommend it to how likes:retro-looking games(or do not dislike it).experiencing the atmosphere of different worlds in a game.science-faction and mystic atmosphere.games which have little story.(or do not mind it)Achievements:PyromaniacSet 50 enemies on fire with the flamethrower in a single player game.⚠️ I learnt that it does not count when I killed enemies which instantly died from it. For example; spiders and worms. But, as I started to burn bigger enemies, after a while it unlocked. So, I think it works, just keep in mind this. 👌I AM TUROK!Complete the single-player game on Hardcore difficulty.⚠️ The“Hardcore”difficulty means that you have only one life, and the enemies cause high damage on you. It could be really annoying, despite the re-spawning supplies, but if you have patience enough and you practice a bit to learn where you expect the enemies from, it is possible to beat it.Useful quide:I remember how much annoyed me that when I did not find a mission objective, key, feather or its portal and the hopeless adventures again and again to find them, because without just one of them, it is impossible to finish the game❗So, I believe this guide is clear enough to help you and avoid this inconvenience. 🤓http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=900588575"
,Recommended,405830,30618345,Posted: 19 March,all,coolRONz,"WOW! I love this game! Yeah ok the graphics are kind of meh.... But the lighting and controls, just fluid play of the game rocks so hard. Ran on my ultrawide display out of the box, huge plus in my books. I am a casual gamer and as such with tunnels and mazes I get turned around easily, but this game has all kinds of helpful hints to help me find my way. Yes sure you can turn those off, but then I would most likely get confused, frusterated and never play the game again. This game caters to both kinds of gamers, hardcore and casual players alike. The keyboard/mouse controls work flawlessly for me, but so does the controller too, but I'm not good with FPS and a controller to be honest, feels wrong to me. But the fact both work so well is a huge pluss to me. And although the graphics and textures feel very dated to me, the lighting, wow they did a fine job of just being able so see everything clearly, so its sort of a classic take graphically but still looks good. Sorry, its a hard one to explain. The game itself is very well put together, good levels with a nice variety, very quick and smooth game play. Although there are tons of graphics settings in game, I feel they could pretty much max it out and it still would run fine on a potatoe. Also default settings are quite low, so first thing you'll need to do is go into the settings and turn everything way up. Sadly though its capped at 60fps, its definitely an improvement from yesteryear, but it would have been nice to sync with my display, the game itself sees my higher refresh but just doesnt give me anything more. But I am just knitpicking.. Its a great way to travel back to 1998!"

Not only that i've emulated it on the pc and this remake. This remake is something. The lighting is better, the textures are better, weapons look better, not only that but it's easier to find things with the little markers now. I'm finding stuff I didn't even notice previously.Also some of the maps are altered and improved with new things. There's also a new animation to grip onto a platform when jumping which is useful. On top of that the health now goes past 200 and you can save any time you want. I've only played the early part of the first level but i'm not dissapointed what so ever. I'm utterly impressed and happy I got the game.I bought it on sale and the nosataglia trip is amazing. Even the character models look better, more rounded and less blocky. They're not perfect but that's the good part of the game. It's nostalgic, it's a trip down memory lane and I love it. I highly reccomend this game and getting it on sale if you can. If you loved the original you'll fall in love with this one. I can only hope they port the 3rd one, Rage wars, and Evoloution next. I truely hope they do.Also I'd like to point out the new lighting system is NICE.Edit: I'd also like to point out the control system is completely revamped as well. I suggest using a controller for that good classic feeling. It's extremely comfortable."

,Recommended,405830,31090517,Posted: 11 April,all,Aythadis,"Warning, this game holds a lot of Nostalgia for me, as this was one of my most played game on my N64 back in the day, next to the first game, Turok. I still own my copies and they still work.Turok was, in my mind, one of the BEST FPS games on the N64. Some would argue that 007 Goldeneye and Perfect Dark were better, but Turok was basically the QUAKE/DOOM of the N64. The quickness and speed to it and the feel of the weapons made it more fun to me than the others.This game, I can't really understand why I loved this game so much. Yes there are more weapons and way more fun/interesting (looking at you cerebral bore!) and the enemies and the ai they had were MUCH better and harder to fight... But yet I remember Turok 1 way more and enjoy it way more than this one and actually prefer to play Turok 1 over this game. I think my main issue is the push for a ""story"" and ""cutscenes"" and just how I didn't find any levels ""memorable"" Just about everything from the first game I can remember to almost to a Tee and know where everything is, and can play it over and over and over and never get tired. This game I just can't seem to pull myself through it, even after all these years... Maybe it's just me though.My first MAJOR issue with this game though, is the performance. Turok 1 I can run it 60FPS or 120FPS through the entire game since day 1 (and while recording, even with mods.) This game I can't even keep it over 20FPS most of the time, even with the settings down low. Even when I tried to record this, I slowly started to lose 1 frame every 10 seconds, till the game ran at 0FPS. Even after 2 updates, this game still runs like♥♥♥♥♥ I currently can't even complete the game for how bad it runs. I've even deleted the game and re-downloaded it in hopes it would be better, it didn't help. I've looked around on the forums and tried various things to try help it, and did managed to get the game up to 30FPS sometimes.The other problem (though minor) was with the updates, they ruined my save files, so I've had to restart the game 3 times. Hence why I've gotten pretty much no achievements. I've played with cheats so I can just jump ahead and have fun with all the great weapons.FOV settings for this game is just insane. It starts at 45 (original N64 FOV) to a stupid 179.00!! As in, impossible to play at. Why is that even an option?!They brought back the MP, but I never played it, as my internet is utter sh*t and I have terrible ping. I never played the MP anyways back on the N64 because I didn't have friends.So sadly, I hope they can figure out what is causing these performance problems, so that I can come back and attempt to play this game again. Until this game is fixed, I recommend getting the first game, as it works flawlessly... Or wait till they add in Workshop support like they did with the first game, so the fans can fix the game.Pros:- Same great game that I grew up on- Fast paced Gunplay- Great enemies and AI- Both N64 & PC Soundtracks- Old cheat codes still work (disable achievements)BewareObliviationIsAtHand- Working Multiplayer- Improved Options/Controls fit for PC gamers- AchievementsCons:- Poor performance.- Some may not like the old look- I never liked the ""story""- No Steam Cards- A little expensive- No Editor/Workshop support (yet)"

Turok 2 is in my opinion one of the best First Person Shooters of the late 1990's, it was well built for the time and the updates Nightdive Studios (whom are slowly becoming my new favorite game company) made to the game such as ledge grapple; auto jump out of water, slightly redesigned gameplay capable for modern gamepads; with the speed additions to make for much more intriguing gameplay really is the icing on the cake, just the little tweaks they made to an already magnificent title truly shows that Nightdive Studios knows how to Remaster Games.

Everything is untouched minus the fog. The game even runs @ 60 FPS steadily for the most part. The original Turok 2 was always infamous for how super laggy it was, but this version is the definitive Turok 2 experience. It's still as hard as balls though. I recommend playing it on Hard on your first playthrough, otherwise it's too easy on Normal. All due to the Mouse & Keyboard being obviously superior to the N64 controller.The only major downside thus far is the newly, reintroduced Multiplayer online portion of Turok 2, which I currently don't recommend you touch, but Nightdive Studios are working on fixing the huge ping/latency/lagginess it currently has. It's super unplayable and not fun at all."

This game has always held a special place for me and is one of the big ones that kickstarted a lifetime of gaming.In its heyday this game was a cut above the rest. The weapons were so detailed with many moving parts, and the imagination in their design makes each one so memorable. The way the enemies explode into entrails when you hit them with a Scorpion Missile, or how their arms and heads blow off when your Tek Arrows find their mark, and not least of all the unforgettable Cerebral Bore kills; the attention to detail in the models and their animations was just so far ahead of the other N64 games of the era.The level design is still so intricate and varied with many secret paths that can be easily overlooked. Even having played the game over and over in my youth I still found this game so difficult to beat (I dont remember the levels being so damn long)!As with Turok 1, Night Dive have done a great job remastering this game. It would have been nice if they had added a few more animations and a bit of pizzazz, but they have stayed true to the source material which is always a safe move. One thing I did notice was that on hardcore the era-appropriate difficulty spikes are really very frustrating, even more so than Turok 1 (which was quite easy on the hardest difficulty). But maybe modern gaming has softened me up.Still, this remaster has brought back many fond memories and it has stayed true to the original game.I had a great time!bewareoblivionisathand"

Because the last time when I tried to play the original Turok 2 a year or so ago, it was crashing constantly.Remastered version works on dx10 and has lots of new graphical options. I do not care about graphics all that much, but Turok 2 is an old game and frankly, kinda ugly. So new effects, as well as full HD and 125% resolution scale, help a bit.It also has many gameplay settings. Including different toggleable head bobbing options. So if you don't like how camera in the original game constantly sways left and right, now you can turn that off.I personally like the addition of ""!"" marks on the objectives (you can turn it off if you want) - less wandering around aimlessly trying to remember where to go now.All in all this is a great port and a great game! Would recommend!"
,Recommended,405830,30580180,Posted: 17 March,all,Moss,"Quick note: Performance... hasn't been great on my system.  I'm looking mostly at 30-ish FPS with no settings having a massive impact.  After turning off Ambient Occlusion and VSync, multiplayer was at a solid 62 FPS, but singleplayer can't hold 60 without dropping the resolution scale to pitiful levels, and even then, it drops occasionally.  Thankfully, I'm the odd one out here and many others are talking about how well it generally runs, so I'll shut up about this for now.  Hopefully a few early patches get things sorted out.One Disclaimer before moving on, I didn't pay full price for this.  It was $5 off for launch week and another 25% off for owning Turok 1 HD, so in the end, it put me back $11.24.  Thanks, Night Dive!~~Turok 2 is generally held in high regard, despite the fact that many people will recognize the name without having ever played it themselves.  ""Oh yeah, it was that awesome N64 game with the dinosaurs... WAIT, IT WAS A KEY COLLECTING GAME?  WHY DOES IT RUN SO BADLY?""  Turok just kind of sits in this odd place after nostalgia ran its course, like System Shock and Thief it influenced so much yet is recognized by so few.  Thankfully, Night Dive set out to fix that, and did so with... almost... flying colors, considering a few issues I've run into.The game as a whole mixes keyfinding from the first game with a Goldeneye style objective system that progressively adds more on with harder difficulties.  It's also a game where you have to watch your surroundings, as even the first room can stump you if you don't watch for a lever, a tunnel, a secret, an explosive barrel, SOMETHING that'll open up new opportunities.  Generous hitboxes, revamped climbing, and complex level design make platforming just as important as shooting, and you're expected to fully explore each level to the best of your ability to win in the end.Unlike Turok 1, this game actually has a bit of a story going for it, complete with in-engine cutscenes and objectives that match the current plot.  Combined with the vastly improved visuals (compared to 1), the overall animation quality, the new aesthetic of each stage, and the general feeling of the maps, every aspect of Turok 2 feels like a huge step up from the previous game and retains all the things that made it special while also tweaking the formula in a few new ways.  This may be only a first impression, but overall from the general sound of it, what I've played so far is the WEAKER part of the game and only getting better from here on out.So, really, all I can say is ""go for it.""  $15 is a pretty good price for a classic shooter entirely revamped, now in proper 1080p60 with a crapload of visual effects thrown on top.  There are some minor aesthetic changes I'm not a fan of, but overall it's still the same Turok that pushed N64 Expansion Paks by the crapload and made your friend with the Playstation 1 insanely jealous.I wish I had the same glowing remarks for multiplayer, but so far it hasn't been a great time.  The game modes itself are intact and it feels great, you can even bring local players online, but the few servers that were up had extremely high pings with a terrible amount of delay and rubberbanding to everything.  Keep it sub-100 ping or you're in for a true garbage fire... or just play Local/LAN, which is 100% intact and leaves me with very little to complain about.So... yeah.  It's still Turok 2.  You'll have a blast with this game if you're even slightly familiar with either late 90s FPS's or Crash Bandicoot-esque platformers, but keep in mind that you'll need to get a 6 GB Expansion Pak for your Keyboard if you want to play in 4K."
,Recommended,405830,30744277,Posted: 25 March,all,J o n e x,"This game is a near perfect remaster, as expected from Night Dive. Nostalgia plays a large role in my recommendation of this game, but there are many reasons to buy it even if you never played the eighteen year old original game.Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was one of the first narrative driven FPS games ever released. Although more basic in terms of story compared with modern games, it still has a certain charm, worthy of your 8-10 hours to finish the game. The levels are very large, and teeming with secret areas, and alternate paths. Enemy variety is also decent, with each level introducing new ones, and a new environment to which they belong. Weapon diversity is also worth noting, as there are over 20 of them. They sound great, shoot great, and provide many different options for how you can play. New graphical options have been added, and gameplay feels more solid than the original. Make no mistake, this is the best version of Turok 2 currently available.Despite everything I like about this remaster, it still has issues. The first being the hit registration. Whether this is a flaw with the remaster, or an existing issue with the original game, I’m not sure. But I certainly don’t remember having such a hard time being able to shoot enemies. The hitboxes are very small, and what I assumed would kill them (or at least injure them) actually does very little, if not no damage. For example, I can headshot an enemy with one bullet, or waste 20 bullets before finally bringing them down. I was playing on Hardcore, but none the less this gap is too big. I regularly found myself saving after killing every enemy, as I didn’t know whether I would end up wasting my ammo on the next.The next issues are the boss battles. Aside from being some of the best examples of poor hit registration, sometimes the health of the boss would refill if you save during the fight and reload it. Personally I encountered a major glitch during the final boss in which he gets stuck in the ceiling and wouldn’t get hurt. Forcing me to reload a much earlier save before the battle.Turok 2 is a great game, and Night Dive have definitely made a successful effort with this remaster. If you can play on an easier difficulty, I’m sure you wouldn’t have the issues I had, but none the less, be prepared to face them if you choose hardcore mode."

This remaster means business, not only does the game now run on Windows 10 (yay!) it also looks and performs leagues above its past iterations. I really can't believe just how fluid and fast the gameplay is, back on the N64 the game had a slow pace with frequent slowdowns and a very narrow FOV. On the remaster you can crank the draw distance, open up your peripheral vision and zoom around at 60fps, and the game runs like butter. Honestly it plays somewhat like DOOM 2016 in that I run and dance around enemies a lot more now than I did on the N64. I definitely recommend this remaster for fans of the original, and anyone interested in what all the hype is about.

Supporting the efforts of Night Dive Studios benefits everyone.I personally feel that Turok 2 is worth the price.Gameplay has a good pace, and (for those new to Turok 2) you can get a couple new weapons to amp up the carnage by going straight to level 3 after Level 1.It's nice to have the upgraded resolution and extras-""god rays""/scatter, etc. I'm not saying that this looks or has AI like Crysis or anything, just that it's better than the original and that's what you're getting.I appreciate the new additions like the level warp checkpoint sytem using the old ""Save Totems"", the PC-style quicksave/load, and the tasteful and tastefully sparse level map tweaks are an essential element to cap off this remaster as well as the previous one. The work Night Dive has done, yet agian, breathes new life into what some may consider a classic.*****************************************That being said, much like a previous review, I too have had an issue with ""teal"" colored lighting dominating the textures.Sometimes it can go away when I look down, though mostly it just stays there since about halfway through Level 1.I'm on level 3, still there.I've also noticed the flshlight and flare gun don't seem to work.I've tried different graphics options to no avail.I hope this is fixable either on my end (drivers/new GPU/cmd line) or through a patch (1.5.2? :)May this feedback be of good use.***************************************Other than that Turok 2 runs decent considering I'm using my nearly decade old signature gaming rig:Intel Xeon X3380 E0 @ 4.0GHz w/ Corsair H50, 1.42V8 GB GSkill Pi @ 1056 MHz CL5 5:4 Ratio, 2.15VDFI Lanparty  UT P35T2R @ 422FSB @ PL 6, 1.57V NBPlextor M6e Black Edition 256 GB=W7 64 Pro Boot DriveSeagate es.2 250GB/32MB 7200, WD VelociRaptor 80GB/16MBVisiontek Radeon HD4870 512MB @ 790/1000 w/Zalman VF1000Corsair AX860i w/ 12 Gauge 8 Ft.

The difference being I did play Turok back in the day but I hadn't played this one.  I was expecting more of the same.Happily this one feels like a massive improvement in every way.  The environments feel a lot better to explore.  The objectives make it feel like you're making progress, rather than just drifting through levels aimlessly.  Also there seems to be a lack of that irritating fog this time around, or at least the draw distance is so much better.The only thing is the movement still feels floaty and imprecise.  Combined with the framerate it actually starts to make me feel ill after playing it for a while, but then I actually have that issue with a few other fps style games with a similar movement feel.  (I can't play Wolfenstein 3D for more than a few minutes on a modern machine before feeling sick all day)Overall though, I heartily recommend this one.  So much better than its predecessor.

76561198109175148,Recommended,405830,31089226,Posted: 11 April,all,jaymet,"This is an amazing port of a very good N64 first-person shooter that was historically hampered by the console hardware it was designed for. There's an older PC port of the game that attempted to bring it to a wider audience, but it was pretty much garbage, and the game lay mostly forgotten as a result. This port from publisher Nightdive Studios not only resurrects this fine shooter, but also improves on it in every way, from graphics to audio to controls and even new (albeit minor) quality-of-life features.The game itself holds up very well. It is a first-person shooter originally released in 1998, and was an early adopter of ""realistic"" gore modeling, where you could blow off heads, limbs, and even drill out brains with a nasty little weapon that harkens back to the 80's cult horror film Phantasm. Speaking of weapons, Turok 2 is full of them, from the aforementioned Cerebral Bore, to a bow that shoots explosive arrows, lock-on missile launchers, a Predator-style razor disc that returns when thrown, and even your own little personal room-clearing nuke. You'll be needing them too, as the game can be brutally hard, and enemies tend to be fast and aggressive, although sometimes you'll see enemy NPCs with more defensive scripts such as hiding behind cover.  There are also massive bosses to contend with, and you'll need to throw everything AND the kitchen sink at their hideous faces if you're going to win.One aspect of the game that can be seen as either positive, negative, or both is the map design. There are only six levels in Turok 2, and they are MASSIVE. They are also twisting mazes featuring multiple objectives with minimal handholding. Nightdive Studios have added optional UI trackers that help keep tabs on your mission objectives, and you've got an auto-map that fills out as you explore, but you're still going to get lost in this game. It's just inevitable. Finding all the mission objectives and secret areas can be freakishly tough as a result, and use of a walkthrough will almost assuredly be needed to 100% clear this daunting game.Music is decent, but gets repetitive. Sound effects are ok. As I mentioned earlier, this game was originally developed for the N64, and they had to squeeze everything on to a cartdrige. Audio took a hit as a result, and voices and sound effects were not on par with CD-based games of the time. That being said, Nightdive has still improved on the mixing, and everything sounds much cleaner and crisper than it did in the original. Still, this would be the weakest aspect of the game (and possibly the dated visuals, but those personally don't bother me, and the game looks better than it ever has with the all the enhancements Nightdive have made).My final verdict is: this is an absolute must-buy. Turok 2 rocks, it's one of the great classic FPS games of all time, this port is amazing and can run well on most any rig, and to seal the deal you have the return of one of the greatest bloody multiplayer modes in FPS history. So sit back, relax, and prepare to get wrecked in an uncompromisingly brutal nostalgia trip which will have you hunting all the dinosaurs, aliens, arachnids, and other assorted dimensional trash who dare to pit  themselves against one of the mightiest warriors to ever prowl a circuit board. By the end of this game, you too will be exalting over the bodies of your slain enemies, war-bow in hand as you proudly cry, ""I AM TUROK!""TL;DR: 10/10, would Turok again."

Especially the N64 if to choose one version.For this mastered version.....I LOVE IT.Definitely amazed with all of those new options I get to experience with this remastered Turok. Quick Warps, Alt. Weapon Bobbing choices, Icon hints to guide us, controlling the fog, and changing music from N64 to PC anytime. I especially felt that the quick-save and quick-load options is the best part. Simplifies everything.Everything I see within this Remastered version is all good.But there is one downside I like to note.....PC Music.There are parts of most music tracks we hear only in the N64 version, the PC version lacked. And it was like that in the USA release of Turok 2 for PC back in 1998, but not the Japanese version. Which happens to be called ""Violence Killer: Turok New Generation"".I found the music album of ""Violence Killer: Turok New Generation"", which plays the FULL tracks of the PC version, including the part of each music you hear only in the N64 version. The Death Marshes would be my biggest example. Listen to the first 1 minute of the 3rd level's music from N64, and you won't hear that on USA's PC; but the japanese version will play that part.Perhaps the music can be helped with another update for this Turok 2 Remastered. It's worth helping Night Dive Studios.My special thanks to Night Dive Studios for the re-release of Turok 2 as well as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Enjoyed them both.And I'm hoping that Turok 3 Remaster would be re-released for Steam and GOG. It may have never been released on PC before, but I believe that anything is possible. And for those that don't believe Turok 3 remaster is possible (I call them the Blind Ones); Take a look at Doom 64 and Doom 64 EX."

Take note, other developers out there: THIS is how you do justice to a classic game that so desperately needed a modern revival!Playing this beast of a game on a steady 60 FPS (even during that Styracosaurus part which used to give me headaches as a kid because of the tremendously low FPS) alone is enough to warrant me buying this game the minute it went Gold, but man...the options menu in this game is truly remarkable. Night Dive Studios spared no expense bringing this game back from the proverbial dead, that's for sure!If you played this game back in the olden days (either version) and you're a bit on the fence about buying this remaster because you have any doubts of how well it performs...lemme tell you right now...you look that fence square in its beady little eyes, give it the finger, and tell it to go fornicate itself, and then promptly buy this game. If you own the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter on Steam, you will get a 25% coupon for this game (the game is on sale right now anyway, at $14.99...when I went to buy the game, the total went from $19.99 to $11.24, and well worth EVERY hard-earned penny of me money!).Gone are the headache-inducing overly foggy skies and terribad draw distances, and here are the days of crystal clear, late-90's textures and, oh, did I mention the 60 FPS? I did? Great...but, for real brahs and brahettes...freakin' 60 FPS.Bottom line...buy this remaster, especially if you are in any way familiar with this title. Well worth the asking price! Considering the original Turok was $20 (and still is, I believe), I was fully expecting this game to be more than that, but nope! Night Dive comes through again!Now, there are a couple minor niggling drawbacks that I can think of, in terms of glitches/bugs, but these will more than likely be patched very soon, given NDS' track record with remasters such as this: For example, In the Death Marshes (Level 3), if you reenter an Armory after blowing it up (regardless of how long you wait, it seems), you will instantly be killed by the exploding boxes around the warp...guess the things are self-aware and don't blow up unless Joshua himself sees them explode!And honestly, at least up until now, I haven't run across any other glitches! That is not to say, of course, that that is the way it is for everyone. I'm sure others do exist.*breathes deeply* Now that I'm done gushing over this game, here are the specs I'm playing it on:CPU: AMD Athlon X4 760K Quad-CoreMB:  MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 (that's quite a mouthful isn't it?)GPU: ASUS NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR3 (16 GB)"

I bought Turok 2 for the n64 when it first came out - even then I was a pc hardware fanatic and I found the framerate - even with the expansion pack unplayable. The pc port was also pretty crappy.So I am pretty much playing it for the first time and I love it. Turok 2 has some of the best weapons available (can someone say cerebral bore??) on any fps even by today's standards.Being I couldn't get through it on the n64 or the pc port I am playing this for the first time. I am glad I waited..It took almost 2 decades (God I'm old) but it's here and I'm having a blast. Absolutely the best 15 bucks I've ever spent on a game ever.If you are a fan of old school shooters you must get Turok 2.

76561197979961681,Recommended,405830,30573214,Posted: 17 March,all,HexeR,"Everything that was great about the N64 release is all right here for us to enjoy once more, while everything bad about the N64 release (the low framerates, the controls due to the N64 controller, and the more limited graphical features) have all been removed and improved.This is the definitive Turok 2 experience, much of which still holds up extraordinarily well, as I found myself playing it for hours on end when it released, encaptured just as much as when I played it originally back in 1998.The animations still hold up exceedingly well and give many triple A games a run for their money as you see dinosoids flung across rooms, flop and twitch violently in their death throes, and leap at you menacingly.  The levels are still as huge as ever, surpassing the test of time in which you will still find yourself lost from time to time (which may seem like a bad thing at first, until you realize there's a quick-travel[warp] system in the game, as well as a conventional map), which is a huge break from the tightly scripted corridor shooters of the modern era.  Even Doom 2016, a game I vastly enjoyed, fails to truly recall the depth of exploration and roaming of 90's era FPS's, while in Turok 2 it remains still perfectly encapsulated.  You'll find out just how much you missed discovering where to go on your own.The gameplay is polished to a fine sheen as the hit boxes and aiming is precise as ever, with some nice little effects sprinkled ontop.  The feedback from hitting and killing enemies is as good as it gets, where they shriek from being winged in the shoulder, grabbing their arm briefly, to snarling and crumpling to the ground after a well-placed headshot.  The spectacularly gorey deaths aren't just icing either, but rather lends itself to the over-the-top sci-fi prehistoric fantasy setting of the game, where you have a Native American cross-dimensional guardian weilding triple-rocket launchers fighting genetically modified dinosaur soldiers with wrist blasters that can turn invisible.  Yea, it's as crazy as it sounds, and even more enjoyable.The story is much more developed than Turok 1, where you're given actual cutscenes and introductions before each level giving you a basic rundown on the enemies you'll be facing and some lore, along with your objectives.  With your objectives, you'll need to find keys to unlock the final boss, parts of the nuke weapon, and feathers to upgrade your character, giving you a reason to revisit previous levels so you can access areas you couldn't before.Turok 2 is still the benchmark for what a sequel should be in every sense of the word in the FPS genre.  It doubled the weapon count, has levels 2 to 3 times as big as the previous games, has unique enemies for each world, easily tripling the enemy count from Turok 1, boasts a very impressively orchestrated soundtrack, has an expanded story, and ontop of it all has a multiplayer mode.  One wonders how they even managed to fit it all on an N64 cartridge to begin with.I can't even begin to go into all the features they added, such as bloom, screenspace ambient occlusion, deferred lighting, extended draw distance, alternate weapon bobbing, FOV slider, both PC and N64 soundtracks, and the list goes on.  If you thought Turok 1 on Steam was lacking, then this should go above and beyond your expectations."

Or simply because you weren't born yet. Pick this up, if nothing else to support studios like Nightdive.Those who have played it will feel right at home, between the visual enhancements, 64bit support due to the Kex Engine, FOV slider, and the slight tweaks to the gameplay. The look and feel have been kept intact. Right down to the compressed N64 soundtrack, though you can opt to use the original PC port OST.The only complaint I have is that there isn't the ability to play MP Coop like you could on the N64 at the time of writing this.I can't stress it enough, even if you don't play it that much pick this up and support Nightdive.

Turok 1's main objective was to find level keys just so you could continue. Turok 2 on the other hand keeps the level keys, but also gives you numerous objectives per level to complete. As an example, the first map in this game, The Port of Adia, tasks you with saving 4 children and activating 3 distress beacons. The overall MAIN objective of each level however, is finding and protecting an energy totem from Oblivion's forces. These totem challenges will test your mettle by the end of the game, with absolute swarms attacking it as soon as you warp into the totem challenge.Guns GALORE. Seriously man if you don't know what the Cerebral Bore is you are a ♥♥♥♥in' mongo. Ammo types! Explosive Arrows! A Nuke Launcher! Flamethrowers and Plasma Guns! Plenty of options for your carnage needs friend.The only issue everyone seems to point out with this game is map length. There aren't that many levels in the game, but Acclaim made up for that fact by nearly doubling the length of every map in the game. Turok 1 had some decent sized maps but Turok 2 turned that way up. Thankfully, unlike the first game, this remaster has the class save and load anywhere function, so you do not have to rely on checkpoints to save your progress.Turok 2 has and will forever be my favorite game made by Acclaim. I'm hoping that the sales of both Turok 1 and 2 drive nightdive to finish the series with Turok 3 and Turok: Evolution. This game is not for everybody, but if you can pace yourself, and really take in the enviroments, you'll find one hell of a top notch shooting experience in this game."

I played the first game and seeds of evil back in the day on N64; I would always rent the turok games from a now defunct video store.The game feels so much better with PC controls. The binding changes, and specific mouse input / sensitivity vs the original version with the N64 controller and analog stick; it had some awkward controls imo. Now it basically feels like im playing a proper 90's fps. My favorite part is being able to switch back and forth between the N64 music and the PC version music (I prefer the N64 music but its nice you can switch between them) Being able to change the Graphics, Video, and Audio balance is really nice as well as the new engine the game is running on, it looks better than ever and it runs better framerate wise (i remember the huge amounts of fog and fps lag on the N64 version)Im glad to see turok getting the attention it deserves, I personally feel its an underrated game series that deserved more attention, but i know its cherished by a longtime community.

,Recommended,405830,30561400,Posted: 16 March,all,Reikozunaken,"Turok 2 was one of my absolute favorite childhood games, and even still holds a place of high esteem in my books. I have to say that from the day Turok 1 was remastered, I was eagerly awaiting (and hoping) for Turok 2 to come out! I wanted to get a good idea of what to say in a review, so I made sure to complete the first level all the way through before posting. I forgot how long these levels are!I've heard some people complain about the convoluded, directionless levels presented in Turok, but I've always found that to be a staple in the series. There are way too many games that make levels by drawing a line, bending it a little, and telling you to walk down it. This game is about exploration and finding what you need to continue onward. Of course, if you don't like exploring levels, Nightdive Studios added a hints feature that's on by default which shows you objects of interest even through walls. I had to turn that off since I prefer the vanilla experience. They also added an edge climbing mechanic to make jumps easier if you just barely miss. I don't think you can turn that off.This is the same old Turok 2 with updated graphics. It's not going to look anything near what today's graphics usually look like, but it's much prettier than revving up the old N64. I'm still impressed with all of the monster's reactions to being shot, all of which are still in the game. They have a hardcore mode as well, which removes most - if not all - pickups and makes the enemies ridiculously hard to kill. I think I'll just stick with hard mode.The only downside I've found is that they have a separate music option for PC(CD) which sounds a whole lot better than the also included N64 tracks. It's a downside because the PC tracks are from the Turok 2 soundtrack which doesn't loop the songs properly. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I found the soundtrack and it cut out large chunks of the music because they figured it was too repetitive. The loop parts had such cool transitions that I would literally just stand in the levels to hear all the way through! Fortunately, the N64 audio option (on by default) plays the whole track like it should.I had a ton of fun playing through the first level again and I look forward to playing the rest as well. I definitely had more fun playing this today than I have on an FPS in a long time!"

No spring lock and responsive controls is definitely a plus. My problem with the original Turok 2's controls was that the aiming was much slower than Dinosaur Hunter. Sequels need to move forward not backwards. Also the addition of Online multiplayer is really awesome. The bad side is the crazy lag but it's still fun.

Like the remaster of Turok 1, this game has been flawlessly ported over to the new engine and the new controls/movement physics make it vastly superior to play over the N64 version and the original PC port.Its crazy that this game has a huge amount of settings to tinker around with (and in the console commands) that most modern AAA PC games don't even come close to having. Although most of the textures/models don't appear to have been modified, the new object based motion blur and other new visual enhancements really give them added pop. I'm sure a HD re-texture project will appear at somepoint. They even provided both PC and N64 soundtracks which is a nice added bonus.I remain hopeful that Nightdive Studios can port over Turok 3 Shadow of Oblivion and Rage Wars as long as the sources for those games still exist and are in good shape. With the high quality of both this and their Turok 1 port, it really shows the huge importance of preserving older games to make them work with the latest computers whilst enhancing the playability of them.I'd recommend this to anyone even if they haven't played the original game on N64 or the earlier PC port."

Incredibly satisfying remaster to a classic.  Quake with dinosaurs.Not sure if this can be uncapped through an ini file but hopefully 144 support soon!"
,Recommended,405830,30571305,Posted: 17 March,all,Anema86,"Note: A recent update also DRASTICALLY improved performance on AMD hardware. Framerate drops and generally poor performance were an issue prior to the 3/22 update. It now runs perfectly.I'm not familiar enough with the N64 version, or the original PC version, to be able to give a blow-by-blow comparison of this and the original, but I do recall that this was the best of the N64 Turok games, and one that I waited for eagerly when I saw it was being re-released.It's fun, but it really shows its age. The enormous, labyrinthine levels that were once its greatest strength are among its biggest problems now; there are only 7 or 8 levels in the entire game, but they are long as♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Why is that a problem?"" you may be wondering. Well, it's primarily a problem because fewer than a dozen objectives are scattered across these gigantic stages that take 2 or 3 hours to complete. So if you happen to miss a prisoner or child or distress beacon, good freaking luck backtracking through these enormous stages to find one small alcove that you accidentally missed initially.There are, of course, changes to the UI meant to make this less likely to happen: objectives show up on the UI with a clear symbol, but so do switches and a lot of destructible objects. In more complex areas where four switches have to be pulled to open the passage to a new area, it's particularly not helpful. This highlights another problem: the stages are enormous, but, just as with Hyrule Field in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, they're big for the sake of being big, with arbitrary and tedious switches hidden behind walls that have to be opened one by one until the way forward is finally opened. Flip a switch, it opens a wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, it opens a different wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, it opens another wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, and the way forward is finally open.This happens repeatedly throughout each of the tediously long stages. The first stage, for example, has a mere 7 objectives, but my entire playtime so far has been spent in that level, with about fifteen minutes coming from level 3. I've beaten level 1 a number of times on the N64 version, but still missed two children this time around, so I had some idea of what I was doing, and the stage still took about 2 hours.Take Goldeneye's opening Dam level, for example. Counting each individual alarm, there are 8 objectives that must be completed. The stage is 5 minutes long for a reasonably decent new player. That's very high density, and it means the player is nearly always making small steps toward progress. Contrasted to the 2 hour opening stage of Turok 2, where one objective is accomplished for every 15~ minutes of gameplay. This means most of your time is spent running around and shooting enemies. That's good, because it's fun to shoot things, and Turok 2's biggest strength is the variety of weapons and their destructive capabilities, but it doesn't fix what is fundamentally a sparse and uninteresting game.Turok: Dinosaur Hunter--incidentally, the first N64 game I ever owned--was sparse, too, but it didn't have objectives. Levels had clear, simple goals: get from A to B, and kill♥♥♥♥♥♥along the way. Exploring side paths was about finding goodies, not achieving mission objectives. Turok 2 attempts to merge some of the objective-based mission play of Goldeneye with the linear ""Kill♥♥♥♥♥♥and find the exit"" that Turok had borrowed from PC shooters, but it misses the mark because it results in so goddamned much backtracking through extremely long stages. You're not looking for a hidden alcove to get a new weapon that is optional, and moving forward if you get bored trying to find it. You're looking for a required mission objective that could be literally *anywhere* throughout the entire stage. The only clue you'll have is that objectives are rarely clustered together, so you can be reasonably sure that, if you just rescued a prisoner, you've got a few minutes' trek radius in each direction where there won't be another one.I've not tried the multiplayer. I can't imagine that the multiplayer in this game is as much fun as it used to be. Last Xmas, my family revisited Goldeneye, which my father, my uncle, my cousin, and I spent hundreds of hours playing against each other when we were all younger. It was definitely one of those things best left to memory, instead of digging it up and seeing its flaws in a brand new light. Again, without having tried it, I'm sure it suffers the same problems.I like Turok 2, and I'd certainly recommend it for people who played it when they were younger and want to revisit it. It's worth it, at least at the discounted $15 price. I'm not sure I'd be willing to put $20 on it. More needed to be done to modernize the gameplay, though. Shortly after entering the Death Marshes, I realized that I should have found some sort of armor to permanently increase my max health, or gained a few levels to increase my weapon damage, or anything along those lines, because that's what we expect from modern games. There's none of that here, and that's where its age really shows: the gameplay is incredibly archaic, and it happens across levels that are at least ten times longer than they should be.I've also gotten inexplicably stuck on walls in a few places, so there are some glitches and bugs that need to be worked out. No, I'm not going to report them, because I'm a paying customer, not a beta tester. Having to redo fifteen or twenty minutes of gameplay because you got stuck on a wall is annoying, and is literally the reason I'm writing this review instead of playing the freaking game.I like it. If you liked it back then, then chances are that you'll like it now.The music is better than I remember it being, too."

The original had some flaws that made the game pretty unplayable, all of that has been fixed in the remaster. The options menu is very user friendly, with options for FOV and resolution scaling, as well as some advanced graphics options like Ambient Occlusion. Which is fantastic to see on a game that was made 2 decades ago.If you played the original game and want to know if this game is worth the nostalgia, it is 100%. The remaster fixed all the bad things about the old game like horrible controls, hard to find objectives (which now have icons, this was an awesome idea), fog, and lack of saves. You can quicksave and even fast travel around the map using those checkpoints. It is well worth the 20 bucks. I would of paid 60 if I could play a demo and see how great it is beforehand.If you never played this game before, I still recommend it. It was a very underappreciated game at the time it was released and deserves the respect it has given with this remaster. The game has a bunch of badass weapons, all unique in some way, from a Shredder that shoots lead like a shotgun that bounces off walls, to a Cerebral Bore that drills a hole into the victims head and explodes, the weapons are probably the coolest part of the game IMHO. The levels are all unique and have a different set of cool enemies to fight. The controls make the game feel like a modern game, Nightdive did an amazing job with the port and seriously deserves the same respect game devs like CDPR get."

Fast paced action, lots of blood and gibs flying around, a vast amount of crazy weapons, and a varied cast of enemies and character keep everything so fresh. Nightdive Studios has done an absolutely amazing job of bringing this game into 2017. This game was meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard. The N64 controller doesn't even compare. Not to mention it's amazing being able to play the game above 15fps and at a modern resolution. There are so many little touches added to modernize the game a bit. The blur added to the character animations really brings the animation quality up a notch, even though it's just a simple touch. The improved lighting and sound also really enhance the experience. Quick note though, I recommend  playing this game on hard mode, normal is just a bit too easy, especially if you're a seasoned FPS player.

I have nostalgia for this game and as usual Nightdive does the port justice by provided increased resolution, options for N64 or PC music, fluid mouse control and framerate, plenty of options you'd expect from a modern AAA game, regular bug fixes/updates, and any time save states. This isn't a lazy port from a greedy developer - this is a passion project from a core PC gaming person/studio. I have nothing but praise for the port itself, and it meets it's asking price of $20 due to the effort put into it, despite the age of the game (it would be hard to find the original PC port without piracy).If you have nostalgia for the game and have already played a decent portion of it, then this is a no brainer. If you never played Turok 2, you have a shooter with some neat weapons, exciting combat, hunting for keys/switches, and occasional platforming (a lot less than Turok 1). - though I became irritated by Level 5.."

The graphics are much more fluid and vibrant with lots of extra touches, such as bodies that stick round after death and blood splatters that can cover power-ups and ammunition. Some functional differences are in here as well, like the ability to climb up to certain ledges leading to less death by falling, and how the game won't let you waste any extra life tokens once you've maxed out. Since you can save your game at any time, the save points have become interconnected warp portals to make travelling faster. It's still fun to play after all these years, and anyone who enjoyed the original Turok 2 will have a blast replaying it in this remastered edition!"

Turok 2 is much more labrynthine than the first game and the quest items and missions are much more difficult to achieve. The soundtrack, offered in N64 style or PC style, leaves much to be desired and really drowns out the poor voice acting (and I didn't see subtitle options anywhere).If you're not sure if you'd like Turok 2, skip it at full price. On sale, I say purchase it if you want a new experience or nostalgia."

76561197993945251,Recommended,405830,30561213,Posted: 16 March,all,Onwards to GA-KO!,"It's in my humble opinion that this game has aged like fine wine, and was made even better with new tweaks from developper Nightdive Studio's work, which includes markers to help you locate objectives. This fixes what is in mine and I'd bet most people's opinion to be Turok 2's greatest flaw, which was that Turok 2 did not give you enough information on how or where to find the objectives.The combat is as great as ever, even more so with a mouse and keyboard. The feeling of strafe shooting dinosaurs, blowing their ♥♥♥♥ing limbs or entire upper body off with a double barrel shotgun, seeing their last few seconds of life as they fall to the floor in pain writhing like worns is a satisfying now as it was back when you first played it on N64.If I had one complaint to give it would be that the lack of platforming has been retroactively made into a detractor. While I loathed Dinosaur Hunter's platforming on the N64, I did thoroughly enjoy it with the superior controls of mouse and keyboard. Turok 2 does have platforming mind you, but it's usually for secret areas or to collect resources such as health and ammo, most of it is none mandatory.AND MULTIPLAYER! GOD! Having played some it makes me sad that I didn't get to play it on this scale when I was a child. 16 player deathmatch is a joy! Tho people looking for balance need not apply, they shouldn't want to. It's too easy to abuse the Nuke weapon and become virtually unstoppable. And while I've had a mostly good experience, the game has connection issues.A great game, and a must play in my opinion."

Turok 1 is a fast and fun throwback with great level design, but its sequel slows things down and focuses more on combat in levels with very confusing layouts. This focus on shooting is a huge problem because killing monsters  in this game isn't very fun. The weapons are very weak despite sounding powerful, and almost every enemy is a huge bullet sponge unless you shoot them in the head. This doesn't really make the game hard or anything, (it's almost impossible to die on the normal difficulty) it's just very tedious. When the game was released one of the biggest selling points was all of the death animations and location based damage, that sort of thing doesn't hold up much at all. It definitely don't make up for the really repetitive soundtrack, boring level design, and nerfed movement.I had a lot of fond memories of both Turok games back in the day, I was happy that Turok 1 surpassed my nostalgia and was very fun as a modern game. It's too bad I can't really say the same about its sequel, this is a good remaster of a game that isn't really worth playing anymore."

Game for which i waited for so long, but then this game comes out and I see they went and changed the level layouts of turok 2. Like, what? how? WHY? Who does that? Its not Turok 2 remastered, its Turok 2 simplified. Its the Turok 2 simplified vision of the devs and that kills the game for me. The game overall feels easier aswell, like the tek bow does a lot more damage then it did in the original or should i say the tek bow always kills with one hit in this game unlike in Turok 2 (original, real turok 2 game) You actually had to shoot at enemy weak spot. Then there is the speed of the character? Its a small thing, but again, why? Whats going on with this remake, remaster or whatever it is or wants to be??? And one more thing that bugged me was when i have N64 music selected and the intro cutscene of ""flesh portal"" plays, it isn t using the n64 music instead it uses the pc versions music. Overall just so much that made turok 2 what it was, is gone here.And yes there are many positive things going on for this game aswell, but most of the 400 positive reviews talk about those things, so go and get that information from there. I just wanted to point out that this games level layots have been butchered and it isn t the Turok 2 old fans remember!So overall if You´re the kinda guy who thinks Turok 2 had overcomplicated levels and wanna play an easier version of the game, go for it, but if you want an authentic experience, You liked Turok 2 for what it was, this is not the game to buy"
,Not Recommended,405830,30862509,Posted: 31 March,all,Damuel,"This game suffers HEAVILY from rose tinted glasses syndrome. As someone who was massively excited for this and kept saying ""Man I wish this was Turok 2"" when playing the Turok 1 remaster, I strongly suggest people avoid buying this for little more than the nostalgia unless they can put up with infuriating level design.The level design is some of the worst I've EVER seen. Level 4 notably has moments that are pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t where paths diverge in opposite directions to waste your time. For example, there is a 10 minute maze you navigate upwards only to hit a locked door at the end. To the right of the locked door there is a floating platform you can jump down to, and to open the door you need to hit the switch on said platform. So you do that, and there's no way to get back to where you just were besides navigating the maze again.The map is useless, you'd be better off using wet toilet paper to navigate some of these areas. Not to mention it's nearly impossible without the hints turned on because items like keys and switches are hidden in dark corners behind objects.The ONE redeeming factor for the game is that the weapons are generally all fantastic. Lots of variety and some are badass. The enemy variety is pretty ok as well.Also the music is sometimes completely ♥♥♥♥ing awful. As Vinny (Vinesauce) put it, level 3 sounds like several trumpets farting into your ears. Sometimes it's great though the levels can be so drawn out even the great music can get tedious to hear on loop.On top of the level design being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the game can be insanely cheap at some points, I'm not sure if it's because AI was adjusted to make up for the fog removal, but countless times I'd round a corner or even start a level and instantly take damage by several enemies shooting me across the room the moment I'm within eyesight. There's also a bridge on level 4 (I'm not sure if this was on the n64 version) that you will fall through if you stand on the left half. Some of these bugs really should have been fixed.I do NOT suggest buying this unless you're willing to use a guide or just have serious nostalgia, I'd actually say in retrospect having played both remasters that Turok 1 was a superior game."

The Sniper mode on the Tek Bow stopped working with normal arrows for me.  I don't know why, I started my game up and suddenly whenever I went into sniper mode with Normal arrows, the animation would play for firing but no projectile would come out.  Nothing.  But it still took an arrow from my ammo total.2. Any time at all the game loses focus (so when I alt-tab or quit), it sends all three of my monitors into unfixable black screens.  Control Alt Delete doesn't work, alt-tabbing back doesn't work, nothing works except having to hard reset my computer.Otherwise, the game is phenomenal, a wonderfully made remaster, and other than these two issues, it runs smoother than a frictionless surface.  It also looks pretty damn good for an almost 20 year old game.  But these two issues I'm having are annoying enough to make me not want to recommend it."
,Not Recommended,405830,30804978,Posted: 28 March,all,TheJoker116,"Alright, not gonna criticize the quality of the remaster itself, it runs well and it's a competent enough remaster.The problem lies with the game itself or rather, its single-player campaing. I had quite a bit of nostalgia about playing Turok 2 multiplayer with my friends as a kid. I never got far in the single-player campaign until now but I cared more about playing with buddies.After 15 hours spent with this atrocity, I can safely say it washed away wwhatever nostalgia I had for it. Since nowadays playing with strangers online is all the rage (wars), I saw no reason to go multiplayer wiht this remaster, since I don't like online MP. I played up until Hive of the Mantids and ... it's atrocious. Despite the addition of markers on objectives and important items, it's still a confusing mess of hard-to-navigate levels filled with confuzing maze-like corridors and hidden passages. You'd think the ol' ""Follow monsters, find objectives"" technique would be enough but some of the main objectives feel like they should be optional hidden items instead.  It's almost impossible to finish a level in the first run, you're bound to get to the exit missing that one (or two) objective that was so well hidden, there's no way you could find it without a walkthrough.The levels are ridiculously confusing and the corridors look the same, there are few details to distinguish maps sections from one another, to a point even a walkthrough barely helps if you're not following it all the way from point A to point B. If at least those old textures looked at least a bit appealing ... but no, there's barely any diversity. Every area in a level will have the same textures, so not only are these mazes confusing but they're also boring to navigate, unless there are monsters to fight.The gunplay's pretty much the only thing positive I can find about this game, it might be why I played multiplayer so often. The weapons are all impressive and seriously, who could forget the Cerebral Bore? Killing monsters is a delight, whether with the Mag 60's three-round bursts, a few shotgun blasts or a hail of plasma from the Firestorm Cannon.Soooo .... I can't recommend this crap ... the multiplayer might be fun but the single-player portion is nothing but frustration and endless navigating. Better stick to good 90s shooters, like Doom, Quake and the Build Engine games."

Firstly the level design is ♥♥♥♥ing AWFUL and nearly impossible to navigate through without getting lost atleast 10 times, and it only gets worse as you progress to the later maps -- This being coupled with the fact that movement is so unbearably slow (especially in contrast to the first game) makes it a very boring, and even frustrating game to play through.Combat is also extremely unfulfilling as there's so many enemies on the screen half the time, usually in very enclosed spaces, that you sometimes aren't even able to judge whether you've killed them because it's just a cluster♥♥♥♥ of insignificant things with lots of health being thrown at you. This can only really be enjoyable in a more open area where you'd have more room to maneuver or utilize movement in a way that would actually be significant during a fight.Platforming is also extremely bad even with the added benefit of being able to grab onto ledges because not only is it such a small part of the game (unlike in the first game, where it was basically everywhere) but when it is involved the experience is either very un-enjoyably simple, or can be summed up entirely by you lagging off a rock into a pit of lava.The audio quality is pretty mediocre and forgettable, I found myself not even noticing the fact that there was background music in some areas so aside from menu music and a few sound effects being enjoyable there isn't really much to say about it.There's also a few glitches I've noticed.Hit detection is really bad especially on your initial shot onto almost any object for some reason, about 60% of the time it doesn't register at all and you end up wasting so much ammo because of this in the long run. I also had the earthquake screen effect on my character at one point where it lasted far longer than I can only assume it was supposed to, knocking me off a ledge and forcing me to redo the impossible task of navigating back from my checkpoint.I also experienced allot of problems with the frame rate as it kept randomly dropping bellow 30 FPS which really shouldn't be happening to a game that has such outdated graphics.In its current state, it's a complete waste of money and I'm past the time limit for refunding."

,Recommended,405830,30606150,Posted: 18 March,all,CanaMavrick,"The first FPS I've ever played is now on steam. Released in 1998, Turok 2 was a great shooter. It has huge, diverse and well designed levels that requires exploration, interesting enemies with good AI and one of the best arsenal of weapons in a shooter, with great gunplay to back it up.While I loved playing it on the N64, the awkard controls and the awful framerates made it hard to get back into (it can dip as low as 10 fps, if not lower). This new ""remaster"" is a huge improvement over the N64 and the original poor PC port. Playing at 60 fps with a keyboard and mouse feels great, alongside many other minor improvements that go a long way to make the game hold up (extended draw distance, faster movement, adjustable fov, updated visuals, etc..).Overall, I still think this is a fantastic shooter, with a great new port to go with it."

Nearly everything is improved in this version of Turok 2, from the graphics, frame rate, weapons etc. The improved controls allow for a much more enjoyable experience, and the inclusion of difficutly modes. Ranging from easy, normal, hard, hardcore. This spawns NPC'S in areas where you would not expect.The audio is great, and I love the fact that you can switch anytime between N64 soundtrack and the PC version. Another new feature is exclamation marks on things you need to find. This can be very helpful if you mainly want to kill everything, and not spend a while looking for objectives. The main thing I love is the fact you can save anytime, anyplace, anywhere.This is eaisly worth the money for any Turok fan. I highly suggest it."

,Recommended,405830,30587305,Posted: 18 March,all,Sire,"Nightdive delivers with flying colors on their Turok 2 Remaster, sadly the game itself has many glaring flaws that are immediately noticeable once you take off the rose-tinted glasses.Let me preface this by saying that I grew up with the three original Turok releases on N64 20~ years ago and nostalgia runs oceans deep with me. The first two were among my most played titles on the console (though not much of 2 stayed in my memory) but after all these years Turok 2 is definitely the lesser of the two titles, easily.Firstly, I'll get to the good stuff: Nightdive has done a wonderful job with this port, you can tweak tons of settings and you get some added bells and whistles to make the game really shine from it's original release. Multiplayer is intact if you want to live out some old school, deathmatch fun. Darren Mitchell's soundtrack still sounds wonderful and suits the game perfectly. I also haven't experienced any issues with bugs and the game ran perfectly day-one for me, anyway.Now is for the nitty gritty, and I'm gonna be harsh about this but: the game has aged like milk. Firstly Turok 1 locked down an aesthetic that went unmatched at the time and it was unique, and still really is. In the mid 90s no game pulled off outdoor environments well but Turok went the extra mile and set most of its' levels in nature with curved edges, wavy walls and slopes that were rounded. Sure, the levels didn't make any shapes that would ever appear in nature but it worked well. Turok 2's environments are mostly jagged and rough, the first two levels take place in vaguely Roman cities which are devoid of life and filled with strange invisible walls and small ledges that Turok has trouble walking over. There's a lack of detail or anything of interest in the levels and they just look boring; everything is super blocky and just looks bad.The level design also brings down the gameplay and this, I think is it's biggest fault of the whole game, level's are large. Really, really large. They're so large that the first level is easily going to take you over an hour unless you've played the game before, the same goes for the second level as well. Turok 2 opted to go for less levels, (6 instead of Turok 1s 8) but make them bigger and more sprawling. There's also a lot of backtracking, within levels and in between levels (thanks to upgrades that Turok can attain to explore levels further) so this means that you'll have to revisit each level at least once to collect everything in it if you care to. After playing a single level for X amount of time and it being empty because you've killed everything, exploring and retreading everything becomes boring fast. The levels are completely arduous and the worst offenders of this are the first two levels. The levels are also littered with unlabelled switches that open doors but there's no telling what switch interacts with what door/wall/fence, it's just bad design. Portals are also abundant which break the levels into chunks and you'll soon forget what portal takes you where. This also really kills the pacing of the game having to slog back and forth just trying to figure out where to go.Weapons are always the highlight of Turok and 2 shines here and it's most famous weapon (Cerebral Bore) was created for 2 and it still kicks♥♥♥♥♥ The Razorwind is also fantastic. Not everything is that great though, and you won't find the more interesting ones until the latter half of the game.Enemies are somewhat hit or miss, Dinosaurs aren't the name of the game anymore (the raptors look terrible and they prance around, it looks goofy) and you'll be fighting humanoid reptiles/dinos, mantid aliens and space demons that look like they were ripped right out of early Unreal titles, really uninspired and they share the same body shapes as Popeye.Overall Turok 2 is a bloated, uninteresting mess compared to it's more precise, streamlined older brother Turok 1. So why do I recommend it? Because the game is still a classic and there's a lot of people that will enjoy it, but mostly to support Nightdive Studios' efforts to bring these incredible remasters to us old school fans. Their work is fantastic and I hope we keep getting wonderful releases like this."

This is what helped define Turok 2 in my opinion.It also has a complete working multiplayer mode if you want to fight against other players to see who's the best Turok out there.  only problem is if some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ desides to play as a goddamned raptor, it's all over for you. They seriously need to do something about this because all it takes is a few swipes and you're done.  really ♥♥♥♥ing easy character to play with.also, I just wished the camera view turned sideways when you got killed like in the original game.I don't know if it's just me but I feel the first game had more of a variety of places to explore and find all the trinkets and keys you need to advance forward to, unlike the first 2 levels in T2 seem the same in almost every hallway you find in, which does make the game seem boring.  but whats not a problem is there are mission objectives to complete before you can exit the level and defend the energy totem pole from waves of enemies coming to destroy it.the only other problem I run into are the ammunition and sometimes the enemies move their heads around alot when they run around or whatever so that brings another challenge if you happen to be a headshot honcho.Other than that, Turok 2: Seeds of evil has 2 things in store for you:  Nostalgia, and lots of death for you to deal.Pros*Badass weaponry*blood and gore*enemies and later levels will prove a challenge for you*Multiplayer is included.Cons*Ammunition is pretty scarce, so make sure you hit what you're trying to kill or else you just wasted ammo.*sometimes you can easily get lost in the levels, so try your best to remember the routes and whatnot, even thoughthere's pointers now unlike the original game, so be ♥♥♥♥ing thankful for that.*playing as a rapter in mutliplayer is competely broken.....seriously????*..........so now when is Turok:Rage Wars coming out??   it's basically Quake/unreal tournament set in the Turok universe.Even though the nostalgia is probably the only purpose for this re-release, but at the same time the game now caters to veteran and newcomers to the classic turok series....unlike the cancerous 2008 reboot.  If you want, go check out Turok: Dinosaur hunter to see where it all started, and that's another good game brought from the n64 days.I'll give this thing an 8/10"

I was turned off a bit by the sheer number of visual changes and upgrades.However, it grew on me, pretty quickly.

It was certainly possible to play the original PC port, but it was a hassle to set up, and while most things would work, one or two things would be off.I applaud them for trying to keep to the original material as much as possible while also adding fresh updates.I apologize this ""review"" isn't much of a review, but I'm just so happy to see my favorite childhood game revitalized that I had to share it.The multiplayer is incredibly fun, however at the moment there are a few issues with the netcoding. I once had a reported ping of over 26000. My internet is okay as far as US internet goes (it's still♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's literally my only option) and I tried any number of firewall toggles and exceptions, port forwarding, anti-virus toggled off, nothing seems to fix it.But man, when the multiplayer works, the sheer speed and fun weapon selection makes it the most fun I've had on a multiplayer shooter since my friends and I still played Titanfall.The game has certainly aged. There's no disputing that, but it's still a fantastic FPS. You might find its forced exploration off putting, and I can understand that, but the changes with quick saving and the simple fact that this port runs magnitudes better than that N64 port did make it much more bearable, especially for brand new players.I hope Turok lives on and we get more of the games remastered. Hopefully it will continue to spread a new found love in todays players."

This PC port is so smooth, and the precision of the mouse makes it such a better experiance than the analog stick on the N64. The game was a blast on the N64, but this port delivers a better experince. Online multiplayer!!!!! ~ I checked out the servers, but nobody was online. If anyone wants to invite me into a server to test it out I'm down.As far as first person shooters go. This is one of the best of all time. 90's kids often talk about Perfect Dark, Goldeneye, and last but definately not least. Turok 2 Seeds of Evil. The N64 version boasted of computer AI ""unpredictable enemy movements"" and it was noticable at the time. Enemies are tough, and they take cover. The arsenal of weapons in this game will keep you entertained as well. How good are the guns? Better than borderlands.I will admit a bias. I am a fan of Turok son of stone, collected the comics, and played the N64 games. I'm just so stoked that this game is remasterd. If you're in the market for a good FPS with a good campain, at a challenging difficulty this is the game for you. One last thing.... I instantly noticed that the objectives are marked by an exclamation point ""!"" This port holds your hand unlike the N64 version, but to be honest I like it! Heck I will probably beat this game.

Glowlingly recommend.There's a plethora of settings you can tweak with the controls.And as someone who played the original N64 version, there's been enough very minor yet meaningful changes to the gameplay, it solves all of my gripes with the Original and I intensely appreciate the thought that went into that.The game itself, it doesn't hold your hand and its still a rock solid shooter some 20 years later.It's still possible to get absurdly lost in this game even with the hints activated (Lair of the Blind Ones and Hive of the Mantids being the worst offenders) but once you've beaten a level successfully, its pretty damn rewarding.There are some minor strange but infrequent bugs in the game, but its being patched fairly regularly. For anyone who was a fan of the Original or slightly curious about this game this is one of the most glowing recommendations I have ever given."
,Recommended,405830,30715840,Posted: 24 March,all,[OSyn] Azzalack,"This is an outstanding game that I didn't have the chance to appreciate previously, with its low FOV combined with it's pseudo-Metroidvania level design. The changes here are largely either convenience features or graphical features, both of which are appreciated, though the level design has been altered. In some places it is for the better, though in others it is worse. The Multiplayer is working just fine, which is nice; it even supports splitscreen! I previously had one gripe in an old version of this review; the FPS Cap limited the game to playing at 59.9FPS previously instead of 60, but the workaround that fixed it for me was to uncap the frame-rate in-game and then limit it to 61 or 62 with MSI Afterburner.OLD REVIEW: I was previously able to recommend this game, and would do so with a GLOWING review, but must say ""no,"" for now, as the most recent patch causes the game to run below 60 frames per second most of the time; this was not a mistake, but an intentional change in the game's design. For a first person shooter, this is not, in any capacity, acceptable. For now, I must recommend pirating an older version of the game to play instead, as it will play at an acceptable frame-rate as compared to this version."

Its great to watch them tumble over, loose limps and die in the most melodramatic way possible.There is also a great varity of them, you will meet new types in every new level. The Maps themselves are also very different from eachother.  with everyone having a unique look.Graphics are great for a console game of the time (with great improvements in this remaster, without compromising the original look), animations are top notch and even today great to look at.But not all is gold here. There is a reason why i never finished Turok 2 on the n64 (beside maybe being too young). All the maps are quite big and at times mazelike as hell and you have to look in every corner because you have to find a lot of stuff to procide. But you can be as cautios as you want to, you will have to come back to previous maps because for some Parts or keys lyou need special abilitys you only can collect with other abilities in other levels. At one Point i missed 1 crystal-or-something and i had to search for an houf to find it. The remaster improved here a lot with new visual clues for important items etc, but it still can be pretty annoying.Another issu for me was the small amount of ammo you get for the weapons, i guess the original developers did this so you would also use the more obscure weapons, in that regard it worked, but for my taste i ran out of ammo for my favourite weapons too fast.all said and done, i would devinitly recommend trying Turok 2, it is a great shooter with a lot to see and find. Some of the levels are too long and complicated, but with night dives additions it is not nearly as frustrating as it was on the n64!"

The large variety of memorable weapons and enemies means that there is never a dull moment in any of the six sprawling maps the game offers.Having grown up with the original on the Nintendo 64, there was no bound to the excitement I felt when a proper PC port was inevitably announced after the first game's remaster.  However, veteran Turok players should keep in mind the few tweaks that this version has brought along with it.  In addition to the added PC controls, this port also has a few changes in dynamic lighting, slight map changes, some moved item and enemy locations, and a new ability to fast-travel between pink portals (originally used as saves in the N64 version).All in all, this game is a masterpiece with incredible level and music design, and this all transfers beautifully to this Steam incarnation.

Turok 2 is the sequel to the N64 hit Turok, remastered and looking better than it ever did on the N64.In Turok 2 you play as Turok, a Native American warrior chosen to defend Earth from interdimensional threats. This time the Primagen has come, unsealed after thousands of years its up to our favorite Dino blasting hero to blast some Dinos and save the day.Turok 2 is an FPS and has loads of interesting weapons at your disposal. Of course you begin with the mundane, pistol and a bow. But quickly you gather up exploding bolts, and energy shotgun that literally shreds the enemy, and of course the Ceberal Bore, which drills into the bad guys head and.....explodes. Great fun to be had for all. With the PC controls or using a gamepad/controller, the controls are tight. Aiming is less precise, considering this is an N64 game, and it does get annoying to not be able to zero in on your target. This is slightly forgiven when more powerful weapons are obtained.The level design however is sorely lacking. Each level tasks you with finding several things, and the levels are sprawling. Multiple paths, hidden paths, teleporters to other realms, it can be a little over whelming. Luckily a handy overlay of the area can be summoned, giving you an exact location as to where you are in the current area. This is great, but still doesn't take away the fact that there are a ton of things to collect. Aside from the main objectives, there are runes to collect to unlock more levels, weapon parts, keys, its quite a lot. If you do plan to play, plan a several hour session. However, there are teleporters around, allowing quick jumps to different sections.With the remasting of the graphics, so does the sound get remastered. You can play the game with the original score, but the remastered just sounds so much better. All the weapons sound great, and powerful. The pistol sounds wimpy, while the whine of that Cerebral Bore is certain to make you whince at least once. The enemies also sound amazing, with dinosaurs sounding scary, as well as many of the more unique enemy types.If your looking for a nostalgia trip, or your a young punk who has no idea what an N64 is (Nintendo 64), Turok delivers."

Turok 2 resolves a lot of those issues, adds some fun new stuff in, and ends up with a really excellent product.There are actual voice-acted cutscenes and plot now, which is interesting. The plot itself is fairly standard (bad guy wants to take over a place, you have to stop him), but there's backstory for a lot of locations, motivation for a lot of enemies, and an actually well-crafted sequel hook. It's nice to see that effort was put in, and the game's story is generally alright.The game looks good (for its time) and animates great. Areas are bright and colorful, enemies are astonishingly expressive, and physics seem weighty and realistic.A lot of mechanics and gameplay elements are carried over from Turok 1, including the lives system, the idea of a handful of giant levels instead of many smaller ones, a few weapons, some enemies, and the solid platforming with no fall damage. However, there're a fair amount of new ideas added to the gameplay too, such as reclaimable arrows, a rideable armed dinosaur, checkpoints that give you health and ammo and allow fast-travel, and upgrades to help you find certain collectibles which are now scattered throughout levels.Those collectibles are the main difference between Turok 1 and 2. In addition to the level keys from the last game, Turok 2 adds additional (yet necessary to continue) objectives to every level. These mostly involve running up to something and pressing a button or using an item that you picked up in the same area, but the problem is that they're often really well-hidden. Combined with the expansive, complex nature of the level design, this leads to a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of backtracking and looking stuff up to try and find the last necessary location. Complementing these objectives are pickups for upgrades and new weapons that are similarly well-hidden or spread out. You can spend an hour or two longer than necessary picking a level clean for everything that you need to progress, slowing the otherwise-fun gameplay to an absolute standstill. The level design also lacks the intuitiveness of the first game, so it's far easier to get lost and completely stuck. This is Turok 2's main fault, which is a shame, because everything else works so well.On the more positive side of things, Turok 2 does a lot to correct the first game's faults. You can switch ammo types now, and enemy respawn rates are down. The armor's gone, which I don't mind because it wasn't really that necessary in the original.The weapon variety is insanely good. All the traditional weapons are still present (pistol, shotgun, etc.), but there are some really crazy ones added in. The War Blade is one of the most overpowered melee weapons I've seen in a while, there's a minethrower and an auto-pistol and a thing that fires shotgun shells in a sort of bouncing sniper-shot, and then there's the Cerebral Bore, which is one of the most amazing video game weapons I've ever encountered.Complementing the weapons is the gore system. Turok 1 was more bloody than gory, but this game kicks both of those things to 11. Blood splatters, gushes, and pools, enemies twitch and jerk on death, and you can remove heads and limbs if you aim at them. At one point I blew an enemy's entire top half off. The sound design adds a lot, too, adding screams, spurting noises, and the sound of enemies choking on their own blood. This is one of the most amazingly violent games I've ever seen, and it's a goddamn N64 title.Apparently the main character is a different guy also named Turok.This Steam port is also really good. The game seems to be far more crisp and colorful than the original, a quicksave feature seems to have been implemented (making the lives system obsolete), the auto-aim is gone so you actually have to try and hit things, and overall it just seems like a lot of love went into it. Night Dive Studios really seem to put some effort into reviving classics, and it shows.Overall, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is even better than Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. It plays better, it has more stuff, it has fewer minor issues, and it's a better port. The level design's worse, but everything else more or less makes up for that. I heartily recommend this game."

My downright refusal to give it away often stems from the fact that I could never beat it fairly. It has always been a game that seem to require cheats in order to finish it. But despite my promises to beating it fairly-  The 12 year-old pissant that was myself back in the day, would input the oblivion code nonchalant just to get past the tougher portion of the levels with unlimited ammo and God mode. Looking back at it now- neither both the game and I didn't age properly to a certain extent.I'm going back a year later or more to Thanksgiving of 2016. I'm visiting my brother who still has the old girl that is the Nintendo 64 along with her controllers and their abysmal analogs. I know, I know- Input childhood nostalgia and 90's kids shenanigans here. But sometimes, I believe that there's some memories that need the rose tint taken away. Now don't get me wrong but the N64, God bless its hardware, has never aged well as one would think. It's equivalent to that of decades-old jerky. Sure, you can still eat it but it was hard to chew, tough to swallow, and the taste is faint but not enough to motivate you to keep eating.The system while incredibly addicting with racers and platformers, it felt like it was never intended for the FPS genre. I'll admit a few good ones like Doom 64 comes to mind immediately- it was the other games like Turok and GoldenEye that showed how awkward that three-handled monstrosity that was the controller truly was. Utilizing the C buttons to move may have helped, but try aiming with that limp thumbstick and your frustation will escalate to Wieliczka levels of salt.Jump away from the off topic family reunions and back to self-loathing and loneliness that I call military life. I get a coupon for 'Turok 2: Remastered'. And after playing 'Dinosaur Hunter' months before, I purchased the game immediately and promised to myself to play it straight. No cheats and maybe some walkthroughs, but no cheats for the duration of the playthrough.Review:After beating it, I can say that 'Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Remastered' is one the best remasterings I've ever seen for a game. There's a lot of polish in both enemies and environments, making everything looks so grand and without the fog of war minisculing the depth like it did a decade ago. You can now see everything and are no longer annoyed by baddies shooting you through the fog. Enemies now bleed more and corpses stay put rather than disappear in order keep the frame rate steady. Understandbly, what I'm typing before may be considered heresy to some players. But thankfully, Night Dive placed customization and allows the player to tool the game to their liking. Do you still love that fog regardless of its massive shortcomings? you can activate it. Hints are either distracting or bothersome? You can disable them. Want that weapon sway? Sway it away. Do you think that the ledge grabbing ability shouldn't belong in game despite it being incredibly helpful in situations? Disable that mess and keep it vanilla for Turok 2 is essentially your virtual oyster.Initially, I played this game with a Xbox controller. Considering Turok 2 was originally for consoles. It felt somewhat integral to play it vanilla like so.  Again, heresy to say- but utilizing a modern controller to a 10 year old title felt like I was playing it for the first time. As stated before, the N64 controller is a nightmare. So the use of two thumbsticks made game more responsive. My only gripe was when it came to swapping weapons. The one thing I was hoping they would keep was the way on how you switched your arsenal in the N64 variant. If I remember correctly, you would hold either A or B on the N64 controller and then highlight your choice of firearm with the thumbstick. Here, they repeat Turok: Dinosaur Hunter's mechanic of gun swapping. It's not a bad mechanic but when you're in an intense firefight, I would rather be fighting Mantids and not the menu. But more realizing too is that the 90's method means your couldn't move while you were choosing your gun so I can understand why they would change it to what it is now.But we all know keyboard and mouse is by far the best choice. Considering that Turok 2 is basically Pre Serious Sam, Post Doom sort of mix. It made me curious to see if WASD  was more preferrable what with the no reloading, run/gun features; so I decide to give it a shot and playing this game upon a second run with the WASD+Mouse setup surprisingly feels natural. Much like GoldenEye- Seeds of Evil with PC controls is fantastic. But I do feel they missed an opportunity by copying Doom's way of handling the weapon switch. Every weapon is labeled on the numerical keys, yes. But remember how Doom categorizes their guns to specific numbers? For instance, the shotgun and super shotgun were on key 3? That made it convenient. That convenience is not here. Every single firearm has their own key which doesn't sound bad, but when your guns are listing from 1 thorugh + on the keyboard then that categorization would be exponential and much needed.Short answer is that graphically speaking, Turok 2 looks amazing. But on the control side of the game can be somewhat frustrating and there's  a limit on how you can customize in terms for button layouts. But the experience of it varies on your input and choice of play style. And there's without a doubt that Nightdive has put a lot of life into Turok 2, making it one of the few remastered releases that doesn't feel completely souless.Confession:I did noclip, though. It was in the Hive of the Mantids and I had no clue on how to get past the force field the blocking entrance to the whispers talisman chamber. Not to mention the fight with the final boss was both ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and ridiculous. So I did break my promise on not cheating and enabled unlimited ammo near the end. Suffice to say, though while I am somewhat pleased how far I've gotten- I still cheated and gotta play it again clean. Will probably retry from scratch and get good, eventually."

The game looks great, runs like butter, and there's a ton of fun extras to play around with.My two favorite things are the ability to switch between the N64 & PC music, and I applaud them for using the N64s mega cheat since thats the one everyone knows. (Seriously bewareoblivionisathand is up there with iddqd)If you like turok 2, this is a must buy. If you don't like turok 2, then stop lying to yourself and buy this anyways."

Turok 2 Seeds Of Evil is even better than the original. There's nothing more satisfying than fighting dinosaurs and lizard people. Turok 2 Seeds Of Evil is a video game experience not to be missed. This game is awesome you will want to play it again and again. I loved the music in this game and it fits it well with the action and adventure. The music in the Lair of the blind ones is creepy as hell (I hate those goddamned spiders) And the weapons in this game are bad♥♥♥♥♥especially my all-time favorite weapon The Cerebral Bore, just fire away and watch as it drills into the heads of your enemies before spurting out blood as it drills into your enemies brains and with a fantastic finale when their heads explode, Trust me you'll be laughing like crazy. Turok 2 Seeds of Evil is hands down the best FPS shooter and Turok game ever. I highly recommend this awesome game, trust me you won't regret it."

The only thing this game requires though is subtitles. The alien chick's voice was so horribly recorded back in the day you can't understand anything she says. Other than that though it's great to have these classics coming back."

It's a great remake.However, if you've never played this game... it's actually not that great.  I remember never beating it when I was a teenager on N64... and now I know why.  The level design is needless and uninterestingly confusing.  Expect to be backtracking about as much as you're making progress."

The devs have also patched the game several times and they seem receptive to community feedback so it's entirely possible some of the points I mentioned above may get fixed. Nightdive Studios does good work.8.5 / 10"
