,Recommended,405900,23324784,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Newgeta,"There are games you want to play and then there are games you have to play.  This is a game you have to play.This is my first experience with the series, but being a huge fan of FFT, OB, and Xcom I have always wanted to give this a shot.Roughly 100 hours later, my S/O hates this game, my front lawn is a little over grown and I have a sink full of dishes.I still have a lot to do in the game but I think I can say without hesitation that this is the best tactical RPG I have ever played.At first I was worried about the geo panels making me feel like I had to play each fight a certain way, but most of the time you can just kill them and go about your business.The comedic story, beautiful sprites and endless game play make this one a real keeper.I can see myself playing this one for years to come.The only gripe is that you WILL need the strat guide AND gamefaqs to understand all the systems and mechanics in the game because, holy hell, are they neumerous and complex.A few hints to make your life better:Turn off Anti Aliasing if you get a multicolored rainbow line in the middle of your screen.Turn on Vsync if your screen is tearing.Leave the edge blur effects off.You can throw enemies onto geo prizims to 1 shot destory them.Dont worry about leveling up more than 4 or 5 characters your first time through the story.Do not mess around with the item world until you beat the game (unless you have to for the story).Ditch your starter prinnies asap, and level a male fist user, a mage, healer, a theif, and male warrior  with your main characters these will all you need on your first play through.Do not worry about starting new characters with perfect stats or better versions of the class you currently have, you can restart them later as any new class and carry stats from their current level over as many times as you want (google transmigrating disgaea).On first playthrough, angelic main character is the best one to ask the assembly for a healer and a mage because of next tip.Once a character creates another one at the assembly, it can learn all of their spells by standing beside the new character in battle and casting the new character\'s spell(s) 5 times; this works with all spells at all levels.Bribes in the dark assembly are cumulative, that is, the more you bribe, the higher your influence gets over time.The dark assembly can be entered and exited at no penalty to re roll influence for that session.Talk to your all of your castle's vassals in each chapter, they sometimes reward you."
,Recommended,405900,21435405,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,Calorie Mate,"Disgaeais 13 years old by now, and I've played every version of it before. And by now(after it was being patched by NISA) I wholeheartedly recommend this version as well.If you are intersted in SRPGs likeFinal Fantasy Tactics,Fire EmblemorTactics Ogre, then Disgaea might be up your alley. In fact, I believe its one of the best franchises of the genre, especially due to its endgame.Since this is the first title in the franchise(PC version is based on the PSP port), it is a bit dated in comparison to it's succesors, but it still features all the core mechanics that make the series great. And some of them are really unique. They're already featured on the store page but some of the most noteworthy are those:Item world- The item world is probably the most unique feature of them all. A randomly generated dungeon inside every item, which you can use to level the item up or change how certain items work. There are two basic mechanics in the item world.1)For every floor you clear, the item gains a level. It gets tougher the further you go.2)Every item has residents that change the item's stats if you subdue them. For example, a ""Marksman"" raises the item's HIT stat, a ""Gladiator"" raises it's strength, and so on. You can even combine and transfer residents between items, so there's a lot to do here, if you want to create the perfect item/weapon.Transmigration- The max lvl in Disgaea is 9999, and on top of that you can use transmigration, which is basically a ""rebirth"" of the character to the same, or another class. It's back to lvl1 but it'll be stronger when leveled up. This way you can build strong characters with lots of abilities.Geo Panels- GPs are colored areas in the field, which have different effects on characters standing on them(like 50% bonus exp.)You can change the effect or even remove the Geo Panel completely by picking up and throwing the crystal causing an effect to another place, or by destroying it. There's quite a lot to play around with here, especially in the item world, so these are just the very basics.So these are the three features I think are most important to mention. There's definitely more though(such as multiple endings and other unique gameplay mechanics.)The biggest draw for me though, is the over-the-top and comical story. This game doesnottake itself seriously.So if you're into any of that, give it a go. Even though Disgaea is often regarded as pretty ""grindy"", if you only want to clear the story, the grind isn't really that much if you focus on a core team. The real grind of Disgaea lays in the possibilites you have as a player. Be it strengthening an item, or turning it into a tool that suits you; be it transmigration or the mentor/pupil system. There'salwayssomething to do, if you want to.The PortEdit:Since release, NISA put in a good effort to patch the game. Not only did they root out the biggest problems, but they also added the bonus characters from the other versions of the game.Before, in this section I mentioned a lot of problems, but according to the patch notes and reports from people, they are now pretty much gone. A couple of people still report occasional crashes, but the main issues have been resolved.Other than that, the port doesn't feature any fancy settings. Just the options to switch between original and new textures, shadows, V-Sync, SSAOand a weird Depth of Field effect. No resolution options either, just fullscreen or windowed. They patched in bubonic filtering which is a nice addition. But thats pretty much it in terms of settings."

,Recommended,405900,21701694,"Posted: 7 March, 2016",all,IanStoianov,"Let's split this up:First, the game itself. It's a strategy RPG with a wild, sometimes self-referential plot, several jokes, references to movies and TV shows, led by a lovable cast of characters. Gameplay wise, the game's main feature is the possibility to take the characters all the way to level 9999(yes, four nines in a row), several over the top attacks, combo possibilities, and the geo-panel system, all adding to a highly replayable game.Combined with the ""Item World"", where you can go through randomized stages to strenghen your gear and even acquire some of the strongest in the game, and with the several endings and new game +, this will keep fans of JRPGs entertained for hundreds of hours. I had over 250 of those back in the PS2. Highly recommended.Granted, some mechanics are rather dated, but there's nothing obnoxious enough to disturb the enjoyment of the game.Now, the port. Look, it's a 13 year old game. The original was on the PS2, and this version is based on the PSP port. Personally, I expected the game to be a straight port and locked to 30fps, and I would have been fine with that for this game, but they added new surface textures, a new interface, and high quality character portraits. The character sprites themselves have not been touched, and offer the same pixelized style from back in the day, witth an optional ""filter"" that basically blurs the images(meh).Otherwise, the game has no real resolution options, but seems to run at your desktop resolution when in fullscrenn, and has a ""Depth of Field"" and ""Background Blur"", which to me, end up just bluring the top and the bottom of screen, and an option for SSAO, which at the very least makes the game jitery.Upon release, there were random performance issues, but the first patch seems to have fixed most of those. Avoid the needless SSAO option and it should run fine. I barely scratched the surface of what the game offers with this review, and can't recommend this game enough."

In the past few years Steam has been practically bombarded with a plague of low-quality ports of classic JP games designed to cash in on nostalgia with very little effort. Disgaea's port was initially rough, but after a round of updates I have experienced no further crashes and very few graphical issues. Based on this, I can say that it's not just a simple cash grab, and that I would probably buy the sequel if it were released."

Turns out the Steam review section have a letter cap and it can barely cover 1/4 of my review so I dumped it.Disregarding the optimization issues, the game itself is a must have for anyone who enjoys RPGs. The story isn't meant to be taken seriously, enter with an open mind and enjoy the vibrant characters the game has to offer.Give it some time though, the current optimization state is unjustifiable. You'd think that NISA, the publisher who also worked on the port, would spend more time on their dearest and longest-running franchise.And for people who's having frame rate issues, try turning off V-Sync, worked like a charm for me.If it doesn't work, just keep tweaking with your settings.Edit: Delve into the forums and found out that if you have a controller, try plugging it in using InputMapper (Not sure if other alternatives works).I've been using my DS4 this whole time and running the game at 60 FPS with V-Sync off. When I plugged it off, the FPS dipped to a revolting 15 FPS. Tried it with my DS3 and got the same result, plugged in gave me 60 FPS and when removed, it dropped to 15 FPS again. Do not try it in game though, it will crash your game so make sure you save first.Edit 2: The horse♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is still a dangerous weapon.Edit3: They've fixed the issues and the game is playable now. NISA have been extremely responsive and active with the community and assuring us that the problems will be fixed and indeed it did.

,Recommended,405900,21862361,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,sardine,"OH BOY WHERE TO BEGIN!Disgaea is my favourite game series of all time and after waiting literally 3 years later it finally made its debut to steam! Although it had a rocky start on launch day NIS did a good attempt to fix all the problems and although the game is playable for the most part, the rest of the problems can be fixed with thePrinny Perfect Modthat Kaldaien made so I strongly suggest using it if you want a better experience. Port issues aside, let's discuss about the meat that is Disgaea!The best way to describe Disgaea is that it's Final Fantasy Tactic's crazy uncle who overdosed on drugs and alchohol. Compared to other tatic's games such as the aforementioned Final Fantasy Tatics, Fire Emblem  and X-Com, Disgaea gives you so much freedom and allows you to be as creative as you want to be! Literally every humanoid class can use any weapon skill with any strategy that opens up to many possible combinations (e.g. mage's with guns and archers with axes) and the absurd level cap of 9999. On top of that, the Item World, although archaic in the first game, is an excellent random dungeon if you want to spend time spelunking and improving your items!Now if you don't like grinding in videogames or can't tolerate an excess amount of grinding, I strongly suggest staying away from this game series as it is heavily grind based later on in the post-game/side-game, where the real meat of the game takes place.Out of all the entries in Disgaea, the main story in the first game is probably the best imho. With the original trio Laharl, Etna and Flonne, they make the story really enjoyable as it's mostly comedic and self-aware of it's own absurdness. Granted it does an excellent job when being serious as well so don't jump in thinking its all fun and games!Voice acting wise it can be a hit or miss for many people. I personally enjoyed the english dub of this game as they did a pretty good job in voicing the characters and I expecially love Barbra Goodson, Michelle Ruff and Sandy Fox for their roles as Laharl, Etna and Flonne respectively. They pretty much made the game for me and even to this day they still reprise their roles for the characters. And ik that Etna's original voice actor from the PS2 version didn't carry over and although I did like her old voice, I prefer Michelle Ruff voicing Etna since I'm more used to her voice than Amanda Winn Lee's. If you don't like hearing the dub there's the option to switch to japanese sub so it's up to personal preference.Btw, 90% of all the non-port problems that are in the first game have been fixed and improved on in Disgaea 2 and onward! This includes monster unit equality, faster level grinding and more challenging ordeals :) With that being said, I recommend playing Disgaea PC as it not only does a great job introducing you to the game's mechanics but also shows how the series has come far 13 years later.Edit 04/21/16: Completely forgot to talk about the music in Disgaea. Simply put, its GOD LIKE and I want everyone and anyone to listen to it. I give it a sardine/10 its too good m8.Edit 08/22/16: Now Pleinair, Adell, Rozalin and Overlord Zetta can be recruited and playable! I waited nearly 6 months for Pleinair to be playable and NIS has delivered :)"

Apparently the PC port is based on the PSP version which is (suprisingly) inferior to the original (PS2) in terms of quality of life features. NISAmerica, despite of being masters at creating incredible strategy games, is a lazy company. The buttons are remaped to PSP so you don't have L2/R2, instead you have to use combinations like square + L/R to perform what should be assigned to L2/R2 (and this can't be changed). You can't choose resolution (the game will snap to fullscreen at 16:9, which is very strange and as I said, lazy). They didn't add the option for text and walk speed, the game feels incredibly sluggish. This is unaceptable for a 2017 remake. Still, the game is a mandatory introduction to the series. I recomend playing it first if you plan on playing other games of the series, because it will feel very slow in comparison, but even so it is a classic and should be experienced by everyone in my opinion."

Having it on the PC has been great and I want to give a big shout out to the Developers for working on this port even after release and making it work with controllers, cleaning up some bugs, and in general letting me play this on a system that I know will still be able to play it when I upgrade it in 5-10 years.  On the PS2 when I picked this up as a blind purchase I spend over 400 hrs playing.  It will take me a lot longer but I expect to break that at some point on steam.    Here is hoping D2 follows along.  I'd probably play the others as well (they are all fairly fun games) but the original story is still the best in my opinion.For those who don't know what Disgaea is I recommend you do a little research before you buy.   It's a tactical turn based RPG.  You level up and equip your characters as you go through the story.  The fights are very akin to Final Fantasy Tactics  but very over the top.  You can complete the game at around level 50/60 but you can level up your characters to 9999.  There are side quests, ways to make the levels harder, and item dungeons that are just random levels that get harder and harder as you power up your gear, and the game goes crazy on New Game+ where you can start over and over with the same characters you just went through the game with the 100 previous times.  This game has a lot to offer the completionist, tactical gamer, and anime fan.  It's all good fun... but may not be suitable for younger audiences of parents who don't want to try and explain what the characters are talking about."

Steam's refund policy makes this a little better now, but if you don't know what Disgaea is and / or don't already like it I would suggest holding off on buying this for a few weeks until they have nailed down the remaining issues. (which they say they are working on),So, if you already love Disagea, and wanted a little PC action for it, go for it.If you don't know what Disgaea is or have never played a Disgaea game, you may want to wait for another week or two before having a go at this."

If you're into this kind of RPG / strategy game, I would recommend giving this a go. Younger players might be a bit put off by the graphics and the ""simple"" gameplay, but if you can get past that, it's definitely worth it. The story is good fun and the voice acting is mostly good as well.The ""end game"" content can be difficult, confusing and debatably boring. Grinding the Item World to level up your characters and weapons/armour can be a bore but it's worth it to access the extra content and getting access to all the additional humanoid characters can take a bit of research and cause confusion... but there is a sense of achievement as you progress and unlock more and more.The game is a bit buggy and has a tendency to crash when (I, at least) chain a lot of special abilities over a long period of time. Usually around the end of the Item World I have noticed this will happen more often. I don't suggest alt-tabbing out of the game at all / much as that affects performance as well. Other than that, I have not experienced any issues.Hopefully the newer Disgaea games also come to the PC as it would be a great boost to the otherwise Playstation-only franchise."

Your goal is to defeat every single enemy unit on it and win. Pretty straightforward, but also pretty damn fun!

I cannot ever hope to properly convey to you how much of a wonderful thing this is unless you go from the ps2 to this port and see the difference yourself.This is orders of magnitude more important than any other feature added to the pc port: abusing the game's grinding mechanisms often requires constant recycling of levels to the point where one might suffer the thought that the loading screen is where one spends most of the time in the console version.This pc version does not suffer that at all with the added benefit of a large screen to experience the game with.#1 Frustration with the portThere are crashes; as they fix some issues with the game for others, they've been introducing new crashes for those with no problems. As far as I can tell, the majority of these crashes can, at the time of this writing on March 6th, be avoided by turning off all of the pc specific features, but many users have reported a memory leak that will randomly strike.The devs have not abandoned us and have been steadily pumping out patches and interacting with us on the forums; I am not worried at all about the future of this title.With this in mind, should you buy the port?Absolutely. This is the definitive version of this game and any bugs that exist are steadily being addressed.If you haven't played this game yet, you will likely be better served by other reviews which talk about core mechanics, but I should mention that you will find no better SRPG series available on pc (and, perhaps, beyond).buyPort ReportOriginal: 8/10Pc Port:  6/10Addendum:I should add that Japanese Audio Support is available for those like myself who hate dubs of any kind regardless of language.

If you're playing any Disgaea game for its story then you're playing it for the wrong reason. This game has such a huge learning curve that I didn't understand half of its mechanics until I completed the game (which you don't need to understand to finish the game). IMO this is an rpg version of wow... single player mode. You complete the story then grind grind grind. Think of it like Final Fantasy Tactics on steroids... you have to level up your character, then his weapon mastery, then his skills, then his specialties, then his weapon (or any of his equips). If you get hooked to this game like I did you may remember what sunlight looks like lol. One last thing to mention, this game is definately worth the $20.Conclusion: if you want a game you can play for months, years, or maybe even a lifetime, then this is for you."
,Recommended,405900,29655114,Posted: 2 February,all,SilvasRuin,"Getting this out of the way first: I do not think Disgaea has aged very well. It's still fun and it still sounds good, but it looks like crap and it's missing a staggering amount of quality of life that was added by each of its predecessors. That has not stopped me from buying the game 3 more times even after I had played Disgaea 2.With that initial caveat out of the way, I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes non-standard tactical RPGs, as a bit of a warm up to the rest of the series, and I whole heartedly recommend it to anyone that enjoys complex, emotional, and thought provoking stories. I realize its near constant humor and episodic (in multiple senses) story deliverence is going to be what most people focus on, but when this game wants to get serious, it can do that very well too. It has plenty to say about the human condition, when all is said and done. This is one of my favorite stories in gaming history for its poignancy, its wit, its subtle foreshadowing, the way it can surprise you anyways, and the messages it gives."
,Recommended,405900,24965815,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,genoforprez,"(Note: This is a review of the port quality and not the game itself)When this port first hit Steam it was kind of a huge mess. NIS has been pretty good at taking feedback and continuing to support/update the game, though, and I can honestly say that it is now a pretty decent PC port.There are still some issues with it, especially in the visual department. You have to understand that it is an older game (and it already ""looked old"" on its native PS2), but that's not where the visual mess comes in. They tried to add a bunch of fancy effects like shadows and edge blurring and such, but it just looks baaaad. Fortunately, you can turn most of these horrendous things off and everything is A-Okay. The biggest offender is the ""new textures"" applied to game maps. They look terrible. REALLY terrible. They just don't mesh with the surrounding art at all. Thankfully, again, you can turn them off and just use the classic map. (Whew.) The updated character portraits in the interface look fantastic, but the updated interface itself is sort of jarring. Unfortunately, if you turn off the updated interface you don't get the updated character portraits. You have to use both or neither. But you can get used to the interface so it's not TOO bad.My biggest complaints when the port first came out were the control issues. I like playing Disgaea with a controller and you'd think that part would have ported over just fine, considering the game was ORIGINALLY for controllers. But the character movement at the hub had an insaaaane acceleration issue, the cursor controlled kinda wonky, and all of the button cues on the interface were just generic numbers instead of the actual buttons. Not to mention huge, inexplicable framerate drops that would happen from time to time. BUT ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN FIXED. Character movement is now fine, cursor is fine, button cues show the actual buttons (on my 360 style controller at least), and I'm no longer experiencing framerate issues.I would have been VERY hesitant to recommend this port when it first dropped on Steam, but I feel like it's now in a pretty good place. It isn't flawless, but it's plenty good enough."

My first impressions of the game were that the character designs and the animations were nothing short of amazing. The storyline was engaging, and full of hilarious and downright silly moments. The environments that you play throughout the stages were vast, ranging from snow covered mountaintops to the burning embers of volcanic ash to even a baseball field (yes, you read that right).If you, like me, enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics, you'll be pleased to know that Disgaea also boasts of myriad character classes for you to choose from - and customize as you see fit. (You can equip any class with any weapon/armor build, though most classes have a particular preferred set, but you're free to divert away from the latter if you so desire). Character classes comprise of the common warrior (very tanky) classes and mage (high damage, low def) classes to the more unorthodox classes (Scouts - able to change environmental bonuses, Angels - my personal favourite, excels in almost everything, and the completely imba Majin - demon(?) class behemoths than have virtually no weaknesses).And when you think you've leveled your characters high enough, the game also allows you to reset your character completely by a process called Transmigration that returns said character to level 1, with a modest boost to his/her base stats. The change pays off when you've transmigrated your character a couple of times and you'll begin to see the difference when your character grows from a struggling demon to a all-netherworld-will-fear-me demon (or human, or angel, or monster, or whatever-you-want-to-add-in-this-space) slayer.While many have commented about the technical bugs with the vanilla release, the recent update seems to have fixed many (if not all)  of the performance issues, and I've been running the game with a steady 60fps even during heavily animated scenes.All in all, Disgaea is a gem of a game, and I'm glad that they did a wonderful job porting this to the PC after so many years.Also, Disgaea was the game that, to my knowledge, first introduced the word ""dood"" and the world of prinnies.

Now that the ugliness of pre-patch Disgaea PC is behind us, I can comment on the game proper.Disgaea PC is a remake of the oldest entry in the Disgaea series: Disgaea 1. More specifically, it's a remaster of the PSP release, Afternoon of Darkness. The good news is that the new graphical editions are welcome ones: new backgrounds being the main draw. Sadly, some very simple additions that could have improved benefitial are lacking. Most glaringly, there's no in-cutscene ""skip cutscene"" button, which is a feature every Disgaea game from 2PSP onward had that made things much less frustrating. The game is also extremely slow compared to later entries, lacking the high-speed movement and camera options that later games possessed.All-in-all, Disgaea PC's biggest shortcomings lay in the fact that it's a straight port for all practical purposes and doesn't include anything that would help make the game feel like it was released in 2016. Additions like more camera options, higher movement speed, a skip-cutscene button, and the improved ""cancel options"" system from later games could have helped bring this dated game into the modern era of Disgaea.All that said, however, if you can get past the datedness of the game's mechanics, you've got a really solid SRPG on your hands here, and a new definitive starting point to the series. It's a wonderful title in a wonderful series, just be prepared to feel a bit irritated by the age of the experience. This is a faithful rerelease. For better and for worse."

Disgaea is one of the most freeform games ever. Distribute 10 actions over a turn freely, from 10 separate turns in a row to a Rube Goldenberg-esque chain attack that devastates your target(s). Level up your characters with traditional grinding, or tweak your items with random-dungeon crawling to make them twice as powerful as normally or more. Are the plot-based characters too boring? Create your own! Do you think archers would be cooler if they ran around with axes and longswords? Why, just give them some!Disgaea doesn't just have a single way to play it - you can do anything you want, and still succeed (well, as long as you did something remotely sensible), and that's why I love it. It also is extremely rich in content - you can easily lose hours in the random dungeons, and getting to the normal final boss doesn't even show you half the stuff you can come across. There are several bonus stages to take on once you're done with the normal story, and the story's final boss' level of 105 pales in comparison to the ultimate secret boss Baal's towering Lv.4000 figure - not to mention there's no end to the power of the random dungeon enemies' and bosses' strengths. Between powering up your party, micro-managing your equipment, and taking on new bonus challenges, you'll easily lose a few hundred of hours in this game, and feel entertained and rewarded all the way through. Slow-paced enough that you can watch videos and eat while playing, fast-paced enough to never get boring."

When you play it the first time trough the story you dont will make without doing some older maps and level your character so a little grinding you need to do but in my opinion its not a bad think and when you get stuck you can whenever you want look in google for tipps becuase there are enough thinks about this game because its older.And at some maps you need to think how to beat it because of the Geo-Symbols who make some buffs or debuffs for the character that stays on the field like enemy buff or invincibility but more infos you get ingame.For the game what comes after the story thats what is for me the real think i like to do then you start to grind your character to level 9999 and make your eq even better that you come to a million of damage and do more differend maps thats not from the story like the item world where you get random generated maps there is where you can spend easy more about 3000 hours if you want. When you now think thats boring because you dont like to grind for to long  then you can buy the game too for the story and a little playtime afterwards you will have your fun.I use my Xbox controller and i dont have any problems with it when you use your keyboard i dont know how this is.I hope my first review wasnt to bad and i hope some people will buy this game and like it that it will get some more people who like it so that the there will be alot more games from disgea in the future and more people enjoy this game for more question even for other disgaea games you can send me a message

When it first came out on the PS2 it was pretty unique with it's focus on super grinding. I did not care for it back then, having been an SRPG player since the very beginning with Shining Force 1 and 2...played on an actual Sega system. When the PS1 came out, it was flooded with tons of great games with that feel: Final Fantasy Tactics, Vanguard Bandits, Vandal Hearts, Tactics Ogre, etc. etc. By the time the PS2 came out it felt like the genre as a whole was drying up. So you can imagine my excitement when this was released. Of course, Disgaea is really its own beast and I did not appreciate the charm it had at the time.When it was re-released on the PSP I decided to give it more of a fair shake. I took the time to grind characters and unlock the secret levels/endings. I gotta say, it was worth it. I ended up really enjoying the game. It had the trappings of the SRPG genre that I loved so much, with a kind of general absurdity to it that ended up being very entertaining. If you accept Disgaea for what it is, it is a genre unto itself.When I saw they were porting it to the PC with the content from Afternoon of Darkness, I was pretty excited. Getting to play that on a normal sized screen again with a controller sounded aces to me. I have not been disappointed so far. This is one of those games where, if you have the time, you can easily waste 5+ hours in a single sitting as you grind out levels or explore the depths of the Item World. All the charm is still there with a slightly nicer looking interface. Is it worth it if you still own the original or the PSP version? Probably not, they really did very little to it. But if this is your first foray into the series or you need a cheap copy to play, then go for it. You really need to experience this game at least once."

Being able to load in and out of stages with almost no loading time is freaking awesome.  The major glitches like game crashes have more or less been resolved at this point.Pros:  Absolute grindfest!  You can spend as much time as you want making your characters and their gear over powered or you can try to squeek by with the bare minimum stats.  It's nice to be able to play the game at your own speed or just come back to a challenging stage later and pwn the crap out of it.Cons: The first version capped Statisticians (the experience multiplier) at 300 per character.  Since you can't stack in slots or other items this can really bring the leveling process to a crawl.  Luckily the game was written with that in mind, so you don't technically need to hit level 9999 to beat anything.I love this whole genre.

That is not the point with this version. The first time I started it up it crashed to desktop instantly. I thought ""Well it happens sometimes, I will just restart it."" So I did and it worked fine, I was able to set up the options I wanted in the options menu and away I went. The first chapter went by pretty fast, and the game with everything set to it's highest settings allowed ran like a dream. It was great! I decided that it was time to take a break for the night, I could return tomorrow. So the next day rolls around and I start the game up again, it immediately crashes. I restart it figuring it would be like the night before and the game just keeps crashing and crashing. I looked up many of the solutions and tried out all of them, and with the help of Pretty Prinny was finally able to get the game running again. Once again I am happy, and get to play through the second chapter of the game. I come up to the part where you need to get a level 10 item to advance. That means having to delve into the item world and subdue the masters and level up your items. About halfway through the first dungeon the game crashes once again. I am a bit annoyed, but decide it might have just been a one time thing. I go back to the game and proceed to do item world once again and this time not even into the second floor of the item the game crashes. At this point I am pretty frustrated. While crashes in the main storyline aren't too bad, in the item world it can be really bad considering you cannot save during the process. (There is an item you can get which lets you teleport out but I am sure it is limited and you have to purchase more from what I remember from the other versions.)So here I find myself writing this review, at the current time this game is really not worth it at all conidering how many problems I have had with it. It maybe an isolated case, but upon reading other peoples reviews and forum posts this game does crash quite a bit. Hopefully someday this will fix these problems."

,Recommended,405900,29365387,Posted: 19 January,all,Teemo Morgana,"Hello! First of, the one most important thing i'd like to mention is that i used to play this on DS, and have over 500 hours on my main savefile there. Now, lets get to the review of this game:Disgaea is a tactical RPG that has a grid-based turn taking battle system that plays similar to Final fantasy tactics, however there's some unique things aswell. One of the most important things is placement, and besides just walking, you can also throw characters and use displacing skills to move around, making the games strategical side very balanced. However, there's something for everyone, as if you don't like to use complicated strategies, it is also possible to just stat your way through almost anything, so however you'd like to play is going to work for you in the end.The story is great, following the adventures (and perhaps missfortune) of the Prince of the netherworld, Laharl, whom along with his vassals strives to get respect from the demons he rules over. In order to not spoil anything i just want to say that the story is well written for the most part, although some stuff is a bit predictable, some other things are really nice.The graphics in this game are very stylized, and therefore are pretty hit or miss. It follows a particular style of japanese style called anime/manga, with one of the people designing graphics having previously worked on Dragonball Z. It presents a very charming look, with a serious undertone, in a similar fashion (although in a very different way) to games like Binding of Isaac. new to the PC version are updated textures, sprites and just about everything else in the game having updated HD looks. they look very fine, although the Depth of field effect gets really annoying in the Item world. Fortunately, this is easy to deactivate, as is the new graphics if you'd like a throwback to the ps2, Psp or DS versions.Now, my personal opinion: I really love the game, which is incredibly funny as when i first played the game i found the game to be somewhat strange and somewhat offturning. The Music is very specific in it's style, and while very well composed, it might not really work for some people. Once you get past that (if it's even something you need to go past it to begin with) you'll sink alot of hours into this product. Everything in the game is well balanced to different levels of powers, which is amazing when you consider the fact that your stat growth and items strength are customizable. I find this to be a great feat, and something that should be appreciated.Following this point, i'm going to drop some spoilers, so if you find that you don't want to spoil anything from the game itself outside of what has been said, i'd like to finish with my score:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Music and Sounds: 6/10 (it gets repeditive, but you CAN turn it off aswell ^^)Story and dialogue: 7/10Overall experience: 8.5/10 (yes, the gameplay is the focus so it influenses this score for me the most)*******Spoilers ahead!********So, when it comes to End game, i find that this game does an extremely good job at challenging the player to go further. Starting with Prinny land, then to Human world, into cave of ordeal, alternative netherworld and then beaty castle, finishing with Baal castle. The climb to get stronger constantly feels rewarding as you see yourself grow to powerfully crush something that would slay you 20 hours ago.If you know exactly what you're doing, getting to the very end with defeating Prinny baal or Etna mode is easy, only taking a couple hundred hours, while a newcomer will find that this game can hold your attention for massive amounts of time. As stated in the beginning, i have over 500 hours on my DS save file, and i spent so much time maxing out my stats to the point where killing Prinny Baal goes in seconds. However, once you DO reach the very top by crushing these foes, the game does feel empty, as you've started getting used to feeling rewarded with further challenges and won't find more. Now, the most redeeming feature of this game is of course the item world, as it is probably where you'll spend most of your time and it actually feels rewarding to be there, even after you've defeated the stronger enemies you can find. Once again, it does start to drop of with no real conclusion in this department either."

I am going to say that it is a story can be hit or miss only because the only time I experienced it when I was 14 and liked it.The plot plays with tropes and surface layer of jRPGs. With very surface skimming:The main character, Laharl (the son of the late Overlord of the netherlord, King Krichevskoy) has to remind the contest for the throne that he is the heir to the throne, fend off the forces of [science fiction] human attackers, and infiltrate the Divine hosts of Celestia.

This is great if you are more into casual or story mode games.I would like to assert that the side game may require more knowledge on the matter, however. This will come naturally to hardcorers.Highly customizeable characters for stats that the player wants. The player can create characters to use in combat other than the unique characters.  Weapons are the only thing that show when equipt to a character (except monster characters).Max Level 9999 and reincarnations to level 1 for much high base stats.Damage multipliers to reach well beyond 100 thousand.Enemies too easy? Murder senators that deny you aStronger Enemiesbill in the Dark assembly.Being a game with a lot of menus, its pretty fluid.Graphics/MusicSprites with 3d environment.PS2-esque with optional/free new texture.The way the developers used their insturments with the special attacks maywowyou.Its music is unique to me or stands out enough to me for me to enjoy the remastered soundtrack.AchievementsFair and difficult.Story progression achievements (I want to say there is one for all alternate endings, but I cannot comfirm that at the time.)Damage done in one hit achievementsBounty slaying achievementsGrinding IncentivesPlayer supportNot a port'n'dumpThis isn't really about the game, but the program itself that needs to be said.First of all, in its current state it still crashes seemingly randomly on high end computers.When this game was first ported and released on PC, the game had issues. Some people couldn't get it to run, some high-end computers had fps issues, and some people had no issue whatsoever.  The company that released this diamond in the rough has been with the players, hearing their complaints on these issues, and have been working on those issues.  I am posting this review after the big issues.  I run on 60 fps usual with occassional fps drops and rare crashes.Seeing this get be fixed up fills me with joy to have founda video game company that respects their consumer.Edit log:1.My story mode edit will take a while longer. I just got my yo-shi-tsu-na and my savefile was lost due to steam cloud transfer overwriting the wrong save over it.2. Built back up and got the Hyperdrive. Game crashed while game was processing item's stats. Probably will say ""forget it"" to trying to get that again for a while.

There are some small things that I would've appreciated, like hiding certain assets (trees etc. can block your view of characters), being able to skip faster than holding tab, being able to zoom further back and so on.The only more substantial problem I've had with the game so far has been the Item World RNG. It's frustrating when you fight through 9 stages, and then the item boss spawns on an unreachable island (or even worse, you get stages that are practically or literally impossible to beat).The good totally outweighs the bad though, most of my complaints are really just matters of convenience. It's worth every penny for the gameplay and entertaining dialogue, and I hope they port more Disgaea games in the future."

The mechanics are easy to understand and you'll never have to look anything up online to make progress.It is a little bit grindy, but I don't mind so much since I'm having fun and you can mitigate that a bit by playing smart. You can level new character very quickly in the Item World by earning +EXP bonuses for instance. If you're the type of person who likes watching numbers go up to insane levels and going from a pauper to overleveled god, definately give this a go.Finally, the game is pretty much fully patched now and I haven't noticed any more issues.

I'm not big on turn-based strategy games for my inability to learn information in a short period of time and how they can feel slow and repetitive.Disgaea, however, has really interesting mechanics which can change how you play on different maps and with different character setups. The customization has a surprising amount of depth in it; you can create custom characters to add to your party as well as buffing your equipment to fit their playstyle. The combat system gives you a variety of options to defeat your opponents, along with class- and character-specific techniques.In essence, I thought I'd just play for a while and quit, but I'm really enjoying the freedom they give you.

Disgaea follows Laharl obnoxious prince of the netherworld and the only character i don't like, Etna his ""Vassal"" (She's more like a nanny out of respect for Laharls father) and Angel traniee Flonne (The token love intrest i guess) in a slice of life style story following 12 chapters of humor and fun. Disgaea is a short game in story but not post game with it's sequel coming out in december being the overall upgrade. A better main character a more developed story, way way way better music (Just look up Visual Sensation or white tiger), and FAR better mechanics and combat system. But overall disgaea 1 is once again Disgaea's Phantom blood a strong start that becomes better and better with every game.And the last thing to mention is a tip the character Plenair is super OP as a character who uses Guns easy to get even when you fight the boss known as ""Vyers"" or ""Mid boss"" lose to hit you start the game over but don't worry it's just the first 5 levels you get plenair by talking to her after restarting a new cycle or losing to Vyers in this case. talk to plennair and select the blank space and she joins your party. plenair can solo them plus shes easy to level up buying some health resoration items plenair can solo the Pormotion exam to a easy level 4 thus awarding your failure with a really too good key to sucess.

I collect all the game from console and portable and the spinoff even Phantom Brave.I'll be doing a Technical Review instead of a Game review because the game itself is already awesome and I know PC people have always wanted this game since the beginning so I support them. I recommend this game for its gameplay and humor and for the 1st time it officially comes to PC breaking its exclusive Console.But there is something SO WRONG with this Port!! I have to voice the technical issue!First off. The mouse cursor is annoying!! Sure Keyboard+Mouse is good but if I'm using a gamepad, the mouse cursor should disappear but instead it stays onscreen and messes up when you are trying to position your characters. I literally had to move the cursor offscreen. It just really messes up the game itself. Luckly there is an option to turn it off but the cursor will still stay in the screen. At least a turn off cursor button would be nice.Another is 50/50 about the Graphics working and not working.Also the options menu, is horrible. I think the SSAO or the Shadow is messing with the stutter clipping and such. There is so much fuzzy hazzy things going around. There are multiple people screenshotting their game with so many different problems.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631898655The screen end blur, normal map and Depth of Field needs to be disable.

But there has been reports of terrible FPS drop even with those of Powerful Rigs.I'm using 2 different laptops which is a Low-Mid End VAIO S and Mid-High GE70 2PE Apache Pro MSI Laptop. There is bad FPS Dipping so they need to fix that Optimization Problem.Note: I always have V-Synv off even on NVIDIA Task Panal customization. I just hate it when that thing is on.Fullscreen < Window modeSomehow, Window mode makes the gameplay much more smoother and faster while Fullscreen mode just slows things down... What is this? A Broken Emulator?Those with Inter-Graphics. The game will Default itself with Intel so you will have to open your Task Panel and force it to run into your Game Graphics Card.

Would I recommend it?Yes, if you have never tried Disgaea, and do not have access to a DS, PSP, nor PS2.Or else, I'd suggest you playing on them first for the time being. Reasons listed down below.Now, here comes the PROs and CONs== PRO ==It's on PC, which have a wide range of audiencesIt got steam sync, so you don't have to worry about your save file vs console savesThis version is the multilingual version, so you can switch between language whenever you feel like it. (I'm Taiwanese)It got graphical enhancement, with SSAO and stuffIt brings nostalgia back to the way how turn based tactic game can be so much funThe story is still great, dispite that it has been out over 12 years. Still brings tears whenever I'm on a certain cutscenes.Got tons of different ending (including secret ones) for lots of replaybility, also for the grind too *grins*Got the most intriging battle mechanism that I have ever experienced in a turn based tactic gameProbably the first turn based game to feature a procedurely generated maps (to my knowledge) for tons of challenges.Great sound track made by Tenpei Sato(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenpei_Sato)Great character artwork made by Takehito Harada(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takehito_Harada)Examples of latter 2 combined:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67M1SGJNxz4Honestly, I'd give this game a 99/10. But now, here we goes with the CON== CON ==This is probably the most important, which can be solved over time.This is NIS' first take on making a game on PC.So bugs exist, like all other reviews out there, there's been reports of many crashes, and slow FPS and such,however, I'm optimistic on this can be resolved over the course of time.Unlike all other Disgaea games that has been released, this game ported the PSP version, which does not have the following speed up options: Battle Movement, Text Speed, and Geo Chain. The above three things will make the whole game feel a lot slower than the pace that it wanted it to be.Since this is a PSP port, and PSP are missing two shoulder buttons, making the game unable to tilt the map, making certain areas hard to spot (especially those geo symbols)The keyboard / mouse control is ... meh. Differ from person to person. I still ended up using 360 controller though. However, it's still ok with the default mappings, just to a person that have played it with controller, I'm just too used to it. xDToo bad that NIS removed the most awesome song in the english version (which only existed on the PS2 version)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcBfdFn0sU8That's pretty much it, yeah. The over all experience with the PC version (since I've played PS2, PSP, DS, and now PC), still feels great, if you put aside the con's number 1 issue, which I'm sure NIS will get it resolved ASAP. So yeah. That's all about it now. Now go buy this game!"

Gameplay is fast and it's decided on the law of the biggest level. The pixel art is great and aged well.

I've read that it had a rocky start, but by the time I picked it up, those problems seemed to have been sorted out.  The game sells itself as a tactics RPG, but I consider it more of a puzzle box.  Each scenario is set up around a unique challenge, and if you're not particularly up to that challenge it's totally possible to just brute force that sucker.  The game is littered with levels that are clearly set up in order to make grind out levels easy for just that purpose.Playing with a keyboard and mouse feels weird to me, so I recommend a gamepad.  However, I use a steam controller for this and I've mapped the right touchpad to a mouse so I can use it as a pointer from time to time to make selection a bit easier.  Getting used to the way the game handles facing in isometric is a bit weird, and it's less of an issue with that configuration."

For now, I just wanted to point out a couple of things.First, I was VERY disappointed that Etna's voice is not the same as before. The original voice actress was perfect for the part, and this one is just playing second fiddle. It will definitely take some getting used to, and I hope it doesn't curb my enjoyment of the game entirely. It's hard to believe such a small detail can change the immersion so much, but it does. Evidently the voice actress in this has been present since the remake and sequels, none of which I had the luxury to try. So for those of you who never played the very first game on Playstation 2, you won't even notice a difference.Second, as of launch, it's probably best to disable some options such as Screen End Blur, Depth of Field, and SSAO, as they honestly make the game look worse. Most of the other options are probably more of a preference thing, and even though it's not as ""smooth"" or pretty, I kind of prefer the old user interface and map textures. I'm having a hard time telling if the music is actually different or the same, but it sounds slightly off to me. Maybe I'm just remembering wrong, as it has been something like 10 years since I actually played Disgaea.Anyway, all in all, it is Disgaea, so I'm sure it's still a good game, and I'm not going to give it a negative review or anything unless I feel it deserves it after playing it.

Mage with guns, Fighters using spells, Ninjas being impossible to hit, yet it is all possible.For anyone new to the game I would say that I would recommend it but the difficulty curve is a bit high so grinding is needed. Well basically the whole game you grind to make your people stronger and go into items to make them stronger for your people to use. It is possible to get to level 9,999 but at the end of a standard playing you would get to without excessive grinding around level 100 or so.

In a nutshell , it is a traditional RPG with a heavy emphasis on grinding. This may or may not please people, really depends on how you like your RPGs. Though I haven't even completed this game yet, the quests I have gone through are really entertaining and sometimes very odd. The game mechanics in Disgaea PC are actually rather deep if you choose to utilize them, though as a in game NPC says you don't have to if you don't want to (to beat the game). From my own experience after playing for  40 hours I'm realizing how much this game has to offer and how much I haven't even touched yet.So if you're looking for a traditional grindy RPG to pass the time and don't mind some anime like humor interspersed with some heavy moments I recommend you pick this game up."
,Recommended,405900,21453396,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Jaarka,"As a life-long fan of the Disgaea series, I anxiously awaited the PC debut. A chance to play it again, steam achievements, and the possibility of series support on my platform of choice?! Sign me up, Dood!Then, news of a high-profile gaming website slamming the port as ""shoddy"" and ""unacceptable"" started to circulate. I became nervous, and worried that NISA had dropped the ball and doomed my favorite series before it even properly released. Will it be unplayable? Are the graphics options all screwed up? Will it control terribly? I decided to wait patiently for my preorder to unlock and test it myself...I am happy to report that none of the issues that article reported exist, in my experience. It appears, from doing some research, that the problems reported are entirely random and/or isolated instances that may be due to optimization conflicts. What does that mean to you, review-reader? Well, you could have a perfect experience like I have had thus far: solid 60FPS, zero screen tearing, wonderful mouse response (playing Disgaea with a mouse was something I NEVER expeected to enjoy, but here I am not even hooking up my controller!), and wonderful audio quality. Or you could have less-than-perfect performance, some of which is solveable with a few tweaks on your end. NISA has started collecting data from users who are experiencing issues, so hopefully all of that will be solved in short-order.Now, this isn't without a few words of warning: some of the new settings are, quite frankly, garbage. Blurring the edge of the screen? PASS! Blurring the characters so that they don't look like their original pixel art style? No way, Dood! Personally, I really like the new (HD) menu style, and the enhanced map graphics. The fact that you have the option to toggle ALL of the changes is fantastic, and I'm glad that NISA realized that the PC community likes to customize their experiences individually.If you're interested in a classic Strategy RPG (this is a port of the PSP version, a decade old, of a game that originally released on the PS2 in 2003) that shows a bit of age, but hasn't lost an ounce of the brilliant humor and tactics that made it the cult hit that it was, do yourself a favor and check out Disgaea PC. I can't recommend it enough, and I really hope that the rest of the series begins to make it to Steam in the future. Get out there and get your Overlord on!"

,Recommended,405900,21437978,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,LudvigXIV,"I post this on release day and for now Disgaea PC experiences some heavy graphical issues - FPS drops, slowdowns, weird glitches and maybe something more for other people. However, I consider it a minor problem, which will be fixed someday soon.Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is one of my favourite games of all time. It has funny dialogues, engaging story, vivid characters and great design, but it is not a compensation for the poor gameplay - on the contrary, gameplay of Disgaea is pretty complex and it gives you a lot of freedom to create your own way to play. This freedom and customizability of gameplay is something that can rarely be seen in Japanese TRPG's (and not only them), so Disgaea is somewhat unique. You can make yourself an army of different demonic underlings, or use main characters, you can use classic weapons for each class, or you can give a handgun to your barbarian - it's up to you. Grinding to LV9999 is not just a simple hack'n'slash through the enemies over and over again (it is possible, though) - it is a quest to find an effective way to maximize your characters to the top. Make your enemies stronger, upgrade your weapons (by beating it from the inside, lol), transmigrate and become super strong. It is not a mandatory task, though - you can just beat campaign stages without any addition grinding at all, but you will have to use your head to be effective in battle and solve different puzzles in a process. Throwing and color_panels mechanics make this game even deeper, so prepare to think a lot.So, imo Disgaea is a great game and if you haven't played it - you most definitely should. As I said earlier, PC port is experiencing some technical issues in the day of release (for example, I can't see proper animations, have some problems with layers and there is no visible Base Panel at the start of the level, just an empty spot on a map, which I need to remember), so it would be wise to wait for developers to correct all these issues (and I guess that it will be done soon enough), and then to buy this wonderful game.For those who already bought it and trying to make the game work/trying to refund - just wait for a bit. No game is perfect on a release day. A lot of people mentioned it, but if you turn off all these fancy options, such as SSAO, V-Sync, Depth Field, Character Filter, etc, you may solve your problems. Somebody even solved them by pluggin in their gamepad - so if you have one, try to use it (Disgaea, being a console game, should be played with a gamepad, after all).Let us be patient and trust Nippon Ichi - I am sure that they will fix stuff and we will have our Disgaea on PC. And when that happens, I wil rewrite this review, dood."

Recommended.------------------------As always, my recommendation comes with a disclaimer that your experiences will vary. Please read through at least the next paragraph.Let's tackle everyone's main issue with this port... performance. Good God, launch day was a disaster for a lot of players, even those with high-spec PCs. But, interestingly enough, I have a mid-tier rig running 2.5-year-old hardware (i5-4460 3.2GHz + R7 260X 2GB), and Disgaea PC works fine. I'm honestly not sure where everyone's frame drops are coming from. I tested using new/old map textures, SSAO (which I didn't like personally, but it still didn't impact my performance too much), and all the other minor graphical tweaks...no sudden drop in FPS for me. So I'm probably really lucky that it runs perfectly fine... and as such I'm going to ignore factoring in performance for my review. Just be warned that if the game doesn't run smoothly for you, the rest of this review is pointless and you should return this game until NISA (Nippon Ichi Software, America) sorts things out.NISA seems to be on point and fixing a lot of the issues with the game's performance currently, as Disgaea PC's rating has increased from 67% (Mixed) to 85% (Very Positive) after the first few weeks of bug fixes.Disgaea PC is a port of Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP, which is an enhanced remake of the original PS2 title, Hour of Darkness. This is the third remake of Hour of Darkness, after Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea DS for Nintendo DS systems.Disgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done. I love grindy games, and so I figured Disgaea was right up my alley. Sure enough, I've played and enjoyed the hell out of Hour of Darkness and Cursed Memories. Haven't played 3, 4, D2, or 5 yet since I don't own a PS3/4.Another highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.I'd have to argue a minor problem with the mechanics is just how many different systems they've jammed into this game. There's the tactical combat, which is simple enough to understand... then they introduce Geo Panels and Effects, Lifting and Throwing allies, enemies, and Geo Effects...the Dark Assembly, Pupils, Skill/Stat Inheritance between Master and Pupil, the Item World, Reincarnation (Transmigration in this version), and some mechanics the game doesn't even cover such as Elemental Affinities (Fire, Wind, Ice), Status Effects, and Weapon Masteries. For a newcomer this may seem like a daunting amount of things to learn about... and believe me, it is. However, all of these things don't need to be used...in fact the game even tells you, you can beat the game with ""minimal game knowledge"". The systems are there to provide hardcore players the means to be more efficient in grinding out those stats.I won't go into nor analyze the story (because I suck at analysis and not spoiling), but I will say it's decent and humorous enough to suffice as an RPG plot. I also will not criticize the graphics because I don't really care for them, but the port made the map and character art look better than the PS2 graphics. There is also an option to change the graphics back to the old PS2 game, for that old nostalgic feel (I guess). EDIT: I completely forgot about the Keyboard+Mouse (the mouse kinda messed the cursor movement up for me, so I turned it off...but you could technically play the game using just the mouse if you wanted to... also mouse click detection is a bit bugged) and Gamepad support (which is a little clunky to detect). That's there as well. I suppose I should also add that the port added custom resolution support. (you can resize the screen to your desire)Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. Good for RPG fans, grind-fest lovers, and people who just want a lot of content for their buck.Score Breakdown:Story/Plot/Characters: 9/10(each character seems unique in their own way, dialogue gave me a couple laughs, story was dramatic at times - but not overly so when it was)Music: 8/10(pretty good soundtrack, still waiting for my digital dood/pre-order soundtrack bonus)Graphics/Art: 5/10(has a nice theme to it, but even with the new textures the game looks dated, plus the new character filter thing just blurs the pixels so your characters look like a smudge on the screen... wtf?)Mechanics: 8/10(lots of cheesing you can do with unit movement, lifting, and AoE attacks, probably intentionally made to be cheesed... overall great but slightly clunky mechanics)Value: 10/10(hours and hours and hours and hours of content and grind)Performance: 8/10(works fine on my rig - stays notably above 60fps most of the time - others not so much... EDIT: I am now getting crashes more often, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the math and numbers are getting too high? Either way, dropping 2 points off performance. It shouldn't be crashing because of memory leaks or integer over/underflow.)Oh yeah, I should add: Buy it for the Prinnies, dood!"

The game has lots of contents that I guess can argue for its price tag, even though the game is 13 years old.That said, my old PSP ran the game better than my PC. I can see some effects causing a brief lag. Buttons are not even properly labelled unless you use a mod. Not to mention few crashes here making it annoying sometimes. Are these gaming breakingly bad? Not really. Are these disappointing? Yes, 13 years old game that ran fine on my old PSP shouldn't be this finnicky on PC.I am not sure whether I can recommend the PC version when other versions run fine compared to this.Not to mention, the game doesn't add anything new. I remember ports adding new things to the game. PSP version added Etna mode, whereas PC version just seem to be direct port of PSP version without adding anything new (i.e. one of the user mod I think was adding the contents that were added on DS version).So they charge $20 for a 13 year old game without adding anything new to the game. Newer fans would probably enjoy this game and older fan would probably ""enjoy"" the game, as it's just the same game from 2003.

I'm not someone who plays games with ease, by this, I mean that it's really hard for me to get into a game, most games I played, both offline and online, have been boring to me, or I simply felt like I was too stupid to grasp the concept.Not with Disgaea. I played this on the PSP for an approximate 100 hours already, but playing it back when it was years since I was able to have this much fun was truly amazing. I'm going to review this based on gameplay more than my personal enjoyment and nostalgia, though.The gameplay system itself is pretty simple, straight to the point and basic. You level up your characters by killing monsters, using both normal attacks and special attacks that cost SP.The game has shops, a hospital, a truly infinitely fun ITEM WORLD in which you can level up your own items.It runs more than smoothly on my system, which is mid-tier, or simply 'good' for today's gaming, so don't worry about that.The soundtrack during fights is simply... amazing. Fits the game very well.The characters are very easy to get attached to.. aside from the main protagonist.(not that I spent most of my hours transmigrating etna on psp and making her stronger than laharl.. hehe...)Worth every dollar.

They quickly addressed the issue and patched it so it can be played again, which is commendable since I have had MANY games in which the devs pretty much gave the finger and let it remain a buggy, unplayable mess since they already got their money.While I can't speak for everyone, the gamebreaking bugs have completely fixed with me.

The first Disgaea game had, IMO, the best writing and characters and a good voice acting cast.  Most of the bugs and technical issues have been fixed as of this writing, but some people still get the odd crash, mainly in long Item World sessions, so take that into consideration.As for this port in particular, the new UI looks nice though the other graphic options are a bust.  Keyboard and mouse work just fine if you don't have a gamepad and can all be remapped.   The multiplayer from the PSP version didn't make it though, along with the special characters you got from it.  It's a not a big loss IMO, but it's worth mentioning.  The best part of the PC port though is that you can use memory editors to do fun things like unlock the advanced classes early on, or allow monsters to more easily keep their level up instead of being left in the dust while you just solo everything with Laharal.Overall since the patches I'd recommend it if you want a decent sRPG on PC.  Most people will be able to play through the game without incident now, and it's worth playing through if you never had a PS2 or PSP.

Yep pretty absurd like that and it sums up the story pretty well! All the npc are likewise interesting and crazy!- Anyway, the game is about your team of 10 peeps at a time on a map defeating the enemy. You can have a lot more than 10 toons in your army, but only 10 can fight at the same time. You can switch to another toon if you want by switching out one of the active one on the map. The fight is all about positioning yourself at the right place and also protecting yourself from the enemy who will try to gang up on one of your toon if you let it.- You can raise your level to 9999+. Yeah thats a loooooot of lvl!- You can eventually do millions in damage. In fact, damage becomes rediculus pretty fast!- You can increase the level and stats of all items including weapons and accessories. Even one-use items that restore your skill points can be increased by doing the maps in the item world. Yes, there are random maps in each item with special npc that you can beat and then transfer to other items to improve their stats even more! This concept is pretty awesome!!!- You can decide to rebirth any of your character into another class! They start back at lvl 1 but keep a lot of their stats and all their skills from the original class. So you could have a mage that becomes a ninja or a fighter with lots of evade or hp. Imagine a lvl 1000 character that restart at lvl 1 with genius rebirth (keep 95% of his original stats). Then he can regain stats from his new class pretty fast!- You got a dark council of senators (much like USA congress) that you need to bribe and/or subdue so that they vote your way in many ordinances. Even when you bribe them all to your side, they can still vote against you the little rascals! Don't know why it makes me think of house of cards so much!!!- The tactics and the fact you can lift your toons and even the enemies and throw them give a lot of tactical choices on the map like you wouldn't believe.- The game is somewhat a bit steep on the learning curve at first because there is a loooot to discover, but after you get the hang of it, it becomes a lot easier to play, but still keep that somewhat deep tactical strategy level."

While some of them raise actual concerns, most are just people not caring enough to go look at the options or following advice (Tried to help a few peeps, answers were along the lines of ""ok game sucks go away"")My potato of a computer (AMD Athlon II X2 250, ATI Radeon HD 4800 series~~) also runs the game flawlessly, with no visual or audio stuttering."

Seriously why thumbs up a game simply based on the franchise alone? that's like thumbing up Dragon Age 2.....simply because it's the 2nd Dragon age agme and DAO was amazing.Those looking for a genuine review with harsh truths please look here.NOTICE! Yes this is Disgaea in all of it's glory yes i love the franchise i've owned every game to date excluding the DS port because...well...didn't have a DS at the time lol But i'm a die hard fan of the franchise and was soooo excited when i saw this listed that for the first time in at least 5 years since SKYRIM i pre-ordered a game.NOW THAT THATS OUT OF THE WAY.This game has a TON of issuesGraphical issues come down to 3 major and i do mean major problemsSSAO as people have pointed out breaks the visuals entirely with graphical glitches like messed up black lines all over the place. Turnning this off in turn removes the graphical glitches but SSAO should NEVER be the cause of such a thing and thus needs dire fixes.Resolution: this is probably the biggest one because it's tied to a bunch of problems. For starters, trying to run this game in full screen (there is no borderless? why?) completely breaks the game entirely. Upon going into full screen (for me) the game minimized......and refused to come back up......when ever i tried to maximize the window again it would just go right back down after a few seconds and the ONLY way i got it to stay up long enough to go back into windowed mode was to rapidly spam click my mouse on the window as it came up. it was extremely frustrating and this was all with in the first few seconds of loading the game up for the first time NOT EVEN IN GAME YET TECHNICALLY.now back to the resolution issue. This port is clearly a port from the PSP or DS version of the game because OH GOD the graphics are soooo blurry. Turning off every graphical enhancement makes it look worse like it's running sub 480p and resizing the window just makes it even more stretchy and blurry. Character filter is absolutely pointless beause regardless of it being on or off the characters are pixelated to no end. Seriously they NEED to update the sprites for this game to play it on PC.the third graphical issue is more on a performance side of things. the menus take FOREVER to bring up and the scrolling text for things like tutorials and talking to NPCs in general do not have a speed adjuster. You can not alter this so if you accidentally talk to that one NPC that just won't stop talking....guess what? .....tough luck....you're stuck spamming your buttons away until the text goes away. PATCH IN SCROLLING TEXT SPEED OPTIONS PLEASE!Now onto the rest of the....issues....controls. if you have a regular controller you are set, it's fairly easy to figure out the game with that. If you're on a mouse and keyboard like myself, yes you have rebindable keys, BUT THE BUTTON PROMPTS ON SCREEN DO NOT MATCH YOUR KEYBOARD HOTKEYS. To skip tutorial story stuff when selecting a map it says 4? i pressed 4....nothing happened......what does this 4 mean? OH it means the 4th button for your CONTROLLER. Good job! SO IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS IM USING. On the flip side this is just a minor inconvenience as the menus and game as a whole can be completely played and controlled via mouse. Your keyboard doesn't even need to be touched as a matter of fact. the menus are accessed via left click over a character and right click over an open space to bring up the regular main menus for ending your turn or swapping out equipment and checking on character stats. But as i pointed out, the menus and controls as a whole are just sooo off in terms of responsiveness. you can click twice on the screen and nothing happens when trying to pull up the main menu. it's very frustrating when the game itself runs at a perfect 60FPS for me. This is the first time a Jrpg of any kind has run so smoothly in terms of framerate on PC for me since most Japanese game developers don't put much effort into optimization in general for PC. Then again considering how old this game is IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKING THAT IT RUNS AT 60FPS.Seeing as i have less than 1 hour of gameplay i have no clue what the rest of the game is yet but just think.....it took me nearly one hour just to get into the game, get past the first 2-3 battles.......and create my first character........HOW!? I CAN DO THIS SO MUCH FASTER ON MY PS3 OR PS2! It's soooo frustrating because this franchise is my favorite one....period....nothing on my games list compares to how much i like this franchise as a whole. So please NISA....FIX THIS GAME SO WE CAN PLAY IT PROPERLY ON PC!yes i will say i recommend this game, BUT THIS IS A HEAVY HEAVY WARNING THAT THIS GAME IS NOT A GREAT OR EVEN GOOD PORT. THIS GAME IS SLOPPY ON PC. SO TAKE MY WARNING SERIOUSLY. The game at launch is not worth the 20$ they are asking for even tho the franchise as a whole is well worth the 60 they generally charge for each new game."

Sure it gets a little grindy sometimes, but you can get through the main story without too much grinding (though you should reincarnate at least once, making you have to re-level, but with higher stats, allowing you to one shot some early enemies).It works fine for me, even at the highest graphical settings, im not sure why it's giving other people issues, no visible delays for me. The mouse controls are fine, so if the controller gives you issues, you can always switch over. (Besides many pc gamers prefer mouse controls).

It has been ported a few times before to the ds and psp and i have played every version of this game that has come out. While initially this port needed a bit of work they got everything patched and i can say this is a very well done port it includes everything from previous ports and adds more. I wont spoil everything but there is more end game content and a bit early as well. The controls are ok for KBM but can all be changed to your liking. Control support is great as everything again can be remapped and ther game recognizes your controller and adds the actual button pictures in the game (ie. like at dialog instead of an arrow or a button 1 it has a picture of the A or X button) This port also allows you to choose the cursors and item portraits you want out of the game series as a whole which is very nice.Port 10/10Disgaea is your tile turn based rpg with plenty of levels and items. The story is much more humorous then serious in any way as you gather a rag tag team of many races and personalities on your way to become the overlord of the netherland. It is mildly difficulty  but that can be changed with how much you level grind. It is possible to play this game through with a horde of characters, a few select, or even just a single charcter you overlevel a bit making it possible to play to your preferance. Its a bit lacking in strategy in the main story play as the main strategic point in the game (geos) are quite one dimensional. They do make up for that a bit by having a randomly generated dungeon you can go into whenever that has plenty of depth of strategy whether you get to the end using a geo combo to kill everyone or just make it to the portal down (you can also just brute force kill everyone).  There is full voice acting in both english and japanese and its all well done and translated well. My main problems with this game are the lack of a large amount of strategic depth, the amount of level grinding, and the lack of much end game content.  Overall though the game is very fun and quite good 9/10The end game content is different endings you can achieve a second story that plays the game in a different perspective and one specific ending is level grinding through the levels and unlockable maps which takes a long time.Avoid this game if you dislike level grinding, tile turn based rpgs (duh) or want a game that you can play for +100 hours as even though i enjoy this game a lot and have played all versions id say i have about 120 hours worth of play time over 10 years or so."

My hours are a lie on this game, as it's an oldie, i've wasted 100's of hours on both the Ds and Playstation versions and couldn't be happier about it.This is by far one of my favourite games, I can't wait to pump some hours into it again , although it's a daunting task.You have so much content to rift through, multiple endings, unlocking classes, the crazy leveling system and reincarnation system literally makes the replayability factor amazing. Don't be suprised if you spend 100 hours on this game and still want more. If you like spending hours improving your equipment and characters or just in general micro managing/Unlocking dungeons and characters this game is what you need in your life. You can pick it up and go whenever you want.I won't spoil the story, its definitely engaging and rich, the characters are really fun to play with, not your usual I'm going to save everyone and be loved type of deal, combined with a quirky soundtrack its a must for any Rpg/Team Strategy Fan.P.S there is an anime for those interestedI would highly recommend this game DOOD"
,Recommended,405900,21435060,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,TheVulpineHero1,"Note: Review edited 03/03/2016.Currently, the game runs very slowly. While there are no resolution options in the in-gamne menu, by going to window size ""user"" and dragging the window, you can enlarge the screen. In terms of actual content, it's pretty much the DS port with nicer menus and an updated spriteset, which isn't unwelcome, but also has a bunch of semi-superfluous graphics options that seem to be bogging down the gameplay experience and causing odd bugs. Japanese VA track is present, though -- can't remember if that made it into the DS port, but it certainly wasn't in the original ps2 version.A few options I'd like to see, above and beyond or in addition to an overall speed optimisation, are options to control the speed the text scrolls at, as well as a way to move quickly in the castle without using the mouse support. (Mouse support, by the way, seems completely fine.) Game is playable, at least for me, but I'd advise skipping through cutscenes and turning off all animations because of the slowness -- which is sad, since the humour and attack animations are quite nice.All in all, February seems like it's been a bad month for highly anticipated ports of popular games. Street Fighter V was highly anticipated and released half-finished with a ridiculous price tag, Tales of Symphonia was a collosal wreck of a port, and now Disgaea is having problems, both with the pre-order soundtrack and the game itself. Hopefully, there'll be some speedy improvements from the devs based on customer feedback; like many people, I was super hyped for this launch and would love to have supported further Disgaea and NIS titles coming to Steam, but I can't really do that if the ports are going to be mediocre. Until fixes appear, pass.Edit: The devs have released fixes, which at least in my own experience, have provided a lot of improvement. While there's still a little while to go (some graphics options aren't super stablised, cave of ordeals 3 crashes), the response from the dev team has been very good and I as a customer feel confident that these issues will be addressed in time. For now, this is far less of a gamble than it used to be, so if you enjoy yourself that crunchy core of Disgaea gameplay, I can recommend it."

Maybe I just lucked out and ended up playing one of the best games the genre has to offer but wow, what a game. Consider this a reccomendation from someone who couldn't have even imagined themselves enjoying a game like this before my first few hours with it.The story is pretty enjoyable too, a bit too 'b-tier anime' for my taste at times but certainly motivated me to continue playing up to where I currently am at the time of writing this review, the start of chapter eleven. The comedy present throughout is pretty top-notch though, I was absolutely sold on that aspect of the game after the first few tutorial levels. I can guarentee you'll at least crack a smile at SOME point while playing this game.Having never played the original PS2 game or it's PSP release I can't willingly assert this is the worst port ever, but the fact a game this graphically simplistic experiences slow down on even modern iGPU solutions seems a bit off, from footage I've seen pre patch the game was a lot worse than this though, I have to at least admire the developers desire to rectify their mistakes.I'm very much looking forward to finishing the main story off and then delving into the wealth of post-game content on offer. For the first game in it's series Disgaea must have absolutely blown people away back in 2004, I might be late to the party but it's a party I'm not in any rush to leave.I've yet to try Disgaea 2 PC but I can guarentee you it is right at the top of my most wanted list right now, the fact a series like this made it's way to PC at all is pretty damn cool and I really hope 3, 4 or God forbid even 5 make their way to the PC eventually, that'd be fantastic."

I could sit through ten missions because often they'd only take a turn or two to complete.  Three or four if I was lining up for a geo-d combo to get sweet sweet bonus points.The story line clearly has it's fair share of humor, it's a humor based game after all.  While a some of the jokes made me smile or chuckle (nin-nin-nin), others are more... japanese zaney humor that might not really stick with the audience that cares little for anime.  Myself included, not a big fan of anime things really.Each weapon type feels unique and fluent and you can equip any weapon on humanoid classes, though some weapons fit more naturally for some classes, you can feel free to experiment.

The Gatekeeper also happened to be on a tile that had both of these so I had to quit the game. This was more or less within my first 2 hours. And even after that, I still loaded my save up and carried on playing, even went back to the item world only to lose again on the 10th floor thanks to a case of ""So near yet so far"" on the exit tile and even then, I still went back to the game.Basically, Disgaea is a very addicting game, and I'm so glad it's found it's way onto the PC.Personally for me there are some frame rate issues when using certain moves as well as a fixed resolution but don't let that put you off.The characters are just as brilliant and sometimes more cringey than I remembered, the soundtrack is incredible and the fact that you can level up not only your characters but your items as well is what makes this game a joy to always go back to.

I was looking forward to the mouse controls, as I feel SRPGs can be controlled extremely well with the mouse, and I was throughly dissappointed. Said controls are excessively touchy, and have caused several poor movements (lift and throw) already (5 chapters in), and 2 glitches, one of which crashed my game. However, the instant saving is phenominal, and I would love to see more of the features from other games implemented, such as the more forgiving movement (obviously you can cancel your movements, but in later installments you can just re-move until you actually act). I also would really like to see more of the series ported to the computer, espcially if they work on the mouse controls more.TLDR: If you own another version, don't bother.

Yes.Since you are reading these reviews you must be torn to get this game or not. If you have only played the newer Disgaea games - Ie, 4.D2. and 5, I would stay away from the computer port, and just  emulate the psp/DS version of it, as it had a few nice Quality of life features, such as faster dialog. If you have played all of them before, give this game a chance.Gameplay- Disgaea follows a typical TRPG system- Make unit, Select unit, Move unit, Kill unit. Gain exp... Oh, and throw Prinnys Dood. The place where Disgaea is different, is the exp system. Most games let you go to level 99, or if your lucky 999. Disgaea says no to that, with a soft level cap of 9999 and a 'optimal' level cap of  186,000.Given that TRPG's are the best kind of RPG's I have to give this part a 9/10Story- Demons, Demonesses, Angels, Flonnes, Prinnys. You play as Laharl; a 1313 year old demon child, who has just awoken from a 2 year slumber to find out that his father, King Krichevskoy, ruler of the Netherwold is dead. This has caused most of the Kings vassals to take off, or to try to take Laharls place as the overlord. Thus, Laharl needs to take the throme back by force.8/10. Probably the best story in the Disgaea series,  A good mix of comedy, story telling, and drama.(My personal story ranking- 1,2,5,4,3, D2)Port- I have not put enough time into the game to give this too much thought, however, it seems to be an almost identical port to the Psp version, with a few extra options added. The options are- New maps, new sprites (Which look terrible) New menus, V-sync, screen size, SSAO, DOF, Screen Blur, and Shadows. (30-60 FPS)7/10. Not much to say, seems like a straight port.Performance- This is where the problem lies for some people. Do you have an AMD GPU? Your in for a bad time. Do you like the new features they added? (V-sync, SSAO, ect) Your in for a bad time. Luckily for me, I have neither of the main problem causers, so the game runs at a smooth 60 fps.9/10. This score is only based on the performance I get.Overall score- 8/10.  It's a decent port of a great series with a few quality of life features missing. If you like the series and want NIS to port more of the series, go ahead an give em $20.(For context- Running Windows 7, GTX 970, 16GB, i7-4770)"

My wife still hates the game because she has ""no idea what the hell is going on with all of those tiles exploding over and over"".

If this is your first time through the game, expect 100+ hours of gameplay for main story and Etna Mode. Otherwise, if you have played this before only get it if it is on sale. Not only does it keep the majority of the original bugs but introduces new ones. However the new layout seems great. Overall I recommend this, but beware if you have played it before.

This should fix all of your problems with graphical and performance issues.The controls are wonky at best. I reccomend a controller more than the other options. The mouse doesn't register that you've clicked sometimes, so if you are using a mouse, hitting K while hovering over something is probably better than using left click. Keyboard controls are not very good but not very bad, ""meh"" if you will.The newly added textures are good but some are lower res than others, which can look a bit weird. Also, you cannot speed up text prompts and the settings menu is really weird, this is more of a bit of annoyance. Note that there is no borderless window mode, resolution settings.Overall I reccomend this game to anyone who can put up with these issues and has played a SRPG (like FF:Tactics), but it is not acceptable to release a game in this state.Will update the more I play."

The character textures were not updated but a filter was added to smooth them which in my opinion makes it look worse. However, you have the option to turn that off. The UI has been redone and also has the option to use the classic version of that but considering how well done the new one is I think that is better. The animations during cut scenes are crisp and clear also.As far as the actual game goes it has a quirky ridiculous story but that is not its main attraction. The main attraction is the fact that everything can level up in this game. You can literally take a basic HP pot that restores 100 health and level it up so it restores 10,000. It is the same for every item in the game including weapons and armor. Your characters can level up to 9999 and there is loads of content for people who make it to that high of a level. You can transmigrate your characters back down to level 1 and level them up all over again.

Again, I'm not saying they have a good reason, or that no one should give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ quite the opposite, just saying it's hardly an issue.That was it.Many were having problems FPS and such, and those who were, were on a GTX 980Ti.I, never experienced this though.PC controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ get literally, any controller.by that I mean modern console controllersThe buttons they have use 1-10 rather than whatever controller you're using.So instead of A B X Y/shapes you have 12345678The controls on the controller aren't even finished believe it or not.What I mean is, you wanna zoom out? well you have to use Square/X and Left trigger!Rather than just using left bumper or trigger...Yeah, this was ported from the PSP supposedly, if so they certainly did upgrade alot.

Oh sure it went in, but it's not a square.""Just use the old option in settings""This uses the old blurry drawings though. The GUI looks like it was squeezed into a small box for 2 months, then pulled out and slapped in. it's scaled horridly, basically.There is new voice acting, but the only one to absolutely frustrate me to no bounds was Etna's.Maybe it's a new voice actor, but this is the worst acting having nothing to do with what's going on I've ever heard.And you know something, the voice acting, it's good, really good, the voice actor fits Etna very well.""So why's it bad?""It sounds like the VA was either reading the entire script from the ending to the top, or was emailed the lines to take, never played Disgaea, never saw disgaea, nor had someone to tell her ""this is how you emote this scene""It's like she was blind to the entire situation that the story and her character took place in. It's so out of place.If you disagree, then you've no doubt got 0 idea on how voice acting works. As a voice actor myself, this♥♥♥♥♥♥ is wildly unnacceptable. The old Etna voice actually fit the scene, there was clear direction.

Humorous stories with some surprisingly emotional moments that make you adore the characters. Takehito Harada's varied, vibrant character designs. The catchy tunes by Tenpei Sato.The original Disgaea, now ported here to Steam, is where it all started. The port's had a bit of a rocky start--mixed performance for many (but with temporary solutions present). NIS has thankfully made it clear (quickly and detailed, too) that they are aware and are working to solve the issues. That's plenty more initiative than other developers grant. Give it a go despite what you've heard; even if it doesn't work well on your system no matter what you try, it's still playable enough and there's an effort to fix out there.As far as the first Disgaea compares to its peers, it certainly has one of the most well-woven marriages of story and characters in its grand scheme. Unfortunately, to be honest, having played the living daylights out of later games in the series, I found myself constantly missing nice things implemented later and the snail's pace by comparison. Don't let that deter you though, the first Disgaea is still an incredibly fine game and I just hope that later installments land on Steam as well!"

The artwork and character design is charming, the story can hook you right from the beginning, and the combat system is fun and interesting.Disgaea PC, unfortunately, is a bad version of the game. It crashes every twenty minutes, sometimes the voice acting disappears, and it suffers from screen tearing at the larger resolution of a full-screen mode. The buttons for controller keybinding are labeled with numbers instead of letters, and while there's an option for Japanese voice-acting, choosing it means you get no voice acting.Honestly, I've enjoyed what I could play of the game. Despite frequent crashes and forced restarts, I've cleared the tutorial, created a new minion (a cleric), and enjoyed myself immensely. So I'm torn between returning it because the crashes make it nearly unplayable, and keeping it because what little I can play has been deeply enjoyable.So I'm not recommending this game, but if the game gets a new patch (the developers are still working at it) that fixes the crashing, that will change in a heartbeat."

If you have an Xbox One controller the game runs fine. The only annoying thing about the controls is that the game doesn't change the commands on screen to match the controller.

Maybe it's just me; I haven't played the PS2 version in a couple years, but I remember her voice sounding different, and some of the dialogue differently. They also took out the zoom out button, which is a huge pain in the butt. It's excusable though.I was really upset about the graphical changes. I didn't like the updated textures and whatnot... but then I discovered that the old textures are still in the game, and that you can turn them on or off in the settings. You can even change the peripherals in the menu to look like the original game. Which is great.Overall, I haven't played enough of it yet to pass final judgment, but I think I prefer the PS2 version which is sad considering this came out 13 years ago... but we'll see. I'll update my review after a couple more hours. I'll recommend it for now, because this is still Disgaea, which is a legendary game.

76561198051547341,Recommended,405900,34316368,Posted: 17 August,all,Delimon,"This game was released with a few problems but most of those are fixed now and I'm more than happy to write a review for it.This game will absorb hours of your time with it's endless amount of content and the game ends when you decide it does rather than the game forcing you to dosomething else. So you could realistically keep playing this game for years and keep progressing your characters.The story is pretty funny but I somewhat wish that the voice acting was a little better but overall it was pretty decent.As for the gameplay itself it starts off sluggish and slow but the more your progress the more avenues you have open to you. For example, it probably took me around 25-30 in-game hours to hit level 100 for the first time.  When I respeced my MC it only took me an hour to reach that point again and being even stronger than previusly and learned a new move when I hit level 100 as well. So you definitely have the option to keep leveling your characters and it should not take forever after you play through the story and unlock some of the better levels.The assembly can be a pain as each character has seperate senators and it took a very long time just to get one of mine to have a good standing with all of them to pass the things that I wanted.As for the cast there is a very diverse amount of characters that you can use and you can seriously vary your team compositions to your liking. Want to have a squad full of ninjas? Well go for it, nothing is stopping you other than having to fight the class once and unlocking it for creation. And if you save up enough mana to make the character a genius it'sthat much easier to level them and they are that much more powerful as well.The concept of the item world was really interesting and very difficult. One thing that you will have to learn is how to use the difficulty setting and when to turn it up or down. Usually when you are doing the item world you want the lowest setting possible so you can get to the lowest floors. Some items are better than others because they have more floors so the more you level them the more powerful the item becomes. You can also move and combine specialists making items even stronger.The visuals are nice for a handheld game (which is what you should expect since this is a port of a handheld game) and while they may eventually get boring you do have the option to turn them off and on to your leisure which is a major plus in cutting down grinding.Overall I'd give this game an 8/10 and if you are into turn based RPGs then this is one of the best ones out there so give it a shot and see if you like the game for yourself."

Welcome back to the front of the Strategy RPG pack, Disgaea. We missed you.Part of what distinguishes Disgaea from more run-of-the-mill SRPGs is its wicked sense of humor, which makes just unveiling the story a treat.I have played Disgaea 1-4, unfortunately haven't played 5 yet. I have had no problems with the port and have 6.5 hours into the game as of the time writing this.Positive:+ Stayed true and is what you expect if you played Disgaea 1.+ One of the best SRPGs you'll find+ Great story with dark humor+ Steam trading cards+ Achievements+ Replayability+ PRINNIESNegatives:- Price, I think it's a bit high, however, I wanted to support the future of more PC ports- Controls can be a bit awkward at first with the keyboard. My system is to use only keyboard. I use the mouse if I am targeting during a battle. NiS could patch it so it is simplified by having WASD move the camera and the mouse do the actions, sort of like a CIV 5 type control system.- I think some of the character graphics are still pixelated even after the portAbove Average Game Dood!:7/10I don't regret pre-ordering the game and I hope there are more PC ports of classic RPGs. I would recommend getting this at discount if it is your first time playing this sort of game. If you have played the series before, you should definitely get it, dood! Arguably the greatest and most substantial strategy RPG you'll get on the PC.I never experience any type of video issues that was expressed by other uses.

I remember how boring it was and the amount of grinding I had to do.-Its on the Steam summer sale... Still not buying it.-Bored, give it a go, I'll just get a refund before thetime is up for it.-Oh nothings change, bored, dull... Grinding, gringing is boring.-Oh... Where did the time go.  Whoops.So disgaea in one of the most OTT RPG and in-depth games ever made.  You can pretty much make godly characters.  There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to play, though of course you can game over by loosing battles.  Though promotional exams, for example, are hard every so often you get a fluke run that lets you beat one with sheer luck.You can make characters stronger... You can make spells stronger... You can make skills stronger... You can make items stronger... It basically amounts to this; the more you put into a character, the stronger they get and by the end of the game... Things are just crazy.The game is still a grinding game, but you sometimes get so invested in it you loose track of the time. Even without the grinding, those with the brain to figure out stragies will like this game too.  JRPG games have a reputation for being utterly boring becaus they put storyline in and like the novelisation style of telling stories.  This one is decent and you can skip it anyway.I'll update things if further into the game change.  Right now as of writing they added a few new characters and somehow broke the sound in the process.  But they are at least updating, which some ports from other systems won't bother with. :-/Edit:As of today more or less, thesound issue was fixed."

I'm used to quality products from NISA, particularly their flagship Disgaea line. This is a huge disappointment.In addition to the problems listed in Destructoid's article(http://www.destructoid.com/the-pc-port-of-disgaea-is-an-absolute-mess-344192.phtml), I want to add one major complaint of my own. The game doesn't show icons for the controller buttons at all. Instead, it gives you numbers, leaving you to guess which controller button they are referencing by number until you memorize them. Seriously, you couldn't afford to get button icons in the game?*When I purchased this game, it was unplayable and crashed multiple times. I hear that's been fixed, as well as many of the slowdown and graphical issues, but as I got a refund on the game, I can't comment on this any further. Kudos to NISA for making the effort to fix things for the fans, but I'll wait for a sale to pick this one up and try it again."

Each game builds upon the already great mechanics to the point where 5 is incredibly complex. Disgaea PC however is much more basic. This is not necessarily a bad thing but for those who are used to the mechanics of 5, 1 feels incredibly lackluster and boring. The game is incredibly slow paced,. There are no shortcuts for grinding or unlocking classes. There is limited units and attacks. All these aspects combine into a fairly boring title.In saying all this, if this is your first Disgaea game you will probabaly like it. I first played this on DS when that was first released and I thoroughly enjoyed it although, after playing 5 this is just too simple for me to enjoy."

Not bad, definitely not terrible, but when core functionality does not work properly (eg dodgy mouse controls) you cannot call it good.  Serviceable at best.The art is nice, the music surprisingly good and the plot quite entertaining.  Humour is always YMMV, but I liked it.  It definitely helps to have at least a basic appreciation for the Japanese TV references.  The core gameplay, however, was disappointing.  It is a decent Tactical RPG, a genre barely represented on PC, but compared to its peers there are some serious issues.  The way experience is handled cripples certain classes and emphasises one or two over-powered Rambo characters over a balanced and tactial squad (the normal for the genre).  This makes a lot of the potential gameplay elements irrelevant, because attempting to explore them weakens you and makes the game more grindy/less fun.  The randomised Item World maps are an interesting concept, but can occationally be impossible to complete, resulting in wasted time.There is a market for this game, but I think it is a very small one.  Combined with the not-so-good port, I believe this is a game most people could safely pass over."

But of course.From first glance Disgaea PC suffers the same problems most japanese game ports to the PC unfortunately seem be known for. Bugs, performance issues, mostly related to the pc part of the game. The keyboard and mouse have very touchy controls, selecting everything you don't have your mouse over and overall unresponsive controls sometimes. It's hard to get your units to move where you want exactly due to your cursor suddenly selecting a tile nowhere near where you've clicked.Also for some reason playing the game with a mouse and keyboard can demand a greater performance out of your machine, thus lowering your frames per a second. This is only a problem is you're computer isn't exactly a gaming rig. This only covers a small amount of the issues, but overall the game is still very playable regardless. This port, plain and simple is at the moment is best enjoyed with a controller. I'm sure a lot of these issues will be fixed later, but if you're considering buying right now I can't recommend it unless you happen to have a controller of some kind."

I had seen many people having issues with the frame rate, and stating that textures weren't loading. I had a smooth 60fps experience and all my textures loaded fine. I had to change all the new graphical settings off and use the old textures and UI, but that didnt' bother me much. I didn't even change the settings because of performance issues.

This port is such a dissapointment I cannot even properly express it in words, but I will try.First of all, there are no resolution settings and all the new ""enhancements"", when turned on, create weird visual bugs. Especially SSAO - turning that on resulted in a chess board design that covered my screen. I do not know, maybe this port was orignally based on a FTP chess game.And WTF, the framerates. Considering the type of game this is, how is it possible for it to fluctuate between 20 and 60 frames constantly? I do not have a top of the line rig, but I believe my setup is decent enough (970gtx, 16GB RAM, i5 processor) to handle a game originally made in 03.The only good thing about this port is that the new textures do look better. The background looks brighter and less muddy and the text is in higher resolution. However all of this does not matter when the game lags for no reason and the controls feel very sluggish. Speaking about controls, the game uses generic ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc buttons in the dialogue boxes regardless of what controller you're using. Yup, no way to set the control type to Xbox or PS.Honestly, if you (the developers) do not know how to make a proper port, then do not do it, or find someone who can. Just leave these classic titles for the original consoles they were made for.Maybe they will patch it, maybe not. We shall see.0/10 exploded prinniesOn the plus side, not playing this game will give me more time to write my thesis, lmaoEDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the game no longer suffers from framerate issues and visual bugs.

That dosen't say much considering the bare bones graphics options.  I like the idea of being able to swith between the new and old textures and interface but there needs a way to lower the overall reselution.

I've had no success.  Using the asdw keys to move and select units is clunky and dosen't feel right given the games narually angled camera.  Using the mouse would have worked exept there is no way to adgust the camera except zomming. Also, while attempting to select units it always takes multiple clicks with the mouse before the game decides to actually select something.Note: (No PC user should ever have to use a controller if they don't want to.)Don't buy this game on PC unless they patch it to were it becomes functional.

,Not Recommended,405900,25124782,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,Battlechili,"I tried to enjoy this game. I gave it a chance. But I can't recommend this.Disgaea 1 is an extremely grindy SRPG. Anytime you create a new character, he or she is level 1. You need to either grind levels you've already beaten or grind item world in order to make them stronger, or else they won't be fit for upcoming missions. Added to this, item world itself is both a requirement to continue the game at a certain point and also an unfair grindy mess in its own right. There comes a point in the game's story where you aren't allowed to continue unless you have a level 10 weapon. In order to level up weapons, you need to go through 10 floors of item world, which is a world inside any and all items in the game that has 10 floors of randomly generated maps of enemies to fight. You have to clear floors of these in order to level up your weapon. If things get too difficult, you can just move from one map to the next via a floor tile that's placed in a random spot on the map. The problem is is that each floor you go through has progressively harder enemies; even high leveled well equipped units can fall once you get to a certain point. The enemies increase in difficulty very quickly, and if your party starts wearing down, the only way to truly escape the dungeon is to use an item called ""Mr. Gency's Exit"", which frustratingly enough, can only be obtained after clearing 10 floors in item world. Add this to the annoying tedium that are geo crystals, random crystals found on maps that change the stats of units on certain tiles, and the whole thing becomes exceedingly annoying.Outside of this, the plot itself is silly and ridiculous, and as a result its difficult to find the characters in this game relatable. The game is full of slapstick humor and dark humor involving characters making fun of each other or torturing prinnies and so on. None of the characters act as you would expect a real person to. It detaches them from reality in a way. I realize most of the characters in this game are demons, so its not expected of them to act like normal humans, but it just makes it harder to think much of them. That said, I do think there's some appeal to the humor and a likable character or two. Etna in particular is what pushed me to continue playing this game really; she's a sexy self-serving demon that, while strong, lacks the attitude of her friend (and the main character), Laharl. But a character cannot save a game, and I just could not enjoy this game. It doesn't help that the graphics are a bit dated and the music is boring and repetitive.If you're looking for a fun SRPG from NIS, I would suggest you look towards Phantom Brave PC rather than this. It has a better PC port anyways. Or perhaps wait for later Disgaea games to get ported, as I hear the series improved with later entries. This game was my first plunge into Disgaea, and it was overall unpleasant in my opinion."

The storyline is extremely quirky and rediculous, definitely not something to be taken serious if you're coming from something like Final Fantasy. The gameplay is where the magic begins. It's a tactics based rpg in which you essentially keep leveling up. As far as I'm concerned, once you finish the main story line, the only real goal is to simply see how absurdly powerful you can get, which wouldn't seem like a very deep concept, but is somehow extremely addictive.The level cap is 9,999. Yes, almost 10,000 levels. Not to mention, you can reincarnate whenever you want, further increasing your stats with every level up. For example, a level 200 character is typically pretty weak. If you say, level up to 5000 and then reincarnate and THEN level up to 200, you now have a hell of a character. You're also able to level your equipment, skills, and expertise with weapons. Virtually everything is able to be trained. You also have the ability to create characters, modify how strong/weak enemies are, how expensive/rare items are in the shops etc.Ultimately, it's a fantastic game if you have the time to put in to it. Once you start hitting post game levels and manage to overcome the initial difficulty, you'll start powerleveling pretty fast and that's where things really get entertaining.Did I mention how disappointed I am that Pleinair isn't available? :'("

Though I prefer the English voice-overs.Brain usage:Take note that it's a strategy game but unlike Chess or XCOM you don't really need a brain(of course you need it to live) to have fun with this gem. You just need to be evil.10/10... please NIS bring more of your  games here. Don't let the negative reviews get you. They will help you improve your future ports! Please for the love of sardines!"

,Recommended,405900,21443073,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Faaln,"Well at launch I'm one of the people that could completely rememedy their FPS issues by fiddling with settings, it's my understanding that not everyone is so lucky but the developers are looking into those issues at the moment so hopefully that will be remedied in the not so distant future. (My settings are all new graphical features off except the new UI with Vsync on using a DS3 controller).This is the first Disgaea game and probably my second favorite after Disgaea 4. The story is excellent, the main story (with some grinding of course, this is a japanese srpg after all) is crazy long (I think last time it was 80 ish hours for me on the PSP version), the characters are generally likable, there's a bunch of zaniness with random bouts of seriousness, and it's just generally very enjoyable if you like SRPGs (Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem) without requiring it to take itself too seriously.Granted, this is a PS2 game ported to the PSP and then finally ported to the PC. The main place this starts showing this age are the graphics, which look only slightly better upscaled and are otherwise unchanged (unless you choose to use new map textures). The other is the lack of class/combat/quality of life features in later disgaea entries. For instance there is no option to change text display to instant, many later classes are missing, you can't toss towers directly on to people you need to throw them next to people, etc. But those features (aside from the text display one) are mainly only going to be noticed as missing by someone who has been playing later entries into the series while the older graphics are probably going to be up to taste.This game series has a history of INSANELY long post-game content. In addition to the usual alternate ending fair/NG+ (and Etna mode) there are also massive challenges that require a huge amount of grinding, reincarnating, grinding more, etc, etc to even accomplish. But if you're the kind of person that can handle it the content is there and it will eat a lot of time.I really like the entirety of the series and I hope that they also begin making their way over here (hopefully in their PSP/PS Vita versions with all DLC/extra content included in the base game) but for now this is a great first step into a giant, complicated, grindy, funny, and lovingly crafted series. I hope you decide to try it, dood."

Considering a very large portion of these characters and classes have been featured in the most recent games in this series, I can't imagine it would have been a lot of work to add these to this game, considering they've managed to improve most other graphical elements. I'm sure it won't be long until some modders fix that, but it would have been nice to see this done officially.The UI is still in essence the same UI as on PS2. There is mouse support added, but it is not as streamlined and intuitive as in a UI designed with mice in mind. Playing with a mouse isn't extremely annoying, but I think almost anyone would prefer to play the game with the same input device as it was initially designed for, a gamepad.The inclusion of both english and japanese is nice for players in Europe, seeing as the original PS2 PAL release did not include the japanese dub.The extra graphical options surpass what I from experience would have expected from a port of a JRPG as old as this, but a resolution and antialiasing setting would have been nice. Most new graphical effects worked fine on my PC, without slowdowns, but some of them interact with the sprites in an undesirable way in a few situations. Nothing game-breaking, howeverSome people have encountered performance issues with this game, even with hardware far surpassing the recommended specifications, but I had no issues. I'd recommend buying the game, and simply apply for a refund if you run into problems."

,Recommended,405900,21441334,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,iSvCrux,"So far this game has been more or less what I expected of the port. Being that this game is almost 15 years old, I won't be reviewing the game as much as I will the adaptation to the PC.The good:-Option to switch between English and Japanese voice overs-Mouse support, even in menus (though more on this later)-Options between classic and updated graphical styles-Keyboard/mouse and gamepad button mapping-Framerate not locked at 30fpsThe bad:-No resolution choices-Mouse controls can be clunky/unresponsive-I will start this off by saying that I have had none of the crashing/low framerate problems that have been reported so far. I kept the graphical settings at stock with the sole exception of turning shadows on.--PC Controls--When it came to the controls, I found the default mouse commands to be very intuitive. L-click to select, R-click to cancel/go back. The entire game could be played entirely with the mouse, although keyboard shortcuts do prove to be useful for faster interactions. Plus, they added a nice detail of having a custom mouse cursor for the game, which I personally liked.However, I did notice that the mouse commands could be a little clunky. If you click somewhere outside of a menu, for example, you have to click twice for it to first, put itself back in the menu, then again to actually select what you wanted to click on. In combat, clicking on tiles proved to be a little hit or miss for me on what I expected it to do. It seems the mouse detection boxes are very small in the grid, and you have to be pretty close to the center to actually click them. Sometimes, it would even seem to just stop working altogether, and I would have to click several times to get the clicks to register. Maybe this is just because I'm not used to the controls yet, but so far they don't feel 100% accurate.Talking to people is a bit of a pain as well. You can click and drag to move your character towards your pointer, or you can use WASD in the overworld. Talking to people is done by running into them, face to face. This proves to be difficult no matter what movement option you use. I do remember this being a problem using the PS2 controller as well, but it's even more difficult to do with 8 directional movement (like WASD). The mouse movement isn't much better, but I had better success with it.--Updated Textures--This port release did upscale some of the textures from the original 2003 release, and it really shows on the menus and backgrounds. However, the character sprites didn't look as crisp as the rest of the game. While the new textures are a higher resolution, it ends up making the characters look blurry as opposed to crisper. The original sprites were much more pixilated, but they were carefully stylized to make up for their low resolution. Fortunately, the game allows you to switch between old and new character sprites, as well as backgrounds and maps. Personally, I like the updated maps and backgrounds with the old sprites.--Conclusion--Overall, I do recommend this game. If you are a fan of the original game, this port is worthwhile. If you are new to the Disgaea series, I definitely recommend starting here, with just a few warnings: 1) I would recommend the use of a controller, being that this game is a console port, but using a mouse and keyboard is doable if that's all you have access to. And, 2) While the port is better than I expected, it is still lacking in some areas. If you expect a full PC experience, you are going to find this game lack luster.If you are looking for a top down strategy game that can go as deep as you want it to, this is the place to look. The humor is wacky and very anime, with a very self aware ""over the top"" spin.Love the art, love the music, love the characters.Port: 7/10Gameplay: 9/10First Trading card being a foil: 11/10"

The visuals are nice and there's a fair amount of content to the game.Beyond that, it starts to fall apart. The game is pretty grind heavy. It might be that I was missing something obvious, but I found that I had to constantly replay through earlier chapters of the game to train up my units. This is made more frustrating in that the only way to gain EXP is for the unit to defeat an enemy. There's no EXP from healing your own units, which makes it frustrating to train up the clerics, who aren't known for their damage outputs.In regards to the actual combat, the main issue that I had with it is that the levels don't really feel well-designed. There are a lot of walls and such that require rotating the map, which makes navigating and moving units feel slower than it should be.All in all, I want to like this game, and perhaps there is something I'm missing, but it's too grind-heavy and clunky in gameplay for me to have enjoyed it."

It looks a bit dated when compared to todays graphics but the charm is still there.The voice acting is great. The soundtrack really stands appart from other games and the storyline is a lot of fun. I love level griding in this game. It feels really rewarding creating characters that can annihilate the enemy characters in one move.If you enjoy tactical RPGs and don't mind dated graphics then I recommend this game very much."

I remember it like it was yesterday. I got the game and played it for easily 20 hours straight. I wouldn't go to bed and was worried my dad would catch me gaming in the morning when he had to prepare for his job and leave so I closed my door tight and played with headphones. I was in 9th grade or something and would skipped classes so I could keep playing.Great to play this once again. Good times!

Your max level in the game is 9999, now unless you grind in the Item World, I highly doubt you will get anywhere near that if you are a casual player. Now, Disgaea, on PS3 you can get this game in the range of 5 to 10 dollars, here it is 20 bucks, though I am not complaining, It is a great way to kill time if you have nothing to do. The graphics aren't up to snuff in todays standards, but who cares, there are loveable characters, hateable characters, and a lot of post game stuff.

Disgaea is one of those timeless classics originally based on the ps2 system. The gameplay is awesome, the story is what you'd expect of a difinitive JSRPG, and the sprites look like they come out of a SRPG :P. Sadly, this little gem has a couple of bugs.

NIS is aware of the issues and is working to fix them, so if you're unsure, check back in a week or so to see if a patch is out.UPDATE: A patch has bene released, and most people are reporting the game runs fine now. The controls are still PS2/PSP-era so keep that in mind.Personally I've had no performance/visual issues. My specs might help you figure out if you'll have issues or not prior to the patch:OS: Windows 10CPU: i7 3.2 GhzRAM: 12 GBGPU: AMD R9 270xMy only complaints otherwise with the porting are regarding the keyboard/mouse controls (mouse is really weird, use a gamepad) and how the buttons are labeled 1-2-3-4, etc instead of Square - Circle - X, or A B X Y, etc. There seems to also be errors regarding some unit queues (if a unit is queued to attack, but the target dies before their turn comes up, that unit no longer gets to attack), but that's a relatively minor issue.As far as the GAME goes, this is my first time coming into contact with Disgaea, and I'm enjoying it. Humor's entertaining enough, I love the character designs, and the gameplay keeps me interested and entertained. It actually feels pretty rapid for a strategy RPG, which IMO is a plus."

I beat the game around 30-40 hours or so (or whatever it was) which was a good game length and enjoyed the story. It also has multiple endings to support multiple playthroughs, which I did some of. I then spent the next 300 hours of playtime fighting the semi-secret alternate bosses, leveling characters up near max level, and acquiring the top end weapons and armor, then leveling them to max  level as well.This is absolutely a great game and worth the price.

I have a lot of nostalgia for it and have sunk a lot of hours into it on PS2.The new menus look great and scale well. Switching to the old menu style reveals a grungy pixellated mess.The game performs fine for me, evidently because I've got a controller plugged in. N1 seems to be working on a solution and has been good about communicating.My only real gripes are that with an XBox 360 controller's analog sticks, you're not able to turn your character to face various directions and you can't aim certain special attacks. You have to use the D-pad for these things, and I don't see any sort of options to switch this around. It's a minor but annoying thing.Overall it's a good, functional port (for me anyway) and once I get over the starting hump, which is a bit slow, I know I'll put a bunch more time into the game and have a lot of fun like I used to back in the PS2 days. Hopefully further games in the series will follow this one onto Steam, as well as classics like Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom."

Some times enemies are impossible to see because they are in trenches  and managing the situation involves then guesswork. Still, even with annoyances the base game is very solid.The game has some technical issues. The major one I experienced is probably a memory leak based. This causes game to crash after longer game sessions. This is very unfortunately, because saving the game is possible only outside missions and item world consists from consecutive maps where escaping is possible only after every tenth floor. Depending on enemy difficulty, clearing ten floors, can take from 20 minutes to multiple hours.

Even though the developers made some improvements to the quality of terrain, menu items and text, much of the game's graphics are still fairly low resolution and pixelated.The game play is the same from its original release years ago, and might be a bit off-putting to players that are only familiar with more modern takes on strategy games. Level ginding is a requirement and you will be repeating maps over and over before you have any chance of progressing the story. The game can be quite difficult as well -- which may be a positive or negative depending on your preference. There is something of a tutorial to start but much of the gameplay is only briefly explained in optional tutorial text leading to a fairly steep learning curve. There are no in-mission saves and some parts of the game require marathon like runs to complete.Despite all of this, Disgaea is still a fun, deep game with massive amounts of replayability. Maps provide a variety of strategic challenges and there are numerous paths to improving characters. This is one of the few games I have played  that manages to be consistently funny even though the English tracks are not as good as the Japanese version (The English voice acting is decent, but the English translation is fairly weak. If you happen to understand Japanese you will notice that the English translation is often much shorter and leaves out a lot of information and in many cases is very different from the original text). Replayability is off the charts and I suspect very few players will ever get close to 'completing' this game.Overall Disgaea is good enough to recommend if you are willing to overlook its age related short comings -- particularly given the shortage of good turn based strategy games on the PC."

The story is looney with each chapter being as memorable as the next. The content available is just mindboggling. You have to kill things to get mana, which is used to make more characters, but to make more powerful characters you have to get it past a vote and some senators my hate you and you can just beat the heck out of them to change their vote or bribe em. To get your characters more powerful, you have to ask the senate to get more powerful items in the store or open up new levels to grind. Oh yeah, grinding. This is a grindfest and where most gamees stop at level 100, tihs game stops at 9,999. Oh, there's also reincarnation. The leveling is like an idle clicker game except looks cooler and more satisfying. There are levels that are specifically made for grinding and you can try to pass a bill that makes enemies more powerful so you can grind faster. Characters aren't the only thing you can make more pwoerful, you can make your items more powerful by going through a randomly generated world called the Item World. Those stats you see when you look at items like ""Statistician"" or ""Gladiator,"" they're personfied and you beat the hell out of them to subdue them.

76561198153723995,Recommended,405900,30960464,Posted: 5 April,all,LightFight,"So..Time I'll write my first review ever, about my favourite video game ever.Disgaea PC is the PC version (who would have guessed) of Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. It's a JRPG and for most of the people, who have played JRPGs, the concept of this game is probably very obvious. For those who are here, because of the holy and sacred Anime Weekend (i love u steam); it's a turn-based, strategy game, where positioning is key. I really like these kind of games and I don't wanna go too much in to it, cause I would start fan boying really hard. Only one more thing about the gameplay: prepare to spend hours of grinding. In fact, the real game starts with the grinding, so if you have no patient your should consider another game, that's not Disgaea. Still it's very fun and for me at least it never got repetetive, though I can understand if that's the case for other people.I'll try and make this part quick, but It won't work.I absolutly adore the story and all of the characters you meet in the game. I don't wanna talk about depth or some BS like that, but they do got a story and you'll get to love at least one or two of them. To tease you a little, the protagonist trio consists of; Laharl, Prince of the Netherworld, a very strong demon, who's not unhappy about the recent death of his father. He hate's love and friendships and would like to rule over pretty much everything. Oh, and he's a bit of a complacent teenager. As number two we have his loyal servant; the all-mighty beauty queen Etna, who likes to do sexy poses without a body to back it up. I didn't steal that joke. So she's a demon, not much to say about that, because I don't wanna spoil anything. My favourite character, probably in video game history, is the third protagonist; Flonne. She's an angel trainee send to ""assassinate the Overlord"". Unfittingly, she apologizes as she punches Laharl into the face ( one of the two times she ever uses her fists in this story). Her heads full of flowers and you could confuse her with a Sailor Moon character.Now, that I didn't keep that part short, the game has multiple endings, so if you're into that, have fun. Also the game doesn't take itself too serious and you shouldn't confuse it with a child's game, because it rerally isn't.If you made it through this review, I apologize if it wasn't as helpful as me or you would have liked it to be; again it's my first one. I'd be very happy for any tips or advices on my profile for future reviews, because I plan on doing some more.Now go buy the game and have a great time, dood!"

The insane gameplay and the amount of freedom on how you want to play wether its making a dragon heal or a mage use axes. I love how much of a post-game it has to offer and how many hours you can put into the game and still have stuff you can do.

With an entertaining story with mulitple endings and an expansive post game this game will hook you in and deprive you of your sleep!

Feels good."

It is a grind fest but if you play your cards right you don't have to in the main story. If you plan on doing all of the extra content and post game it will take a while, and a lot of grind.The port has been stable thus far and works well even on laptops. I look forward to playing the rest of the series. If you struggle with this game I highly recommend youtuber HCBailly as his playthroughs show almost ever aspect of the game in detail if you need a helping hand."

,Recommended,405900,30891492,Posted: 1 April,all,Hentai363,"Very good PC port for the classic PS2 game. I love the Disgaea Series and I am glad to have this in my library. It is a fun,turn based RPG that I wouldn't recommend this game to new people to the games because it is very old , it isn't a bad attribute it is just that if they want to start the series they should play some of the newer games because they fleshed out the mechanics more and the difficulty is a tad easier. I would recommend a solid 8.5/10. If you don't want to grind as much play final fantasy tactics."
