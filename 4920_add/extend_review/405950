The difficulty curve is pretty forgiving, but there have already been couple of levels that have needed couple more tries to make it work.Some lines and selections of words seemed a bit out of place on the monologue that happens between zones, but overall the dialog seems fitting to the athmosphere.The level editor isn't implemented yet to the game, but when it's ready, it might bring more longevity to the game."
76561198140299850,Recommended,405950,19514569,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,foofaraw,"When I first saw “Lowglow” in the Upcoming section, I was impressed enough to take the relatively uncommon risk of posting its announcement in my Activity feed (an action that has bit me on my donkey on occasion.) This time I absolutely made the correct choice.“Lowglow” is a casual, meditative puzzle game composed of colors, lights and sound. Lights fall from the “sky”, and must be guided by the player to that puzzle’s target, somewhere on the screen. This is done by placing, and angling, one or several “bouncy” lines. There is no time restraint, no rush (except for one specific achievement.) The lights fall, and bounce, and change direction and speed based on color and type of the object they contact. “Lowglow” is, in fact such a simple game, conceptually, that I find it difficult to produce an interesting review, though to not make the effort would be tragic.Sometimes it seems the object of “Lowglow” isn’t necessarily to simply reach the target, but to create the most beautiful, and musical, pathway of flowing and singing lights in the process. I suspect there are “best” methods, but the presence of achievements based on supra-par success indicates that there are many, perhaps dozens, of winning choices for each level. This is also a strong indication of replayability. The line(s) must be placed and angled very precisely, so a knowledge of physics and Newton’s laws of gravity will certainly come in handy. Lines can very easily be placed, changed, moved and deleted. Controls could not be simpler.I don’t know how long “Lowglow” gameplay lasts, but after about 2 hours I have only 2 of 12 achievements, so I suspect the increased difficulty of further levels will add quite a lot of time to game completion. (As levels are locked until accessed, I can’t speak further at this point.) As well, there is an editor in the works to add even more interest and wonder. Sometimes I find myself grinning from amazement at the complexity of a winning scene.Along with “Lowglow” gameplay is a pleasant and entertaining story of exploration, and (one presumes) spiritual growth. While interesting to some, this can be easily skipped by those that wish, as it doesn’t seem necessary to the puzzle mechanics. The puzzle mechanics themselves seem to be such that as soon as it seems the game grows easy, something new is encountered that must be investigated thoroughly through vigorous investigation of the effects of gravity and propulsion.“Lowglow” is a wonderfully entertaining game with a superior learning curve and significant challenges. It’s a bit more expensive than most conceptually similar puzzle games, but by no means excessively so, and quite possibly the editor will add completely new dimensions to explore. It can be played very easily while doing almost anything else that you may find to be of less interest (such as meetings or conversations.) At this stage I can only express a feeling that this game was created as a labor of love, and to play it is no labor at all."
,Recommended,405950,19471087,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,Ruksi,"I had really good experience on my first two play sessions (2 hours or so).Lowglow delivers what it promises, an artsy puzzle game. I personally like the the art and sound design. Some of the dialog is so-so but the atmospheric mumbling noises in the background help to mitigate that, once again a praise to the sound design.The levels are not that hard at first, then they start to require quite a bit of trial and error to get it just right. It's fun as even a slight change in one of the lines can totally change the trajectory. Around the green area, some of the puzzles seem like impossible without using the help lines. Oh, and the feeling when you get a level completed off the bat by just drawing a single line, awesome.So, the game has some bad moments but a lot more enjoyment than dissapointment. Totally worth the price if you enjoy puzzle games."

And when you compelete a level you feel a little smarter, or maybe just lucky, espesially when you finish a level on your first line placement. Not sure what is going on with the spoken dialogue, or lack of it rather, but not a game breaker. Would like to see more games from Rockodile like this."
,Recommended,405950,19593681,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,clt,"Interesting designs, challenging levels and nice visual presentations make this game worth playing.The only thing I want to discuss is the bonus puzzles. I doubt there should be any ""motivation"" of the solution for some of them.  I solved vault 1 by first noticing a chaotic behaviour in the intersection of two forcing fields, then putting the line there and adjusting for around 100 different angles (subtle adjustments, obviously). And not surprisingly, even the smallest adjustment of the position will lead to a completely different outcome.I think when you have two constant force fields acting in the opposite direction with possible reflections (as in vault 1), the system becomes highly chaotic. I mean not even normal dynamical systems like a double pendulum but much more complicated governing systems. It is therefore almost impossible to know what should work out - you just have to keep trying.More surprising is vault 4, it has a constant forcing field and an electric field (as the particle gets repelled), I believe the system should be 100x more complicated that the above case and have not yet figured out the correct position of the second line. You need a huge acceleration from the forcing field, but I don't know whats the initial condition.Maybe I am just not playing in the correct style, but aside from the bonus puzzles everything work out fine for me.Also, it will be extremely helpful if there is a replay mode - Some of the curvatures are amazing."

What I did not like so much though is the ""story""; I am sure the developers had a nice time creating it, but I found it to be nowhere near as interesting as the storytelling of games like Portal (1 and 2) and The Talos Principle. Due to the story, as well as the somewhat ""repetitiveness"" of the levels , I can only give this a mild recommendation."

,Recommended,405950,22694053,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,Quaggy,"It's a fun and relaxing puzzle game, which revolves around bouncing lights toward a goal. When the light hits a block of a certain color, it's behavior changes. (Red destroys the light, Blue makes it gravitate downward, Yellow makes it gravitate upward, and Green makes it impervious to gravity.) Every time the light hits a block, a musical chime plays, so it reminds me of the old DS game Electroplankton. The levels are very 'trial and error' heavy, but there's no time limit, so you can just relax and play your way through. Its a pretty short game, but definately worth the $4 I paid for it on sale. :)"
,Recommended,405950,20198782,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Basic,"Picked this up in the sale for ~£4.20 and have completed the game including all the bonus levels.Overall a simple but enjoyable puzzler, I found most of the main levels fairly straight forward but there were a couple I had to come back to.Took me about 4.5 hours to finish everything (except an achievement for ""Complete 30 levels with less lines than the given amount"". I've only completed 19).Higher levels require lateral thinking and a few (especially bonus levels) require pin-point placement of your lines. Personally, I play this to relax so don't mind spending the time to tweak lines, but I imagine some may find it mildly tedious.You can skip a level if you want to, but you won't be able to unlock all bonus levels until you've gone back and solved them.Very enjoyable, pity it isn't slightly longer. The developer is adding a level editor which should help."

Once a line has been placed, you move it around or fine-tune the angle by just moving an endpoint. There's no time limit, but you have a limited number of lines to draw per level, and you must hit the goal several times in a row to cement your success. Each zone adds a new twist (gravity effects, etc). Successfully completing a level adds to your stock of ""golden lines"" which can be used once-per level if you need more than the provided number of lines. Many of the levels can be beaten ""under par"" for added challenge.I'm a sucker for the glowing crystal aesthetic used here; the visual & sound designs are clean and pleasant, and the ambient background tones make it a relaxing puzzle experience.Pylon / 10"
,Recommended,405950,24347148,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Chive,"Excellent for what it is. An audiovisual puzzle experience. The game is entirely about using angles of impact and acceleration of these little ""droplets"" of light. The game makes clever use of the augmentation of gravity, singularities and portals to make for at least 7 hours of individually challenging puzzles. However, you can easily break 10 hours if you're striving for those achievements.The echoing, tranquil visuals and audio make for a relaxing environment, especially for some of the more challenging levels. Excellent job.As far as the little storyline that goes along with it, it's lacklustre. Although it certainly makes for a story, you can tell the developer didn't lose much sleep on it.At $3 on sale, I don't feel I could have found a much better puzzle game. At some point I'll probably play it again :)Puzzles: 9/10Audio:   9/10Visuals: 10/10Thanks for the experience."

That's not necessarily a huge fault because Enigmo is amazing, but it's hard not to wish I were playing that instead. This has fewer mechanics and interactions, and the further you get into the game the more randomness/luck-based solutions start feeling. There are some neat ideas here and there, but so many of my later solutions were things I could never reproduce other than by accident, and it got a bit frustrating after a while. Visually it's...fine, I guess. The music is uninspiring but inoffensive (and doesn't remotely compare to Enigmo's, some of which I thought was great), and the story is forgettable and didn't really add anything to the game for me. It's ok, I guess, and I finished it, but as you might be able to tell from the numerous comparisons I've made, much of the time I was wishing I was playing a different, better game."

There are 100+ puzzles and it took me about 11 hours to finish the game 100%.I thought overall that it was a good puzzle game, with interesting visuals and audio. Some of the later levels did get a bit irritating though because the game was very picky about where and at what angle your lines were placed. Just moving the line a hair made it go to a significatly different place.So I would only suggest this game to the more patient puzzlers. And even then I feel like you should get it on a sale."
