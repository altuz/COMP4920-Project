76561198079221824,Recommended,405960,19514678,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,DefiantShade,"For an early access title built by two developers, there is pretty solid game play here. While level layout is static, the amount of enemies and their type (i.e. champion, elite etc.) is random, making each playthrough of a level unique.  Perma death system keeps you on your toes adding a nice bit of tension to your adventures ever so deeper into the dungeon. All learned skills carry over on death, howerver any crafting recipe you have will be lost.The devs are very active and friendly as well as the community thus far. There are a few things  in need of tweaking as others have posted, relating to ambient sounds and music etc. but overall the game is stable and in very playable condition as it stands and will only improve from here in my opinion."

Im used to HC in Path of Exile so that is almost required to keep me interested.-I get to keep my skills upon dying, so no repetitive early game.-UI looks clean, Level design and Skill animations look good.-Hitting stuff has weight and impact to it .-Mouse movement, no WASD.What could be improved from my 2 hour experience with it:-Skill animations from melee hits take too long, so it's hard to dodge projectiles.-Gameplay could be a bit faster.-Can't bind LMB manually to something different than basic attack.-Volume sliders randomly went to zero multiple times, probably on alt-tabbing. When it doesn't happen, sound plays while tabbed out.-Character moves while navigating in menus.-Dodging stuff actively is always nice and i didn't see a dash ability. I hope the ""Charge"" one works for that, couldn't test it tho.-5 skill slots are be a bit too limiting, i see why its limited but for me the right number is 7+.-Loot doesn't fall to the ground directly, what ARPG does that? Write me a comment, i can't think of any."

Reminds me a lot of playing Titans Quest on hardcore. I will say its not as in depth as TQ but it does a great job of keeping you entertained and always on the edge of your seat. Also you have to be a fan of RNG, as the skills and loot are based off it. Each skill seems to go to level 5, so you have to find the scrolls and craft them in order to level up your skills.BTW this is made by 2 people and I will say they are VERY involved with the community on the forums and doing a great job in putting this together. Its well worth it and I can't wait to see it as a finished product."

,Not Recommended,405960,20306223,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,TJ0,"TL;DR: It's not playable yet. Go play Torchlight or something.Long Story:Of Audio:The sound work is horrible, i can still hear the static tap-tap of my footsteps. Some of the in-game narratives were goodish, but in general, they were in bad quality, and the poor acting made them seem a bit silly for such a 'hardcore' game. The game has no hit sounds/effects of any sort for the player, for example the enemy arrows just dissapper into you, which makes it really hard to tell if you are hit or not (in cae of you are shot from afar).Of Graphics:The map looks nice, and the models are decent. Everything else? Complete utter poopoo. The splash at the start has worse quality than youtube videos from 2005. The intro video (which the game wants to show you every time you start the game) is ... hilarious? I can't honestly do nothing but laugh at it. And the game tries to sell itself as 'hardcore'. Well, you can't really be hardcore without the right atmosphere, which the horrible voice acting and poor intro video certainly do not set.The items you equip seem to have no effecr on your appearance, which is understandable, for this is a game from small team with no time to model each item.Of The Map:The levels are static, which is kind of fine, though i hope they will change this later on. Static maps really hurt replayability in these sort of games. What I don't understand is, why is there no automapping? Since the levels are static, it should be easy to implement, and I see no reason why it isn't there. (Back to this later on).Now, I must admit I only played the first level, which was somewhat dull. We got some prison cells, some zombies wandering(not) around, etc etc. The typical rpg dungeon settings. The first level seemed lacking, as because of the horrible voice acting i could not follow the story (had to consentrate not to giggle and cringe). It was just a bunch of rooms thrown together.The boss of the first level was. well, 'lacking', so to speak. The combat was closer to point and click then actual arpg combat, for the boss only seemed to have 2 spells; one which was AoE that hit basicly the whole room, doing little damage (so easy to soak, no reason to stop hitting/move away), and some sort of curse(?) or likes, that cast a kinda nice looking effect on the player, making them unable to move (but could still hit the boss), and after a period of time, inflicted some damage. There seemed to be no way to play around these spells, so the bossfight was pure dps race.The Combat:I really like combat, like, really. When i play a ARPG game i expect fell-refined combat system with multiple ways to aproach the fight, that supports different playstyles, and suchs. Now, the combat in Sunken is pretty much point and click. Press 1 for damage, left-click when OOM, and Q for heal. The game decides not to explain the combat system in anyway, which could be another failed attempt to make the game feel 'hardcore'. Even the first bossfight was a dull DPS race. During my second run on the first level, i found 2 spells, so there seems to be some spellcasting system in place. However, the damage of spells is static, and spellcasting is limited by a) mana b) cooldown, and from my experience, there is no way to affect cooldown, so it's the limiting factor. With static damage and static cooldowns, going for caster type doesn't seem reasonable.The Character:You get experience points from killing monsters. You level up when you receive enough experience. Each time you level up, you get 5 'points' you can assign to attributes. Each attribute does something 'Each click', which seems to be a ARPG term i do not know, but I assume they meant by attribute level. Dexterity, for example, improves armor by 0.5, and crit chance by 0.1%. You start with 10 points in each attribute, so for example to max out crit chancem you have to be level 190, and by then you have 100% crit chance, meaning your attacks do 150% damage. Sounds rad, right? I haven't played long enough to actually confirm this, but this is what the game tells me when i first choose which attribute i want to level. I'll most likely write a full analyzis on how much each attribute affects gameplay later on.The 'Hardcore':This game aims to be 'hardcore', I like that. I like hardcore games. In fact, I'm designing a game that I'd like to call hardcore. But what makes a game hardcore? Sunkens ideology seems to be, that stripping down user experience is 'hardcore'. The lack of minimap/automapping, the lack of tutorial, or any explainations of basic game mechanics or even showing the user the keybindings (or list the buttons for the action bar thingy) seems to be their way of doing hardcore.For me, hardcore is more about being punishing. The game should be hard to beat, not hard to play. Players should have to think about which their choice will be, and the game should support that. Sunkens total lack of transparency makes it really difficult for me to recommend it, as it is nowhere near 'the fun of a hardcore game'.The Conclusion:It's not ready. The developers have fallen into some pretty basic pitfalls of game design. Luckily, these can be fixed, and there is lots of material available on how to do this. here is some of my suggestions.- Remove the intro. Seriously, it's bad.- Add a way to skip the ingame narratives.- Add a tutorial. The first level could act as sort of a tutorial zone that introduses the player the mechanics. The is plently of material on this avaiable on the interwebs.- Add a hit effect to the player. It's the simplest things that make the combat so much better.- Add floating texts to combat. I want to see how much damage i did, and how much i received. Even ascii-based roguelikes have these nowadays. Easy to implement.- Add a way to hit while standing still, even when not aiming at any monster. Basic ARPG.- This game does _NOT_ need more content at this point. It needs better gameplay. Look up how to 'juice' the game. Even hardcore games require some juice to make the combat more pleasing.That's about it. Summing it up again, this game is nowhere near the 6€ pricetag it has now, but I'm still looking up to see how it develops. So, don't buy it now, come back later :)"

I do like the crafting mechanics and having to make your way to a room on each floor in order to craft. There is nothing ground breaking here but the game is in a very good state for being early access. It will keep you entertained and well, that is what we are paying for.Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b3E4xYURiI"

I can't find their Facebook page.Don't buy this game.  Haven't played far enough to figure out if this game still has major flaws.  It was also weird that this game was in Early Access late last year and but upgraded without any kind of an announcement (even on their Facebook page) around January of this year.

,Recommended,405960,19560929,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Steve Woz Ere,"Pros:Early impressions of the game are very promising - I can only see the title improving upon what's there, which is already in a playable state.Combat element isn't too hectic, like some aRPGs.UI is simple and intuitive (which is a good thing).Its permadeath mechanic avoids save/load spamming (also a good thing), but still allows the player to keep learned skills.Has replay value as some of the content will change on subsequent playthroughs or after death, due to the randomness.Appears to be well optimised - I've had no framerate issues or overburdened/overheating GPU/CPU like in some other games that are still in development, and I only have a mid-range PC.Cons:Camera is locked, so can't change the angle or zoom in and out.Controls cannot be re-bound to any mouse buttons, like most other aRPGs.There is no minimap or full screen map to help navigate the (pre-designed) levels. Though I guess one can eventually remember the layout if played enough.There's no way to retract stat points if a mistake is made when assigning them.Summary:Of course, a lot can and likely will change in the future, so I'll update my review if and when necessary.As it stands, I can recommend this title for fans of the genre, especially at its low price.On a sidenote: The devs (two man team) are very active and responsive with the playerbase, so that's another plus."

Strange, but good ingame story, learned from hints, which does peak the interest.I find it a nice game to idle away time, in big gulps or sips. Has leaderboard and some good surprises in the fights."

Like you character only wearing pants. When he gets new armor it's just a new type of pants. He always wears no shirt. So stuff like that gives the game some character.There's a crafting element to this, but I don't think it is fun right now.  That may change as they keep working on this, if they keep working on this. Combat for me was pretty stiff and clunky. That may be due entirely to my older computer, but I am pretty sure they got a bunch of optimizing to do.This has a pretty cool atmosphere but it has a way to go before it is compelling to play. For now I recommend holding out and see how it develops."

The loot drops leave much to be desired, also a good amount of the time I can't pick up the loot. Crafting is dry so far, as is the story. This review has nothing to do with end game, but the first 30+ minutes of the game, which I feel are important. I am already bored and unimpressed, and I am gonna find it hard to play through more content. Also the first ""Boss"" was absolutely uneventful and also left much to be desired."
