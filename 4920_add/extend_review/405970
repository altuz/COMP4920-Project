I saw your interview in ""TOKEN PODCAST"", That's how I found this game. The only thing I haven't liked so far is the fact that the text of the dialogue boxes cuts off when the button ""E"" appears and you can't read the whole thing, which are really entretaining.THANK YOU!"

Had a lot of fun with it on my first playthrough, and I'm probably going to play through it again soon on the hardest difficulty.Platformer fans should definitely pick it up. Good soundtrack too."

Gameplay-wise, the game seems to be inspired by Trine, and carries a bit of its charm.The rest is unfortunately not worthwhile.- not yet fun after half an hour of play- character controls are sluggish and unpolished- insanely heavy handholding- game pacing is slow and constantly interrupted- very weak narrative immersion- generic music and settingI think the worst is that gameplay concepts are completely arbitrary and unjustified narratively. For instance, the main mechanic of the game is about switching between three shapes (circle, triangle and square). Once you are in the right shape, simply touching an enemy will destroy it. This feels really dumb. A rabbit is jumping towards you and you're a circle? Oh man, you're in trouble! But if you're a triangle, the rabbit instantly vanishes by barely touching you ... poof. Reeeeally?? In what kind of fantasy is this cool and immersive? Similarly, the game requires of you to understand that this or that object is associated with a square or circle or triangle. So you are expected to know that a moose is a square (or whatever they thought a moose is, I can't recall). Anyways, none of this resulted in a fun and immersive experience for me.So yeah, I stopped playing after half an hour because I was not having any fun and I kept being underwhelmed by the game. If like me, you need a game to engage you quickly otherwise you give up on it and go look elsewhere for entertainment, I strongly discourage you from buying this game."

Definitely recommended. I live-streamed my first hour playing the game, which you can watch here:https://youtu.be/ZhvAoQ9vQNA"

If you played this game or a demo before the paprer's cut edition and didn't like it, you should give it another chance because the game is much better now.It combines the feeling of an action platformer and a puzzle platformer.It has some gameplay mechanics that translates into a very interesting gameplay dynamics: Flat can transform into 3 shapes, each shape has different properties and different ways to interact with the world. Most of them are very intuitive and provides some depth while still being simple.Also, some times its visual style is outstanding.Unfortunately the first levels feels a little unpolished, but after beating them the game is pretty good."
,Recommended,405970,25462788,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,MUHn4d0,"A good platformer with fitting music, some annoying enemies and a lot of frustration for people like me who suck at platforming.Sometimes you aren't sure where to go and especially the time challenge bits with rising lava are frustrating as hell when you fail a jump once and have to do everything all over again. The bosses offer quite a challenge with the exception of the final boss for no apparent reason which was kind of a letdown.A meh story but fun worlds which are all different in appearance make for an inviting look and fun platforming, defintely worth playing."

76561198043663357,Recommended,405970,24728229,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,PaleMimic,"Flat Kingdom Paper's Cut Edition or FKPCE or maybe Flat Kingdom, whatever the name, it’s a side scrolling, platformer made by an indie developer by the name of Fat Panda Games. Upon first glance at the game, the Paper Mario series might spring to mind. You wouldn’t be completely wrong on thinking that, the games does share several features of the Paper Mario games, but not many. The graphical style has the paper-made-world idea set out pretty well and the music fits well with each stage, feeling cheery when traversing the colourful world and dangerous when fighting against bosses.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mechanically however, the game doesn’t quite hit the spot. The idea of transforming between different shapes to fight off the varies enemies is a nice idea and fairly unique at that. The puzzles are fairly easy but are a welcome challenge to help players get to grips with the shape transformations. On the other hand there can be some fairly pointless puzzles that seem to serve no real purpose, and some sort of expect you to understand what the developer was thinking to solve them. Also on the rare occasion you can find enemies that you think were square, for example, only to realize they’re actually circular and you just wasted one of your precious hearts. Boss battles are another thing that seems to be on the iffy side. It takes several attempts to figure out what to do, if you can work it out at all, and you sometimes have to be in the mind of the developer to fully understand what’s supposed to happen.I’ll give the developers credit though, their enemy dies are fairly different, including the bosses. Triangular rats, spherical fish and a killer whale called Hank.The various stages are all thematically different ranging from cardboard caverns to volcanoes of paper (God knows how that works).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Flat Kingdom is fun game that tries too hard at some junctures but at the same time feels unique. The art style is very reminiscent of the Paper Mario series and it’s great. The mechanics are iffy at times but for the most part they work in the games favor. Overall I’d recommend playing Flat Kingdom even if it’s for a quick platforming fix. It’s different and fun and well worth a look. Good Day!"

It does not have much to bring you back to it an a lot of enemies are not clear on what shape they are and its hard to remember what beats what. It looks nice and the story works but if you are not a fan of the platformer genre then this game is not for you. 7.4/10

,Recommended,405970,22343267,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Virus610,"Flat Kingdom was pretty fun. Sort of rock-paper-scissorsy combat, but you can tell which one your opponent is ahead of time, and just need to react. Playtime: About 5 hours for 89% completion.Solid platforming and metroidvania aspects made for a pretty fun time.There are a couple of drawbacks, though. Moving through water is a slog, and given there's an entire water world, you end up moving through the world at a snail's pace. Also, almost all of the bosses follow the same formula: Bunch of random attacks, then one attack that exposes a vulnerability, repeat x3. This isn't the worst thing in the world, but it can mean a LOT of just waiting around.If you don't mind kind of tedious, and only occasionally engaging boss fights, and if you can bear with a whole world of really slowly swimming, this game's not bad. I don't intend to 100% the game, though, because I'm not really interested in going through those water stages for a couple of missing coins."
