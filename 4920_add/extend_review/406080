The graphics are awful, with it not being clear which screen elements are part of the UI and which are just there for looks, and the gameplay is dull and repetitive.You basically take turns adjusting which kinds of ants you want, buying upgrades, and occasionally engaging in a random battle with bugs and such. Every part of this is dull; even the battles consist of clicking ""Attack"" or ""Retreat"" and then seeing numbers change.Also, if you are getting SimAnt vibes, you're wrong; it's more like a crappy business management sim that replaces business with ants. There is no real time aspect to this at all; it's just tweaking numbers and then clicking the button to move on to the next turn and see what happens.Highly advise against wasting your time on this."

Game is built to grind and can be repetative.Pretty much one of the oldest clicker games out there.Maybe get on sale (>50%)9.5/10Long ReviewSo I see many of negative reviews and I do agree with many of them, but I will have to totally recommend this little piece of gem as I grab it as soon as I saw it.I first played this game maybe 8 or 9 years ago, don't even remember how I even got my hands on it and I totally loved it, made my day everyday seeing my colony grow and fight with the believible surroundings that you can pretty much live it as if it was real. Yes, you may probably get this game for free somewhere out there (just like many games in steam) but I just wanted to own this little gem in my library and also a way to support the devs that make my(as well as many's) childhood a little bit brighter. I mean 2$ that cost less than a cup of coffee. You have no obligation to buy this game so please don't whine about it for it being not free, no one's forcing you to buy the game.Yes, to point out many reviews out there, that this game is indeed repetitive and is a grinding game. I mean which grinding game is not repetitive? If you don't like to grind then by all means dont get this game, no need to fill the reviews  with all the negatives its not fair for the game since you guys are just stating the obvious.To put it in a polite way, clicker game, is better suited term than a grinding game. This maybe infact one of the oldest clicker games out there. Note that I spent over 16 hours in the game and that contribute to around 6000 days in the in-game time. Say I click around 30 - 60 clicks (combinding fights and whatnot) I spend the time clicking around 270,000 times!! I am not a fan of the clicker genre but man this game is fun and also frustating at times. I sometimes think this is one of those games that are made to make chidrends shut up.So all in all, its a pretty decent game with hand-drawn annimations and keep in mind this is a pretty darn old game. As I mentioned, this is not a game for everyone, especially those that don't like games being repetitive. Grab it while on sale or even at full price I would say it is worth it.9.5/10"

I would never recommend this game to anyone though. It's fraught with flaws.First of all, the UI is extremely odd, and can be very confusing to navigate. The whole game is a clicking simulator, which isn't bad for some, as games of the like are usually great ways to pass the time, which is one redeeming factor the game has. The art. HOOOOOLY CRAP the art. The whole game is literally clip art images that you can easily find on google, some of which have been animated very simply (we're talking a few pivot points on some images in like, Adobe AfterEffects). The music and sound effects are maddingly repetitive, as well as the ""battle"" sequences which are just some more clicking (if you win you get some stuff if not oh well).Essentially, this game is horrendous, if you buy it, use it to waste time and only to do so. If you have some nostalgia to deal with like I did, go right ahead, I love this game sure, but that doesn't make it good. Sort of like loving a terrible, terrible, movie.TL;DR: I played this game as a kid and loved it, still love it, but it's still terrible."

I remember the old version when i was a kid, it was a lot better, i had a lot more fun. Now with this? I want a refund...One thing that i hated right off the bat speaking of battles, was that you COULD in the old game, spam click the attack button to be done quicker, instead you slowly, slowly..... slowly.......... kill your enemyUpgrades are a joke, after 5 levels the low tier are relics, and by level 20 all 'powerups' are non existant. After you hit level 35 you just go to the beach and spam Go, it's that easy.Random events are completely wiped, sure you still get them, but like 2% work. I found myself going ""Oh, another storm... *Clicks Go*"" when in the past i used to think ""well this is about to be painful"" because your nest would be taken down by a certain amount, and that would both hurt your defense for battles, and limit your food storage.Grinding for population is probably the most irritating thing ever. As i said you spam Go constantly with the exception of a few battles. I remember it used to take me just under 5 mins to hit level 10 now? It took about 3 hours due to food shortage, only getting 1 per second (4-5 per day) and battles.I can go on and on, but i'm not going to. If you want to play this, go ahead i'm not stopping you, but if you enjoyed the old game. Find something else... Avoid this like a plague. For it is boring, hair pulling inducing, insanity.

I mean improving graphics would have been nice but I understand why they didn''t-Statistics is basic. Like its worse than the previous game. Pop ups appear such as ""You have conquered a smaller colony..."" which have no effect in the game other than being an event. The events that happen have no effect in the game other than boring battles. This I think other than the battles is the worse part to the game because it feels random and not very interesting. Who cares that I conquer another colony? Tell me what I have gained from this.-once going to all of the locations, game lacks replayability-The enemies show no differences in attack and defence stats.

Takes a few minutes to get the hang of it as theres no tutorial just a help page , but the interface is pretty self explanatory. I got it on special and I do play it now and then between my major gaming time to wind down after a hardcore game. Its one of those games you play to kill time. Basically its just checking to for the right balance between four different types of ants with grandpa ant giving you advice along the way. You get your soldier ants to defend the colony the nurses to raise the young the workers to build a biger nest and your scouts to search for food. You earn stuff to get upgrades and do the odd battle. This is a great game to play when you are waiting on hold and have to be ready to talk to someone."

,Not Recommended,406080,18384776,"Posted: 8 October, 2015",all,Mondo,"This is a very simple game, reminiscent of an idle game, except you have to click ""Go"" rather than wait for things to scroll.   The game mostly consists of clicking go, with short bursts of splitting your colony between four different tasks, moving to a new location to encounter different events, and buying things from a store using a rare currency you might encounter.  Events can vary a lot, ranging from free food, to battles with roaming critters or people.Unfortunately the control you have over these events is very small.  It's expected that they be random, but the game doesn't even tell you what some of them do.  My ant colony had been poisoned multiple times while I was in the house, with no visible effect.  Weather changes at random, there's a temperature gauge, being indoors lets you avoid weather, but...I have no idea what any of the weather does.  Many locations are listed as being good for something, but I have failed to notice any of those areas coming through on thei rpromise.Battles also happen as random events, the idea being that you have to assign a certain number of ants as soldiers in order to overcome an area's encounters.  It seems like the stats of encounters just goes up if you assign more soldiers, though, resulting in a roughly even chance of victory regardless of how many soldiers you assign.  Battles consist solely of either hitting the attack button repeatedly (sometimes 50+ times) or deciding to retreat.  There's an auto-battle button, but auto-battling includes the retreat option, there's no feature that simply automates hitting the attack button.  And the AI will almost always choose to retreat.  Even when the chance of taking damage is miniscule, or even absolutely zero, the AI may decide that the battle isn't worth it and it'd rather lose the standardized 0.5% of your ants for running away.Your other ant jobs aren't much more useful.  None of them are really transparent as far as numbers are concerned, and they seem to operate off of certain plateaus that change sometimes, but without a discernable reason.  The worst part is that the effectiveness of every job is dwarfed besides the bonuses you can get from the gem shop (which thankfully doesn't take real world cash, despite what the name might imply).  Harvesters are the only job that you'll really need any amount of ants in, but that job is also rather pointless in appearance when compared to the random food events.Overall, the game obscures all of the necessary information to play it, and seemingly does so because if you saw any of the games inner mechanics you'd be appalled at how broken and ridiculous they are.  The makers of this game aren't just Anarchists, they're pratically criminals, creating games like this to make a cheap buck off of people who don't know any better.  I would not recommend this game under any circumstances."

Their power is always based on yours and that includes when you have set aside population as soldiers so basically it's just a waste.  You will usually be underpowered and have to retreat and lose ants.  You can't feel like you have grown strong enough to dominate an area.2.  Bonus scaling.  Bonuses per day are fixed but growth is curved, so anything you've gotten in the past fades into irrelevance.3. Unspecific events.  Sometimes things happen but they don't always say how big an impact they had.4. Autobattle (completely needed to battle) can only be used if the advisor thinks it's unloseable,  but that's too conservative sometimes."
